Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `update` function in `publify_core/app/controllers/admin/content_controller.rb` using the `id` parameter from the `params[:article]` hash, when it should use the `id` from the outer params hash. This allows a malicious user to attempt to update an article they do not own by including the `id` of a different, target article in the nested `params[:article]` hash
*   **Weaknesses:** The code incorrectly prioritizes the article id passed within the nested `params[:article]` hash over the main `params[:id]` parameter.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially modify content of an article they do not own, because of the flawed logic in how the article to update is identified.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a `PUT` request to the update action with a modified `params[:article][:id]` can redirect the update to the wrong article.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the `admin/content#update` endpoint.

**Technical Details:**

*   The commit `c0aba87844d1e47da50c0d99a3465164a4d244ce` addresses this issue.
*   The vulnerability was present in the `update` function of the `content_controller.rb` file, located in `publify_core/app/controllers/admin/`
*   The vulnerable code was:
    ```ruby
    id = params[:article][:id] || params[:id]
    @article = Article.find(id)
    ```
    This code snippet would first try to get the id from `params[:article][:id]` and if it was not present or nil, use the id from `params[:id]`
*   The fix removes the first part of the assignment, so it uses only the main id parameter to find the article to update

**Additional Notes**

*   The commit also includes a test case to ensure the vulnerability is fixed in `publify_core/spec/controllers/admin/content_controller_spec.rb`. The test case validates that the `id` parameter passed in the nested `article` parameter is ignored and that the article is updated with the correct values.
* The github content also shows the change made to the code and its corresponding test
