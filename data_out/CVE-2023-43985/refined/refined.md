Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-43985:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper neutralization of SQL parameters within the `StBlogSearchClass::prepareSearch` method of the "Blog Search" (stblogsearch) module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the module directly incorporates unsanitized user-supplied input into SQL queries, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization of user inputs when building SQL queries. The vulnerable code constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating user-provided search terms with SQL keywords using `LIKE` clauses without proper escaping or parameterization via `pSQL()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- **Gaining Admin Access:** Attackers can potentially inject SQL queries to manipulate user data, possibly gaining administrative privileges.
- **Data Removal:** Malicious SQL queries can be used to delete or modify critical data within the PrestaShop database.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data from the database can be extracted and exposed, including tokens and admin AJAX scripts.
- **Email Hijacking:** Attackers can potentially modify SMTP settings to intercept and control email communications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network (Remote):** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via HTTP requests.
- **PrestaShop Front Controller:** The attack vector is through a PrestaShop front controller.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** An unauthenticated (guest) attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Basic HTTP Request Knowledge:** Attackers need to be able to craft HTTP requests to send malicious SQL payloads to the vulnerable controller.
- **Module Controller Concealment:** The module's controller path can be concealed during exploitation, making it difficult to detect from standard front-end logs.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided patch shows the use of `pSQL()` function to sanitize the `$search` variable before it's used in the SQL query within the `LIKE` clause. This resolves the SQL injection vulnerability.
- The advisory notes the importance of using `pSQL` to mitigate other risks, such as stored XSS.
- The advisory also recommends upgrading PrestaShop itself to disable multiquery executions (semicolons).
- The advisory highlights that the author of the module doesn't follow semver standards.

The advisory also recommends enabling OWASP rules on a Web Application Firewall, but notes that this will likely require fine-tuning and bypasses to not interfere with backend functionality.

**In summary, CVE-2023-43985 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability in the SunnyToo "Blog Search" module for PrestaShop due to a lack of input sanitization, which can allow unauthenticated attackers to potentially take full control of a vulnerable PrestaShop installation.**
