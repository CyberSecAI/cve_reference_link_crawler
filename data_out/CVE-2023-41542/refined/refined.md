- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application attempts to prevent SQL injection by using a blacklist of keywords. However, this blacklist can be bypassed using alternative SQL syntax, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability in the `/jeecg-boot/jmreport/qurestSql` endpoint. The application uses a flawed blacklist approach for filtering potentially malicious SQL queries, which is insufficient.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive data such as database names, usernames, passwords, salts.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the `/jeecg-boot/jmreport/qurestSql` endpoint by sending a crafted JSON payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. The provided script seems to indicate that authentication is not required, although this should be verified.
