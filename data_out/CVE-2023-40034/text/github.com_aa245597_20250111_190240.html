## Package

gomod

github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>= 1.0.0; < 1.0.2

## Patched versions

1.0.2

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can post malformed webhook data which leads to an update of the repository data that can e.g. allow the takeover of a repository.

This is only critical if the CI is configured for public usage and connected to a forge witch is also in public usage.

### Patches

Please use either next or the latest v1.0 e.g. v1.0.2

### Workarounds

Secure the CI system by making it inaccessible to untrusted entities, for example, by placing it behind a firewall.

### References

Fix: [#2221](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/2221)

Backport: [#2222](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/2222)

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-40034

### Weaknesses

[CWE-20](/advisories?query=cwe%3A20)
