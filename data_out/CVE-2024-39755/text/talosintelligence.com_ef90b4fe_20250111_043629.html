# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2024-2060

## Veertu Anka Build node agent update privilege escalation vulnerability

##### October 3, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2024-39755

##### SUMMARY

A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the node update functionality of Veertu Anka Build 1.42.0. A specially crafted PKG file can lead to execute priviledged operation. An attacker can make an unauthenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Veertu Anka Build 1.42.0

##### PRODUCT URLS

Anka Build - <https://veertu.com/download-anka-build/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-282 - Improper Ownership Management

##### DETAILS

Anka Build is a suite of software tools designed for macOS virtualization, specifically for testing macOS or iOS applications in CI/CD environments. The suite comprises three main components: Controller, Registry, and Nodes. Anka Build Controller is centralized dashboard for managing nodes, VM instances, templates, tags, and logs. Anka Build Registry serves as the central repository for macOS VM templates and tags, facilitating easy access and version control. Anka Build Nodes are macOS hosts that run on-demand VM instances.

A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Anka Build when a Node joins the Controller or an already joined Node is updated. When a Node is added to the Controller, an Agent package is installed on the Node. A Node can join the Controller by executing the following `ankacluster` command on the Node system:

```
ankacluster join <http://controller-address>

```

When the above command is executed, an `ankaAgent.pkg` file is downloaded to the `/tmp` directory, and subsequently, the PKG file is installed.

Once a Node joins the Controller, the agent on the Node can be updated by sending a PUT request to the controller URI `/api/v1/node/update`. This also triggers the download of `ankaAgent.pkg` to the `/tmp` directory, followed by the installation of the PKG file.

A low-privilege user has the default write permissions to the `/tmp` directory. To exploit this vulnerability, a low-privilege user can create a file named `ankaAgent.pkg` in the `/tmp` directory. When a Node join or Node update action is triggered, the file `ankaAgent.pkg` will be overwritten with the actual Anka agent PKG file. There is a window of opportunity between the file being downloaded and the file being run for installation. During this window, the low-privilege user can replace the `ankaAgent.pkg` file with a malicious PKG file. When the installation process runs, it will install the malicious PKG on the system.

When an update node request is sent to the controller, the controller creates a PKG install task, invoking the `veertu.com/veertu/ankaCloud/agent/listener.(*AgentListener).DownloadAndInstallPKG` method of the `anka_agent` LaunchDaemon to update the Anka agent. The decompiled code of `veertu.com/veertu/ankaCloud/agent/listener.(*AgentListener).DownloadAndInstallPKG` is as follows:

```
   pkg_path.ptr = (char *)&tmp_anka_agent_pkg_path;  //  <------- (1)
    pkg_path.len = 18LL;
    v26 = veertu_com_veertu_ankaCloud_agent_listener__ptr_AgentListener_downloadFile(
            v47,
            v50,
            pkg_path,
            ControllerClient);  //  <------- (2)
    data = v26.data;
    tab = v26.tab;

    [...]
       v28 = veertu_com_veertu_ankaCloud_agent_listener__ptr_AgentListener_installPKG(v47, v51); //  <------- (3)
      if ( v28.tab )

```

At `(1)` the path `/tmp/AnkaAgent.pkg` is assigned to the variable `pkg_path`. At `(2)`, `veertu.com/veertu/ankaCloud/agent/listener.(*AgentListener).downloadFile` is called to download the PKG file to `/tmp/AnkaAgent.pkg`. The `veertu.com/veertu/ankaCloud/agent/listener.(*AgentListener).installPKG` is invoked at `(3)`. The decompiled code of `veertu.com/veertu/ankaCloud/agent/listener.(*AgentListener).installPKG` is as follows:

```
   v41 = &unk_1006B0EAB;
v42[0] = 4LL;
v42[1] = (__int64)v44;
v42[2] = v46;
v42[3] = (__int64)&unk_1006B3781;
v42[4] = 7LL;
v42[5] = (__int64)&syscall__stmp_42;
v42[6] = 1LL;
v38 = (_ptr_exec_Cmd)os_exec_Command(&unk_1006B6153, 9LL, &v41, 4LL);// <------------------- (4)
v15 = (syscall_SysProcAttr *)runtime_newobject(&type_cLmOVQFt);
v15->Setpgid = 1;

```

The `installPKG` method executes the `installer` command at `(4)`, which installs the PKG file.

By exploiting this vulnerability, a low-privilege user can potentially escalate their privileges to that of a root user.

Fixed in 1.43.0 of the Anka Build Cloud.
