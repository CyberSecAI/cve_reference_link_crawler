The provided content relates to a fix for a potential issue in the AMDGPU display driver within the Linux kernel, specifically when virtual displays are used with the vkms (Virtual Kernel Mode Setting) framework. This issue is not a security vulnerability, but a bug that triggers a warning message due to incorrect assumptions about framebuffer modifiers.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of the issue:**

*   The AMDGPU display driver, for GFX9 and newer hardware, requires a check of tiling flags when initializing a framebuffer if format modifiers are not allowed.
*   The vkms framework, which uses a common amdgpu framebuffer creation, doesn't support framebuffer modifiers.
*   The driver was incorrectly applying the tiling flag check even when a virtual display was enabled through vkms, triggering a warning.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The provided content does not describe any security vulnerability
*   Incorrect conditional check in the `amdgpu_display_framebuffer_init` function.
*   This conditional check leads to triggering a warning when it is not necessary.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   No security impact, the fix prevents the warning from occurring

**Attack vectors:**
*   Not applicable - this is not a security vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Not applicable - this is not a security vulnerability.

**Technical Details**

*   The fix introduces a check for `adev->enable_virtual_display` within the condition that determines if the tiling flag check should be performed.
*   The change modifies the following line:

    ```c
    - if (!dev->mode_config.allow_fb_modifiers) {
    + if (!dev->mode_config.allow_fb_modifiers && !adev->enable_virtual_display) {
    ```
*   This change makes the check occur only when virtual displays are *not* enabled and when framebuffer modifiers are not allowed, thus fixing the warning messages generated when a virtual display with vkms is used.
*   The fix applies to the `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_display.c` file.
*   The warning message that is avoided by the fix is `GFX9+ requires FB check based on format modifier`.
