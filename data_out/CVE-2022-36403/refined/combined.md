# Device Software Manager

Key Features
## Automatically Finds Supported Devices on the network

Device Software Manager searches the same network segment as your PC and displays a list of supported multifunction products and printers. When a device is selected from the list, its IP address and other network information is acquired for driver setup. Even if a device is not on the same network segment, you can also search by IP address or device number.

## Automatically Confirms OS version

Device Software Manager automatically identifies your PC Windows OS version.

## Installs the Latest Driver

Device Software Manager downloads the latest supported Driver from the Ricoh download server and installs it.
