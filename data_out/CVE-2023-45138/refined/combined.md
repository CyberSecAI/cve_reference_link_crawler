# XSS and remote code execution through change request title

Critical

[surli](/surli)
published
GHSA-f776-w9v2-7vfj
Oct 12, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.contrib.changerequest:application-changerequest-ui
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 0.11

## Patched versions

1.9.2

## Description

### Impact

It's possible for a user without any specific right to perform script injection and remote code execution just by inserting an appropriate title when creating a new Change Request.

This vulnerability is particularly critical as Change Request aims at being created by user without any particular rights.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been fixed in Change Request 1.9.2.

### Workarounds

It's possible to workaround the issue without upgrading by editing the document `ChangeRequest.Code.ChangeRequestSheet` and by performing the same change as in the commit: [7565e72](https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-changerequest/commit/7565e720117f73102f5a276239eabfe85e15cff4).

### References

* JIRA ticket: <https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/CRAPP-298>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CVE ID
