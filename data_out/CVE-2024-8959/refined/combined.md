WP Adminify is currently part of my development toolbox, as it’s super quick to change the WordPress interface and best of all, it doesn’t affect the site’s performance at all.

This is a very comprehensive WordPress UI app that provides a host of management tools to make the Admin screens neater. Plenty of option to micro manage the screens. Includes full White Box if needed.
