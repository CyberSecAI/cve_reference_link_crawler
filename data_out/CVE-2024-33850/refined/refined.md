- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incomplete access control checks for participants in the waiting room of a locked conference.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient access control allows waiting room participants to obtain the conference roster list and perform actions on the conference according to their role after being admitted.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exposure of conference information and potential unauthorized actions on the conference.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker who is placed in the waiting room of a locked conference can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a participant attempting to join a locked conference and placed in the waiting room.
