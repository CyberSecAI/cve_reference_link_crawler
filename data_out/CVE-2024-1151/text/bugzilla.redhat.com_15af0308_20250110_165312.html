| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2262241#c0)  Rohit Keshri    2024-02-01 11:28:13 UTC  ``` A flaw in the Linux Kernel found in the Open vSwitch Kernel module.  The Netlink copy code in the ovs kernel module attempts to make an in-kernel copy of the actions required. That means that when recursive operations, like sample(), clone(), dec_ttl(), etc include additional actions, the code pushes a new stack frame and recursively calls into the code block.  Unfortunately, OVS module doesn't validate the stack depth, and will push too many frames causing a stack overflow which can lead to crash.
