      "Integer Overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds read"

    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the MySQL port and must be able to send a crafted authentication packet."
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "technical_details": "The vulnerability occurs in the `net_field_length_ll()` function, called by `get_56_lenc_string()`. If the password length field in the authentication packet is set to 0xFE or 0xFF (254 or 255), the packet pointer is incremented by 9 bytes, potentially moving it outside of the packet buffer if the data following is less than 9 bytes. This causes an integer overflow when calculating available bytes for the password leading to an out-of-bounds memory access, crashing the server."
