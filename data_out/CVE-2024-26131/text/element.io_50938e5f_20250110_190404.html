# Security release: Element Android 1.6.12

February 20, 2024[Security](https://element.io/blog/tag/security/)

Hello,

Today we have released a security update of Element Android to address a pair of vulnerabilities. Please upgrade to the new version (1.6.12) at your earliest convenience.

The two vulnerabilities are as follows:

* Sensitive file disclosure via share activity (*Medium*, [CVE-2024-26132](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26132), [GHSA-8wj9-cx7h-pvm4](https://github.com/element-hq/element-android/security/advisories/GHSA-8wj9-cx7h-pvm4))
* Intent redirection (*High*, [CVE-2024-26131](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26131), [GHSA-j6pr-fpc8-q9vm](https://github.com/element-hq/element-android/security/advisories/GHSA-j6pr-fpc8-q9vm))

Both vulnerabilities require a malicious third-party application to be installed on the phone, alongside a vulnerable Element Android, in order to be exploited.

The new version is available on the Play Store, but we have also worked with the F-Droid package repository and SchildiChat Android (a fork of Element Android) to help ensure they have timely releases as well.

Finally, we thank Pietro `suidpit` Tirenna, Davide `TheZero` Silvetti and Abdel Adim `smaury` Oisfi of [Shielder](https://www.shielder.com/) for finding and responsibly disclosing these issues to us, helping make Element and Matrix safer for everyone.
