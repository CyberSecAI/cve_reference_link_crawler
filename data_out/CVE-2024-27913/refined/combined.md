### @odd22 **[odd22](/odd22)** commented [Feb 26, 2024](#issue-2153723999)

Iggy Frankovic discovered an ospfd crash when perfomring fuzzing of OSPF LSA packets. The crash occurs in ospf\_te\_parse\_te() function when attemping to create corresponding egde from TE Link parameters. If there is no local address, an edge is created but without any attributes. During parsing, the function try to access to this attribute fields which has not been created causing an ospfd crash.

The patch simply check if the te parser has found a valid local address. If not found, we stop the parser which avoid the crash.

Sorry, something went wrong.

can we validate the "edge" instead of the above added check?

No. In fact, the edge structure is correctly created. But, the unique identifier of the edge in the TED is based on the local address. Thus, if the local address is IPV4\_NET0 (i.e. 0.0.0.0) we cannot correctly reference the edge in the TED. However, local ID is also a valid identifier. So, I need to check that both local address and local ID have not been found during TE parsing. I'll update the PR accordingly.
