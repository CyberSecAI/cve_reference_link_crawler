- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Car Dealer plugin has an AJAX action that lacks proper authorization and CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Incorrect Authorization:** The AJAX action `cardealer_install_plugin` can be called by any authenticated user, including subscribers, who should not have the capability to install plugins.
    - **Missing CSRF Protection:** The AJAX action does not have CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to potentially trick a user into making the request.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A low-privileged user (subscriber) can install and activate arbitrary plugins from wordpress.org. This allows an attacker to potentially achieve full site control by installing a malicious plugin.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
    - The attacker needs to be logged in to the WordPress site with at least subscriber level privileges.
    - The attacker can execute the request using the browser's developer console (as provided in the PoC) or crafting a malicious request using other methods.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have an account on the target WordPress site with at least subscriber privileges.
    - The attacker can execute the attack by accessing the website.
