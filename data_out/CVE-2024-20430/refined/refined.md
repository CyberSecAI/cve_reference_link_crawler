- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect handling of directory search paths at runtime by the Cisco Meraki Systems Manager (SM) Agent for Windows.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is caused by a DLL hijacking issue, where the software loads DLL files from a location that a low-privileged attacker can control. Specifically, the incorrect handling of directory search paths allows for malicious DLLs to be loaded instead of legitimate ones. This is classified as CWE-427 (Uncontrolled Search Path Element).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. This would allow full control of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is local and requires the attacker to place both malicious configuration and DLL files onto the affected system. These files are then read and executed by the Cisco Meraki SM Agent when it launches on startup.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access with low privileges to the target system. They must also be able to write files to the file system in order to place the malicious configuration and DLL files. User interaction is required as the application executes on startup
