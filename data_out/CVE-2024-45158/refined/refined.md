Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45158:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The functions `mbedtls_ecdsa_der_to_raw()` and `mbedtls_ecdsa_raw_to_der()` in Mbed TLS 3.6.0 do not properly validate the `bits` argument. If this argument is larger than the bit-length of the largest supported curve, the functions can overflow a stack buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Stack buffer overflow:** The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow. Input data exceeding the buffer's capacity overwrites adjacent memory on the stack.
- **Insufficient input validation:** The `bits` parameter isn't adequately validated against the maximum size of supported curves.
- **Conditional vulnerability:** When `MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_C` is disabled, and in certain configurations, a 0-size buffer is used internally which would cause an overflow for all inputs.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker controlling the `bits` parameter could cause a stack buffer overflow with attacker-chosen content, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service:** A stack buffer overflow can cause a program to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Attacker-controlled input:** The attack vector is through calling `mbedtls_ecdsa_der_to_raw()` or `mbedtls_ecdsa_raw_to_der()` with an attacker-controlled `bits` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Control over input:** The attacker needs to control the value of the `bits` argument passed to the vulnerable functions, and the input buffer that will be copied onto the stack.
- **Application interaction:** The attacker must be able to interact with an application using Mbed TLS and trigger the execution of the vulnerable functions with malicious input.

**Additional notes**
- The vulnerability is present in Mbed TLS 3.6.0.
- The advisory notes that all calls to these functions within Mbed TLS are safe, but external calls are vulnerable if not used correctly.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in Mbed TLS 3.6.1.
- A workaround is mentioned: ensure `bits` parameter corresponds to a supported curve when MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_C is enabled.
