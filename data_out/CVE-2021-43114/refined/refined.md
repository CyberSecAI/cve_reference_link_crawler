{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper handling of certificate data and lack of proper validation within the FORT RPKI validator, specifically related to the processing of certificates during RPKI validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper certificate handling",
      "Lack of input validation",
      "Memory management issues leading to potential crashes"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, where the validator crashes, or potentially path traversal. The BGPsec certificate validation component was also crashing and needed to be disabled for version 1.5.2",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted RPKI data containing malicious or malformed certificates"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "An attacker would need the ability to insert malicious certificates into the RPKI data stream being processed by the FORT validator."
    ],
   "additional_details": "The issue was addressed by fixing situational crash due to bad code cleanup, performance optimizations, and removing BGPsec certificate code"
  }
}
