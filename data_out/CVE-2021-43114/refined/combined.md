|  |  | When routers first connect to Fort, they request a snapshot of the validation results. (ROAs and Router Keys.) Because they need to keep their validated objects updated, and snapshots tend to be relatively large amounts of information, they request deltas afterwards over configurable intervals. ("Deltas" being the differences between snapshots.) |
|  |  | .P |
|  |  | During each validation cycle, Fort generates a new snapshot, as well as the deltas needed to build the new snapshot from the previous one. These are all stored in RAM. \fI--server.deltas.lifetime\fR is the number of iterations a set of deltas will be kept before being deallocated. (Recall that every iteration lasts \fI--server.interval.validation\fR seconds, plus however long the validation takes.) |

|  |  | If a router lags behind, to the point Fort has already deleted the deltas it needs to update the router’s snapshot, Fort will have to fall back to fetch the entire latest snapshot instead. |

RRDP Notification: Optimize delta parse

```
It was allocating the deltas array twice, for seemingly no reason.
Also, the array slots were pointers, and the two arrays pointed to
different instances of the same objects. For seemingly no reason.

Now there's only one array, and it stores the objects directly.

Also adds relevant unit tests.

Certificates: Fuse meta and level stacks

```
These stacks always had the same size, and their corresponding elements
always referred to the same certificate.

This was pending work from [#55](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/issues/55), which I think is now properly solved.

Also refactors x509stack_push(); was messy. Patched an unlikely memory
leak in the chaos.

Improvements since 1.5.1:

1. [#51](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/issues/51): Fix crash when `--server.address` is not defined in the configuration.
2. [673c679](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/commit/673c679b6bf3f4187cd5242c31a795bf8a6c22b3): Change `autogen.sh`'s interpreter to `/bin/sh`. (Allows straightforward compilation on default \*BSDs.)
3. [#53](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/issues/53): Add RPM packages to the release.
4. [#55](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/issues/55): Fix situational crash due to bad code cleanup.
5. [eb68ebb](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/commit/eb68ebbaab50f3365aa51bbaa17cb862bf4607fa), [274dc14](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/commit/274dc14aed1eb9b3350029d1063578a6b9c77b54): Performance optimizations.
6. [#57](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/issues/57): Fix practically inevitable crash in server mode's second iteration.
7. [#58](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/issues/58): Remove BGPsec certificate code. (Was crashing easily; needs more testing.)

Please note that version numbers no longer include "v".

(ie. "1.5.2", not "v1.5.2".)

I did this to streamline RPM package generation.

You might need to adjust scripts.
