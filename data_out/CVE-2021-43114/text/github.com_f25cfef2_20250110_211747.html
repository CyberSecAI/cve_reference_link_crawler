Improvements since 1.5.1:

1. [#51](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/issues/51): Fix crash when `--server.address` is not defined in the configuration.
2. [673c679](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/commit/673c679b6bf3f4187cd5242c31a795bf8a6c22b3): Change `autogen.sh`'s interpreter to `/bin/sh`. (Allows straightforward compilation on default \*BSDs.)
3. [#53](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/issues/53): Add RPM packages to the release.
4. [#55](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/issues/55): Fix situational crash due to bad code cleanup.
5. [eb68ebb](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/commit/eb68ebbaab50f3365aa51bbaa17cb862bf4607fa), [274dc14](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/commit/274dc14aed1eb9b3350029d1063578a6b9c77b54): Performance optimizations.
6. [#57](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/issues/57): Fix practically inevitable crash in server mode's second iteration.
7. [#58](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/issues/58): Remove BGPsec certificate code. (Was crashing easily; needs more testing.)

Please note that version numbers no longer include "v".

(ie. "1.5.2", not "v1.5.2".)

I did this to streamline RPM package generation.

You might need to adjust scripts.
