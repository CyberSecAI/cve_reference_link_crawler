# Setting a correct `integrity` attribute to injected code allows to bypass the allow-lists

High

published

Mar 31, 2024

## Package

npm

@kindspells/astro-shield
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

1.2.0,1.3.0,1.3.1

## Patched versions

>=1.3.2

## Description

### Impact

Versions from 1.2.0 to 1.3.1 of Astro-Shield allow to bypass the allow-lists for cross-origin resources by introducing valid `integrity` attributes to the injected code. This implies that the injected SRI hash would be added to the generated CSP header, which would lead the browser to believe that the injected resource is legit.

To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to first inject code into the rendered pages by exploiting other not-related potential vulnerabilities.

### Patches

Version [1.3.2](https://github.com/kindspells/astro-shield/releases/tag/1.3.2) provides a patch.

### Workarounds

* To not use the middleware functionality of Astro-Shield.
* To use the middleware functionality of Astro-Shield ONLY for content that cannot be controlled in any way by external users.

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
