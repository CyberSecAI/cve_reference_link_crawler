- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `addTranslations()` function in `gettext.js` is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution due to improper user input sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of sanitization of user-provided input when used with the `addTranslations()` function. This allows an attacker to inject properties into the prototype of JavaScript objects by manipulating the `__proto__` attribute.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial of service (DoS) by altering the state of generic functions like `toString` or `valueOf`.
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE) in scenarios where the application evaluates specific object attributes and executes them with functions like `eval()`.
    - Property Injection, where the attacker can pollute properties the codebase relies on for informative values, like security-related attributes (e.g., admin status).
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by manipulating the input provided to the `addTranslations()` function, specifically injecting a `__proto__` property.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to control the input to the vulnerable `addTranslations()` function which can be done remotely. No specific privileges or user interaction is required.
