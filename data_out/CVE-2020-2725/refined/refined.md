 CVE-2020-2725:

Root cause of vulnerability: The provided documents do not specify the exact root cause of this vulnerability. However, they mention that multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in VirtualBox.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The documents do not specify the exact weaknesses. However, they mention that there are multiple vulnerabilities discovered in VirtualBox.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker could take control of VirtualBox resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process, a Denial of Service condition, or other unspecified impacts.

Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited both locally and remotely, as mentioned in the Gentoo advisory GLSA 202004-02. The Oracle advisory also mentions that some of these vulnerabilities can be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.
