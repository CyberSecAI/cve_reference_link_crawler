The provided content is related to CVE-2024-4970.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "Widget Bundle" fails to properly sanitize and escape settings, specifically within the "Text Form" widget.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization and output escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker, with high privileges (such as an admin), can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be stored within the website's database.
- This malicious code will then be executed in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Redirection to malicious sites.
    - Other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is performed through the "Text Form" widget settings, particularly the title field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have high privileges (Admin or similar) to access the plugin's settings and add widgets.
- The attacker must be able to modify the "Text Form" widget settings.

The content also notes that this vulnerability is exploitable even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup). This implies that the vulnerability bypasses some of the usual WordPress security mechanisms for handling HTML content.
