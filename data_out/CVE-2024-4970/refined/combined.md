## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Widget Bundle <= 2.0.0 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Enable the "Text Form" widget
2. Add the widget and set the title to `" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//`
3. Save and see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
