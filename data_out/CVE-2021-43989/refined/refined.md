The provided content is related to CVE-2021-43989.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected mySCADA myPRO product stores passwords using the MD5 hashing algorithm.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of password hash with insufficient computational effort. The use of MD5 makes it easier for attackers to crack password hashes.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who has obtained the password hashes can crack them, potentially gaining access to user accounts. The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5, with high confidentiality impact.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, with low attack complexity.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. They need to be able to access the system over the network and obtain the password hashes.
