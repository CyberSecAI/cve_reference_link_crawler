The provided content is related to CVE-2021-43989.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The myPRO HMI/SCADA system stores passwords using the MD5 hashing algorithm.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort (CWE-916). MD5 is considered cryptographically weak and susceptible to collision attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can crack password hashes that have been obtained, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable (network-based).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to obtain the password hashes, but does not need any prior privileges or user interaction.
