The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository related to the Nuntium project. It appears to address a security issue related to GeoPoll API authentication and adds logging for unknown parameters. The commit also includes changes to the user interface to display GeoPoll channel information.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant security-related changes:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

-   The original implementation used a potentially vulnerable method to compare the received signature with the calculated signature, which could be susceptible to timing attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Timing Attack Vulnerability:** The original code used a simple string comparison (`signature != params[:Signature]`) which could potentially leak information about the correct signature via timing analysis. This is because string comparisons can terminate early if the strings don't match at the first character, revealing information about the signature gradually.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   An attacker could potentially bypass the signature verification by timing the string comparison, thus allowing them to send malicious data to the GeoPoll endpoint.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The attack vector is through the `incoming` endpoint of the Geopoll API. An attacker would need to send specially crafted HTTP requests with an invalid signature, and through timing analysis gain information to guess the valid signature and then send malicious requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker would need to have knowledge of the target's endpoint URL, the format of the GeoPoll signature calculation, and be able to send HTTP requests to the GeoPoll API endpoint.
-   The attacker would have to be able to perform precise timing analysis of the server's response time to gain knowledge of the signature.

**Mitigation:**

-   The vulnerability is mitigated by the code change which replaces the insecure string comparison with `ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.secure_compare`. This method performs a constant time comparison which prevents timing attacks.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The commit also logs unknown parameters in both the incoming and status endpoints, which is useful for debugging API changes from the external API provider.
-   The commit introduces UI changes to display the GeoPoll channel's incoming messages URL and delivery reports receiver URL, which helps users understand their configuration.
