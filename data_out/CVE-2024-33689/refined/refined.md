- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Radio Station plugin (<= 2.5.7) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The plugin lacks sufficient CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute unwanted actions, potentially compromising the website. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through forged HTTP requests sent by a malicious actor to a vulnerable website when a logged-in user visits a malicious webpage or clicks a malicious link, causing the user's browser to unwittingly perform actions on the targeted website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious site, which will execute the forged request on the vulnerable plugin. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the targeted website.
