- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect file permissions, including on docker files, within Brocade SANnav versions prior to v2.3.0a.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate access controls on sensitive files, potentially exposing them to unauthorized users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with local access to the server can read sensitive information contained in the affected files.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the server is required for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have gained unprivileged access to the server where Brocade SANnav is installed.
