# Stored XSS in admin system configs

Moderate

[Flyingmana](/Flyingmana)
published
GHSA-5vrp-638w-p8m2
Jul 28, 2024

## Package

composer

openmage/magento-lts
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

< 20.10.1

## Patched versions

20.10.1

## Description

### Impact

This XSS vulnerability is about the system configs

* design/header/welcome
* design/header/logo\_src
* design/header/logo\_src\_small
* design/header/logo\_alt

They are intended to enable admins to set a text in the two cases, and to define an image url for the other two cases.

But because of previously missing escaping allowed to input arbitrary html and as a consequence also arbitrary JavaScript.

While this is in most usage scenarios not a relevant issue, some people work with more restrictive roles in the backend. Here the ability to inject JavaScript with these settings would be an unintended and unwanted privilege.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

The problem is/will be patched with Version 20.10.1 or higher.

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

Possible mitigations are

* Restricting access to the System Configs
* checking templates where these settings are used to apply proper html filtering

### For Users relying on this possibility

Some Users might actually rely on the ability to use html there.

You can restore the previous behavior by making use of the new introduced `->getUnescapedValue()` method on this escaped elements. Developers should have a look at the newly introduced `Mage_Core_Model_Security_HtmlEscapedString`

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-41676

Why not `$this->escapeHtml()` at all?

It would also be possibe to add a flag to `Mage::getStoreConfig($path, $storeId = null, $secureFlag = null)` to escape that values.

no need for this modularity here. Just because we can do it, doesnt mean we have to.

> Why not `$this->escapeHtml()` at all?

to expose a way to still get the unescaped values in templates, for Stores which might actually rely on some of the special characters.

Mhh, store the config-value in a variable an escape it - or not - as you need. (to not call it twice)

The unescape value isnt used - it least not in core.

But now I have to rewrite the full block instead. Not sure if thats worth. I remember another PR where a `new Mage_XXX_Model_XXX` was changed explicity to `Mage::getModel` - just to allowe rewrites.

But if its not worth of having, I'm fine with it. It just itched me :D

In which situation you would want to rewrite an escaping method?

And with `cweagans/composer-patches` its also a lot easier nowdays to patch any core file of any lib.

Anyway, if anyone sees the need to change it, they can provide a PR
