{
  "CVE-2024-41110": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Docker daemon incorrectly handles API requests with a Content-Length of 0 or when using chunked transfer encoding. It forwards these requests to authorization plugins without the body, potentially leading to incorrect authorization decisions.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "AuthZ bypass, Privilege escalation",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass authorization plugins, leading to unauthorized actions including privilege escalation, disclosure of information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
       "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted API request with a Content-Length set to 0, or using chunked transfer encoding, sent to the Docker daemon.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have the ability to make API requests to the Docker daemon and  local access to the host machine unless the Docker daemon is insecurely exposed over TCP."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A regression in Docker Engine where a fix for bypassing AuthZ plugins was not carried forward to later versions.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "AuthZ bypass, privilege escalation",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could send an API request with Content-Length set to 0, causing the Docker daemon to forward the request without the body to the AuthZ plugin, which might approve the request incorrectly.",
      "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted API request with `Content-Length: 0`",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to send API requests to the Docker daemon."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by how Docker Engine handles requests with Content-Length set to 0 or chunked transfer encoding, leading to the request being forwarded to the AuthZ plugin without a body.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authorization bypass due to incorrect handling of requests with no body.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially bypass authorization checks, leading to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation.",
       "Attack vectors": "Sending an HTTP request with Content-Length set to 0 or using chunked transfer encoding.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make API requests to the Docker daemon."
    },
     {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A flaw in how Docker Engine handles requests, causing it to forward requests without a body to authorization plugins under certain conditions.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "AuthZ bypass.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could bypass authorization checks, potentially leading to privilege escalation and unauthorized actions.",
      "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted API request with a zero-length content or chunked transfer encoding, bypassing the AuthZ plugin.",
