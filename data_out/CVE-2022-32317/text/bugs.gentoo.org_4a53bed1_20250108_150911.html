| [Description](#c0)  Jocelyn Mayer    2022-12-23 12:41:08 UTC  ``` In the current ebuild, not all CPU flags checked by the mplayer build system are set from the CPU_FLAGS_X86. The proposed patch is to add more cpu_flags_x86_xxx in IUSE and thus in myconf in order to get optimizations more consistent with the whole system configuration. The only drawback is that, for sse4_1 and sse4_2, there is no direct mapping between CPU_FLAGS_X86 and configure flags then those 2 cases have to be checked by specific directive.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Emerge mplayer 2. Check the build log  Actual Results:   avx avx2 fma3 fma4 sse3 sse4 sse42 and xop flags are not set by the ebuild but detected by the configure script.   Expected Results:   After adding more cpu_flags_x86 to IUSE and build configuration, the only CPU flag I saw in the build not set by the ebuild is cmov. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Jocelyn Mayer    2022-12-23 12:43:06 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 844799](attachment.cgi?id=844799 "Ebuild patch proposal for finer x86 CPU features tuning") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=844799&action=edit "Ebuild patch proposal for finer x86 CPU features tuning"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=844799&action=diff "Ebuild patch proposal for finer x86 CPU features tuning")] Ebuild patch proposal for finer x86 CPU features tuning ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Jocelyn Mayer    2022-12-23 12:43:44 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 844801](attachment.cgi?id=844801 "Output from emerge --info =media-video/mplayer-1.4-r1") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=844801&action=edit "Output from emerge --info =media-video/mplayer-1.4-r1")] Output from emerge --info =media-video/mplayer-1.4-r1 ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Jocelyn Mayer    2022-12-23 12:45:06 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 844803](attachment.cgi?id=844803 "Emerge build log with patch applied") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=844803&action=edit "Emerge build log with patch applied")] Emerge build log with patch applied  Note that the patch submitted for this issue: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/861140> has also been applied to get a successful merge ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Larry the Git Cow   gentoo-dev  2022-12-24 10:21:32 UTC  ``` The bug has been closed via the following commit(s):  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=8cdb49a98ff943afe53695735fb3eed4b77c3b28>  commit 8cdb49a98ff943afe53695735fb3eed4b77c3b28 Author:     Sam James <sam@gentoo.org> AuthorDate: 2022-12-24 10:16:46 +0000 Commit:     Sam James <sam@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2022-12-24 10:19:57 +0000      media-video/mplayer: add 1.5          Unclear if anything happened with security [bug #858107](show_bug.cgi?id=858107 "RESOLVED INVALID - media-video/mplayer: heap use after free?") though.
