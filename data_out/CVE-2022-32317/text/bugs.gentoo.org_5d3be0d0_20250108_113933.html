| [Description](#c0)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-07-15 02:49:14 UTC  ``` CVE-2022-32317 (<https://transfer.sh/m2WcuM/poc_dup.zip>):  The MPlayer Project v1.5 was discovered to contain a heap use-after-free resulting in a double free in the preinit function at libvo/vo_v4l2.c. This vulnerability can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted file.  The sole reference 404's for me. No idea if this is real, reported upstream, or patched at all. Not sure how MITRE handled this. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  BitFriends    2022-09-19 16:07:46 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 812869](attachment.cgi?id=812869 "poc") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=812869&action=edit "poc")] poc ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  BitFriends    2022-09-19 16:09:11 UTC  ``` Yes, it is real. MITRE didn't reply to my email with the updated link. Here is the poc. It is also on github repo b17fr13nds/MPlayer_cve_poc ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-09-19 16:11:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to BitFriends from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=858107#c2)) > Yes, it is real. MITRE didn't reply to my email with the updated link. Here > is the poc. It is also on github repo b17fr13nds/MPlayer_cve_poc  Have you reported it upstream? ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Larry the Git Cow   gentoo-dev  2022-12-24 10:21:35 UTC  ``` The bug has been referenced in the following commit(s):  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=8cdb49a98ff943afe53695735fb3eed4b77c3b28>  commit 8cdb49a98ff943afe53695735fb3eed4b77c3b28 Author:     Sam James <sam@gentoo.org> AuthorDate: 2022-12-24 10:16:46 +0000 Commit:     Sam James <sam@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2022-12-24 10:19:57 +0000      media-video/mplayer: add 1.5          Unclear if anything happened with security [bug #858107](show_bug.cgi?id=858107 "RESOLVED INVALID - media-video/mplayer: heap use after free?") though.

Reporter: please don't waste everyone's time by requesting CVEs without reporting upstream. ``` |  |
