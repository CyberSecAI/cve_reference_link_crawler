- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PSP files within GIMP. This insufficient validation leads to an integer overflow before writing to memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer Overflow: The primary vulnerability is an integer overflow, which occurs due to inadequate bounds checking when handling user-provided data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current GIMP process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious File: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious PSP file and enticing a user to open it with GIMP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- User Interaction: The attacker requires user interaction to trigger the vulnerability, meaning the target user needs to open the malicious PSP file using GIMP.
- No privilege is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to GIMP by the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
- GIMP has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-23-1593 (ZDI-CAN-22096).
