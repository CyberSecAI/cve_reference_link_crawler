- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, authenticated attacker can inject malicious code into specific pages of the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web-based management interface.
