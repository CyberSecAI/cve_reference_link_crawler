Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-2054:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper privilege management within the execution of stored procedures in Oracle Database. Specifically, when executing stored procedures, the database does not properly check the caller's privileges, allowing for privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Privilege Management:** The core issue is that the stored procedure execution does not enforce sufficient checks on the caller's privileges. This means that a user with limited privileges can potentially execute code within the stored procedure with elevated rights.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to escalate their privileges to resources that are normally protected from users with limited privileges. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of critical database components, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via Oracle Net.
*   **Stored Procedures:** The vulnerability is triggered during the execution of stored procedures in Oracle database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** An attacker must have valid database credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Database Access:** Attacker needs to be able to connect to the Oracle Database instance.
*   **Ability to Create Database Objects**: The attacker must be able to create database objects (procedure, view, trigger).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Oracle by Eddie Zhu of Beijing DBSEC Technology Co., Ltd and Emad Al-Mousa working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
*   Oracle has released a patch as part of the January 2021 Critical Patch Update to address this issue.
* The CVSS score is 8.8, reflecting a high severity vulnerability
* ZDI ID is ZDI-21-083.
* This vulnerability affects Oracle Database versions 12.2.0.1, 18c, and 19c.
