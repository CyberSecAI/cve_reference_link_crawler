{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the Autofill service's handling of URI permissions within RemoteViews. Specifically, the system does not properly verify if the current user has the necessary permissions to view the URI referenced in a FillResponse's RemoteViews before displaying it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient URI permission check",
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious Autofill provider could potentially expose content of another user by including a URI in a RemoteView, which the current user might not have the authorization to view.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious Autofill provider could craft a FillResponse with a RemoteView that contains a URI to private content, exploiting the insufficient permission checks within the Autofill service. The attacker would need to create a malicious Autofill service and be selected as the autofill provider.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious Autofill service that can be selected by the user. No other specific capabilities are mentioned."
  },
    "cve": "CVE-2023-40134",
    "additional_details": "The provided commit message and bug IDs (b/283264674 b/281666022 b/281665050 b/281848557 b/281533566 b/281534749 b/283101289) indicate multiple reports and examples of this type of vulnerability. The fix involves checking URI permissions and dropping RemoteViews for which the user does not have necessary permissions."
