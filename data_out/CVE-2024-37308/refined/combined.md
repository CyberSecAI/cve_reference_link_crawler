# WordPress Cooked Plugin <= 1.7.15.4 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Persistent Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability

Moderate

[XjSv](/XjSv)
published
GHSA-9vfv-c966-jwrv
Jun 13, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= 1.7.15.4

## Patched versions

1.8.0

## Description

### Description:

The Cooked plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via the ‘post\_title’ parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.7.15.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This vulnerability allows authenticated attackers with contributor-level access and above to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses a compromised page.

### Payload:

RE:<img src=x onerror=alert(origin);//

### Steps to reproduce:

[0] Install & activate the plugin.

[1] Add a recipe ‘/wp-admin/post-new.php?post\_type=cp\_recipe’.

[2] Use your payload in the RECIPE TITLE input field and fill in the VIDEO URL (Gallery tab > ‘\_recipe\_settings[gallery][video\_url]’) input field as well.

[3] Publish the recipe.

[4] Injected payload will trigger on the newly created recipe page.

### Impact:

Malicious files upload, creating an account with administrator-level access, ability to completely compromise the targeted website.

### PoC request:

```
POST /wp-admin/post.php HTTP/2
Host: target.tld
Cookie: [contributor_cookies]
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
