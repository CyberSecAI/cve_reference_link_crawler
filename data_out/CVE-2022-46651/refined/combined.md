### @potiuk **[potiuk](/potiuk)** commented [Jul 2, 2023](#issue-1784362932)

The fields that are sensitive (i.e password field is used to show them in Connection edit view) should also be hidden when they are stored as "extra" in the form extra field.

This PR handles both - replacing such values with a placeholder as well as not updating the value if the placeholder has not been modified.
