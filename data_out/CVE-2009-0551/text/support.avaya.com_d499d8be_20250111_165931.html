HTTP protocol. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2008-2540](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2540),

Certain Avaya products utilize Microsoft Operating Systems and may be
affected by this vulnerability.

## 2. Avaya System Products:

Avaya system products include an
Operating System with the product when it is delivered. The system
products described below are delivered with a Microsoft Operating
System. Actions to be taken with these products are also described
below.

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Messaging Application Server | All | Low | Avaya recommends that customers install the security update as provided via Microsoft Windows Update. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya strongly recommends that
customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose
operating systems. Occasionally
vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or applications that come with the operating system.
These vulnerabilities often do not impact the
software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of
the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are
not affected by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Microsoft
Windows
platform may be. For affected Microsoft Operating Systems,
Microsoft recommends installing patches. Detailed instructions for
patching the Operating System are given by Microsoft at the following
