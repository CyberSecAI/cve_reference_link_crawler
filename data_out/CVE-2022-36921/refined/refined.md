Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36921:

**CVE-2022-36921**

*   **Root Cause:** The Coverity Plugin does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Missing permission check, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with Overall/Read permissions can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs, leading to the capture of credentials stored in Jenkins. The CSRF vulnerability also allows an attacker to trigger this action without the user's knowledge or consent.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker needs Overall/Read permission to access the vulnerable endpoint.
    *   The attacker also needs to know the credentials IDs which are obtained by exploiting another vulnerability (CVE-2022-36919) in the Coverity plugin
    *   The CSRF vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permissions in Jenkins.
    *   The attacker needs to know the credentials IDs to be used for the connection (obtained through another method or vulnerability)

**Summary**

CVE-2022-36921 is a vulnerability in the Coverity plugin that allows an attacker with Overall/Read permissions to capture stored credentials. This is achieved by exploiting a missing permission check, which allows connecting to an attacker controlled URL.  The vulnerability is compounded by a CSRF vulnerability which does not require POST requests. It is part of a pair of vulnerabilities (along with CVE-2022-36920) in the Coverity plugin that allows complete capture of credentials.
