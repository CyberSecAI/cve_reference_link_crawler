The provided content is related to CVE-2024-42225.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `skb_put` in the `mt76` driver, which doesn't initialize the allocated memory. This could lead to the potential reuse of uninitialized data when crafting network packets.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of `skb_put` instead of `skb_put_zero`: `skb_put` allocates space in a socket buffer (sk_buff) but doesn't initialize it. This can result in the inclusion of previously used and potentially sensitive data from the kernel memory in the newly crafted packets.
- Uninitialized memory exposure: The allocated memory might contain stale data from previous operations, leaking information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data that was previously stored in the kernel memory. This data could include fragments of previous packets, cryptographic keys, or other sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending crafted network packets to the vulnerable device, which utilizes the `mt76` driver. Specifically related to the `mt76_connac_mcu.c` and `mt7915/mcu.c` files in the driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to interact with a network interface using the `mt76` driver and send specially crafted packets. This likely requires a position on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.

**Additional details:**
The fix replaces `skb_put` with `skb_put_zero` which initializes the allocated memory with zeroes. This prevents the reuse of uninitialized memory and mitigates the information leak. The patch is applied to multiple parts of the code base to ensure proper handling for all cases where skb_put was used for adding new data to a socket buffer.
