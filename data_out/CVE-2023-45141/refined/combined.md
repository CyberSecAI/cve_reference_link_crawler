gomod

github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2/middleware/csrf
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

< 2.50.0

>= 2.50.0

## Description

A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability has been identified in the application, which allows an attacker to obtain tokens and forge malicious requests on behalf of a user. This can lead to unauthorized actions being taken on the user's behalf, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the application.

## Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability is caused by improper validation and enforcement of CSRF tokens within the application. The following issues were identified:

1. **Lack of Token Association**: The CSRF token was validated against tokens in storage but was not tied to the original requestor that generated it, allowing for token reuse.

## Remediation

To remediate this vulnerability, it is recommended to take the following actions:

1. **Update the Application**: Upgrade the application to a fixed version with a patch for the vulnerability.
2. **Implement Proper CSRF Protection**: Review the updated documentation and ensure your application's CSRF protection mechanisms follow best practices.
3. **Choose CSRF Protection Method**: Select the appropriate CSRF protection method based on your application's requirements, either the Double Submit Cookie method or the Synchronizer Token Pattern using sessions.
4. **Security Testing**: Conduct a thorough security assessment, including penetration testing, to identify and address any other security vulnerabilities.

## Defence-in-depth

Users should take additional security measures like captchas or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and set Session cookies with SameSite=Lax or SameSite=Strict, and the Secure and HttpOnly attributes.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
