**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the button element of the WP Table Builder plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- The injected scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the compromised page.
- This could allow attackers to perform malicious actions such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to phishing sites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the button element's settings/configuration.
- This injected code is stored in the database.
- When a user views the page where the table with the malicious button is displayed, the JavaScript code executes in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site. By default, this vulnerability can only be exploited by administrators, however, the ability to use and configure WP Table Builder can be extended to lower privileged users such as contributors.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was present in all versions of the WP Table Builder plugin up to and including version 1.4.14.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.4.15.
- The provided code snippets don't seem to be directly related to the vulnerability, but rather parts of the plugin's code. The vulnerability is likely located within the button element's code, which is not fully provided but is referenced as `inc/admin/element-classes/elements/button-element.php`.
