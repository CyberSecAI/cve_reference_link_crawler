### @suiso67 **[suiso67](/suiso67)** commented [Jul 26, 2024](#issue-2431300721)

[#6839](https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/pull/6839) seem to add `group_write` and `others_write` along with `owner_write` permission when setting `FileSystem::FolderPermissions::ReadWrite` permission to a folder, which is addressed in [#6863](https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/issues/6863). Please let me know if I'm missing any context.

Resolves [#6863](https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/issues/6863)

After further feedback it seems this code has deeper issues

We are investigating a broader rewrite of this right now

Thank you for your contribution, though -- we definitely have issues properly handling reassigning the correct permissions

[@suiso67](https://github.com/suiso67) Upon discussion and a rethink I think we can merge this in the mean time, as setting all perms is not a viable solution and we need a better way to handle setting/restoring perms

| [@suiso67](https://github.com/suiso67) could you rebase once more?  Sorry for being late, it has been merged already.  If you don't mind, I'd like to know if there're more context about related issue you're talking about. I came here completely blind and kind of just reverted the change, and I'd like to contribute to the real issue even thought I can't guarantee anything. |

### This comparison is taking too long to generate.

Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.

You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:

`git diff v3.13.3...v3.13.4`

## Description

![@TopMax](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20659991?u=400960d75f21d5298e55fdbb08003dca7d42c324&v=4&size=48)[TopMax](https://github.com/TopMax)opened [on Jun 30, 2024](https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/issues/6863#issue-2382351244)
### ⚠️ Before submitting, please verify the following: ⚠️

* This is a **bug**, not a question or a configuration issue.
* This issue is **not** already reported on Github (I've searched it).
* Nextcloud Server and Desktop Client are **up to date**. See [Server Maintenance and Release Schedule](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/wiki/Maintenance-and-Release-Schedule) and [Desktop Releases](https://nextcloud.com/install/#install-clients) for supported versions.
* I agree to follow Nextcloud's [Code of Conduct](https://nextcloud.com/contribute/code-of-conduct/)

### Bug description

After updating from 3.13.0 to 3.13.1, this error occurs.

If a file is updated in an existing folder, the permissions are modified for all folders directly above it up to the sync root folder, the folders become writable for groups and others.

Another way is to simply create a new folder for example in the sync root folder. Directly after creation, the folder then has the following rights, for example `drwx------ 2 user user 4096 Jun 30 19:14 test`. After the folder was synchronized, the rights have now changed, in this example `drwx-w--w- 2 user user 4096 Jun 30 19:14 test`.

There are no log entries for either the server or the client.

After downgrading from 3.13.1 to 3.13.0, this error no longer occurs.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a new folder with only read, write and execute permission for the user.
2. After the synchronization is complete check the permissions
3. The permissions changed to allow the group and other to write to the folder

---

1. Create a new file in a previously created folder (older client versions) and check that this folder only has read, write and execute permission for the user.
2. Create a new file in this folder or modify an existing one.
3. After the synchronization is complete check the permissions of the folder
4. The permissions changed to allow the group and other to write to the folder

### Expected behavior

After the synchronization no folder permissions are changed.
