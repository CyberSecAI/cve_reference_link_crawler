[#6839](https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/pull/6839) seem to add `group_write` and `others_write` along with `owner_write` permission when setting `FileSystem::FolderPermissions::ReadWrite` permission to a folder, which is addressed in [#6863](https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/issues/6863). Please let me know if I'm missing any context.

Resolves [#6863](https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/issues/6863)

After further feedback it seems this code has deeper issues

We are investigating a broader rewrite of this right now

Thank you for your contribution, though -- we definitely have issues properly handling reassigning the correct permissions

[@suiso67](https://github.com/suiso67) Upon discussion and a rethink I think we can merge this in the mean time, as setting all perms is not a viable solution and we need a better way to handle setting/restoring perms

If you don't mind, I'd like to know if there're more context about related issue you're talking about. I came here completely blind and kind of just reverted the change, and I'd like to contribute to the real issue even thought I can't guarantee anything. |
