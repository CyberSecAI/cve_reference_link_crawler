* Nextcloud Server and Desktop Client are **up to date**. See [Server Maintenance and Release Schedule](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/wiki/Maintenance-and-Release-Schedule) and [Desktop Releases](https://nextcloud.com/install/#install-clients) for supported versions.

### Bug description

After updating from 3.13.0 to 3.13.1, this error occurs.

If a file is updated in an existing folder, the permissions are modified for all folders directly above it up to the sync root folder, the folders become writable for groups and others.

Another way is to simply create a new folder for example in the sync root folder. Directly after creation, the folder then has the following rights, for example `drwx------ 2 user user 4096 Jun 30 19:14 test`. After the folder was synchronized, the rights have now changed, in this example `drwx-w--w- 2 user user 4096 Jun 30 19:14 test`.

There are no log entries for either the server or the client.

After downgrading from 3.13.1 to 3.13.0, this error no longer occurs.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a new folder with only read, write and execute permission for the user.
2. After the synchronization is complete check the permissions
3. The permissions changed to allow the group and other to write to the folder

---

1. Create a new file in a previously created folder (older client versions) and check that this folder only has read, write and execute permission for the user.
2. Create a new file in this folder or modify an existing one.
3. After the synchronization is complete check the permissions of the folder
4. The permissions changed to allow the group and other to write to the folder

### Expected behavior

After the synchronization no folder permissions are changed.
