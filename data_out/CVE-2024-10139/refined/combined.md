# Submit #425285: code-projects Pharmacy Management System 1.0 SQL Injection[info](?kb.submission)

| Title | code-projects Pharmacy Management System 1.0 SQL Injection |
| --- | --- |
| Description | A critical SQL injection vulnerability has been discovered in the Pharmacy Management System version 1.0, specifically in the add supplier functionality. This flaw occurs when user inputs, such as the name parameter, are not properly sanitized. Attackers can manipulate these inputs to inject and execute arbitrary SQL commands through a GET request to the endpoint /php/add\_new\_supplier.php. If exploited, this vulnerability may allow unauthorized access to sensitive data, including supplier details, and disrupt operations. Given the absence of a patch, the issue represents a severe risk, demanding immediate remediation to prevent database compromise and information leakage. |

## **Affected Version:**

* **Pharmacy Management System**: 1.0

## **Vulnerability Information:**

* **Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection
* **Severity:** CRITICAL
* **Status:** Unpatched

## **Vulnerable Endpoint:**

* `/php/add_new_supplier.php?name=aaaa&email=aa@contato.com.br&contact_number=1234567890&address=321321321321adsadsadsa%20%20dsadsadsa`

## **Vulnerability Description:**

A critical SQL injection vulnerability has been discovered in the **Pharmacy Management System** version 1.0, specifically in the **add supplier functionality**. This flaw occurs when user inputs, such as the `name` parameter, are not properly sanitized. Attackers can manipulate these inputs to inject and execute arbitrary SQL commands through a **GET** request to the endpoint `/php/add_new_supplier.php`.

If exploited, this vulnerability may allow unauthorized access to sensitive data, including supplier details, and disrupt operations. Given the absence of a patch, the issue represents a severe risk, demanding immediate remediation to prevent database compromise and information leakage.

## **Proof of Concept (PoC):**

Below is an example of a **GET** request illustrating how the SQL injection vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the `name` parameter:
