Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in the phpkobo AjaxNewsTicker version 1.05. It arises from the application's failure to properly sanitize user-provided input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application accepts user-controlled input in the `requ` parameter, which is then used to make server-side requests. This allows an attacker to potentially control the target of these requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By controlling the server-side requests, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary code. While the PoC focuses on database interaction during the installation phase, SSRF vulnerabilities can often be leveraged in various ways to interact with internal services, potentially escalating to code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/ntic/install/index.php` endpoint.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The malicious payload is injected into the `requ` parameter of the GET request. This parameter contains a JSON payload including command and form data that are used in the application installation process.
*  The `requ` parameter is vulnerable to SSRF and allows the attacker to control the server-side request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not require prior access or authentication.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to send requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Basic understanding of HTTP and JSON:** The attacker should understand how to construct a malicious HTTP request and how the application parses JSON.
