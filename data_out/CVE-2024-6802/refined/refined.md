Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `Master.php` file, specifically within the `save_record` function, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter in a multipart form post request. The parameter is not being properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **CWE-89:** The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-89, which stands for "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')".

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Compromise:** Attackers can use SQL injection to extract, modify, or delete data in the database.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive data like usernames, passwords, and other personal information.
*   **Full System Control:** In some cases, depending on the database permissions, an attacker could potentially gain control of the system hosting the database server.
*   **Application Downtime:** By modifying or deleting critical information or the entire database, the attacker can cause the application to become unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to `/lms/classes/Master.php?f=save_record`.
*   **Multipart Form Data:** The malicious SQL code is injected via the `id` parameter within the multipart form data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP POST requests and understand multipart form data.
*   **SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL to craft effective injection payloads, although tools like sqlmap can automate much of this process.
*  **No Authentication Required**:  Based on the provided information, authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited using tools like `sqlmap`, which can automate the process of finding and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   The report provides examples of `sqlmap` payloads used to detect the vulnerability through boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
*   The databases can be dumped using `sqlmap`.
*  The vulnerable parameter is `MULTIPART id`.
