- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The health check RPM in Cisco IOS XR Software opens TCP port 6379 by default upon activation, exposing the Redis instance running within the NOSi container.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An open, unprotected Redis instance on port 6379.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to write to the Redis in-memory database, write arbitrary files to the container filesystem, and retrieve information about the Redis database.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can connect to the Redis instance on the open port.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the device and the ability to connect to the open port 6379. No authentication is required.
