Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2022-30360
*   **Vulnerable Software:** OvalEdge 5.2.8.0 and earlier
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), also known as Persistent or Type II XSS.
*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `slackid` and `phone` parameters when updating a user profile. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when a POST request is made to `/profile/updateProfile`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Lack of input sanitization on the `slackid` and `phone` parameters.
    *   The vulnerability bypasses previous XSS patches, suggesting a weakness in the patch implementation.
    *   The exploit strings start with a space, indicating a possible filtering bypass technique.
    *   Character limitation of 50 characters for payload.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected user profile data. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Account takeover
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Defacement
    *   Other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious POST request to `/profile/updateProfile` including the malicious script in the `phone` or `slackid` parameters.
    *   The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have a valid account with the OvalEdge application.
    *   The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the server.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content gives a specific example of the vulnerable request and data parameters using a CURL command.
*  The content suggests that there are multiple stored XSS vulnerabilities, but it only provides details on this specific one involving `/profile/updateProfile` endpoint.
