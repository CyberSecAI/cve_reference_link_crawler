- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure communication between the FRP client and server in Gradio when the `share=True` option is used. HTTPS is not enforced, leading to unencrypted communication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of HTTPS enforcement for communication between the FRP client and server, allowing for interception of data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can intercept and read files uploaded to the Gradio server, as well as modify responses or data sent between the client and server. This can expose sensitive data from files and potentially manipulate application behavior.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle attacks by intercepting the unencrypted communication between the Gradio client and server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the FRP client and server. This typically involves being on the same network or having control over a network hop between the client and server.
