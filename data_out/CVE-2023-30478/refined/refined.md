- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** By exploiting CSRF, an attacker can trick an authenticated user into unknowingly performing actions.
