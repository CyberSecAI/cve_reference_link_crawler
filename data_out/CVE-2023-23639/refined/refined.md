- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, allowing an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unprivileged users can perform actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not detailed in this document, but it involves exploiting functions within the plugin that lack proper access control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a "Subscriber" user, which is a low-privileged user role in WordPress.
