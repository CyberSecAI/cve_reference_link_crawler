- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the 'sips_popup' shortcode of the Simple Image Popup Shortcode plugin for WordPress.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts that execute whenever a user accesses a page containing the injected shortcode, potentially leading to malicious actions within the user's browser session.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through the plugin's 'sips_popup' shortcode, by injecting malicious code via user supplied attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated users with contributor-level access or higher can inject the malicious shortcode into pages or posts.
