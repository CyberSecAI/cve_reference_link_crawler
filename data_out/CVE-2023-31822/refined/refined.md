Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Vulnerability Name:** Exposure of secret in Entetsu Store

**Root Cause:** The Entetsu Store mini-app on Line exposes its client secret to the client-side. Specifically, the client secret is included in the response of the API endpoint `https://api/retailstudio.jp/api/v2/get_media_info`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Hardcoded/Exposed Secret:** The primary vulnerability is the direct exposure of the 'client secret' within the API response. This violates the principle of keeping secrets confidential.
*   **Insecure Secret Management:** The application lacks proper secure management of the client secret, leading to its exposure via a publicly accessible API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Channel Access Token Acquisition:** The exposed client secret can be used to obtain the channel access token.
*   **Malicious Message Broadcasting:** With the channel access token, an attacker can send malicious broadcast messages to users of the Entetsu Store mini-app. These messages could contain:
    *   Malicious website links
    *   Fraudulent information
    *   Other potentially harmful content.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Traffic Analysis:** An attacker can intercept or analyze the network traffic of the Line app when the 'Entetsu Store' mini-app is used, particularly when making requests to the specified API endpoint.
*   **Client-Side Exposure:** The secret is directly embedded in the response data, making it accessible once a user interacts with the vulnerable mini-app.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Basic Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to monitor network requests made by a client using the Line app and interacting with the vulnerable mini-app, or have access to the API response.
*   **Line Application Usage:** The attacker needs no elevated privileges, only the ability to make requests to the api endpoint through the Line application by simply opening the 'Entetsu Store' mini-app.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Line version 13.6.1.
*   The client secret is used to obtain a channel access token which is essential for secure communications.
*   The vulnerability is related to the Entetsu Store mini-app.
