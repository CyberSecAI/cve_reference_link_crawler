Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-23152:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A maliciously crafted 3DM file, when parsed by `opennurbs.dll` within Autodesk applications, can trigger an Out-of-Bounds Read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The software attempts to read data from a memory location outside of the allocated buffer, leading to potential information disclosure or crashes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** The vulnerability can cause the application to crash, leading to denial of service.
*   **Read Sensitive Data:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive information stored in memory.
*   **Execute Arbitrary Code:** An attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves parsing a maliciously crafted 3DM file. This means a user needs to open a file from an untrusted source.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious 3DM file.
*   The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the malicious file using a vulnerable Autodesk application.
*   The attacker needs user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.
