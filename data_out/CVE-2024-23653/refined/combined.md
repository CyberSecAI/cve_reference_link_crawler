Running interactive container APIs was done by giving
the gateway implementation access to worker controller
directly, but it should be passed with a build job instead.

Ensure interactive calls validate same conditions that
the build requests do. Refactor of the build side is to ensure
we use the same validation function for both cases. There
was no validation issue with the LLB validation.

# Interactive containers API does not validate entitlements check

High

GHSA-wr6v-9f75-vh2g
Jan 31, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<=v0.12.4

## Patched versions

v0.12.5

## Description

### Impact

In addition to running containers as build steps, BuildKit also provides APIs for running interactive containers based on built images. It was possible to use these APIs to ask BuildKit to run a container with elevated privileges. Normally, running such containers is only allowed if special `security.insecure` entitlement is enabled both by buildkitd configuration and allowed by the user initializing the build request.

### Patches

The issue has been fixed in v0.12.5 .

### Workarounds

Avoid using BuildKit frontends from untrusted sources. A frontend image is usually specified as the `#syntax` line on your Dockerfile, or with `--frontend` flag when using `buildctl build` command.
