# Interactive containers API does not validate entitlements check

High

GHSA-wr6v-9f75-vh2g
Jan 31, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<=v0.12.4

## Patched versions

v0.12.5

## Description

### Impact

In addition to running containers as build steps, BuildKit also provides APIs for running interactive containers based on built images. It was possible to use these APIs to ask BuildKit to run a container with elevated privileges. Normally, running such containers is only allowed if special `security.insecure` entitlement is enabled both by buildkitd configuration and allowed by the user initializing the build request.

### Patches

The issue has been fixed in v0.12.5 .

### Workarounds

Avoid using BuildKit frontends from untrusted sources. A frontend image is usually specified as the `#syntax` line on your Dockerfile, or with `--frontend` flag when using `buildctl build` command.

### References

### Severity
