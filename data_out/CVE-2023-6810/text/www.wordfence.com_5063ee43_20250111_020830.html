### Description

The ClickCease Click Fraud Protection plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to an improper capability check on the get\_settings function in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author access and above, to retrieve the plugin's configured API keys.
