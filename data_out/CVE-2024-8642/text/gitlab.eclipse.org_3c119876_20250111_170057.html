# Eclipse EDC: Consumer pull transfer token validation does not apply any rules (e. g., expiration check)

The Eclipse Foundation is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/) (CVE) Numbering Authority. This issue it used to request and track the progress of the assignment of a CVE for a vulnerability in the project code for an Eclipse open source project.

## Basic information

**Project name:** Eclipse EDC

**Project id:** {id}

**Request type:** reservation

**Versions affected:** before 0.9.0

**Common Weakness Enumeration:**

* {[CWE-303](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/303.html)}
* {[CWE-305](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/305.html)}
* ...

**Common Vulnerability Scoring System:** {[cvss](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)}

**Summary:**

In Eclipse ECD after 0.5.0 and before version 0.9.0, TokenValidationService validation incorrectly checks validation rules, what can allow the attacker to bypass the check for token expiration. The issue requires to have a dataplane configured to support http proxy consumer pull AND include the modules "transfer-data-plane" and "data-plane-public-api". In 0.9.0 the vulnerable code has been removed.
