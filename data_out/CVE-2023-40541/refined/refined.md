```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the Shortcuts application where a shortcut can output sensitive user data without explicit user consent.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper user consent checks before a shortcut outputs potentially sensitive data.
- Impact of exploitation: A malicious shortcut can output sensitive user data without the user's knowledge or permission, leading to potential information disclosure.
- Attack vectors: An attacker can create a malicious shortcut that exploits this vulnerability. If the user runs this shortcut, the attacker can gain access to the user's sensitive data.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious shortcut. The user must then execute this shortcut for the vulnerability to be exploited.
