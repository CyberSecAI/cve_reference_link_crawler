{
  "CVE-2023-40140": {
    "root_cause": "The key mapping information between native key mappings and the KeyCharacterMap object in Java is shared, allowing for a read to be attempted while it's being modified.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Concurrency issue due to shared data between native and Java components.",
      "Race condition where a read operation conflicts with a write (modification) operation."
    ],
    "impact": "Local escalation of privilege. While the specific exploitation details are not given, the EoP (Elevation of Privilege) designation indicates that a successful exploit allows an attacker to gain higher-level access or capabilities than they would normally have.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local exploitation.",
    "required_capabilities": "No additional execution privileges needed, suggesting that the attacker only requires the ability to execute code at the current privilege level."
  }
