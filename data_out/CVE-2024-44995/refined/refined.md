{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A deadlock can occur in the hns3 driver when configuring Traffic Control (TC) during a reset process. The race condition happens because the TC setup process can bring the network interface up before the driver's uninitialization (UINIT) routine is complete, leading to a deadlock.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Race condition leading to a deadlock.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "System deadlock, rendering the network interface unusable and potentially disrupting system services relying on network connectivity.",
  "Attack vectors": "Configuring TC (Traffic Control) while a reset of the hns3 network interface is in progress.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to trigger TC configuration and initiate a reset on the hns3 network interface simultaneously."
