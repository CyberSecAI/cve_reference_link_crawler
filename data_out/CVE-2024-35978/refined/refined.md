{
  "CVE-2024-35978": {
    "Description": "The provided content describes a fix for a memory leak in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem, specifically in the hci_req_sync_complete() function.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a failure to free the previously allocated skb (socket buffer) associated with a synchronous HCI request before assigning a new skb to hdev->req_skb. This leads to a memory leak each time a new synchronous request completes without the previous skb being freed.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Memory Leak"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A memory leak can gradually exhaust available memory resources, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition as the system runs out of memory.",
     "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by repeatedly sending and completing synchronous HCI requests, which will cause the memory leak.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to interact with the Bluetooth subsystem and trigger synchronous HCI requests."
