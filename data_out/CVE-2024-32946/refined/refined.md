- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The LevelOne WBR-6012 router uses HTTP and FTP for administration and management. These protocols do not support encryption, leading to cleartext transmission of all communications, including credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext transmission of sensitive information, specifically via HTTP and FTP. The device lacks options for more secure encrypted alternatives (HTTPS, SSH, SFTP) and the vulnerable services cannot be disabled.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Sensitive information, including credentials, can be exposed to network sniffing attacks. This could enable an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the router's administration interface and potentially control the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Network sniffing. An attacker on the same network as the router can capture the cleartext communications.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable router to sniff the traffic.
