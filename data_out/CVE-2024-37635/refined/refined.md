- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `setWiFiBasicCfg` function in TOTOLINK A3700R firmware version V9.1.2u.6165_20211012 does not perform proper bounds checking on the `ssid` parameter after URL decoding. The decoded string is directly stored on the stack without length validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability due to missing length validation when storing the decoded `ssid` parameter on the stack.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can overwrite return addresses or other critical data on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, hijacking the program or causing a denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` with a long `ssid` value.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device, which typically means being on the same network or having access to the device's web interface.
