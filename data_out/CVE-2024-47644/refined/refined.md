- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Copyscape Premium plugin <= 1.3.9 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could lead to unauthorized actions being performed within the WordPress site, under the context of an authenticated user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a malicious website or email that tricks a logged-in user into submitting a request to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious requests and trick a logged-in user into triggering them. The attacker does not need to be authenticated but needs to target a logged in user.
