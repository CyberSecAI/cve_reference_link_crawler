## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Category Posts Widget (Free < 4.9.17, Pro < 4.9.13) - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its "Category Posts" widget settings before outputting them back in a page/post where the Widget is embed, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Add a "Category Posts" widget to the footer (this can be achieved with the Classic Widgets plugin along with a non block theme like Twenty Twenty One, or older versions of WP), add "%more-link%" to the Post details > Template field, then add the following payload in the "Read More text" field (further down below the Template one: <img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
The XSS will be triggered on any page in the frontend
