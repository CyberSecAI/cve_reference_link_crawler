The provided content is related to CVE-2024-6158.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Category Posts Widget plugin does not properly validate and escape user-supplied input in the widget settings (specifically, the "Template" and "Read More text" fields) before rendering them on the page. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page, which can then be executed in the browsers of users viewing that page. This could lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must have administrator-level privileges or be able to add widgets.
- They add a Category Posts widget to a page or post.
- They inject malicious code into the "Template" and "Read More text" fields in the widget settings.
- When a user views the page, the injected script executes within the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user, like an admin, to add and configure the widget.
- No unfiltered_html capability is needed for the attack, making the vulnerability exploitable even in multisite setups with restricted privileges.
