- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) by improper handling of user-supplied input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is network-based and can be triggered by a user with low privileges through a user interaction, which is a click or similar.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs low privileges to inject the malicious code that is later stored on the server. A user interaction (e.g., a click) is needed to trigger the execution of the malicious script.
