The provided content relates to CVE-2022-28371.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Verizon 5G LVSKIHP modem (both IDU and ODU components) utilizes a static, firmware-embedded certificate for authentication to JSON listeners.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Static Certificate:** The use of a hardcoded, static certificate for authentication. This allows anyone with access to the firmware image to obtain the certificate.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   The static certificate allows an attacker to bypass authentication to the JSON listeners on the device. This can be combined with other vulnerabilities (such as the command injection in `crtcreadpartition`) to achieve remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Access:**  An attacker with network access to the device's internal interfaces (10.0.0.1 or 10.0.0.2) can utilize the static certificate to interact with the JSON listeners.
* **Firmware access:** Access to the firmware is required to obtain the static certificate.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the device, or have access to the internal interfaces (10.0.0.1 or 10.0.0.2).
*   **Firmware access:** The attacker needs access to the firmware to retrieve the static certificate. This can be obtained through the device's log export function.
