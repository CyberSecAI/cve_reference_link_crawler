- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The TOTOLINK EX1200T router exposes sensitive information (WiFi key, etc.) through the `setting/getSysStatusCfg` endpoint without requiring authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated access to sensitive system information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain sensitive information such as the WiFi key.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a request to the `setting/getSysStatusCfg` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device, presumably within the same network or through an exposed management interface.
