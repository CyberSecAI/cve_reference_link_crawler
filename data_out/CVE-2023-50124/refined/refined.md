{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Flient Smart Lock allows users to unlock the door via a biometric fingerprint. The fingerprint scanner is an AES1711 scanner. There are two screws accessible from the outside of the door, which can be removed by an attacker to get access to the fingerprint sensor. The fingerprint sensor has a default password set on the UART interface, allowing an attacker to upload new fingerprints.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Physical access to the fingerprint sensor",
      "Default password on the UART interface",
      "Lack of proper verification of the fingerprint data"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can replace stored fingerprints within the lock, gaining unauthorized access to the perimeter.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Physical access to the lock",
      "UART interface access",
      "Replacement of stored fingerprints"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker with physical access to the smart lock and basic knowledge of UART communication can perform this attack."
