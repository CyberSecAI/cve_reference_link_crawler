- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly enforce restrictions on excessive authentication attempts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts (CWE-307).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can conduct brute-force attacks against legitimate user credentials or keys, potentially gaining unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs network access to the application and no prior authentication is required.
