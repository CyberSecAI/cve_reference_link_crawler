Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2024-38568.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The driver for the HNS3 PMU in the Linux kernel does not perform bounds checking when writing data to the `event_group` array.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: If the number of events in an event group exceeds `HNS3_PMU_MAX_HW_EVENTS`, a memory write overflow occurs in the `event_group` array.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: Writing beyond the bounds of the `event_group` array can lead to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by using the `perf` tool to create event groups with a number of events exceeding `HNS3_PMU_MAX_HW_EVENTS`.
  - Specifically, the `perf stat -e '{pmu/event1/, ... ,pmu/event9/}'` command can be used to create event groups, where the number of specified events determines if the overflow condition will be met.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to use the `perf` tool. This typically requires local access or the ability to execute commands on the target system.

**Additional Notes:**
- `HNS3_PMU_MAX_HW_EVENTS` limits the number of hardware events that can be included in an event group.
- The fix adds an array index check to prevent writing outside the bounds of the `event_group` array.
- The provided content includes the commit messages and diffs for the fix, as well as the original vulnerable code.
