- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer (CWE-788)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write leading to access of memory location after the end of a buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors:** Local access, user interaction required (user must open a malicious file)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious file which when opened by the victim, triggers the vulnerability. The attacker does not require any privileges on the victim system.
