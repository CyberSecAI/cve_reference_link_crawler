- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. Specific impacts may vary case-by-case.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a CSRF attack, where a malicious actor crafts a request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, executes an unwanted action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into triggering the crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the targeted system.
