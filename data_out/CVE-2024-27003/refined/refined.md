The provided content describes a fix for a potential deadlock and an RPM count underflow in the Linux kernel's clock (clk) subsystem, specifically related to the `clk_summary` debugfs interface.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the `clk_summary` debugfs interface handled runtime power management (PM) for clock devices. When printing clock state information, the code would individually resume (`clk_pm_runtime_get`) and suspend (`clk_pm_runtime_put`) each clock device. This caused the following issues:

1.  **Deadlock:** If a thread was in the process of resuming a device to print the clock state, and another thread was simultaneously trying to resume the same device (e.g., due to a screen turning on), a deadlock could occur.
2.  **RPM Count Underflow:** The return value of `clk_pm_runtime_get()` was not checked, causing an RPM count underflow on error paths, due to subsequent `clk_pm_runtime_put`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Race Condition/Deadlock:** The original code created a potential race condition when accessing clk resources due to unsynchronized runtime PM operations from multiple threads.
-   **Error Handling:** The lack of error handling for `clk_pm_runtime_get()` could lead to unexpected behavior, specifically a count underflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   The deadlock could cause the system to freeze or become unresponsive.
-   The RPM count underflow could lead to unpredictable behavior in clock management.

**Attack vectors:**

-   The vulnerability is triggered when the `clk_summary` or `clk_dump` debugfs interfaces are accessed, which indirectly calls the affected functions.
-   The access to the debugfs interface must be done while there is another thread working with the same clock.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   An attacker would need to be able to trigger the printing of the clk summary information while another thread is trying to resume the same device. This can be achieved through accessing the appropriate debugfs entry.
-   The attacker would likely need local access to the system.

**Fix:**

The fix involves ensuring that all devices are runtime resumed *before* walking the clock tree to print the summary. This is achieved by calling `clk_pm_runtime_get_all()` at the beginning of the summary printing and `clk_pm_runtime_put_all()` at the end. This eliminates the redundant `clk_pm_runtime_get` and `clk_pm_runtime_put` calls in the `clk_summary_show_subtree` function and ensures that all devices are in the correct power state to avoid deadlocks and the missing check on error return from `clk_pm_runtime_get`.

This commit addresses a concurrency issue related to accessing clock resources.
