This vulnerability is present in selected Exynos chipsets and pertains to improper input validation in the SMC_SRPMB_WSM handler of RPMB ldfw. The vulnerability allows arbitrary memory write and code execution due to the lack of proper input validation.",
       "affected_versions": "Q(10), R(11), S(12) devices with selected Exynos chipsets",
      "root_cause": "Improper input validation in the SMC_SRPMB_WSM handler of RPMB ldfw.",
      "vulnerability": "An unchecked IRQ index in the RPMB ldfw leads to arbitrary memory write and code execution.",
      "impact": "Arbitrary memory write and code execution.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted input to the SMC_SRPMB_WSM handler of RPMB ldfw.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the SMC_SRPMB_WSM handler. This could involve a local attacker or an attacker who has gained a foothold on the system."
