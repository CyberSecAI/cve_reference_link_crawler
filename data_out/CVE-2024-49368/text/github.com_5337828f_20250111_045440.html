# Notice

We're excited to announce that we've been hard at work developing the next generation of the Nginx UI (v2). To keep up-to-date with our progress, please visit <https://github.com/users/0xJacky/projects/1>.

Please feel free to send any feedbacks, suggestions or bug reports in Github issues.

# Change vs v2.0.0-beta.35

1. Updated Japanese translations, thanks to the contributions of [@kohkimakimoto](https://github.com/kohkimakimoto) .
2. Fixed the directiory name of wildcard certificate changed in Linux [#591](https://github.com/0xJacky/nginx-ui/issues/591).
3. Added a clone button for location block [#586](https://github.com/0xJacky/nginx-ui/issues/586) .
4. Added support for reading proxy settings from environment [#579](https://github.com/0xJacky/nginx-ui/issues/579).
5. Added a proxy option for ACEM user.
6. Added a LogDirWhiteList option for the nginx section of settings.
7. The `CasdoorSettings.Certificate` setting has been deprecated and replaced by `CasdoorSettings.CertificatePath`, which refers to the path of the certificate file.
8. Fixed some security issues, reported by [@unam4](https://github.com/unam4).

# Breaking Changes:

1. Starting from v2.0.0-beta.36, you must specify the directories where the logs are stored. Only logs within these directories can be viewed online. Check this documentation for more information: <https://nginxui.com/guide/config-nginx.html#logdirwhitelist>.
2. The `CasdoorSettings.Certificate` setting has been deprecated and replaced by `CasdoorSettings.CertificatePath`, which refers to the path of the certificate file.
3. About PR [#445](https://github.com/0xJacky/nginx-ui/pull/445), if you are using nginx-ui docker container and encounter this issue, you have to remove the trailing `.conf` manually. Diff: <https://github.com/0xJacky/nginx-ui/pull/445/files>
4. The `nginx_log` section in the configuration file has been renamed to `nginx`.

   `NginxConfigDir` and `NginxPIDPath` in the `server` section have been renamed to `ConfigDir` and `PIDPath` respectively, and both have been moved into the `nginx` section.
5. The `ReloadCmd` and `RestartCmd` have been added in the `nginx` section to configure custom commands for reloading/restarting Nginx.
6. In versions above v2.0.0-beta.23 of Nginx UI Docker containers, `/var/logs/nginx/access.log` and `/var/logs/nginx/error.log` are no longer soft links to `/dev/stdout` and `/dev/stderr`, but regular files. If you need this functionality, please add `access_log /dev/stdout` and `error_log /dev/stderr` in your `nginx.conf`. For users upgrading from older versions who do not need this feature, check if your `nginx.conf` contains `access_log /var/logs/nginx/access.local.log` and `error_log /var/logs/nginx/error.local.log`. If so, please manually remove them to avoid duplicate log entries. This change allows you to map `/var/logs/nginx` to a directory on the host machine to achieve persistent storage of log files.
