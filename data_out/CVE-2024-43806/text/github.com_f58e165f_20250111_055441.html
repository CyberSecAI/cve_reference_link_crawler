| Is this problem happening on `main`?  Bandwhich itself does not use any unsafe code, so it's likely that the memory leak was caused by a dependency. We had lots of dependency bumps since the last release, so this may have been already solved if indeed that's the version you are seeing problems on. |

| I was using whatever was in `main` when I filed the issue, yes. Happy to test again after the changes that landed today, but that all looks like CD pipeline stuff?  I found it quite easily reproducible on multiple machines for me. Just leave it running for a while and eventually, it blows up. Might take many minutes or hours, depending on traffic volume, maybe.  I built it with rust 1.70.0 if that makes any difference? |

| but that all looks like CD pipeline stuff?  Yes that's true. You don't need to test again =).  I found it quite easily reproducible on multiple machines for me. Just leave it running for a while and eventually, it blows up. Might take many minutes or hours, depending on traffic volume, maybe.  Curious. I'm no expert in debugging memory issues, but I'll give it a try.  I built it with rust 1.70.0 if that makes any difference?  I doubt it. |

| ah I see to make the leaks show up you need to attach heaptrack to bandwhich, and then close heptrack **not** bandhwich  Because seems RAII is working correctly and everyhting will get cleaned up at exit, but if we disconnect early it shows us places that accumulate memory in the life time of the program like the state updating above |

Yes But its more like keeping the memory past its usefulness  Also maybe someone who reproduces the issue can try changing <https://github.com/imsnif/bandwhich/blob/main/src/network/utilization.rs#L24> to `self.connections = HashMap::new();` if thats indeed where the biggest issue is, it should be felt by forcing the hashmap to relase its memory |

I'll take a look at how this stored data is used and how to best implement some sort of cleanup.   ---  Edit: Perhaps I shouldn't rule out the possibility that it's caused by file handles not being closed. I'll make sure that isn't the case first. |

There's one thing we can try immediately though: `procfs` v0.15.1 depends on an old version of `rustix`: v0.35.15. I can try to bump it to the newest version via a temporary patch, and we can let [@popey](https://github.com/popey) try again with the patched build. |

| Okay, can all please try the [`bump-procfs-rustix` branch](https://github.com/imsnif/bandwhich/tree/bump-procfs-rustix)?  You can either pull the branch and build locally or use [the CI build](https://github.com/imsnif/bandwhich/actions/runs/6449031088#:~:text=will%20be%20uploaded.-,Artifacts,-Produced%20during%20runtime).  If this still does not fix this issue, I will go ahead and submit bug reports in `procfs` and `rustix` repositories. And in the absolute worst case scenario, we may have actually found a bug in the `glibc` allocator 🥶. |

| Hi all, I went hunting for the bug after [cyqsimon](https://github.com/cyqsimon) brought it up in the community discord server. Looks like I have found the issue and it is in rustix's linux\_raw backend.  As [cyqsimon](https://github.com/cyqsimon) already pointed out the `Dir` struct for the linux\_raw backend contains a `Vec<u8>`: <https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rustix/blob/main/src/backend/linux_raw/fs/dir.rs#L21>.  From the heaptrace the allocation is coming from the `Dir::read()` method here: <https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rustix/blob/main/src/backend/linux_raw/fs/dir.rs#L55>  At <https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rustix/blob/main/src/backend/linux_raw/fs/dir.rs#L78> the code in `read()` checks if it has run out of items and needs to read more, it then calls `Dir::read_more()`. Immediately upon entering `Dir::read_more()`, it calls `resize()` on the `self.buf` (<https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rustix/blob/main/src/backend/linux_raw/fs/dir.rs#L142>). However, it uses this new size:  ``` self.buf.resize(self.buf.capacity() + 32 * size_of::<linux_dirent64>(), 0); ```  This causes `self.buf` to grow every time `read_more()` is called without bound because of the usage of `self.buf.capacity()`. I believe the issue is resolved by simply changing `self.buf.capacity()` to `self.buf.len()` as directly after this `self.buf.resize(nread, 0);` is called to truncate the Vec to the actual number of elements (note this does not deallocate anything).  In normal operation `self.buf.capacity()` should never need to be more than a few multiples of `32 * size_of::<linux_dirent64>()` if not exactly that. |

| Hi all, quick update.  Thanks to the collaborative effort of [@sigmaSd](https://github.com/sigmaSd), [@konnorandrews](https://github.com/konnorandrews), and [@sunfishcode](https://github.com/sunfishcode) (rustix maintainer), we were able to diagnose the issue and reproduce the fault condition in rustix directly. They will likely patch it in the next release.  Since we currently depend on procfs 0.15.1, which depends on an older, incompatible version of rustix, we will not be able to update our indirect dependency on rustix immediately. I will notify [@eminence](https://github.com/eminence) (procfs maintainer) as soon as the rustix patch is available. |

| Good news, rustix has backported this fix to all minor versions up to 0.35, which is the first minor version affected. This means we do not block on an update from procfs (I have notified them nonetheless).  Since I am pretty confident that we've fixed the exact problem, I will close this issue as completed. Please reopen and/or comment in case you are still seeing it on `main`, thanks. |
