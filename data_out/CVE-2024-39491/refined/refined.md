Based on the provided information, all three commits (60d5e087e5f334475b032ad7e6ad849fb998f303, d344873c4cbde249b7152d36a273bcc45864001e, and 9054c474f9c219e58a441e401c0e6e38fe713ff1) address the same vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `cs_dsp` instance for the Cirrus Logic CS35L56 amplifier was not being properly managed. Specifically, it was initialized in the driver's `probe()` function but was only freed in the component's `unbind()` callback, `cs35l56_hda_unbind()`. This caused the `cs_dsp` instance to become uninitialized if the driver was unbound and then re-bound, as it would be reinitialized in probe without freeing the old instance first. Additionally, there was a missing call to `cs_dsp_remove()` in the error path of `cs35l56_hda_common_probe()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Use-after-free/Double Free**: When the driver is unbound and rebound, the `cs_dsp` instance will be uninitialized on subsequent use, which could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
- **Resource leak:** In the error path of `cs35l56_hda_common_probe()`, the allocated cs_dsp instance would leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior, system instability, or crashes. It could potentially lead to more serious issues with further exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by the unbinding and rebinding of the driver. The exact process and impact depend on how the driver is used and its interaction with the ALSA subsystem.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the ability to unbind and rebind the driver which would likely require root or administrator privileges.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix moves the freeing of the `cs_dsp` instance to the driver's `remove()` function and adds a call to `cs_dsp_remove()` in the error path of the `probe()` function.
- The commit message explains that the component binding API doesn't have error handling, making it important to initialize the `cs_dsp` in the probe.
