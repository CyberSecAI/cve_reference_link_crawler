Note that the CVE assignment (by MITRE as assigning CNA) for
CVE-2024-30203 is explicitly as follows:

> In Emacs before 29.3, Gnus treats inline MIME contents as trusted.

associated with:

<https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?h=emacs-29&id=937b9042ad7426acdcca33e3d931d8f495bdd804>

If you think the CVE assignment is not valid, then you might ask for a
REJECT on <https://cveform.mitre.org/> .

Regards,
Salvatore
