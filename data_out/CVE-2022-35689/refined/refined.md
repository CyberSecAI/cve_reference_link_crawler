- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper Access Control (CWE-284)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from improper access control, which could allow an attacker to bypass security features.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to a security feature bypass.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require special privileges or user interaction. Authentication is required for exploitation (PR:N), which suggests that an attacker may need some level of access or valid credentials, but not necessarily administrative privileges.
