# Running the Linux DUC v3.0 at startup

Once you have [installed](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/install-linux-3-x-dynamic-update-client-duc) the new Linux DUC, you will likely want it to run at startup so that the software is always running. That way, if your IP address changes, the No-IP Dynamic Update Client (DUC) will make sure your hostname is reflecting that new IP address.

**This guide assumes you are using a Linux distribution using Systemd. We are using Ubuntu Server here so please note the instructions might vary based on the distro you are using.**

---

While inside the downloaded folder, copy the debian/service folder over to your systemd directory:

```
sudo cp debian/service /etc/systemd/system/noip-duc.service
```
If you installed the No-IP DUC from source, change Line 7 in your /etc/systemd/system/noip-duc.service file to:

ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/noip-duc

If you installed the No-IP DUC using the package manager, you do NOT need to change this.If you want to uninstall the older version of the DUC, version 3.x, follow this guide instead.

Next you will need to create a configuration file for the *noip-duc* program to read.

Create and edit the file */etc/default/noip-duc* using your preferred text editor.

**Config File:**

```
## File: /etc/default/noip-duc
NOIP_USERNAME=
NOIP_PASSWORD=
NOIP_HOSTNAMES=
```

**Example Config File:**

```
NOIP_USERNAME=myusername
NOIP_PASSWORD=mypassword
NOIP_HOSTNAMES=example.ddns.net,exampledomain.com,noiptest.redirectme.net
```

Save the file. Next, reload your systemd daemon:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Then enable the service:

```
sudo systemctl enable noip-duc
```

Finally, start the program:

```
sudo systemctl start noip-duc
```

If everything went okay, then the No-IP DUC should be running in the background. You can run the command *sudo systemctl status noip-duc* and review the recent entries. A successful installation and setup will look like this:

[![successful installation](https://dc9wlm4wphap8.cloudfront.net/support/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/successful-installation.png)](https://dc9wlm4wphap8.cloudfront.net/support/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/successful-installation.png)

We recommend checking out the *INSTALL.MD* and *README.MD* files within the *noip-duc\_3.0.0-beta.5* directory to see our full documentation and help guide.

If everything went smoothly, *noip-duc* should be running in the background and will automatically run when your computer starts, ensuring you can always access your devices on the go.

If you are still having trouble, feel free to check out our [knowledge base](https://www.noip.com/support/) or reach out to our support team at support@noip.com.

# How to Install the Linux 3.x Dynamic Update Client (DUC)

Installing the Linux 3.x Dynamic Update Client (DUC) is easy! In this guide we will use Ubuntu, but most Debian based operating systems (Mint, Kali, Pop! OS, Deepin, etc.) will work with these instructions.

**If you are using an ARM based device such as a Raspberry Pi, you can now use the APT package manager to easily install the No-IP DUC! Simply use the *armhf* deb file instead of the amd64 file.**

You will need root user permissions to perform some of these functions, so use *sudo* when prompted. Please open the terminal.

## **Installing Using Package Manager:**

We recommend using your built in package manager to install the program. This will download all dependencies and make sure it is installed correctly. The .deb file for installing on Debian based setups like Ubuntu is included within the tarball in the Binaries folder.

Download the Linux DUC:

```
wget --content-disposition https://www.noip.com/download/linux/latest
```

Extract the file:

```
tar xf noip-duc_3.1.1.tar.gz
```

Now install it.

```
cd /home/$USER/noip-duc_3.1.1/binaries && sudo apt install ./noip-duc_3.1.1_amd64.deb
```

**If you are root, you do not need to issue the *sudo* command.**

> If you are on a Raspberry Pi or other ARM based device, use the armhf file in the binaries folder instead of the amd64 file.
>
> ```
> sudo apt install ./noip-duc_3.1.0_arm64.deb
> ```

Once the command is complete, run noip-duc to start the program.

You will want to explore the various options, so run noip-duc –help to see the available commands.

## Installing From Source:

You can also build the program from source, which should work on any Linux platform. To install the program from source, you will need Rust as a dependency. So make sure that is installed.

First, download the Linux DUC:

```
wget https://dmej8g5cpdyqd.cloudfront.net/downloads/noip-duc_3.1.0.tar.gz
```

Extract the file, and move into the directory:

```
tar xf noip-duc_3.1.0.tar.gz
cd noip-duc_3.1.0
```

Install Rust using the Rust toolchain installer:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Type 1 > Default Installation when prompted.

Once Rust has installed:

```
cargo build --release
```

Two errors might arise here:

1) You might need to install *build-essential*, which is required to install certain packages. Find this in your package manager, like *apt install build-essential*

2) You might need to restart your shell. See the following warning from the Rust installer:

To get started you may need to restart your current shell.

This would reload your PATH environment variable to include

Cargo’s bin directory ($HOME/.cargo/bin).

To configure your current shell, run:

**source “$HOME/.cargo/env”**

Once that has completed, copy the application to your programs folder:

```
sudo cp target/release/noip-duc /usr/local/bin
```

Now you can run the No-IP DUC by issuing the *noip-duc* command!

**Usage:**

```
noip-duc [OPTIONS] --username <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD>
```

**Example:**

```
noip-duc -g myhostname.ddns.net -u username -p password
```

**If you’re using [DDNS Keys](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/how-to-setup-and-use-a-ddns-key) use all.ddnskey.com, your DDNS Key Username, and your DDNS Key Password.**

This will start the program and talk to our update servers. If your IP is different than the current IP on your hostname, it will update your IP. Default behavior is to check every 5 minutes.

 If you’re trying to update a Group from the Linux DUC, please use one of the following commands instead:

**Updating a Single Host:**

noip-duc -u groupname:username -p grouppassword -g exampledomain.com

**Updating Multiple Hosts:**

noip-duc -u groupname:username -p grouppassword -g domain1234.net,exampledomain.com,myexampleurl.me,myotherdomain.biz

**If you’re using a [DDNS Key](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/how-to-setup-and-use-a-ddns-key), replace groupname:username with your DDNS Key Username, replace grouppassword with your DDNS Key Password and instead of listing your hostnames, use all.ddnskey.com.**

There are a number of different features, run *noip-duc –help* and be sure to check out the INSTALL.MD and README.MD files within the directory to see our full documentation and help guide.

If everything went smoothly, *noip-duc* should be running in the background, ensuring you can always access your cameras or servers on the go!

**Uninstalling:**

To remove the Linux DUC, run the following command:

```
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/noip-duc
```

Please include a screenshot or copy of your terminal output so we can better assist you in troubleshooting.
