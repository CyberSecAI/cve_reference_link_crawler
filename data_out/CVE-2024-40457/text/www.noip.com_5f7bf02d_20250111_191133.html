# Running the Linux DUC v3.0 at startup

Once you have [installed](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/install-linux-3-x-dynamic-update-client-duc) the new Linux DUC, you will likely want it to run at startup so that the software is always running. That way, if your IP address changes, the No-IP Dynamic Update Client (DUC) will make sure your hostname is reflecting that new IP address.

**This guide assumes you are using a Linux distribution using Systemd. We are using Ubuntu Server here so please note the instructions might vary based on the distro you are using.**

---

While inside the downloaded folder, copy the debian/service folder over to your systemd directory:

```
sudo cp debian/service /etc/systemd/system/noip-duc.service
```
If you installed the No-IP DUC from source, change Line 7 in your /etc/systemd/system/noip-duc.service file to:

ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/noip-duc

If you installed the No-IP DUC using the package manager, you do NOT need to change this.If you want to uninstall the older version of the DUC, version 3.x, follow this guide instead.

Next you will need to create a configuration file for the *noip-duc* program to read.

Create and edit the file */etc/default/noip-duc* using your preferred text editor.

**Config File:**

```
## File: /etc/default/noip-duc
NOIP_USERNAME=
NOIP_PASSWORD=
NOIP_HOSTNAMES=
```

**Example Config File:**

```
NOIP_USERNAME=myusername
NOIP_PASSWORD=mypassword
NOIP_HOSTNAMES=example.ddns.net,exampledomain.com,noiptest.redirectme.net
```

Save the file. Next, reload your systemd daemon:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Then enable the service:

```
sudo systemctl enable noip-duc
```

Finally, start the program:

```
sudo systemctl start noip-duc
```

If everything went okay, then the No-IP DUC should be running in the background. You can run the command *sudo systemctl status noip-duc* and review the recent entries. A successful installation and setup will look like this:

[![successful installation](https://dc9wlm4wphap8.cloudfront.net/support/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/successful-installation.png)](https://dc9wlm4wphap8.cloudfront.net/support/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/successful-installation.png)

We recommend checking out the *INSTALL.MD* and *README.MD* files within the *noip-duc\_3.0.0-beta.5* directory to see our full documentation and help guide.

If everything went smoothly, *noip-duc* should be running in the background and will automatically run when your computer starts, ensuring you can always access your devices on the go.
