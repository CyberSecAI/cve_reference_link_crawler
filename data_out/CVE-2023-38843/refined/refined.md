Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** Not yet assigned (TBD) but the content refers to Atlos CSV injection vulnerability.

**Root Cause:**
- User inputs are not sanitized against CSV injection attacks when creating a new incident. Specifically, the "Description" field is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CSV Injection: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the "Description" field of an incident, allowing a user to inject malicious code within a CSV export.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Client-Side Code Execution: An attacker can gain client-side code execution on the machines of other users who export the project data to a CSV file and open it with a vulnerable application (like Excel). This can lead to arbitrary code execution depending on the client's setup and application configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Creating a malicious incident: The attacker needs to create an incident and inject a malicious CSV formula into the "Description" field.
- Exporting project data to CSV: The victim needs to export the project data, which contains the malicious incident, to a CSV file.
- Opening the CSV file: The victim needs to open the exported CSV file using an application like Excel that interprets formulas and will execute the injected payload

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to have an account on the Atlos platform.
- Project access: The attacker needs permission to create or modify incidents within a project.
- No special privilege: The vulnerability can be exploited by any authenticated user, not requiring elevated privileges.

**Additional Details:**

- The Proof of Concept (PoC) provides an example payload `=10+20+cmd|' /C calc'!A0` to inject into the "Description" field.
- The content specifies that Atlos version 1.0 is affected.
