**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A mass assignment vulnerability exists in the netmaker application. This allows a non-admin user to modify parameters they shouldn't have access to.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Mass Assignment: The application allows modification of user roles via parameters that should only be accessible to administrators. This allows a non-admin user to elevate their privileges.
