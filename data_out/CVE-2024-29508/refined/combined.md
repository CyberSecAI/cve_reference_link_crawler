| [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=707510#c1)  Ken Sharp    2024-01-24 16:36:24 UTC  ``` (In reply to Thomas Rinsma from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=707510#c0))  > Hi, a few friends and I found several vulnerabilities in Ghostscript. > Hopefully it’s alright to combine vulnerabilities like this in one report, > if you’d rather have them separated let me know.  Not to worry for this report, but in future we'd really prefer one report per bug. It makes it much easier to divide up assignments between developers, makes sure we don't miss a part of the report, and generally makes the whole thing easier to manage. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=707510#c2)  Ken Sharp    2024-01-24 16:59:48 UTC  ``` A couple of points in passing (again for future reports); we need a command line to demonstrate the problem, you haven't supplied a command line for any of these.   At least the first of the PostScript files, as supplied, can't reach the point of causing a problem because it opens a file on disk and writes to it, which immediately fails unless -dNOSAFER is set or read+write permission is granted for that specific file.  It would be better simply to provide the PDF file, rather than have a PostScript file write it, because file systems differ. Even with permissions granted to it, that PostScript file won't run on my system because it isn't able to open the directory (/tmp doesn't exist). I've had to modify the file to make it exhibit here.  Yes, I'm aware that means I'll have to modify the PostScript program to point to the PDF file, but I'd prefer to do that than have random PostScript programs writing to my file system, that's what SAFER is all about after all. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=707510#c3)  Thomas Rinsma    2024-01-24 17:19:10 UTC  ``` > Not to worry for this report, but in future we'd really prefer one report per bug.  Thanks, noted.  > we need a command line to demonstrate the problem, you haven't supplied a command line for any of these.  My apologies. My underlying assumption for all of these is a regular invocation of ghostscript (i.e. with -dSAFER) without any specific flags.   > Yes, I'm aware that means I'll have to modify the PostScript program to point > to the PDF file, but I'd prefer to do that than have random PostScript > programs writing to my file system, that's what SAFER is all about after all.  I may be misunderstanding, but I thought the "temp" directory (/tmp/ on Linux) is intentionally always R+W allowed with a wildcart. I did not need to modify the allowed paths list for these examples to work on my machine.  For at least the buffer overflows I suppose it would even be possible to do this without a wildcart allowed folder like /tmp/, but using %mem% and .PDFStream instead (but I did not test this).  > It would be better simply to provide the PDF file, rather than have a PostScript file write it,  The reason for doing it this way, is that the command line arguments do not need to be under attacker control, but only the contents of the input file. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=707510#c4)  Ken Sharp    2024-01-24 18:42:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to Thomas Rinsma from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=707510#c3))  > > Yes, I'm aware that means I'll have to modify the PostScript program to point > > to the PDF file, but I'd prefer to do that than have random PostScript > > programs writing to my file system, that's what SAFER is all about after all. >  > I may be misunderstanding, but I thought the "temp" directory (/tmp/ on > Linux) is intentionally always R+W allowed with a wildcart. I did not need > to modify the allowed paths list for these examples to work on my machine.  I'm not on Linux.....  If that's the temp directory then yes it is permitted, but its not the temp directory on my OS (obviously, since it doesn't exist).  Note that your PoC would therefore only work on Linux. On Windows it throws an invalidfileaccess error.   > For at least the buffer overflows I suppose it would even be possible to do > this without a wildcart allowed folder like /tmp/, but using %mem% and > .PDFStream instead (but I did not test this).  You could use the ram file system %ramfs%. I believe that's always read/write (I ought to check that....)   > The reason for doing it this way, is that the command line arguments do not > need to be under attacker control, but only the contents of the input file.  See above.  But fundamentally I just want a way I can reproduce the problem, and for me that's easiest by simply supplying the PDF file. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=707510#c5)  Thomas Rinsma    2024-01-24 19:08:52 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 25256](attachment.cgi?id=25256) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=25256&action=edit) PDF files ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=707510#c6)  Thomas Rinsma    2024-01-24 19:09:49 UTC  ``` > I'm not on Linux.....  > Note that your PoC would therefore only work on Linux. > On Windows it throws an invalidfileaccess error.  I understand! Just giving an example of my system, hence why I specified it as the general "temp" directory. From the code (gs_init.ps) it looks like this is the default/fallback if the system does not specify another directory:  ``` /tempfilepaths [   (TMPDIR) getenv not   {     (TEMP) getenv not     {       (TMP) getenv not       {         (/temp) (/tmp)       } if     } if   } if ] def ```  > But fundamentally I just want a way I can reproduce the problem, > and for me that's easiest by simply supplying the PDF file.  Understood! If your system has an equivalent temp directory then it would be a matter of modifying the path accordingly. If it does not then the best approach would probably be to simulate one by adding a R+W path that you can write to, to the allowlist.  I don't think it's possible to PoC vulnerability (1) using just the command-line, as it requires a string with a null-byte in the middle.  For (2), I've attached the PDF by itself. You can trigger this one using `-dPDFDEBUG`.  For (3) I don't think it's possible using the command-line as it would become too long (at least on my system).  For (4) I've attached the PDF. You can run it with `-dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=out.pdf` and manually see the pointer in the output file.  As for (5), this one relies on being able to create at least the configuration file, so it would require an R+W-allowed directory similarly to (1). ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=707510#c7)  Ken Sharp    2024-01-25 08:08:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to Thomas Rinsma from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=707510#c6))  I don't really want this to spiral onwards, because (if nothing else) it sounds like I'm being unreasonably critical, and I really don't want to discourage anyone from reporting bugs.  But....  > I don't think it's possible to PoC vulnerability (1) using just the > command-line, as it requires a string with a null-byte in the middle.  You can put arbitrary PostScript on the command line too, using -c and -f    > For (2), I've attached the PDF by itself.

Here you can use the @file syntax to have a file which contains a command line that would otherwise be too long for the shell.    > For (4) I've attached the PDF.

Again, I'm not totally worried by having to create files, though it would be useful to be warned that's the case; otherwise I just get an 'invalidfileaccess' error and have to go looking to see if that means the problem is already fixed or the PoC needs adjusting.  Simply saying that, where possible, it is easier for me at least if we can just have the file causing the problem and a command line, rather than a carefully crafted PostScript file to demonstrate that you don't need to control the command line, we're prepared to take that on trust. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=707510#c8)  Thomas Rinsma    2024-01-25 10:21:56 UTC  ``` > Simply saying that, where possible, it is easier for me at least if we can > just have the file causing the problem and a command line, rather than a > carefully crafted PostScript file to demonstrate that you don't need to > control the command line, we're prepared to take that on trust.  In my mind the command line (i.e. lack of extra flags) is really part of the problem, as it shows the control an attacker has on a vanilla system with just control over the input file, that is the concept that these proofs-of-concept prove. The threat model is a headless (I suppose usually Linux-)system that uses Ghostscript for file conversion.  > Again, I'm not totally worried by having to create files, > though it would be useful to be warned that's the case;  Apologies, I thought it would be clear from the descriptions and PoCs. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=707510#c9)  Thomas Rinsma    2024-01-25 11:00:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 25271](attachment.cgi?id=25271) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=25271&action=edit) In-memory / tempfile versions of PoCs 1-4 ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=707510#c10)  Thomas Rinsma    2024-01-25 11:01:15 UTC  ``` Latest attachment is a set of PoCs for vulnerabilities 1-4 that only use `%ram%` and `tempfile`.

I really didn't mean for you to go to this effort with this report, my comments were intended only as guidance for future reports (and for others should they read this).

Might be, I'm not at all sure how that is supposed to work and as I said, I can't test it.  But if so presumably it fails and we will just use the supplied password. ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=707510#c15)  Chris Liddell (chrisl)    2024-01-25 15:33:56 UTC  ``` Issue 3 is addressed in: <https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=commitdiff;h=7745dbe24514>   Issue 5 addressed in: <https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=commitdiff;h=3d4cfdc1a44>   I believe that covers all the issues in this report.

We generally only request CVEs ourselves if there's something dramatic needing fixing that we would plan on doing an out of band release for (partly to have a pointy stick to poke customers with, so they upgrade).  I wasn't planning on a patch release myself, don't know how Chris feels about it. The next scheduled release is in March anyway.  Given the proximity of the next release we'd probably prefer not to make a public disclosure just yet, as that would force us into making a patch release. We're probably looking at something like 6 weeks before the next release should be out.  And yeah, I know making commits to the Git repository is, in a sense, already public. That's a problem we haven't got a good answer for yet. We don't really want to try and maintain a private repository at the same time.   There are a number of package maintainers automagically CC'ed on security bug reports (you may be able to view the CC list, I'm not certain), so those maintainers are aware and can port/backport these commits as they feel appropriate.  And to echo Chris, thanks for making the report. However curmudgeonly I may sound, we really do appreciate these! ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=707510#c18)  Thomas Rinsma    2024-01-26 08:19:55 UTC  ``` (In reply to Ken Sharp from [comment #17](show_bug.cgi?id=707510#c17))  > We generally only request CVEs ourselves if there's something dramatic > needing fixing that we would plan on doing an out of band release for > (partly to have a pointy stick to poke customers with, so they upgrade).  I understand the approach, but in my opinion this case warrants the patch release. I work at a small security lab and by chance we have two clients right now that are seriously affected by this (respectively using Imagemagick and Libreoffice for file conversion on web platforms). The file read/write would be a high severity issue for both. Based on this I expect there will be many others out there.  I would feel quite uncomfortable with this being out there for two months, especially with these public fixes.  > And to echo Chris, thanks for making the report. However curmudgeonly I may > sound, we really do appreciate these!  Happy to help, and all good! I understand the importance of a reproducible report :) ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=707510#c19)  Thomas Rinsma    2024-02-05 15:35:42 UTC  ``` Any updates on the decision regarding a patch release? If needed, we can help get the CVEs requested.  I would strongly advocate for publicly classifying these issues as security issues (with the associated severity) such that users are aware and can prioritize updating. Again, the overall impact is quite high as many document/image conversion platforms are likely vulnerable (think Google Docs, Slack, etc). ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=707510#c20)  Thomas Rinsma    2024-03-15 12:00:52 UTC  ``` For your information, we have requested CVEs for these vulnerabilities. ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=707510#c21)  Thomas Rinsma    2024-03-24 13:29:06 UTC  ``` CVEs have been assigned as follows (numbering from the initial report):  1 - CVE-2024-29509 2 - CVE-2024-29506 3 - CVE-2024-29507 4 - CVE-2024-29508 5 - CVE-2024-29511  Would you be able to indicate these somewhere or make this ticket public, such that people can cross-reference the issues with the fixes? ``` |  |

Subject: Re: Ghostscript 10.03.1 (2024-05-02) fixed 5 CVEs including
 CVE-2024-33871 arbitrary code execution

Hi,

Per Solar's request, here is some information on recent Ghostscript
bugs. They have all been fixed upstream already for either ~1 month
(10.03.1) or ~4 months (10.03.0). It looks like patches have also landed
in most distros, but there is not a super clear changelog or version
history so this might help clarify things.

Note that this is just a subset of all vulnerabilities fixed in 10.03.0
and 10.03.1: these are just the bugs I myself found and reported.

# CVE-2024-29509 - heap buffer overflow via the PDFPassword parameter

The `runpdf` command (and friends) allows the new C-based PDF
interpreter to be invoked from within PS. With this, we can pass various
flags and arguments (see `pdf_impl_set_param`) that are normally passed
via the command-line when the PDF interpreter is invoked directly.

It turns out that validation of several of these parameters is flawed,
maybe because they were considered somewhat "trusted", being
command-line arguments originally.

The fields `ctx->encryption.Password` and `ctx->encryption.PasswordLen`
are set based on the value of `PDFPassword`. During the decryption
process, in `check_password_R5`  in `pdf_sec.c`, a buffer is allocated
based on the string-length of this field:

```
code = pdfi_object_alloc(ctx, PDF_STRING,
strlen(ctx->encryption.Password), (pdf_obj **)&P);
```

However, a `memcpy` later copies the full length of the PS-supplied
object into this buffer:

```
memcpy(P->data, Password, PasswordLen);
```

Because PS-strings are not null-terminated, this will result in a heap
buffer overflow when a value of `PDFPassword` is supplied with a null
byte in the middle. For example, the following will result in a `memcpy`
of 7 bytes into a buffer of size 3:

```
/PDFPassword (foo\000bar) def
```

This bug was fixed in 10.03.0 (2024-03-06), and is bug (1) in this
report: <https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=707510>

# CVE-2024-29506 - stack buffer overflow in pdfi_apply_filter()

The `PDFDEBUG` flag controls the value of `ctx->args.debug`. In
`pdfi_apply_filter` this enables execution of a `memcpy` into a stack
buffer, without bounds checks. The input (`n->data`, the PDF filter
name) is an attacker controlled buffer of arbitrary size. A filter name
larger than 100 will overflow the `str` buffer.

```
if (ctx->args.pdfdebug)
     {
         char str[100];
         memcpy(str, (const char *)n->data, n->length);
         str[n->length] = '\0';
         dmprintf1(ctx->memory, "FILTER NAME:%s\n", str);
     }
```

This bug was also fixed in 10.03.0 (2024-03-06), and is bug (2) in this
report: <https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=707510>

# CVE-2024-29507 - stack buffer overflow via CIDFSubstPath/Font params

Under specific conditions, the `cidfsubstpath` and `cidfsubstfont`
parameters (set by corresponding Postscript objects) are used to load
substitute fonts (this is in `pdfi_open_CIDFont_substitute_file`). The
values are `memcpy`d into the `fontfname` buffer without bounds checks.
Hence, an attacker can pass values larger than the buffer size to
trigger a stack buffer overflow.

```
char fontfname[gp_file_name_sizeof]; // 4096

// .. <snip> ...

if (ctx->args.cidfsubstpath.data == NULL) {
     memcpy(fontfname, fsprefix, fsprefixlen);
}
else {
     memcpy(fontfname, ctx->args.cidfsubstpath.data,
ctx->args.cidfsubstpath.size);
     fsprefixlen = ctx->args.cidfsubstpath.size;
}

if (ctx->args.cidfsubstfont.data == NULL) {
     // ... <snip> ...
}
else {
     memcpy(fontfname, ctx->args.cidfsubstfont.data,
ctx->args.cidfsubstfont.size);
     defcidfallacklen = ctx->args.cidfsubstfont.size;
}
```

This bug was also fixed in 10.03.0 (2024-03-06), and is bug (3) in this
report: <https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=707510>

# CVE-2024-29508 - heap pointer leak in pdf_base_font_alloc()

The function `pdf_base_font_alloc` used by the `pdfwrite` device will
use a hexadecimal pointer representation (`".F" PRI_INTPTR`) for the
constructed BaseFont name if the input name is empty:

```
if (pfname->size > 0) {
     font_name.data = pfname->chars;
     font_name.size = pfname->size;
     while (pdf_has_subset_prefix(font_name.data, font_name.size)) {
         /* Strip off an existing subset prefix. */
         font_name.data += SUBSET_PREFIX_SIZE;
         font_name.size -= SUBSET_PREFIX_SIZE;
     }
} else {
     gs_snprintf(fnbuf, sizeof(fnbuf), ".F" PRI_INTPTR, (intptr_t)copied);
     font_name.data = (byte *)fnbuf;
     font_name.size = strlen(fnbuf);
}
```

Resulting in, for example:

```
<</BaseFont/YZKFTQ+.F0x5618b147e378/FontDescriptor 8 0 R/ToUnicode 11 0
R/Type/Font ...
```

An attacker can obtain this pointer value by reading back the output
file (after writing to a temporary writable and readable location).

This bug (and various other pointer leaks) were fixed in 10.03.0
(2024-03-06), and is bug (4) in this report:
<https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=707510>

# CVE-2024-29511 - arbitrary file read/write through Tesseract config

The `ocr` family of devices invoke Tesseract to perform OCR operations.
The device parameter `OCRLanguage` is used by Tesseract to load a data
file for that specific language. Specifically, such a file is loaded
from `./<OCRLanguage>.traineddata`. By using a path traversal to
`/tmp/`, we can force Tesseract to load our own data file:

```
mark
/OutputFile (/tmp/notused)
/OCRLanguage (../../../../../tmp/test) % loads /tmp/test.traineddata
/OutputDevice /ocr
.dicttomark
setpagedevice
```

As it turns out, Tesseract `traineddata` files can include various
configuration values, including `user_patterns_file` which will try to
load patterns from the given path, and `debug_file` which will write
debug information to the given path. The debug information is quite
verbose, and will print full input lines if they don’t start with a
valid character in the trained language. By constructing our "language"
such that no character is valid, all lines in the pattern file are
printed. For example, the configuration settings:

```
debug_file /tmp/out
user_patterns_file /etc/passwd
```

will result in a file `/tmp/out` containing:

```
Error: failed to insert pattern 'root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash'
Error: failed to insert pattern
'daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin'
Error: failed to insert pattern 'bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin'
Error: failed to insert pattern 'sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin'
Error: failed to insert pattern 'sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync'
<etc>
```

In Postscript we can:

1. Construct the traineddata file under `/tmp/`
2. Use path traversal in `OCRLanguage` to load it when initializing the
`ocr` device
3. Read the resulting output data in `/tmp/out`

This allows us to read arbitrary files outside of the SAFER sandbox, and
write to arbitrary file paths, although during writing, every line will
start with `Error: failed to insert pattern '` and end with `'`.

Note that this is the Tesseract/OCR-related bug that was referred to by
the Ghostscript changelog (and quoted earlier in this thread). Contrary
to what is stated in the changelog it does not lead to RCE by itself,
just file read/write. It also requires Ghostscript to be compiled with
Tesseract support.

# CVE-2024-29510 - format string injection in uniprint device

The `uniprint` device allows the user to provide various string
fragments as device options, which are later appended to the output
file. Two of these parameters, `upWriteComponentCommands` and
`upYMoveCommand`, are actually treated as format strings, specifically
for `gp_fprintf` and `gs_snprintf`. For these, the intention is for the
user to include just one format specifier in the string, but there is no
logic preventing arbitrary format strings (with multiple specifiers)
from being used.

With full control over the format string (by setting a page device with
the respective options), and read access to the device output (by
setting it to a temporary file path), an attacker can abuse this to leak
data from the stack and perform memory corruption. This is specifically
impactful in the cases of `gs_snprintf` (as opposed to `gp_fprintf`), as
its format-string parsing logic is not hardened by compiler measures
like `D_FORTIFY_SOURCE`, while it still supports the `%n` modifier.

Bug report and public blog post with more details and PoC leading to a
SAFER sandbox bypass:
