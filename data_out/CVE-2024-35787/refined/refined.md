Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2024-35787.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect usage of `sb_index` in the Linux kernel's `md-bitmap` driver for clustered-md configurations. Specifically, after commit d7038f951828 removed `page->index` from bitmap code, the logic for clustered-md was not updated to correctly account for slot offsets. This resulted in the code not setting the slot offset for cluster nodes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect offset calculation when setting or clearing bits in the bitmap file in a clustered md environment.
- Missing addition of `store->sb_index` when calculating the page index leading to incorrect bitmap manipulation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The incorrect offset calculation could lead to a crash in clustered environments. This is evidenced by a partial call trace that includes `md_bitmap_file_set_bit`, `md_bitmap_startwrite`, `raid1_make_request`, `md_handle_request`, and other related functions, indicating a potential kernel panic or unexpected behavior during bitmap operations.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by operations that require the setting or clearing of bits in the bitmap file within a clustered md configuration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to trigger operations that modify the bitmap in a clustered MD setup. This is likely to be triggered during standard I/O operations on an MD array with a bitmap.
