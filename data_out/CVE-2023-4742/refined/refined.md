Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input within the `export&uid=X` parameter. Specifically, the `uid` parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without adequate neutralization of special characters or elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The core weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability (CWE-89). The application fails to sanitize user input provided via the `uid` parameter before embedding it in a database query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Integrity Violation:** Malicious SQL statements can be used to modify or delete existing data.
*   **Availability Disruption:** By injecting specific queries, an attacker can potentially disrupt the applicationâ€™s database operations, leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through the HTTP request parameter `uid` in the URL `?r=dashboard/user/export&uid=X`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No special privileges or access to internal systems are required to exploit this.
*   The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable URL structure or be able to find it

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists within the `exportUser` function, which subsequently calls `fetchAllByUids` and `wrapUserInfo` methods where the SQL query is executed.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit is publicly available.
*   The vendor has not responded to the disclosure.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 according to NVD and 6.3 according to VulDB.
