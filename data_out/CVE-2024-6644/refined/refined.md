Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The application uses `AviatorEvaluator` to execute user-provided expressions without any security policies. This allows for direct execution of arbitrary AviatorScript, which can invoke static methods by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **AviatorScript Injection:**  The core vulnerability lies in the ability to inject malicious AviatorScript code into the expression evaluation mechanism.
- **Lack of Security Policies:** The `AviatorEvaluator` is used without any configured security policies, which should restrict the capabilities of the evaluated scripts.
- **Arbitrary Static Method Execution:** AviatorScript's default behavior of allowing static method execution enables attackers to leverage available classes and methods to execute malicious code on the server.
- **Unrestricted Class Loading:** The vulnerability utilizes `ClassUtils.getDefaultClassLoader()` and `ReflectUtils.defineClass` to load and define new classes from base64 encoded bytecode. This bypasses restrictions on using classes and allows execution of arbitrary bytecode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially allowing an attacker to gain complete control of the system. In the provided example, a calculator is launched on the server to demonstrate the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **API Endpoints:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted POST requests to specific API endpoints. These endpoints include:
    - `/api/alert/define` to define threshold triggering expressions containing malicious AviatorScript.
    - `/api/monitor` to add website monitoring which triggers the crafted expressions in a later stage.
- **HTTP Requests:** Attackers send specially crafted HTTP requests to the API endpoints, including malicious AviatorScript within the JSON body of these requests.
- **User Input:** The application processes user-supplied expressions without proper sanitization or security restrictions when defining alert thresholds and monitoring rules.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application's API endpoints.
- **Authentication/Authorization:** The attacker needs valid authentication/authorization tokens to access the vulnerable endpoints, as demonstrated through the use of `Admin-Token` and `Authorization` headers in the provided examples.
- **Understanding of API:** The attacker needs knowledge of the application's API to target the vulnerable endpoints, such as `/api/alert/define` and `/api/monitor`.
- **Crafted AviatorScript:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious AviatorScript payloads that can exploit the lack of security controls on the `AviatorEvaluator`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit steps show how to use `org.springframework.util.ClassUtils` and `org.springframework.cglib.core.ReflectUtils` to define new classes from base64 encoded bytecode, allowing for more flexible exploitation.
- The provided exploit includes the use of base64 encoded Java bytecode that when executed by the defined class loads and executes a system command.

The vulnerability is present in versions up to and including 0.1.0 of the zmops ArgusDBM application.
