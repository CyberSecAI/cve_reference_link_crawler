Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Broken Access Control, specifically the absence of proper authorization checks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An unprivileged user could perform actions that require higher privileges. The specific impact is described as varying case by case, but the overall severity is considered low.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector would involve an attacker exploiting the missing access control check to perform unauthorized actions.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to be an unprivileged user with access to the affected function. The specific required privilege is stated to be "Contributor".
