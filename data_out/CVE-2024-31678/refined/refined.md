Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient protection of the `password` parameter in the `login.php` file of the Loan Management System. This lack of protection allows for the injection of malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The `password` parameter is not properly sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful SQL injection can allow an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application.
- **Sensitive Data Extraction:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, personal details, or financial records.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network by sending a crafted POST request to the `login.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter (i.e., "password") and the structure of the login form.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Loan Management System OOP in PHP with MySQLi/jQuery Free Source Code V1.0.
- The vulnerable file is `login.php`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `password`.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates both boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
- The SQLMap tool and Burp Suite are used to demonstrate the exploit.
- Example payloads include:
  - `username=admin&password=admin111' OR NOT 5946=5946#&login=` (boolean-based)
  - `username=admin&password=admin111' AND (SELECT 2451 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))FOOe)-- lCKh&login=` (time-based)
