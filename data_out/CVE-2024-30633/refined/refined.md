- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow in the `formWifiBasicSet` function of the Tenda FH1205 router firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the usage of `strcpy` to copy user-provided input (`security` parameter) into a fixed-size buffer `v33` of 256 bytes without any bounds checking.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By sending a POST request with a `security` parameter exceeding 256 bytes, an attacker can overwrite the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/WifiBasicSet` endpoint. The `security` parameter in the POST data is used as input to the vulnerable `strcpy` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router, typically requiring network access to the device.
