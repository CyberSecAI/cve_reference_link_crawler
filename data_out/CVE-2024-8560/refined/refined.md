Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `save_invoice.php` file of the SourceCodester Simple Invoice Generator System 1.0. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via multiple parameters within the `/php-invoice/save_invoice.php` endpoint. Specifically, the `invoice_code`, `customer`, `cashier`, `total_amount`, `discount_percentage`, `discount_amount`, and `tendered_amount` parameters are all vulnerable.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The system fails to sanitize or parameterize the input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Query Execution:** A malicious user can execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could lead to various impacts, including:
    *   **Data Breach:** Accessing sensitive data such as user information, financial records, etc.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data within the database.
    *   **Database takeover:** In some configurations, it might be possible to gain control over the database server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability can be exploited by intercepting and modifying the POST request to `/php-invoice/save_invoice.php` using a proxy tool like Burp Suite.
*   **Parameter Injection:** Malicious SQL code is injected into the vulnerable parameters (`invoice_code`, `customer`, `cashier`, etc.) within the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application server.
*   **Basic Understanding of Web Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP POST requests.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft effective injection payloads.
*   **Application Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the invoicing functionality, typically by being a logged-in cashier.

**Technical details and descriptions:**

*   The report includes specific examples of payloads used to trigger the vulnerability, including boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.

    *   Boolean-based blind SQL injection payload example (using EXTRACTVALUE):
        ```
        cashier=Cashier 1' AND EXTRACTVALUE(9612,CASE WHEN (9612=9612) THEN 9612 ELSE 0x3A END)-- rTeI
        ```
    *   Error-based SQL injection payload example (using GTID\_SUBSET):
        ```
        cashier=Cashier 1' OR GTID_SUBSET(CONCAT(0x717a716a71,(SELECT (ELT(6679=6679,1))),0x7162786a71),6679)-- laEK
        ```
    *    Time-based blind SQL injection payload example (using SLEEP):
        ```
         cashier=Cashier 1' OR (SELECT 7314 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))EMDB)-- ndpB
        ```

*   The report also indicates that the SQL injection can be triggered using various parameters like `invoice_code`, `customer`, `cashier`, `total_amount`, `discount_percentage`, `discount_amount`, and `tendered_amount`.

*   The vulnerability was successfully tested using `sqlmap`.
