- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Side Menu Lite plugin versions <= 4.0 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:**  A malicious actor can craft a request that forces a logged-in user to perform unwanted actions. This usually involves tricking the user to click a link or visit a malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into performing an action. The user must have the privileges needed to execute the action. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated, but rather be able to get an authenticated user to perform an action on their behalf.
