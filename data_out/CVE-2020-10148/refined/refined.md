Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10148:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the SolarWinds Orion API, specifically how it handles the `Request.PathInfo` portion of a URI request. By appending specific parameters to the `PathInfo`, the application incorrectly sets the `SkipAuthorization` flag, leading to an authentication bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass API authentication.
- **Improper Input Handling:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the `PathInfo` parameter.
- **Incorrect Authorization Logic:** The application sets the `SkipAuthorization` flag based on the `PathInfo` parameter, which allows requests to be processed without authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute API commands without authentication.
- **Compromise of SolarWinds Instance:** This can result in the complete compromise of the SolarWinds Orion instance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
- **HTTP Requests:** The attack is carried out through crafted HTTP requests to the SolarWinds Orion server.
- **URI Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `PathInfo` portion of the URI to include specific parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable SolarWinds Orion server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker must know the specific `PathInfo` parameters (`WebResource.axd`, `ScriptResource.axd`, `i18n.ashx`, or `Skipi18n`) that trigger the vulnerability.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests with the malicious `PathInfo` parameters.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was exploited to deploy the SUPERNOVA malware.
- The provided documents include details for mitigation, including software updates and IIS server hardening.
- A Python script (`swcheck.py`) is available to help identify vulnerable SolarWinds Orion servers.
- The content indicates that the vulnerability exists in multiple versions of the Orion platform and lists specific vulnerable and patched versions.
