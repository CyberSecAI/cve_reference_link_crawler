- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `formWlanMP` function in the `webs` binary directly incorporates POST parameters into a system call without proper sanitization or filtering.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the router.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/goform/formWlanMP` with malicious commands in the `ateFunc` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface and must authenticate with valid credentials.
