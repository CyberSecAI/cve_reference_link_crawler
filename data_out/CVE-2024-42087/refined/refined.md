{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `ilitek-ili9881c` panel driver was using the non-sleeping `gpiod_set_value()` function to control the reset GPIO. This is problematic when the GPIO controller needs to sleep, leading to warnings.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect usage of GPIO control function (`gpiod_set_value`) in a context where the GPIO controller may need to sleep."
    ],
    "impact": "The primary impact is warnings being generated when the GPIO controller needs to sleep.",
    "attack_vectors": "Not directly exploitable. The issue manifests as a warning rather than a security vulnerability. ",
    "required_capabilities": "Not applicable as it is a bug that doesn't involve malicious exploitation."
  },
  "resolution": {
        "fix": "The fix involves replacing `gpiod_set_value()` with `gpiod_set_value_cansleep()` in the `ili9881c_prepare` and `ili9881c_unprepare` functions.",
        "details": "The patch modifies the driver to use the `gpiod_set_value_cansleep()` function, which allows the GPIO controller to sleep as needed and resolves the warnings. The changes are limited to the driver file `drivers/gpu/drm/panel/panel-ilitek-ili9881c.c`"
