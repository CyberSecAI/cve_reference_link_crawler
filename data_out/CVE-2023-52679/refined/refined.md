      "content": "The vulnerability is a double free in the `of_parse_phandle_with_args_map()` function within the Linux kernel's device tree handling. The inner loop of this function iterates through map entries and calls `of_node_put(new)` to release the reference acquired in the previous iteration. However, this operation incorrectly assumes that the 'new' variable is always NULL on the first iteration of the inner loop.  This assumption is not guaranteed, and a double free can occur if 'new' is not NULL. The fix ensures 'new' is set to NULL after its value is assigned to 'cur' in the outer loop.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect handling of node references during device tree parsing, specifically in how `of_parse_phandle_with_args_map()` manages the 'new' variable in nested loops.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Double free vulnerability due to incorrect reference counting.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**  A double free can lead to memory corruption, which could cause a kernel crash, denial of service or potentially be exploited for privilege escalation.\n\n**Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a specially crafted device tree. The device tree is an input to the Linux kernel, making this a potentially local privilege escalation issue.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to supply or have influence over the device tree being parsed by the kernel and cause the vulnerable code to execute."
