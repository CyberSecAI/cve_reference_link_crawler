- **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The web server backend uses a static string to seed the Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in OpenSSL for TLS.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Weak PRNG seeding leading to predictable keys.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** Information disclosure and man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks.
- **Attack Vectors:** Exploiting the web interface of the router.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
