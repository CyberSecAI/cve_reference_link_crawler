# (CVE-2023-32636) fuzz\_variant\_text: Timeout in fuzz\_variant\_text

New oss-fuzz issue: <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=54314>

It’s a slowness in printing large tuples due to the new extra checks for offset table validity.

I’ve got a fix locally which I’ll attach shortly.
