- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The OpenObserve platform does not sanitize user input in the filter selection menu of dashboards, allowing for stored XSS. This is combined with insecure authentication handling, where the user's username and password are stored as a base64 encoded string in local storage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Stored XSS vulnerability in the dashboard filter selection menu.
  - Insecure storage of user credentials (username and password) in local storage as a base64 encoded string.
  - Lack of sanitization of user input in specific areas of the front end, despite the usage of `DOMPurify` or Vue templating for XSS protection in other areas.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - Complete account takeover by retrieving a user's username and password from local storage.
  - Malicious users could lock legitimate users out of the platform by changing their passwords.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - A malicious user can inject malicious JavaScript code through log data uploaded to the OpenObserve platform.
  - The XSS is triggered when a user opens the filter dropdown in the dashboard panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - Ability to upload log data to an OpenObserve instance. This could be achieved with or without authentication if the application logs data into OpenObserve instance.
  - No special privileges are required to inject the malicious code, only the ability to submit log data.
  - User interaction is required for the exploitation to occur (i.e. a user has to open the dashboard and interact with the filter dropdown).
