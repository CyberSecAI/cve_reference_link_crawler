# Misconfigured HTTP headers allowing stored XSS execution

## Description

### Impact

Kiwi TCMS allows users to upload attachments to test plans, test cases, etc. Earlier versions of Kiwi TCMS had introduced

changes which were meant to serve all uploaded files as plain text in order to prevent browsers from executing potentially dangerous files when such files are accessed directly!

The previous Nginx configuration was incorrect allowing certain browsers like Firefox to ignore the `Content-Type: text/plain` header on some occasions thus allowing potentially dangerous scripts to be executed.

Additionally file upload validators and parts of the HTML rendering code have been found to require additional sanitation and improvements.

### Patches

* Updated Nginx content type configuration
* Improved file upload validation code to prevent more potentially dangerous uploads
* Sanitization of test plan names used in the `tree_view_html()` function

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
