Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2023-2544
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to an authorization bypass through a user-controlled key. Specifically, the `pdf_curri_new.php` component in the UPV PEIX application does not properly validate user access, which allows a malicious actor to access the stored information of other users.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Authorization Bypass:**  The application fails to properly restrict access based on user roles or permissions, allowing an authenticated user to bypass authorization checks.
    *   **User-Controlled Key:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the 'id' parameter of a `POST` request, which is directly used to retrieve user information.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can gain access to the personal information of other users registered within the system. While the provided description mentions the exposure of all stored information, the CVSS vector indicates only a low impact on confidentiality (C:L). There is no impact on integrity (I:N) or availability (A:N).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, as indicated by the CVSS vector component 'AV:N'.
    *   **POST Request:** The attack is performed via a crafted `POST` request to the vulnerable component (`pdf_curri_new.php`).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the UPV PEIX system.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to interact with the web application.
*   **Additional Information:**
    *   **Affected Component:** `pdf_curri_new.php`
    *   **Vulnerability Type:** CWE-639: Authorization bypass through user-controlled key.
    *   **CVSS Score:** 5.3 (Medium)
    *   **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
    *   **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed in August 2022.
    *   **System:** UPV PEIX, an internship management system at the School of Computer Engineering of the Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV).
