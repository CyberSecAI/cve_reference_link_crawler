## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Slider by 10Web < 1.2.57 - Editor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape its Slider Title, which could allow high privilege users such as editors and above to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered\_html is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

Add/Edit a Slider and put the following payload in the Slider Title and save: Test" onmouseover=alert(/XSS/)//
The XSS will be triggered when moving the mouse over the thumbnail in the Slider table (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=sliders\_wds)

### Affects Plugins
