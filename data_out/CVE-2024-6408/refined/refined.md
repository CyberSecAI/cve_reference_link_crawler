- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the Slider Title.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  High privilege users (editors and above) can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers.
- **Attack vectors:** By adding or editing a slider and placing a malicious payload in the Slider Title field. The XSS will trigger when a user hovers the mouse over the slider thumbnail in the Slider table.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user with editor or higher privileges within the WordPress site.
