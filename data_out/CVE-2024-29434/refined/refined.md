- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The system image upload interface in Alldata v0.4.6 allows attackers to perform directory traversal during file uploads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory Traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can potentially overwrite or access files outside the intended upload directory, leading to arbitrary file writes or reads.
- **Attack vectors:**  Uploading a file through the system image upload interface with a crafted filename containing directory traversal sequences like `../`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the system image upload interface of the Alldata application.
