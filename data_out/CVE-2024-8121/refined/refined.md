  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to a missing capability check on the `wpext_change_admin_name()` function within the 'The Ultimate WordPress Toolkit â€“ WP Extended' plugin.

      "Missing Authorization",
       "Improper Access Control"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated attacker with subscriber-level access or higher can change an admin's username, potentially leading to account takeover or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user (subscriber or higher) on the target WordPress site.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have an account on the vulnerable WordPress instance with at least subscriber-level privileges. No other special capabilities are required beyond that."
