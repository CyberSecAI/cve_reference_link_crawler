{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The driver has a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the IOCTL handler for 0x40002008.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack, potentially gaining control of the execution flow.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted IOCTL request with a specific payload to the vulnerable driver.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to have a handle to the device driver, which may require elevated privileges depending on the configuration of the system."
