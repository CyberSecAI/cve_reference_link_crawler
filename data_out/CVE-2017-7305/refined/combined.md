# Riverbed RiOS insecure cryptographic storage (CVE-2017-5670)

## Description

Riverbed Steelhead hardware appliances are used to optimize and
accelerate network traffic.
There can be implemented as TLS endpoints, so they have a secure vault
aimed to store private TLS certificates for servers.
The secure vault has FIPS mode support.

## Improper encryption implementation

The secure vault used on the Steelhead appliance (and potentially other
that we could not test) is not efficient in its default form, because of
the lack of boot loader security.

**Threat**

An adversary can boot an appliance and recover all private keys of the
server certificates that are configured on it. It may happen in various
situation (subcontractors, hardware decommissioning, etc.).

**Expectation**

With proper encryption (FDE) and sanitization procedures, certificates
should be unrecoverable, as quoted from the documentation:

```
> ```
> Since the information is only in memory, when an appliance is rebooted
>
> ```

```
or powered off, the information is no longer available".

**CVE ID**: CVE-2017-5670

**Access Vector**: local

**Security Risk**: medium

**Vulnerability**: CWE-310, CWE-321

**CVSS Base Score**: 7.1

**CVSS Vector**: CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L

### Defeating system encryption with anonymous console access

We followed the steps below to take over the appliance and recover
private keys from the file system, with zero knowledge of the appliance
and its configuration :

**1/** Connect to the appliance in RS232.

**2/** Turn on the appliance and edit the Grub line to boot in `single` mode

**3/** Proceed with the boot to get the root shell. But at this stage,
vault decryption has not happened yet.

**4/** Reset the *admin* password, which can be achieved with the
`/sbin/resetpw.sh` script.

**5/** Modify the firmware to replace `/opt/tms/bin/cli` with `bash` :

```
# mount / -o remount, rw
# cd /opt/tms/bin/
# mv cli cli.bask
# cp /bin/bash cli
# reboot
```

**5/** Reboot to now get a full admin access with a `bash` shell.

**6/** Use the `mount` command to confirm that decryption has happened:

```
# mount
encfs on /var/opt/rbt/decrypted type fuse.encfs
(rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=0)
# ls /var/opt/rbt/decrypted
available framework notes ssl tmp
```

**7/** Now insert an USB key and retrieve the whole vault. Note that
non-exportable certificates can be extracted without any issue (from
`./decrypted/server_certs/names/NOExportableCA/`).
The exportation is only based on a local file that acts as a flag:

```
# cat /var/opt/rbt/decrypted/server_certs/names/NOExportableCA/exportable
false
```

**8/** Note that encryption is made by the `/sbin/secure_vault.sh`
script, which makes EncFS encryption based on fixed and hard-coded keys:

```
[...]
MAGIC_STRING='This ********* motorcycle'
[...]
PASSWORD="${MAGIC_STRING}_{SERIAL_NUM}
[...]
```

So the passphrase is basically a concatenation of a constant magic
string and the appliance serial number, two pieces of information that
an attacker can easily retrieve.

```
> ```
> With this knowledge, it is trivial to reproduce the decryption on any
>
> ```

```
Linux computer with EncFS. Thus, it is actually not necessary anymore to
root the appliance to decrypt data, the disk content could be copied
offline.

Several weaknesses lead to the certificate exposure:

- The boot loading chain is not password protected (starting with Grub)
and there is no integrity control, so it is trivial to "root" the appliance.
- File-system level encryption is inefficient for protecting local
storage, especially when the system lacks of integrity protection : the
disk can be accessed and the data can be retrieved while it is decrypted.
- A fixed and hard-coded value is used by the system as an encryption
key. It even makes offline decryption easy.
- Do not claim to encrypt with PBKDF-2 in the documentation. The user
password is used with no derivation.

### A look at the user password mode

In an improved vault encryption mode, the appliance allows the user to
encrypt with its own key.
The documentation advertises that the key is based on PBKDF-2, so we
expect that the encryption to be a hash.

We set this mode and tracked system calls while unlocking a certificate
in the Web interface :

```
# strace -e write -o /tmp/out /opt/tms/bin/mgmtd & 1 > /dev/null 2>&1
[...]
write(19, "Pass123_EC6R*****0\n", 22) = 22
[...]
```

So we found the password that we set for the vault, appended with the
appliance serial number. With this information, we succeeded in
decrypting the vault offline, from another Linux box.

Riverbed advertises that the use of PBKDF-2 makes the password stronger
to prevent brute force attacks (as it is used in EncFS).
However, a poorly chosen pass phrase (in the absence of password policy
enforcement) and a physically readable salt (the serial number on the
appliance) would yet defeat the benefits of EncFS encryption.

## Insecure secure vault deletion

Two scripts are used at different times to delete the secure vault:
`/sbin/secure_vault_clear.sh` and `/sbin/scrub.sh`.

They simply use the `rm` system command to delete the files, as follows:

```
[...]
umount /var/opt/rbt/decrypted
rm -rf /var/opt/rbt/decrypted
rm -rf /var/opt/rbt/encrypted
rm -f /var/opt/rbt/ssl
[...]
```

A better practice would be to use `shred` or `srm` utilities to wipe
files securely.

## Affected versions

RiOS versions prior to 9.0.1 regarding the single boot mode.

Potentially all version regarding secure vault weak encryption and wiping.

### Solution

Sysdream considers that the encryption scheme needs a complete
re-factoring in relevance with the secrets it protects. We believe that
full disk encryption should be implemented, with better boot loader
security features. Default security and clarifications should be
mandatory for this kind of appliance.

As of now, Riverbed advises:

```
> ```
> 1) Ensure physical access is protected
> 2) Keep your software up-to-date
> 3) Set a bootloader password
> 4) Set a BIOS password
> 5) Change the default secure-vault password
> 6) Take proper steps when decommissioning including erasing hard-disk data
>
> ```

```

We could not verify that all these items can be implemented (for
instance, on our model and RiOS version, no setting allowed to set a
Grub and BIOS password, and the user guide did not mention anything).
So, please refer to your documentation (deployment guide) or support to
check how you can implement these security settings.

## Timeline (dd/mm/yyyy)

* 7/12/2016 Initial discovery
* 11/12/2016    First e-mail contact
* 17/12/2016    Sent all details to Riverbed contact
* 26/01/2017    After several requests to the support, got contact with
the security team. Riverbed position is that customers should put proper
physical protections in place in any case. Also, version 9.0.1 removed
single mode boot.

###### Issue

**CVE-2017-5670, CVE-2017-7305, CVE-2017-7306, CVE-2017-7307** have been posted for the Secure Vault feature by an independent third-party.  The Secure Vault is an AES 256-bit encrypted area of disk used on several Riverbed products to hold sensitive information from the device’s configuration. This can include, for example, SSL private keys for use with SSL optimization, the RiOS data store encryption key, and replication or delegate user configuration details.

The 3rd party was able to modify the system by having physical access to the appliance, and rebooting the appliance into [single-user mode](https://supportkb.riverbed.com/support/index?page=content&id=S14172). They were also able to use other aspects of the default configuration settings to exploit the system and extract information from the vault. This knowledge base article addresses each of the four CVEs disclosed as a result of the 3rd party findings.

| **SteelFusion Edge** | Not vulnerable when optional bootloader password configured; see Solution section below for mitigation. |
| **SteelHead EX** | Not vulnerable when optional bootloader password configured; see Solution section below for mitigation. |

### **CVE-2017-7306 Issue**

The Riverbed products listed below have a weak default password for the secure vault, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to defeat the secure-vault protection mechanism by leveraging knowledge of the password algorithm and the appliance serial number.

NOTE: Riverbed believes that this does not meet the definition of a vulnerability. The product contains correct computational logic for supporting arbitrary password changes by customers; however, a password change is optional to meet different customers' needs.

###### Solution

Deploying your device following the best practices outlined below, and in our documentation, will ensure proper protection of the Secure Vault contents.

The Securing SteelHeads section of the Deployment Guide provides additional information - [this is a direct link to the 9.5 documentation](https://support.riverbed.com/bin/support/static/17qudtqont75l258qrbn4maj75/html/1mk0rjev5snblam40lgbg0mrgp/sh_9.5_dg_html/index.html#page/sh_9.5_dg%2Fradius_tacacs.html%23ww225116), the most current at the time of publication.  This information applies to all vulnerable products described in this KB.

### **CVE-2017-5670 Solution**

**Restrict Physical Access**

Treat the Riverbed device in the same manner as other infrastructure devices handling sensitive data. Restrict physical access to only authorized users.  By acquiring physical access to a device, an attacker through single user mode can gain control, including lost password recovery procedures. Even without breaking into the software, it is possible to gain access to the contents of disks by gaining access to the device itself. You should treat the device as comparable in value to the servers or clients that hold sensitive data.

**Decommissioning**

Take proper steps when decommissioning your device, including the erasing of the Secure Vault and hard disk data in the steps outlined here: [S13237](https://supportkb.riverbed.com/support/index?page=content&id=S13237)

### **CVE-2017-7305 Solution**

If you are unable to restrict physical access or would like to further strengthen the protection around the encrypted data in the Secure Vault, Riverbed recommends implementing the following best practices; additional information is available in Riverbed documentation.

**Use a Boot Loader Password**

Setting a boot loader password prevents anyone with physical access to the device from modifying the boot sequence, including loading single-user mode for password recovery.

To configure a boot loader password:

Steelhead (config) # **boot bootloader password <password>**

Steelhead (config) # **write memory**

Steelhead (config) # **reload**

**Use a BIOS Password**

Enable a BIOS password for pre-boot protection against unauthorized system booting, and loading single-user mode for password recovery.

To configure a password:

* Connect a null modem cable to a SteelHead.
* Open up a terminal on your host to the SteelHead.
* Power up the SteelHead.
* Press F4 to enter BIOS.
* Navigate to the Security tab.
* Specify a supervisor password.
* Make sure that the user password option is set to OFF.
* Save your configuration and continue to boot the SteelHead.

### **CVE-2017-7306 Solution**

**Restrict Physical Access**

Treat the Riverbed device in the same manner as other infrastructure devices handling sensitive data. Restrict physical access to only authorized users. By acquiring physical access to a device, an attacker through single user mode can gain control, including lost password recovery procedures. Even without breaking into the software, it is possible to gain access to the contents of disks by gaining access to the device itself. You should treat the device as comparable in value to the servers or clients that hold sensitive data. Decommissioning Take proper steps when decommissioning your device, including the erasing of the Secure Vault and hard disk data in the steps outlined here: S13237 If you are unable to restrict physical access or would like to further strengthen the protection around the encrypted data in the Secure Vault, Riverbed recommends implementing the following best practices; additional information is available in Riverbed documentation.

**Change the Secure Vault Password**

The key used for encrypting the Secure Vault data can be changed to a value only known by the device administrator.  This ensures the Secure Vault is only unlocked when an authorized user has access to the device.  To change the Secure Vault password:

Steelhead (config) # **secure-vault new-password <password>**

Steelhead (config) # **write memory**

**Note**:

Changing the key requires it to be entered by the user on every start-up of the device.  Functionality dependent on the Secure Vault cannot operate until it is unlocked.  Unlocking the secure vault:

Steelhead (config) # **secure-vault unlock <password>**

Devices that are managed by the SteelCentral Controller for SteelHead (SCC) can have their Secure Vault automatically unlocked upon connection to the SCC after reboot. This allows a key not known to RiOS to be used while also still allowing automatic unlock at boot.

### **CVE-2017-7307 Solution**

If you are unable to restrict physical access or would like to further strengthen the protection around the encrypted data in the Secure Vault, Riverbed recommends upgrading to a supported version of Riverbed RiOS which includes a challenge/response function to protect against this unauthorized access; additional information is available in Riverbed documentation.
