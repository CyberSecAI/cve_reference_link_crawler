  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The mini-app 'Kaibutsunosato' exposes the 'client secret' in the response of the request to `https://asia-northeast1-pibot-order-prod.cloudfunctions.net/userEntry`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200)",
    "The client secret is leaked through the API response.",
    "Improper handling of channel access token security."
