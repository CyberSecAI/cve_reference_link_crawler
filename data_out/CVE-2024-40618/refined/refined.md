- Root cause of vulnerability: Improper sanitization when processing a built-in extension.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization of input when the Whale browser handles a built-in extension, potentially allowing for the injection of malicious code.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered through a built-in extension.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker would need to craft malicious JavaScript that can be injected into a Whale browser built-in extension through the exploited sanitization weakness.
