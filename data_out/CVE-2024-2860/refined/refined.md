- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect local authentication in the Postgres implementation within Brocade SANnav.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the flawed local authentication mechanism of the Postgres database used by Brocade SANnav.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who gains access to the virtual machine where Brocade SANnav is installed can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive data stored in the Postgres database. This could lead to unauthorized access to confidential information, potential data breaches, and compromise of the SANnav system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local; an attacker needs to have access to the VM where Brocade SANnav is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the virtual machine where Brocade SANnav is deployed.
