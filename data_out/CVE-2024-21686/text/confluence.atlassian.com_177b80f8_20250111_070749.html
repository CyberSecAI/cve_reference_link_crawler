# July 2024 Security Bulletin

This Security Bulletin includes 11 high-severity vulnerabilities which have been addressed in the noted Fixed Versions released in the past month.Â These vulnerabilities were discovered via our Bug Bounty program, pen-testing processes, and third-party library scans.

To fix all of the vulnerabilities impacting your product(s), Atlassian recommends patching your instances to the latest version or one of the Fixed Versions. The listed Fixed Versions for each product are current as of July 16, 2024 (date of publication); visit the linked product Release Notes for the most up-to-date versions.

**NOTE**: The vulnerabilities included in monthly Security Bulletins present a lower impact than those published via Critical Security Advisories. Customers can expect to receive those high-priority patches outside of our monthly schedule as necessary.
