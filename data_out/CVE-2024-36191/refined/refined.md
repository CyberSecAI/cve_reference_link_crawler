**Severity:** Important
**CVSS Score:** 5.4
**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
**Attack Vector:** Network (AV:N)
**Attacker Requirements:**
  -  Low privileges (PR:L) on the AEM system
  -  User interaction (UI:R) is required (victim needs to interact with the malicious content)
**Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script that is then stored and executed in the context of other users' browsers.

**Summary:**
CVE-2024-36191 is a stored XSS vulnerability in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).  An attacker with low privileges can inject malicious code into the system. When another user views the content containing the malicious code, the script will execute in their browser, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The attacker requires low privileges to inject malicious script and requires user interaction from another user to trigger the vulnerability.
