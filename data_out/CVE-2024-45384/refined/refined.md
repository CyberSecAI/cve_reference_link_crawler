- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Padding Oracle vulnerability in the `druid-pac4j` extension of Apache Druid.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a Padding Oracle vulnerability. This type of vulnerability arises when an application improperly handles padding during cryptographic operations, allowing an attacker to decrypt ciphertext by observing error messages. Specifically, in this case, it allows an attacker to manipulate the pac4j session cookie.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can manipulate the pac4j session cookie. While a meaningful way to exploit this is unknown, it could lead to unauthorized access or other malicious activities, depending on the cookie's content and usage within the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the `pac4j` session cookie.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application and modify the `pac4j` session cookie. The specifics of how an attacker manipulates the cookie (e.g., by intercepting and modifying it during transit) are not detailed. However, they must be able to send crafted cookie values to the server to trigger the padding oracle.
