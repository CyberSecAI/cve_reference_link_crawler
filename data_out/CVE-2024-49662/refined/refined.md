Root cause of vulnerability: The WordPress Simple Load More plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:  The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website.
Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to redirects, malicious advertisements, or other unwanted HTML payloads executed when users visit the site.
Attack vectors: The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts into the plugin, which are then executed in the context of a user's browser when the page is loaded.
Required attacker capabilities/position: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
