Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-37911:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control checks when accessing deleted document revisions through the XWiki script API, diff feature, and REST API. Specifically, the system fails to verify if a user has the necessary view rights on a *deleted* document before returning its content or metadata when accessed using specific revision identifiers (e.g., "deleted:1").

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Insufficient Access Control:** The core issue is the absence of sufficient right checks when accessing deleted document revisions. The system allows access to deleted document content if the user has view rights on the current (re-created) document, or in the same space via script API.
2.  **Incorrect Assumption about Revisions:** The REST API assumes that revisions are only older versions of existing documents, neglecting deleted versions. This assumption bypasses the required access checks for deleted documents.
3.  **Inconsistent Security Enforcement:** The fix for a previous issue (XWIKI-16285) regarding deleted documents was not implemented consistently across the application (e.g., script API, diff view, REST API), leading to inconsistencies in security enforcement.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Leakage:** An attacker with view rights on a re-created document, but not on the deleted version, can gain access to the content and comments of the deleted document. This is a data leak vulnerability.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information stored in deleted documents can be exposed.
*   **Lateral movement:** If the attacker has edit right in the location of the deleted document, they can re-create the deleted document, thus extending the scope to any deleted document.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Script API:** Using the `XWiki#getDocument(DocumentReference reference, String revision)` method, an attacker with script right but no view right on a deleted document can retrieve the document's content.
2.  **Diff Feature:** By manipulating the revision parameter in the diff view URL (e.g., changing it to "deleted:1"), an attacker can view the content of deleted revisions.
3.  **REST API:** Accessing specific endpoints like `/xwiki/rest/wikis/xwiki/spaces/Test/pages/WebHome/history/deleted:2/comments` allows unauthorized users to view comments from deleted documents.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** An attacker needs only low privileges, specifically view rights on the re-created document (or on the same space via script API).
*   **Ability to Manipulate URLs:** For the diff feature and REST API attacks, the attacker needs to be able to manipulate the URL parameters.
*   **Scripting capabilities:** To exploit the script API vulnerability, the attacker needs to be able to execute scripts.
* **Knowledge of deletion number:** The attacker needs to know or guess the number corresponding to the deleted document revision (e.g., 'deleted:2'). This number is based on how many times a document with the same name has been deleted.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced by the changes made in [XWIKI-14252](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-14252) which introduced the `deleted:-prefix` for revisions.
*   The vulnerability affects XWiki versions from 9.4-rc-1 up to (but not including) 14.10.8 and 15.3-rc-1.
*   The fix involves implementing proper access checks in `getDocumentRevision` methods within `Document.java` and `XWiki.java`. It also involves checking access rights when deleted revisions are accessed.
* The fix also includes added test cases in  `DocumentTest.java` and `XWikiTest.java` to verify the implemented access controls.
*   The severity is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 6.5, highlighting high confidentiality impact with low attack complexity and low privileges required.
