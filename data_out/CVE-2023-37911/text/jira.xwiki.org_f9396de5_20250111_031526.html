#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Create a document that has restricted view right and delete it again.
2. As a user with script right but no view right on that deleted document (but view right on its space), access the deleted document through XWiki#getDocument(DocumentReference reference, String revision).

**Expected result:**

An exception is thrown.

**Actual result:**

The deleted document is returned.

This has probably been introduced in [~~XWIKI-14252~~](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-14252 "Viewing a document in the recycle bin is no longer working") which introduced the deleted:-prefix for revisions, so most likely this affects 9.4RC1.
