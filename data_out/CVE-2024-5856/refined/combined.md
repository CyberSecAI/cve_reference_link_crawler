### Description

The Comment Images Reloaded plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the cir\_delete\_image AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary media attachments.
