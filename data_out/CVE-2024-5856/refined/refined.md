- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization check on the `cir_delete_image` AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing capability check, leading to arbitrary media deletion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access or higher can delete arbitrary media attachments. This results in a loss of data (images/media files).
- **Attack vectors**: Sending an AJAX request to the `cir_delete_image` action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site.
