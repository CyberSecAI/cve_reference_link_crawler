Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `save_menu_item_icon` function in the WP Mobile Menu plugin lacked proper authorization checks. Specifically, it did not verify if the user had the necessary permissions to modify post meta data before allowing changes to the `_mobmenu_icon` post meta.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a capability check in the `save_menu_item_icon` function. This allowed unauthenticated users to trigger the function.
*   **Unrestricted Post Meta Modification:** The vulnerable function allowed an attacker to add or modify the `_mobmenu_icon` post meta on arbitrary posts.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Modification:** An attacker could modify the `_mobmenu_icon` post meta of any post. The impact of this is limited by the fact that the value of the `_mobmenu_icon` is sanitized which prevents malicious code from being introduced. The attacker could change how the menu renders on the page, which can impact the user experience.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network (web).
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attack does not require any authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **No specific position or privilege required**: The attacker can be an unauthenticated, remote user. They simply need to send a crafted request to the vulnerable function.

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided patch added a nonce check (`wp_verify_nonce`) and a capability check (`current_user_can('manage_options')`) to ensure that only authorized users can modify the post meta.
*   Version 2.8.4.4 contained a partial fix, but was not fully secure.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.8.5.
