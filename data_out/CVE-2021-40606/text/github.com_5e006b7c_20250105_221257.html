| * I looked for a similar issue and couldn't find any. * I tried with the latest version of GPAC. Installers available at <http://gpac.io/downloads/gpac-nightly-builds/> * I give enough information for contributors to reproduce my issue (meaningful title, github labels, platform and compiler, command-line ...).   It's a memcpy from unknown addrees bug.  Step to reproduce: 1.get latest commit code (GPAC version 1.1.0-DEV-rev1170-g592ba2689-master) 2.compile with --enable-sanitizer 3.run ./MP4BOX -hint poc\_isom\_hinter -out /dev/null  Env: Ubunut 20.04 , clang 12.0.1  ASAN report  ``` ================================================================= ==194694==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: unknown-crash on address 0x03e8ef58ac20 at pc 0x0000004a3cd7 bp 0x7ffdef589370 sp 0x7ffdef588b38 READ of size 24912 at 0x03e8ef58ac20 thread T0     #0 0x4a3cd6 in __asan_memcpy (/home/lly/pro/gpac_public/bin/gcc/MP4Box+0x4a3cd6)     #1 0x7f35556d80ef in gf_bs_write_data /home/lly/pro/gpac_public/src/utils/bitstream.c:1028:4     #2 0x7f3555da5a1a in gf_odf_write_default /home/lly/pro/gpac_public/src/odf/odf_code.c:1320:3     #3 0x7f3555da92ec in gf_odf_desc_write_bs /home/lly/pro/gpac_public/src/odf/odf_codec.c:325:6     #4 0x7f3555da92ec in gf_odf_desc_write /home/lly/pro/gpac_public/src/odf/odf_codec.c:343:6     #5 0x7f3555da9661 in gf_odf_desc_copy /home/lly/pro/gpac_public/src/odf/odf_codec.c:387:6     #6 0x7f3555cb8760 in gf_isom_set_extraction_slc /home/lly/pro/gpac_public/src/isomedia/isom_write.c:5468:9     #7 0x7f3555fa467b in gf_hinter_finalize /home/lly/pro/gpac_public/src/media_tools/isom_hinter.c:1245:5     #8 0x4e8d21 in HintFile /home/lly/pro/gpac_public/applications/mp4box/main.c:3550:2     #9 0x4f5988 in mp4boxMain /home/lly/pro/gpac_public/applications/mp4box/main.c:6329:7     #10 0x7f355476d0b2 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-eX1tMB/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16     #11 0x429a6d in _start (/home/lly/pro/gpac_public/bin/gcc/MP4Box+0x429a6d)  Address 0x03e8ef58ac20 is located in the high shadow area.  ```  Buggy code in bitstream.c:  ``` u32 gf_bs_write_data(GF_BitStream *bs, const u8 *data, u32 nbBytes) { ... memcpy(bs->original + bs->position - bs->bytes_out, data, nbBytes);  <---data is not inited ... }  ```  [poc.zip](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/files/7036109/poc.zip) |
