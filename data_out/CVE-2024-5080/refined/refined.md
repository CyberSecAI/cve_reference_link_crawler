- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP eMember plugin does not properly validate uploaded files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary file upload vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can upload arbitrary files, such as PHP files, to the server. This can lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server and potentially gain full control of the affected website.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the WordPress admin interface by navigating to the plugin's settings page and using the file upload functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level access to the WordPress dashboard.
