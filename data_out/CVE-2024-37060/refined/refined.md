Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37060:

**CVE-2024-37060**

*   **Root Cause:** Deserialization of untrusted data using `pickle.load()` within the `BaseCard.load` method in `recipes/cards/__init__.py`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The `BaseCard.load` method directly uses `pickle.load()` to deserialize data from a file path, without any input sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject a malicious pickle object that executes arbitrary code when deserialized.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Remote code execution on the victim's machine. When the victim loads a malicious MLproject recipe card, the injected code will execute.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    1.  An attacker crafts a malicious MLproject Recipe that includes a specially crafted pickle file (e.g., `pickle.pkl`) and a Python script (`recipe_card_pickle.py`).
    2.  The script calls `BaseCard.load("recipe_card.pkl")` to load the malicious pickle.
    3.  The attacker shares the malicious MLproject Recipe with a victim.
    4.  When the victim runs `mlflow run` from within the recipe directory, the pickle file will be deserialized, and the injected code will be executed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious MLproject Recipe.
    *   The victim needs to execute `mlflow run` on the malicious project provided by the attacker.

The provided text gives a clear explanation of how to exploit the vulnerability with example code and the exact location in the mlflow code where the vulnerability resides. This is more detailed than a basic CVE description would normally provide.
