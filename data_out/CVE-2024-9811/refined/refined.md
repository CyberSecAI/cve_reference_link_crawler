Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-9811.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input validation of the "company" parameter in the `filter3.php` file of the "Restaurant Reservation System", which allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is an SQL injection. The code does not sanitize or validate user-provided input before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to manipulate database queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Attackers can achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the HTTP POST request to the `/filter3.php` file. The vulnerable parameter is `company`. The attacker can manipulate the `company` parameter in the POST request to inject SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not require any login or authentication to exploit the vulnerability. They need the ability to send a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
