Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-1726:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the RESTEasy Reactive implementation within Quarkus. Security checks for certain inherited JAX-RS endpoints are not performed eagerly. Instead, these checks are executed by standard security interceptors *after* the request body has been serialized and processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Delayed Security Checks:** Security checks for inherited endpoints are performed later in the request processing lifecycle (after serialization).
- **Resource Consumption Before Checks:** Processing resources are consumed before security checks are applied. This means that even if a request is ultimately deemed unauthorized, the application has already spent resources processing it.
- **Exposure of Vulnerable Endpoints:** An attacker can probe for vulnerable endpoints by sending unauthenticated requests with invalid payloads and observing the response status.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a series of requests to vulnerable endpoints, an attacker can trigger excessive resource consumption. If an attacker can send valid content, the requests will be stopped after JAX-RS filters which also may contribute to DoS.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The delayed security checks allow an attacker to potentially exhaust server resources (CPU, memory) by sending crafted requests, ultimately causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack is conducted through sending crafted HTTP requests (POST, PUT, PATCH) to vulnerable endpoints.
- **Unauthenticated Requests:** The attacker can send unauthenticated HTTP requests, exploiting the lack of immediate security checks.
- **Knowledge of Endpoints:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of the application's request paths, specifically for POST, PUT, or PATCH methods to target inherited JAX-RS endpoints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
- **Endpoint Knowledge:**  The attacker needs to know the request paths for some of the application's JAX-RS endpoints using POST, PUT or PATCH methods.
- **Ability to Send Malicious Payloads:** The attacker must be able to send crafted or valid HTTP requests with payloads that can trigger resource-intensive processing before security checks are performed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Quarkus versions: 999-SNAPSHOT, 3.8.x, 3.7.x, 3.2.x, and 2.13.x.
- The fix is included in Red Hat build of Quarkus 3.2.11.
- Mitigations for affected versions include avoiding the use of inherited endpoints or implementing HTTP-level permissions.
