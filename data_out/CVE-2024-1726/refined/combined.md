Due to security checks for some JAX-RS endpoints being performed after serialization, more processing resources are consumed while the HTTP request is checked. In certain configurations, if an attacker has knowledge of any POST, PUT, or PATCH request paths, they can potentially identify vulnerable endpoints and trigger excessive resource usage as the endpoints process the requests. This can result in a denial of service. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2265158#c0)  Robb Gatica    2024-02-20 18:09:22 UTC  ``` Description: Security checks for standard security annotations on the RESTEasy Reactive inherited endpoints are not performed eagerly, but are performed by standard security interceptors instead. Apart from functional differences it also means security checks for inherited endpoints are not performed eagerly.  As long as you know any POST / PUT / PATCH request paths, you can send unauthenticated HTTP requests with illegal payload and see response status. When you get 500 ... this way you detect endpoints (though there can be other reasons...) Can you significantly raise processing time? You can send valid content which means requests will be stopped after JAX-RS filters. Resulting impact depends on what they do in JAX-RS filters.  Affected Quarkus version:  999-SNAPSHOT, 3.8.x. 3.7.x, 3.2.x, 2.13.x  Mitigations with affected version:  Don't use inherited endpoints (or use HTTP permissions, depending on the scenario)  References: <https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/38832> <https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/38754>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2265158#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-03 10:53:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Quarkus 3.2.11  Via RHSA-2024:1662 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1662](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1662)   ``` |  |
