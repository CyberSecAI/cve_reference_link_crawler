- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient access control implementations on cluster configuration CLI requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  A lack of proper access control allows an unauthenticated, local attacker to send cluster configuration CLI requests to specific directories, bypassing security restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read and modify data handled by an internal service, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a cluster configuration CLI request to specific directories on an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be local to the affected device and does not need to be authenticated.
