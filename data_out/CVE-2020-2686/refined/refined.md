Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2686:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a vulnerability within the MySQL database, which is used by several products. The specific nature of the vulnerability isn't described in detail, but it is related to the code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Multiple vulnerabilities exist in MySQL versions prior to 5.6.46, 5.7.28, and 8.0.18.
- The provided content focuses on the impact and affected products rather than the specific weaknesses in the code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server:** An attacker could gain full control of the MySQL server.
- **Unauthorized access to data:** An attacker could gain unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all of the data accessible by the MySQL server.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash of the MySQL server, leading to partial or complete denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, indicated by "AV:N" in the CVSS vector strings, meaning that the vulnerability is accessible over the network.
- The gentoo advisory lists local and remote vectors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The required capabilities/position of the attacker vary depending on the specific vulnerability being exploited, however, generally:
  - **Low Privileges (PR:L):** Some vulnerabilities can be exploited by an attacker with low-level access to the MySQL server.
  - **High Privileges (PR:H):** Some vulnerabilities require an attacker to have higher privileges on the MySQL server.
  - **No privileges (PR:N):** Some vulnerabilities do not require an attacker to be authenticated.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content also includes references to other vulnerabilities addressed in the same MySQL update, but it focuses primarily on the general impact of the collective fixes.
- The NetApp advisory provides CVSS v3 scores and attack vectors for all the vulnerabilities listed.
- The Ubuntu USN indicates that the updated mysql-server packages fix this and other vulnerabilities.
- Gentoo references a large list of CVEs fixed by the update and includes affected package versions.
