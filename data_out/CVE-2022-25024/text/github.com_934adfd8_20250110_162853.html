Even though, there are methods to safely get the json from file, string,

or url even, there is no surely that people will not pass their own data

into the json2xml.Json2xml() contructor.

However, if the data is corrupt or mal-formed, there is a chance an

exception can be raised, bringing the program to a halt.

Hence, a new error type is introduced, that protects against it and

raises InvalidDataError exception which can that be caught and logged in

a program that uses Json2xml.
