| **Describe the bug** I found out that theJson2xml(data).to\_xml() method can raise a UnicodeDecodeError leading to a crash of the running program.  This could be problematic if users of the library are dealing with untrusted data since this issue will lead to a DoS. This should be detected and an execption should be triggered  **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior: [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15817126/152783251-48f9ca07-a4ef-4c36-9935-a5ede0870f0c.png)  **Expected behavior** This execption should be expected. |

| @Asteriska8 Thanks for raising this issue and the explanation, it would be much more helpful if you could please just paste the input data in here so that it is easier to test it. The screenshot while informative doesn't help much in using that in the code. |

`[fix: issue with uncaught UnicodeDecodeError](/vinitkumar/json2xml/commit/194ecbe5cc966025bacdcb583f120750c39af528 "fix: issue with uncaught UnicodeDecodeError

Even though, there are methods to safely get the json from file, string,
or url even, there is no surely that people will not pass their own data
into the json2xml.Json2xml() contructor.

However, if the data is corrupt or mal-formed, there is a chance an
exception can be raised, brining the program to a halt.

Hence, a new error type is introduced, that protects against it and
raises InvalidDataError exception which can that be caught and logged in
a program that uses Json2xml.
