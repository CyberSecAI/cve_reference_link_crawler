As a small business owner, I was concerned about the rising cyber threats targeting companies like mine. Thankfully, I found eScan EDR, and it has been a lifesaver!

I sleep better at night knowing my business is protected against cyber attacks.

![user](https://escanav.com/en/images/user1.png)

Our company deals with sensitive customer information, and maintaining data security is paramount. After implementing eScan EDR, we've seen a significant improvement in our cybersecurity posture.

Had previously used eScan Total Security for a Full Year on my Laptop with great satisfaction, so when the time for renewal was just a week away, I made the decision to buy 1 Year 1 Device from Amazon. I placed the order yesterday, and it was delivered by email in about one hour. After logging onto the URL, installing the software, and downloading all the most recent updates after registering, the steps were quite simple to follow because there were clear installation instructions provided.

Happy to have eScan Total Security Suite for another 365 days at such a great price!

## Titu Sahotra - Mumbai, India

This is my second time of using eScan antivirus. I like it because it takes very less resources. Other Anti-Virus remove viruses and damage or remove your data. eScan does not harm your data. It is very safe and secure. I like it very much and recommend my friends to use eScan Anti-Virus or eScan Internet Security Suite.
