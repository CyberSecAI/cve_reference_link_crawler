Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a kernel handle leak within the `ProcObsrvesx.sys` driver, a component of eScan Antivirus.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Kernel Handle Leak:** The driver fails to properly manage kernel handles, leading to a leak.
- **Insecure Device Permissions:** The driver's device is accessible to all users on the local system, regardless of privilege level. This allows low-privileged users to interact with the driver and trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** The kernel handle leak can be leveraged to gain elevated privileges on the local system. By abusing existing handles of other processes running on the same system, an attacker can escalate their privileges to system level.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local to the system.
- **Low-Privilege User:** A low-privileged user can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have local access to the target system.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system.
- No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability; a low-privileged user can exploit it.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerable driver is `ProcObsrvesx.sys`, version `4.0.0.49`. It's likely that earlier versions are also vulnerable.
- The vulnerability was reported to Microworld Technologies through a coordinated vulnerability disclosure program.
- A patch has been released by Microworld Technologies.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Tijme Gommers, Jan-Jaap Korpershoek and Alex Oudenaarden of Northwave Cyber Security.
