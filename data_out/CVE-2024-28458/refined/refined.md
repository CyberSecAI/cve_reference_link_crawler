The provided content describes a vulnerability in `swfc` (part of swftools 0.9.2) which leads to a NULL pointer dereference. The content also describes two additional memory leak vulnerabilities in the same software.

**Vulnerability 1 (NULL pointer dereference):**

*   **Root Cause:** A NULL pointer dereference occurs within the `compileSWFActionCode` function in `action/actioncompiler.c` at line 94.
*   **Weaknesses:** The code attempts to dereference a pointer that can be NULL, leading to a crash.
*   **Impact:** The program crashes due to a segmentation fault (SEGV).
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted input file (`poc_SEGV_compileSWFActionCode`). The specific details of the malformed input are not provided.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to provide a malicious input file to the `swfc` tool.

**Vulnerability 2 (Memory Leak 1):**

*   **Root Cause:** Memory leaks occur during the parsing of an ActionScript 3 file. Specifically, leaks are observed in `rfx_alloc`, `strdup`, `handleIdentifier`, and `enter_file`.
*   **Weaknesses:** Unfreed memory allocations in various parts of the AS3 parsing and tokenization process.
*   **Impact:** The process will accumulate leaked memory, potentially leading to resource exhaustion if the process runs for long enough, although the document does not provide specifics about the memory usage patterns.
*    **Attack Vector:** This memory leak is triggered by providing a specific input file (`memory_leak1`). The specific details of the malformed input are not provided.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to provide a malicious input file to the `swfc` tool.

**Vulnerability 3 (Memory Leak 2):**

*   **Root Cause:**  Memory leaks occur during the parsing of an ActionScript 3 file. Specifically, leaks are observed in `handleIdentifier` and `handleregexp` during tokenization.
*   **Weaknesses:** Unfreed memory allocations in various parts of the AS3 parsing and tokenization process.
*   **Impact:** The process will accumulate leaked memory, potentially leading to resource exhaustion if the process runs for long enough, although the document does not provide specifics about the memory usage patterns.
*   **Attack Vector:**  This memory leak is triggered by providing a specific input file (`memory_leak2`). The specific details of the malformed input are not provided.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to provide a malicious input file to the `swfc` tool.

**CVE-2024-28458 is specifically assigned to the NULL pointer dereference vulnerability, while the memory leaks are presented in the same document with the same discoverers.**
