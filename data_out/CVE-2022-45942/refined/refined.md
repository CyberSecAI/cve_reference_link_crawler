Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `system()` function call within the `file_save()` function in `includes/baijiacms/common.inc.php` (line 654). The `$file_full_path` parameter, which is partially user-controlled, is passed to the `system()` function without sufficient sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. Because the `$file_full_path` variable is constructed using user-controlled input (`$url`) via the `pathinfo()` function which extracts the file extension, it allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application does not adequately sanitize the filename extracted from the URL, allowing malicious code to be included in the filename and executed through the `system()` call.
- **Reliance on `pathinfo()`:** The use of `pathinfo()` to determine the file extension, while standard, becomes a vulnerability because the extension is directly used in the construction of the file path passed to `system()`.
- **Unrestricted `system()` call:** The `system()` function executes the constructed command without any restriction, allowing the attacker to run any arbitrary system command.
- **Dependency on `image_compress_openscale`:** The code execution is conditional on the `image_compress_openscale` setting, which must be enabled in the backend settings, adding an extra step in the exploitation process, however, it does not limit the exploitation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server where the application is running. This could lead to full server compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `url` parameter in the HTTP GET request to inject a malicious command in the file extension of the URL, which will be passed to the `system()` command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Backend Access:** While not a direct requirement for exploit, the attacker needs to enable image compression in the backend settings before exploiting the vulnerability.
- **Understanding of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to understand how the `url` parameter is processed and how the file extension is used in the `system()` call.
