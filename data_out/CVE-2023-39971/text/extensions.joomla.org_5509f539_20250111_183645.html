[Tobi Gurtner (2).](/profile/profile/details/194973)

Posted on 23 May 2024

Great functions and a great integration-possibility. We use it for all communication with our own MVC components.

It is easy to use for non technical person as well for us as Joomla and component Developers since 2009.

###### Support

###### Documentation

Bad, not exists, not german translated version, documentation is not useable

I used this to:
Newsletter and campaign, Contact forms and auto response, Newsletter and campaign, Contact forms and auto response
Owner's reply:
Hello,

AcyMailing is fully translated in German:

If the texts are not translated on your website, you can go in the AcyMailing configuration page, tab "Languages" and click the "Edit" icon next to the German language then click the "Load the latest version from our server" button. Once loaded, click the "Save" button and refresh the page => AcyMailing should be shown in German now.

Our documentation is indeed not translated in German as none of us masters this language. This is why our documentation is written in English, so that you could activate the browser translation tool.

Note that we focus more and more on adding tips and explanations directly in AcyMailing (the "(i)" next to options) so that users only need our documentation for very specific cases.

#### [Has become buggy and pushes to 'subscribe'](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/acymailing-starter/#rev-125021)

[rookey (2).](/profile/profile/details/8533)

Posted on 06 February 2024

###### Functionality

This extension was great before but isn't anymore. Changing subscriptions in the current version produces an error message.

###### Ease of use

No easy and simple download anymore, users are required to 'register' on their website. Not matching Joomla standards.

###### Support

Error message "0 method\_exists(): Argument #1 ($object\_or\_class) must be of type object|string, null given" when trying to change subscr

###### Documentation

I used this to:
Joomla 3 plugin, not sure which version I received through auto-update

#### [Much Commercial - Voilating OpenSource GNU/GPL rules](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/acymailing-starter/#rev-124655)

[Varma (1).](/profile/profile/details/547763)

Posted on 27 November 2023

###### Functionality

Functionalities are there but give lot of problems with Joomla 4 & 5

###### Ease of use

Not really easy to use. Using Acymailing seems harmful and not beneficial for open-source customers.

###### Support

I purchased the extension few months ago and have generated lot of issue for me on my website, and I reached them several times still no use

###### Documentation

Since they depend on an open-source platform under the GNU/GPL, restricting users from using the entire extension after the license expires.

I used this to:
While it's acceptable to restrict users from upgrading the version or receiving continued support after the license period, controlling the entire extension not to work and running vulnerable background scripts after the license expiration is a security risk.

#### [Powerful and versatile](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/acymailing-starter/#rev-123351)

[Didier Pollez (12).](/profile/profile/details/109255)

Posted on 15 March 2023

###### Functionality

Very versatile and easy to adapt for any type of use and many add-ons for other Joomla extensions.

###### Ease of use

It takes some getting used to but once you know the basics it is easy to configure and use.

###### Support

Top support, very quick answer and solution via the forum or ticket system.

###### Documentation

Very extensive description and documentation and forum, but necessary.

I used this to:
I used this to: I use it to send emails when new articles, events or documents appear. Users can subscribe and unsubscribe from the newsletters.

#### [The worst upgrade ever!](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/acymailing-starter/#rev-122347)

[HDsports (11).](/profile/profile/details/207255)

Posted on 20 September 2022

###### Functionality

Acyba 5 to 6/7 is the worst upgrade ever. Lost lot of functionality (f.e.: add more articles in a newsletter in one step)

###### Ease of use

very complex. With Acyba 5 it was easy to create an newsletter in less minutes. But with Acyba 6/7 you spend hours without success

I used this to:
Sending newsletter to 10,000 peoples.

Insert existing articles in the newsletter

#### [Great functionality, let down by customer focus](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/acymailing-starter/#rev-122307)

[Stephen Hart (2).](/profile/profile/details/323872)

Posted on 13 September 2022

###### Functionality

Very powerful with plenty of options, have used for many years. Enterprise membership provides front end functionality, which is excellent.

###### Ease of use

Some idiosyncrasies in naming of functions that make it less intuitive than it could be, but pretty good overall.

###### Support

Big watchout. Support weak and weirdly touchy. No tracking of support tickets. Got suspended from forum for pointing out lack of response.

###### Documentation

Has improved but not always keeping up with changes. Would say I find what I need quickly about 70% of the time.

I used this to:
Managing mailing lists, newsletters and membership comms for a Society.

Assigning send roles to others from front end.
Owner's reply:
Hi,

Any news about this?

Regards,

Alexandre.

#### [Nice Look, No result](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/acymailing-starter/#rev-122244)

[John (1).](/profile/profile/details/543373)

Posted on 29 August 2022

###### Functionality

It worked 9 years ago (Enterprise version, exorbitant cost). Since 2018 after purchasing upgraded version it stopped working.

###### Ease of use

It has all the ease to send emails but when your emails are not opened even 3% then it has neither ease nor result.

###### Support

Alexandre has no help to offer. He says: o unfortunately I've no "way" to rectify something as it might comes from tons of different reasons

###### Documentation

No manual available to help how to make sure of delivery of the emails as mails sent to me was also not received.

I used this to:
Sending news emails to clients. No question to by new version if there has been bad experience.

#### [A fantastic tool to avoid external e-mail services that do not comply with our GDPR policy](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/acymailing-starter/#rev-122171)

[Carlos (6).](/profile/profile/details/419246)

Posted on 18 August 2022

###### Functionality

I must admit that this is not a tool that I just installed. It is a tool that I have been using for over 10 years. It works great!

###### Ease of use

It is very easy to use once you get used to it. I have to say that this review is for the product acymailing essential. That is I paid 29 €

###### Support

Support is great. At least for the paying version. It is worth every cent.

###### Documentation

It is pretty self-explanatory everything. I am not sure if there is a documentation site, but at least, I did not need it.

I used this to:
I used it for 10 years. We do not want to use services like mailchimp or others, cause that would mean that We would need to transfer e-mail addresses of our subscribers to an external provider, which we are not allowed, following the GDPR Directive.
