- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A Floating Point Exception (FPE) occurs within the `combine_inner` function in `pixman-combine-float.c` when processing a specific image.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The code in `combine_inner`, specifically within the `combine_conjoint_atop_u_float` function, does not handle certain input image data correctly which results in a division by zero or some other floating-point error leading to a FPE.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The program crashes due to the FPE, causing a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted input image, specifically `zone_plate.png` from the `demos` directory of pixman. The program `stress-test` processes this image.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to execute the `stress-test` program with the crafted input image. This could be through local execution or, potentially, a situation where an application uses the vulnerable pixman library to process user-provided images.
