  "CVE-2017-10346": {
    "description": "The provided data indicates a vulnerability in OpenJDK related to insufficient loader constraints checks for invokespecial, which could allow an untrusted Java application or applet to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. This is fixed in IBM Java SE version 8 to version 8 SR5-FP5,  IBM Java SE 7 to version 7R1 SR4-FP15 and OpenJDK 7 version 7u151-2.6.11-2~deb7u2, 7u161-2.6.12.0.el6_9, 7u161-2.6.12.0.el7_4 and openjdk-8 8u151-b12-1~deb9u1",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient loader constraints checks for invokespecial in OpenJDK's Hotspot component.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Insufficient loader constraint checks"
    ],
    "impact": "Complete bypass of Java sandbox restrictions.",
    "attack_vector": "Exploitable via a network using multiple protocols, by untrusted Java applications or applets.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Remote unauthenticated attacker, requires user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.",
	"additional_details": "This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator)."
