Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-1751

**Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Root Cause:** The Skitter Slideshow plugin for WordPress does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `image` parameter of the `/image.php` file. This allows an attacker to control the destination URL of a server-side request.

**Weakness:** The application's failure to validate user-supplied URLs before using them in server-side requests.

**Impact:** An unauthenticated attacker can make the server send requests to arbitrary locations. This could be used to:
   - Query internal services not meant to be exposed to the outside world.
   - Potentially modify information on internal services.
   - Bypass firewalls.
   - Access internal files.
   - Attack other servers.

**Attack Vector:**
    - A malicious crafted URL with the `image` parameter is sent to `/image.php`.

**Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
    - The attacker only needs to send a malicious GET request to the vulnerable endpoint.
