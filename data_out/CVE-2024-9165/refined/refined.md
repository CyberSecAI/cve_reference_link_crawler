### Summary
The provided content describes a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Gift Cards (Gift Vouchers and Packages) (WooCommerce Supported)" WordPress plugin, specifically in versions up to and including 4.4.4. This vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling SVG file uploads, which allows authenticated users with author-level permissions or higher to inject malicious scripts.

### Vulnerability Details
- **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of SVG file uploads.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that will execute when a user accesses the uploaded SVG file.
- **Attack Vector:** Uploading a malicious SVG file.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - Authenticated user with Author-level access or higher.
  - Ability to upload files through the plugin's interface.

### Technical Details:
- The vulnerability exists because the plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling SVG file uploads. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to embed malicious JavaScript code within an SVG file. When a user accesses a page where this SVG file is displayed, the malicious code gets executed in the user’s browser.
- The vulnerability is located within the Gift Cards plugin for WordPress.
- The vulnerability is triggered by the plugin’s processing of SVG file uploads, where it fails to sanitize the SVG content, allowing the insertion of malicious scripts.

### Remediation
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 4.4.5 of the plugin. Users of the affected plugin should update to version 4.4.5 or higher to mitigate the vulnerability.
