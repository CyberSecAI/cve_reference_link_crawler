The plugin look great but I contacted the support and it looks like you need a minimum of 2 weeks to get any answer. So if you have a bug or problem or question, better not to be in a rush, so better not to use the plugin for a business I guess.I tested other plugins that looks less good as this one but I contacted their support and got an answer in less than 2 days in other plugin, which sounds more trustable I think.I hope they can improve their support as it looks like the main problem here.

Excellent concept, which only exists on this plugin.
User goes from one step to another without reloading the entire page
Payment directly from the “Gift Card” page
Instantly preview of the result of the card as it will be sent to the customer.
In short, THE plugin for gift cards.
There are still a lot of things to improve:
Slowness of text entry
Small jerks in the display of fields to be filled in
Limitation of customization of the design of gift cards (although I bought the premium version)…
But promising plugin, because the developer is dynamic and responds to all suggestions.
I do not regret having left my old plugin to switch to this one.
