# Out-of-bounds read in AsfVideo::streamProperties

Low

[kevinbackhouse](/kevinbackhouse)
published
GHSA-38rv-8x93-pvrh
Jul 8, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

0.28.2

## Patched versions

0.28.3

## Description

### Impact

An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.2. The vulnerability is in the parser for the ASF video format, which was a new feature in v0.28.0 (see [#2416](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/2416)), so Exiv2 versions before v0.28 are *not* affected. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted video file.

### Patches

The bug is fixed in version v0.28.3. It is fixed by [#3006](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/3006).

### For more information

Please see our [security policy](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/policy) for information about Exiv2 security.

### Credit

This bug was found by [OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz).

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-39695

### Weaknesses

[CWE-125](/advisories?query=cwe%3A125)

### @mergify **[mergify](/apps/mergify) bot** commented [Jul 4, 2024](#issue-2390434987)

Fixes an out-of-bounds read found by [OSS-Fuzz](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=68210). The bug looks pretty harmless to me, but I'll request a CVE and I think we should backport the fix to 0.28.x.

This is an automatic backport of pull request [#3005](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/3005) done by [Mergify](https://mergify.com).
