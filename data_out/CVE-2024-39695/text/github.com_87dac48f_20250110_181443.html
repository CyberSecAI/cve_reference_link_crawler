### @mergify **[mergify](/apps/mergify) bot** commented [Jul 4, 2024](#issue-2390434987)

Fixes an out-of-bounds read found by [OSS-Fuzz](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=68210). The bug looks pretty harmless to me, but I'll request a CVE and I think we should backport the fix to 0.28.x.

This is an automatic backport of pull request [#3005](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/3005) done by [Mergify](https://mergify.com).

Sorry, something went wrong.
