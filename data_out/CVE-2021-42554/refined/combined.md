WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• As a prerequisite for an attack, an attacker must be able to run untrusted code on affected systems.

Siemens recommends limiting the possibilities to run untrusted code

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The RUGGEDCOM APE1808 is a powerful utility-grade application hosting platform that lets you deploy
a range of commercially available applications for edge computing and cybersecurity in harsh, industrial
environments.

SIMATIC Field PG is a mobile, industry-standard programming device for automation engineers with all
commonly used interfaces for industrial applications that also brings pre-installed SIMATIC engineering
software.

SIMATIC IPC (Industrial PC) is the hardware platform for PC-based automation from Siemens.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.first.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-5953

A vulnerability exists in System Management Interrupt (SWSMI) handler of InsydeH2O UEFI Firmware
code located in SWSMI handler that dereferences gRT (EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES) pointer to call a
GetVariable service, which is located outside of SMRAM. This can result in code execution in SMM
(escalating privilege from ring 0 to ring -2).

Vulnerability CVE-2020-27339

In the kernel in Insyde InsydeH2O 5.x, certain SMM drivers did not correctly validate the CommBuffer
and CommBufferSize parameters, allowing callers to corrupt either the firmware or the OS memory.
The fixed versions for this issue in the AhciBusDxe, IdeBusDxe, NvmExpressDxe, SdHostDriverDxe,
and SdMmcDeviceDxe drivers are 05.16.25, 05.26.25, 05.35.25, 05.43.25, and 05.51.25 (for Kernel

Vulnerability CVE-2021-33625

An issue was discovered in Kernel 5.x in Insyde InsydeH2O, affecting HddPassword. Software SMI
services that use the Communicate() function of the EFI_SMM_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL do
not check whether the address of the buffer is valid, which allows use of SMRAM, MMIO, or OS kernel

Vulnerability CVE-2021-33626

In the kernel in Insyde InsydeH2O 5.x, certain SMM drivers did not correctly validate the CommBuffer
and CommBufferSize parameters, allowing callers to corrupt either the firmware or the OS memory.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-41837

An issue was discovered in AhciBusDxe in the kernel 5.0 through 5.5 in Insyde InsydeH2O. Because
of an Untrusted Pointer Dereference that causes SMM memory corruption, an attacker may be able to
write fixed or predictable data to SMRAM. Exploiting this issue could lead to escalating privileges to
SMM.

# **Insyde's Security Pledge**

#

![](/sites/default/files/page_images/insyde-pledge-3.jpg)

Since our inception 20 years ago, security has been essential. Hundreds of OEMs and ODM partners have trusted us with enabling the platforms that form the foundation of their products, knowing we share their commitment to make them secure. Product security is a top priority with our company and an area of focus that we continue to improve upon every day.

* We sit on the security review team of the industry’s leading firmware standards body; the UEFI Security Response Team.
* We have internal product security experts that drive our Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) process within our BIOS and BMC firmware teams and evaluate existing and emerging threats.
* We issue regular and timely security alert bulletins when mitigations to vulnerabilities are discovered.
* We work closely with all of our silicon vendor partners to ensure the timely and critical delivery of microcode updates and other patches.

At Insyde, we work with the broader industry to identify, report, mitigate and disclose security vulnerabilities. We support you, our customers and partners, in closing the door to anything which compromises the security or privacy in your platforms. We take this role seriously, because if your firmware is not secure, your product is not secure.

This is our pledge to you. If you have any questions about Insyde Software’s commitment to security, I urge you to reach out to us at security.report@insyde.com

**Tim Lewis, Chief Technology Officer**
