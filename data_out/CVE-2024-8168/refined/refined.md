Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8168

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient user input verification for the "Username" parameter in the `login.php` file of the "Online Bus Reservation Site Using PHP With Source Code."  Specifically, the application directly uses the "Username" parameter within SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in `login.php`.
- Lack of input sanitization/validation.
- Direct use of user-provided input within SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access.
- Sensitive data leakage.
- Data tampering (modification and deletion).
- Potential for system control.
- Service disruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request to `login.php` with a malicious SQL payload within the `Username` parameter.
- No login verification required

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server.
- No prior authentication or access is needed.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
- The attacker injects SQL code via the `Username` parameter in the login form.
- Example payloads are provided, demonstrating different SQL injection methods, e.g., time-based (`SLEEP`) and error-based (using `GTID_SUBSET`).
- The `sqlmap` tool can be used to exploit this vulnerability.

**Suggested Repair:**
- Use prepared statements with parameter binding.
- Implement strict input validation and filtering.
- Minimize database user permissions.
- Conduct regular security audits.
