Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw.
*   It occurs in the School Fees Payment System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. Specifically, the `/ajax.php?action=login` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Escalation of Privileges:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential modification of sensitive data, or even complete control of the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as the vulnerability is triggered via HTTP requests.
*   **Specific Endpoint:** The vulnerable endpoint is `/ajax.php?action=login`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker can be an unauthenticated user, as the vulnerability is present in the login functionality.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to `/ajax.php?action=login` with manipulated `username` and `password` parameters.
*   The provided `sqlmap` command demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability, utilizing a saved request in `a.txt` to perform the injection.
*   The `a.txt` contains a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   The provided POC shows how an attacker can use `sqlmap` to identify and exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.
