Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-36877

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in an MSI System Management Mode (SMM) driver named `MsiApServiceSmi`. Specifically, it occurs due to the misuse of the `gRT->GetVariable` function, which is part of the UEFI Runtime Services. The driver fails to validate the size of the data retrieved by `GetVariable` before using it in subsequent memory operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Unvalidated Data Size from `GetVariable`:**
    *   The `gRT->GetVariable` function is used to retrieve the size of a variable ("WMIAcpiMemAddr").
    *   This size is then used in a second `GetVariable` call to read the variable's content.
    *   The driver does not check if the size is reasonable (should be 8 bytes), allowing an attacker to set a large size.
2.  **SMRAM Memory Corruption:**
    *   Due to the size mismatch, a large data read overflows a buffer `pWMIAcpiMemAddr` located in the SMRAM, corrupting adjacent data in SMRAM.
3.  **Arbitrary SMM Write Primitive:**
    *   Two vulnerable functions, `fnWriteStatusToMemory` and `fnResetWideString`, use a pointer contained within the overflowed memory, which can be controlled by the attacker.
    *   By manipulating the variable "WMIAcpiMemAddr" and a second variable "ApServiceAuthority", the attacker can arbitrarily write to memory (including SMRAM), by leveraging these two primitives.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution in SMM:** By exploiting the memory corruption and arbitrary write vulnerabilities, an attacker can gain code execution within the highly privileged SMM environment.
*   **Full System Control:** Code running in SMM has complete control over the system, including:
    *   Access to all of physical memory, including the operating system's memory
    *   Ability to modify the BIOS firmware
    *   Ability to intercept and inject code during the boot process.
*   **Persistent Backdoors:** Malicious code injected into the firmware can persist even after the operating system is reinstalled or the machine is rebooted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Software-based:** The vulnerability can be triggered from the operating system, specifically through a kernel driver (which can be vulnerable itself or malicious), making it easier to exploit on a system.
*   **UEFI Shell:** The vulnerability can also be triggered through the UEFI shell, with no OS required to be present, such as through a USB drive.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the target machine to interact with the operating system or the UEFI.
*   **Ability to Set EFI Variables:** The attacker needs to be able to set, modify, and delete EFI variables. This typically requires kernel-level or UEFI shell access.
*   **Kernel Driver (for OS-based exploit):** To exploit the vulnerability from Windows, the attacker will need a kernel driver.
*   **Understanding of UEFI and SMM:** Successful exploitation requires an understanding of UEFI, SMM, and reverse engineering techniques to locate, identify, and trigger the vulnerability and build an exploit chain.

**Additional Details:**

*   The write-up describes a method to convert the arbitrary SMM write primitive into a more reliable copy primitive by writing custom shellcode and utilizing the wide-byte write characteristic of one of the vulnerable functions.
*   The exploit chain also uses a 'stub loader', which is shellcode that loads additional payloads in SMRAM, bypassing restrictions enforced by `SMM_Code_Chk_En`.
*   The provided content includes a detailed analysis of the vulnerable code, along with code snippets from the exploit implementation, enhancing the information provided in the CVE description.
* The vulnerability affects a range of MSI chipsets, including Intel 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 and AM4 and AM5 platforms.
