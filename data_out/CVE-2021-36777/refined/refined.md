Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36777:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `login-proxy` used by SUSE and openSUSE services was vulnerable to a flaw where it could be tricked into sending user credentials (username and password) to an attacker-controlled server. This was due to the `login-proxy` accepting a `url` parameter which was not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsanitized URL Parameter:** The primary weakness was the login-proxy's acceptance of a `url` parameter. This parameter allowed an attacker to specify an arbitrary URL where the login form's POST data (including credentials) would be sent.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `login-proxy` failed to validate or sanitize the provided URL, thus allowing arbitrary external URLs to be used as the target for sending sensitive user information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credentials Theft:** A successful exploit would allow an attacker to capture the user's username and password when they attempt to log in through the compromised proxy.
*   **Account Compromise:** With stolen credentials, the attacker could then gain unauthorized access to the user's accounts on SUSE and openSUSE services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attack vector is a crafted URL containing the vulnerable `ICSLogin/auth-up` endpoint along with the malicious `url` parameter pointing to an attacker-controlled server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the specific vulnerable endpoint (e.g., `https://build.opensuse.org/ICSLogin/auth-up/`).
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to create the malicious URL that includes the `url` parameter pointing to their server.
*  **Server for Receiving Credentials:** The attacker needs to have a server running to receive and capture the transmitted credentials sent by the vulnerable `login-proxy`.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability affected specific login-proxy instances used within the SUSE and openSUSE infrastructure, not the services themselves.
* The vulnerability was fixed by patching out the vulnerable URL parameter. The general removal of the URL parameter needed testing which was later implemented in a commit `d0b45f98fc74b254ee0585f26647cb6c8d2c871f`
* The provided bug report includes example attack URLs showing how the exploit could be executed.
* The vulnerability has been resolved and is publicly disclosed.
