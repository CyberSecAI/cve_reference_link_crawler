## iperf-3.17 2024-05-10

* Notable user-visible changes

  + BREAKING CHANGE: iperf3's authentication features, when used with

    OpenSSL prior to 3.2.0, contain a vulnerability to a side-channel

    timing attack. To address this flaw, a change has been made to the

    padding applied to encrypted strings. This change is not backwards

    compatible with older versions of iperf3 (before 3.17). To restore

    the older (vulnerable) behavior, and hence

    backwards-compatibility, use the --use-pkcs1-padding flag. The

    iperf3 team thanks Hubert Kario from RedHat for reporting this

    issue and providing feedback on the fix. ([CVE-2024-26306](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x8qh-8j65-v4j9 "CVE-2024-26306"))(PR#1695)
  + iperf3 no longer changes its current working directory in --daemon

    mode. This results in more predictable behavior with relative

    paths, in particular finding key and credential files for

    authentication. (PR#1672)
  + A new --json-stream option has been added to enable a streaming

    output format, consisting of a series of JSON objects (for the

    start of the test, each measurement interval, and the end of the

    test) separated by newlines ([#444](https://github.com/esnet/iperf/issues/444), [#923](https://github.com/esnet/iperf/pull/923), [#1098](https://github.com/esnet/iperf/pull/1098)).
  + UDP tests now work correctly between different endian hosts

    ([#1415](https://github.com/esnet/iperf/pull/1415)).
  + The --fq-rate parameter now works for --reverse tests ([#1632](https://github.com/esnet/iperf/issues/1632), PR#1667).
  + The statistics reporting interval is now available in the --json

    start test object ([#1663](https://github.com/esnet/iperf/pull/1663)).
  + A negative time test duration is now properly flagged as an error

    (IS#1662 / PR#1666).
* Notable developer-visible changes

  + Fixes have been made to better (unofficially) support builds on

    Android ([#1641](https://github.com/esnet/iperf/issues/1641) / [#1651](https://github.com/esnet/iperf/pull/1651)) and VxWorks ([#1595](https://github.com/esnet/iperf/pull/1595)).
  + iperf3 now builds correctly on architectures without native

    support for 64-bit atomic types, by linking with the libatomic

    library ([#1611](https://github.com/esnet/iperf/issues/1611)).
