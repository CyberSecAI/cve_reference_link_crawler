## iperf-3.17 2024-05-10

* Notable user-visible changes

  + BREAKING CHANGE: iperf3's authentication features, when used with

    OpenSSL prior to 3.2.0, contain a vulnerability to a side-channel

    timing attack. To address this flaw, a change has been made to the

    padding applied to encrypted strings. This change is not backwards

    compatible with older versions of iperf3 (before 3.17). To restore

    the older (vulnerable) behavior, and hence

    backwards-compatibility, use the --use-pkcs1-padding flag. The

    iperf3 team thanks Hubert Kario from RedHat for reporting this

    issue and providing feedback on the fix. ([CVE-2024-26306](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x8qh-8j65-v4j9 "CVE-2024-26306"))(PR#1695)
  + iperf3 no longer changes its current working directory in --daemon

    mode. This results in more predictable behavior with relative

    paths, in particular finding key and credential files for

    authentication. (PR#1672)
  + A new --json-stream option has been added to enable a streaming

    output format, consisting of a series of JSON objects (for the

    start of the test, each measurement interval, and the end of the

    test) separated by newlines ([#444](https://github.com/esnet/iperf/issues/444), [#923](https://github.com/esnet/iperf/pull/923), [#1098](https://github.com/esnet/iperf/pull/1098)).
  + UDP tests now work correctly between different endian hosts

    ([#1415](https://github.com/esnet/iperf/pull/1415)).
  + The --fq-rate parameter now works for --reverse tests ([#1632](https://github.com/esnet/iperf/issues/1632), PR#1667).
  + The statistics reporting interval is now available in the --json

    start test object ([#1663](https://github.com/esnet/iperf/pull/1663)).
  + A negative time test duration is now properly flagged as an error

    (IS#1662 / PR#1666).
* Notable developer-visible changes

  + Fixes have been made to better (unofficially) support builds on

    Android ([#1641](https://github.com/esnet/iperf/issues/1641) / [#1651](https://github.com/esnet/iperf/pull/1651)) and VxWorks ([#1595](https://github.com/esnet/iperf/pull/1595)).
  + iperf3 now builds correctly on architectures without native

    support for 64-bit atomic types, by linking with the libatomic

    library ([#1611](https://github.com/esnet/iperf/issues/1611)).

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512
ESnet Software Security Advisory
ESNET-SECADV-2024-0001
Topic: iperf3 RSA authentication
Issued: 10 May 2024
Credits: Hubert Kario (RedHat)
Affects: iperf-3.2 through iperf-3.16 (inclusive)
Corrected: iperf-3.17
Cross-references: CVE-2024-26306
I. Background
iperf3 is a utility for testing network performance using TCP, UDP,
and SCTP, running over IPv4 and IPv6. It uses a client/server model,
where a client and server communicate the parameters of a test,
coordinate the start and end of the test, and exchange results.
II. Problem Description
iperf3 includes an option to require authentication before allowing a
client to begin performance tests. The authentication scheme in iperf3
versions <= 3.16 (when used without implicit rejection support, first
introduced in OpenSSL 3.2.0) is vulnerable to an RSA decryption
side-channel timing attack. This may allow a remote attacker to
decrypt a user's iperf3 password and run unauthorized network
performance tests.
The iperf series of tools perform active measurements to determine the
maximum achievable bandwidth on IP networks. It supports tuning of
various parameters related to timing, protocols, and buffers. For each
test it reports the measured throughput, loss, and other parameters.
When configured to require authentication, the EVP\_PKEY\_decrypt() or
RSA\_private\_decrypt() methods would be used in a non-constant time
fashion. An attacker that is able to send a sufficiently large number
of messages for decryption to a listening iperf3 server could recover
the plaintext credential. This is described in "Everlasting ROBOT: the
Marvin Attack" by Hubert Kario. [1]
III. Impact
It might be possible for a malicious iperf3 client to decrypt the
credential string used for authorization and use this to perform
network performance tests without authorization.
Note: Despite a similarity in names, iperf2 is unaffected by this
issue.
IV. Workaround
There is no workaround for this issue.
V. Solution
This has been fixed in iperf 3.17 by using OAEP padding. However, a
new option has been added (--use-pkcs1-padding) that will re-enable
the vulnerable code for backwards compatibility.
VI. Correction details
The bug causing this vulnerability has been fixed by the following
commit in the esnet/iperf Github repository:
master 299b356df6939f71619bf45bf7a7d2222e17d840
All released versions of iperf3 issued on or after the date of this
advisory incorporate the fix.
We'd like to thank Hubert Kario (https://github.com/tomato42) for
bringing this issue to our attention.
Security concerns with iperf3 can be submitted privately by sending an
email to the developers at .
