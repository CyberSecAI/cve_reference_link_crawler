Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromAddressNat` function of the Tenda FH1201 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of `sprintf` without proper bounds checking when constructing the URL string `addressNatList.asp?page=%s`. The `page` parameter, obtained from a POST request, is directly inserted into the format string.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- By sending a crafted POST request with an oversized `page` parameter, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow. This could lead to:
  - Denial of service (DoS) due to crashing the affected service.
  - Potentially arbitrary code execution if the overflow is carefully crafted, allowing the attacker to gain control over the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a POST request to the `/goform/addressNat` endpoint of the router's web interface.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the device's web interface.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as being required in the provided document, implying that the endpoint is likely unauthenticated, or could be exploited after gaining authentication.
