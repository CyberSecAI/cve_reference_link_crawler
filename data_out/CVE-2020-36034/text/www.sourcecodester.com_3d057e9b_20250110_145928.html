**Project: School Faculty Scheduling System using PHP/MySQLi**

## **About**

The School Faculty Scheduling System is a simple project that will help a certain school manages the schedule of their faculties. The system has 2 sides, which are the school management side of the system admin side and the faculty side. The system admin can manage all data in the system which is the list of courses, subjects, and faculty lists. The courses and subject data are used for the information needed when the schedule of the faculty is for his/her class with students. That system itself has only a minimum scope but a good start for developing a scheduling system and easy to enhance when you are also planning to add a feature for the schedules of each student class for their subject. Using this system, the faculty can only view the schedules of their classes, meetings, or other important scheduled that the school management assigns to them. The schedules of the faculty are listed on the calendar view and have an option for the view which is the daily, weekly, and monthly view of the schedule list. The calendar view schedule feature been possible in this project with the help of fullcalendar plugin/library [https://fullcalendar.io/].
