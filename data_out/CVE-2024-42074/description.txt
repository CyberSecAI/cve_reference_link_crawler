In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: amd: acp: add a null check for chip_pdev structure

When acp platform device creation is skipped, chip->chip_pdev value will
remain NULL. Add NULL check for chip->chip_pdev structure in
snd_acp_resume() function to avoid null pointer dereference.
