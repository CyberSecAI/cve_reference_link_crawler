- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure through error messages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can obtain the full path of the Jira application data directory, potentially aiding in further attacks or gaining unauthorized information about the system's configuration.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a request to the `AttachTemporaryFile` REST resource with an invalid filename.
