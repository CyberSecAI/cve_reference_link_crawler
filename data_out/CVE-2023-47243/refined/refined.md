Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The MSHOP MY SITE plugin for WordPress versions 1.1.7 and earlier suffers from a broken access control vulnerability. This means there's a missing check for authorization, authentication or nonce token in a function which allows an unprivileged user to perform actions that should require higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:**  The core issue is a lack of proper access control checks, which allows unauthorized users to execute privileged actions.
- **Missing Authorization/Authentication:** The vulnerability stems from a missing or inadequate authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a specific function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user (specifically, a "subscriber" role in WordPress) can execute privileged actions they are not supposed to have access to. The specific impact can vary depending on the functionality affected.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable function.
- The specific attack vector is not specified but it is triggered by a lack of authorization check.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a WordPress user with a subscriber role, which is a low-privilege role in WordPress. This means an attacker needs to be able to log into the WordPress site.
- The attacker must identify the vulnerable function to exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is classified as a medium severity with a CVSS score of 5.4.
- The patch is available in version 1.1.8 of the plugin.
- A virtual patch is available from Patchstack to mitigate the issue before updating.
