  "CVE-2011-0029": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Windows Remote Desktop Client handles the loading of DLL files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when Windows Remote Desktop Client incorrectly restricts the path used for loading external libraries.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure library loading"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution, complete control of the affected system, arbitrary code execution as the logged-on user, installation of programs, viewing, changing or deleting data, creation of new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Convincing a user to open a legitimate Remote Desktop configuration file (.rdp) that is located in the same network directory as a specially crafted dynamic link library (DLL) file.",
      "Email attack: Sending a legitimate .rdp attachment to a user, and convincing the user to place the attachment into a directory containing a specially crafted DLL file and to open the .rdp file.",
      "Network scenario: Placing a legitimate .rdp file and a specially crafted DLL in a UNC or WebDAV location and then convincing the user to open the .rdp file."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince the user to open a malicious .rdp file from an untrusted location (network share, WebDAV share, or local directory).",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is related to the class of vulnerabilities described in Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637, which affects how applications load external libraries."
