- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack buffer overflow in the `formSetQosBand` function due to the uncontrolled copying of user-supplied data into a fixed-size buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A classic stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability is present in the `strcpy` function call within `sub_7D644`. The destination buffer (`dest`) is a fixed 256 bytes in size, while the source (`src`) is derived from user-controlled input `list`, allowing it to exceed the destination's bounds.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By sending a crafted `list` parameter that exceeds 256 bytes, an attacker can overwrite adjacent stack memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can send a POST request to the `/goform/SetNetControlList` endpoint with a specially crafted `list` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device. No authentication requirements are mentioned, suggesting the vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
