- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An implementation issue in the Connectivity Standards Alliance Matter 1.2 protocol.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure. The protocol is designed to prevent access to information about devices within the same fabric, but the implementation flaw allows such disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A third party can disclose information about devices within the same fabric (footprinting), even when the protocol is designed to prevent such access. This allows an attacker to gain information about devices, potentially aiding in further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable by a third party on the local network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same network (adjacent). Requires low privileges to exploit.
