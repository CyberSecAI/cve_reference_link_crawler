  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an unrestricted file upload in the `student/controller.php` file of the SourceCodester Student Management System V1.0. Specifically, the input received through `doupdateimage` (line 218) is used to determine the location of the file to be written (line 237), without proper validation or sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted file upload",
      "Lack of input validation",
      "Path manipulation vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can potentially change or damage existing files, create new files, and achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by uploading malicious code.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted payload through the `_FAILE` variable, triggering the file upload functionality within the `doupdateimage` function.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No specific user privileges are mentioned as a requirement."
