Package        : php-twig
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-39261
Debian Bug     : 1020991

Marlon Starkloff discovered that twig, a template engine for PHP, did
not correctly enforce sandboxing. This would allow a malicious user to
execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.14.3-1+deb11u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your php-twig packages.

For the detailed security status of php-twig please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/php-twig>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

# Cross-domain cookie leakage

High

[GrahamCampbell](/GrahamCampbell)
published
GHSA-cwmx-hcrq-mhc3
May 25, 2022

## Package

composer

guzzlehttp/guzzle
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<=6.5.5
>=7.0.0,<=7.4.2

## Patched versions

6.5.6
7.4.3

## Description

### Impact

Previous version of Guzzle contain a vulnerability with the cookie middleware. The vulnerability is that it is not checked if the cookie domain equals the domain of the server which sets the cookie via the `Set-Cookie` header, allowing a malicious server to set cookies for unrelated domains. For example an attacker at `www.example.com` might set a session cookie for `api.example.net`, logging the Guzzle client into their account and retrieving private API requests from the security log of their account.

Note that our cookie middleware is disabled by default, so most library consumers will not be affected by this issue. Only those who manually add the cookie middleware to the handler stack or construct the client with `['cookies' => true]` are affected. Moreover, those who do not use the same Guzzle client to call multiple domains and have disabled redirect forwarding are not affected by this vulnerability.

### Patches

Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.3 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.6 or 7.4.3.

### Workarounds

If you do not need support for cookies, turn off the cookie middleware. It is already off by default, but if you have turned it on and no longer need it, turn it off.
