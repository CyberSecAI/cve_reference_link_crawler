## Description

[WatchTowerHQ](//watchtowerhq.co") Website Monitoring: Done Right

Fed up with using tools that get sold to GoDaddy, lose their founding team, and slowly die?

Tired of half-assed customer service that takes 72-144 hours to get a response?

Looking for one solution to cut the costs of many tools?

Our founding team is intact and not only focused on a world-class customer service experience, we’re focused on making WatchTowerHQ the best tool agencies and companies turn to when managing multiple websites.

### Automated Updates

Set it and forget it by scheduling WordPress theme and plugin updates in advance. Every Tuesday at 7am? Not a problem with WatchTowerHQ

### Performance Insights

Wondering why no one stays on your website? It’s probably because it’s slow…like Ford Fiesta slow. Figure out what you need to do to transform it into the Porsche it deserves to be.

### Daily Backups

Take them daily, store them for a year. Don’t be at the mercy of the intern who accidentally deleted all of your blog posts from the last 6 years. Restore them quickly from one of your backups. Automate these as you would like, or take them manually.

### Historical Data Tracking

A snapshot in time is great for some. You’re not some. Most are like you, they want to see how data looks over time. Screen shots from last May? Easy peasy. Site speed today relative to 2 months ago? One click.

### Notifications?

We’ve got you covered. You control who gets alerts, which alerts they get, and when. All for you to control within your account.

### Domain and SSL Registration Monitoring

The dreaded call from a client at 12:47am when they realize their domain has expired and a 12 year old North Korean is holding it hostage for 72 BTC. Don’t let that happen to you or your clients. Always know when your domain or SSL certificate are about to expire so you can proactively renew.

### Real-time Uptime Monitoring

Kiss false positives good-bye. Set your limits, get updated when they’re triggered.

### One-Click Access

Access your WordPress site or staging environment with one click right from the website dashboard.

WatchTowerHQ is the most robust website monitoring and management tool. Increase operational efficiency by eliminating wasted time, improving your security, and taking preventive action.

### Custom User Roles

Select from one of WatchTowerHQ’s user roles with granular permissions selection or create custom roles to fit your organizational needs.

Please note that WatchTowerHQ tracks information about your site including:

\* Domain information (Registrar, DNS, SSL, Blacklist Status, Site & Proxy IP addresses)

\* WordPress plugins, themes, and core

\* Google Lighthouse & Google Analytics data

\* Screen captures

\* CSS & JavaScript code

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
