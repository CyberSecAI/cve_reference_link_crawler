The provided content is related to CVE-2024-24198.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by casting a `sockaddr* addr` to a `sockaddr_storage* addr_store` without ensuring that `addr` is 8-byte aligned. `sockaddr_storage*` requires an 8-byte aligned address, while `sockaddr* addr` might not be 8-byte aligned which leads to undefined behavior (UB).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Type confusion/casting issue: Incorrectly casting a pointer of type `sockaddr*` to a pointer of type `sockaddr_storage*` without proper alignment.
- Undefined Behavior:  Accessing memory using the misaligned `addr_store` pointer triggers undefined behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The undefined behavior can lead to crashes, data corruption, or other unpredictable issues.
- This could potentially result in a denial-of-service or other security issues depending on the context of how the data is used after the cast.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the code path is reached where the pointer cast happens. This is within the `src/util.c` file in line 143 of smartdns. The `addr` parameter to the function needs to be unaligned

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make a call to the function with an unaligned pointer of type sockaddr as parameter
