{
  "CVE-2022-3033": {
    "root cause": "A crafted HTML email containing a `meta` tag with `http-equiv=\"refresh\"` and a URL in the `content` attribute, when replied to, triggers a network request to the specified URL, bypassing remote content blocking. This, combined with other HTML elements and attributes, allows execution of JavaScript code within the message compose document.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of META refresh tags in HTML emails.",
      "Failure to block network requests initiated by META refresh tags when composing replies.",
       "Lack of sufficient sanitization or isolation of HTML content in email replies, allowing javascript injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary JavaScript execution within the context of the message compose document. This allows attackers to potentially read and modify the message contents, including the quoted original message which might contain decrypted plaintext of encrypted data. The attacker can transmit this content to a URL they control by modifying the URL specified in the document.",
    "attack vectors": "Crafted HTML email with a `meta` tag having `http-equiv=\"refresh\"` and a URL in the `content` attribute, sent to a Thunderbird user who then replies to the email. Additionally the malicious email must contain certain other HTML elements and attributes to achieve code execution",
    "required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send a crafted HTML email to a Thunderbird user and induce the user to reply to it. The attacker needs to include specific HTML elements and attributes to enable JavaScript execution. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim."
