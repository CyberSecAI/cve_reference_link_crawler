## Description

[Video.js HTML5 Player](https://wphowto.net/videojs-html5-player-for-wordpress-757) is a user-friendly plugin that supports video playback on desktop and mobile devices. It makes super easy for you to embed both self-hosted video files or video files that are externally hosted using Video.js library.

### Video.js HTML5 Player Add-ons

* [Disable Right Click](https://wphowto.net/videojs-html5-player-for-wordpress-757)
* [Themes](https://wphowto.net/videojs-player-plugin-themes-7042)

### Video.js HTML5 Player Features

* Embed MP4 video files into a post/page or anywhere on your WordPress site
* Embed responsive videos for a better user experience while viewing from a mobile device
* Embed HTML5 videos which are compatible with modern browsers
* Embed videos with poster images
* Embed videos using videojs player
* Automatically play a video when the page is rendered if the device and browser support it
* Embed videos uploaded to your WordPress media library using direct links in the shortcode
* Clean and sleek player with no watermark
* fallbacks for other HTML5-supported filetypes (WebM, Ogv)
* HTTP streaming

### How to Use Video.js HTML5 Player

In order to embed a video create a new post/page and use the following shortcode:

```
[videojs_video url="https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.mp4"]

```

Here, “url” is the location of the MP4 video source file (H.264 encoded). You need to replace the sample URL with the actual URL of the video file.

#### Video Shortcode Options

The following options are supported in the shortcode.

**WebM**

You can specify a WebM video file in addition to the source MP4 video file. This parameter is optional.

```
[videojs_video url="https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.mp4" webm="https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.webm"]

```

**Ogv**

You can specify a Ogv video file in addition to the source MP4 & WebM video files. This parameter is optional.

```
[videojs_video url="https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.mp4" webm="https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.webm" ogv="https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.ogv"]

```

**Width**

Defines the width of the video file (Height is automatically calculated). This option is not required unless you want to limit the maximum width of the video.

```
[videojs_video url="https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.mp4" width="480"]

```

**Preload**

Specifies if and how the video should be loaded when the page loads. Defaults to “auto” (the video should be loaded entirely when the page loads). Other options:

* “metadata” – only metadata should be loaded when the page loads
* “none” – the video should not be loaded when the page loads

  [videojs\_video url=”https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.mp4″ preload=”metadata”]

**Controls**

Specifies that video controls should be displayed. Defaults to “true”. In order to hide controls set this parameter to “false”.

```
[videojs_video url="https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.mp4" controls="false"]

```

When you disable controls users will not be able to interact with your videos. So It is recommended that you enable autoplay for a video with no controls.

**Autoplay**

Causes the video file to automatically play when the page loads.

```
[videojs_video url="https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.mp4" autoplay="true"]

```

**Poster**

Defines image to show as placeholder before the video plays.

```
[videojs_video url="https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.mp4" poster="https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/poster.jpg"]

```

**Loop**

Causes the video file to loop to beginning when finished and automatically continue playing.

```
[videojs_video url="https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.mp4" loop="true"]

```

**Muted**

Specifies that the audio output of the video should be muted.

```
[videojs_video url="https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.mp4" muted="true"]

```
### Video.js HTTP Streaming

The plugin supports the m3u8 file format that can be used for Video.js HTTP Streaming. It allows you to play HLS, DASH, and other HTTP streaming protocols with Video.js, even where they are not natively supported.

```
[videojs_video url="https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.m3u8"]

```

I appreciate the stable playback of the video.
However, there are some complaints.
-There is no function to output structured data of moving images.
-In addition to mp4, you can set webm and Ogv as options, but you cannot specify the order in which they are read.
(\* Even if you want to load webm into a browser that can read webm, MP4 is the priority description, so there is no point in preparing a file in webm format.)
We are anxious to be able to respond to these issues.
