Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-3023

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `orderby` parameter within the `wp_easycart_admin_table.php` file. Specifically, the code used `sanitize_text_field` which is not sufficient to prevent SQL injection in this context.
- Lack of proper preparation of the existing SQL query, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a time-based SQL injection. An attacker can manipulate the `orderby` parameter to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Modification:** Although not explicitly stated, the ability to inject SQL suggests that an attacker could also modify or delete data, depending on the specific SQL injection.
- **Complete Compromise of the application:** The CVSS score indicates a high impact regarding confidentiality, integrity, and availability, suggesting that a successful attack can lead to a complete compromise of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The `orderby` parameter in the HTTP GET request is the attack vector.
- **Network:** The attack can be performed over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with administrator-level or higher permissions on the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was found in the `wp-easycart` plugin, specifically in versions 5.4.10 and earlier.
- The vulnerable code is located in `wp-easycart/trunk/admin/inc/wp_easycart_admin_table.php`.
- The fix involves sanitizing the `orderby` parameter using `preg_replace( '/[^a-zA-Z0-9\\_]/', $_GET['orderby'] )`, to remove non-alphanumeric and underscore characters before using it in the query, and sanitizing the 'order' parameter with `strtolower` and comparing to "desc".
- The fix was implemented in version 5.4.11 of the plugin.
- The vulnerability is considered high severity with a CVSS score of 7.2.
