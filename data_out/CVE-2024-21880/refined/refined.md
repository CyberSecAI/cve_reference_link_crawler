**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection'). The vulnerability is present in the handling of URL parameters in an authenticated endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- OS Command Injection: The Enphase IQ Gateway fails to properly sanitize user-supplied data in a URL parameter, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the Enphase IQ Gateway device. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including but not limited to:
    - Data exfiltration
    - Device compromise
    - Botnet inclusion
    - Disruption of service

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via a URL parameter in an authenticated endpoint. The attacker needs to send a crafted URL request to the affected device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated.
- The attacker must have network access to the Enphase IQ Gateway.
- The IQ Gateway needs to be modified to obtain a public IP address and connect to the public internet to be directly exploitable.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Enphase IQ Gateway versions 4.x through 7.x
- The fix is available in version 8.2.4225 and newer.
- A workaround is to ensure the IQ Gateway is not exposed to the public internet and is behind a router.
