## Description

MSI Afterburner v4.6.5.16370 is vulnerable to
a Denial of Service vulnerability by triggering the
`0x80002000` IOCTL code of the `RTCore64.sys` driver.

## Vulnerability

The `0x80002000` IOCTL code of the
`RTCore64.sys` driver allows to perform a Denial of Service,
leading to a BSOD of the affected computer caused by a
NULL pointer dereference. The handle to the driver
can only be obtained from a high integrity process.

The prologue of the vulnerable function `sub_11150` is:

```
.text:0000000000011150 mov     rax, rsp
.text:0000000000011153 mov     [rax+8], rbx
.text:0000000000011157 mov     [rax+18h], rsi
.text:000000000001115B push    rdi
.text:000000000001115C sub     rsp, 0D0h
.text:0000000000011163 and     [rsp+0D8h+SectionHandle], 0
.text:0000000000011169 and     qword ptr [rax-50h], 0
.text:000000000001116E mov     rdi, rdx     // [1]
.text:0000000000011171 mov     rcx, [rdi]   // [2]

```

At `[1]` value of second parameter on `RDX` register
is assigned to `RDI`. The second parameter is a pointer
to the `SystemBuffer` obtained from the IRP object
(`pIrp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer`)
and it's controlled by the attacker in the `lpInBuffer`
value on the `IOCTL` request call.
At `[2]` the value is dereferenced without checking if
it's a valid memory address, which result in a NULL
pointer dereference when the attacker sends a NULL
`lpInputBuffer` value:
