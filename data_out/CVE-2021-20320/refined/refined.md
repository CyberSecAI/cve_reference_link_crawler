  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A flaw was found in the s390 eBPF JIT compiler in the Linux kernel. Specifically, there were three miscompilation issues in the s390 eBPF JIT related to the `bpf_jit_insn` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The eBPF JIT compiler for the s390 architecture had miscompilation issues."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker with special user privileges could circumvent the verifier and potentially gain root privileges, leading to a confidentiality problem.",

      "Local attacker with special user privileges"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Local access",
      "Special user privileges"
    ],
        "additional_information": "The issues were present in the initial s390x eBPF JIT compiler backend implementation (v4.1+) and one issue in v5.5+. The fixes were introduced in kernel 5.15 rc3 and were backported to stable kernel updates."
