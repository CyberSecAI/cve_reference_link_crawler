| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2010090#c0)  Rohit Keshri    2021-10-03 15:58:21 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in s390 eBPF JIT in bpf_jit_insn in arch/s390/net/bpf_jit_comp.c in the Linux kernel . In this flaw, a local attacker with special user privilege can circumvent the verifier and may lead to a confidentiality problem.  Uncovered three miscompilation issues in the s390 eBPF JIT. They can be used by an unprivileged local user to circumvent the verifier and gain root privileges. This series fixes all 3; no new tests are required since Johan's tests will be integrated upstream.  - 2 fixes are for initial s390x eBPF JIT compiler backend implementation, v4.1+ - 1 fix v5.5+  [https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20210902185229.1840281-1-johan.almbladh@anyfinetworks.com/](https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20210902185229.1840281-1-johan.almbladh%40anyfinetworks.com/)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2010090#c1)  Rohit Keshri    2021-10-10 09:50:03 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2012561](show_bug.cgi?id=2012561 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-20320 kernel: s390 eBPF JIT miscompilation issues fixes [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2010090#c9)  Justin M.

Subject: [[PATCH bpf-next 00/13] bpf/tests: Extend JIT test suite coverage](#r)
Date: Thu,  2 Sep 2021 20:52:16 +0200	[[thread overview]](#r)
Message-ID: <20210902185229.1840281-1-johan.almbladh@anyfinetworks.com> (<raw>)

This patch set adds a number of new tests to the test_bpf.ko test suite.
The tests are intended to verify the correctness of eBPF JITs.

In cases when it is feasible to test all possible values exhaustively, for
example every legal ALU shift value, so is done. In other cases, a pattern
of operand values that are likely to trigger different JIT code paths are
tested. For example, instructions with two 64-bit operands are tested with
every power-of-two value combination, with some small pertubations added.

Some tests might seem a bit artificial. However this patch set, as well
as my other recent additions to test suite, is essentially a bi-product of
my work implementing a JIT for 32-bit MIPS. The tests exercise mechanisms
and aspects that I encountered during JIT development, and that I found to
be non-trivial to implement correctly.

Johan

Johan Almbladh (13):
  bpf/tests: Allow different number of runs per test case

  bpf/tests: Add test case flag for verifier zero-extension
  bpf/tests: Add JMP tests with small offsets
  bpf/tests: Add JMP tests with degenerate conditional
  bpf/tests: Expand branch conversion JIT test
  bpf/tests: Add more BPF_END byte order conversion tests
  bpf/tests: Add tail call limit test with external function call
