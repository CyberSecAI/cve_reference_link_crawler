Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-36904:

**CVE-2022-36904**

*   **Vulnerable Plugin:** Repository Connector Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 2.2.0 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Missing permission check.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with Overall/Read permission can check for the existence of an attacker-specified file path on the Jenkins controller file system. By making a sequence of requests, an attacker can effectively list the entire Jenkins controller file system.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Sending HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.

In summary, this vulnerability allows an attacker with Overall/Read permissions to potentially map out the entire filesystem of the Jenkins controller.
