Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28710:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper input validation in the Apache Airflow Spark Provider. Specifically, the host and schema fields of the JDBC hook were not properly validated, allowing for the inclusion of characters such as `/` and `?` which are used as delimiters for those fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient input sanitization/validation: The vulnerability stems from the fact that the JDBC hook did not properly sanitize or validate the host and schema inputs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file read: By crafting a malicious input for the host or schema field, an attacker could potentially read arbitrary files from the system where the Airflow Spark provider runs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted JDBC connection string: An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by providing a crafted JDBC connection string containing malicious `/` or `?` characters in the host or schema parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input parameters of the JDBC hook.
- The attacker would need to be in a position to configure a Spark connection in Airflow and be able to manipulate the JDBC connection string used by the Spark provider.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was found by Xie Jianming of Nsfocus.
- The issue was fixed in Apache Airflow Spark Provider version 4.0.1
- The fix for this vulnerability involved adding proper input validation that restricts `/` and `?` in the host and schema fields. This is documented in the related pull request: <https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30223>.
