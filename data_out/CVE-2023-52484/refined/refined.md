{
  "CVE-2023-52484": [
    {
      "Root cause": "The SMMU (System Memory Management Unit) did not check `MAX_TLBI_OPS` when invalidating TLB entries, which could lead to a soft lockup when handling a large number of per-page TLBI commands.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "The `arm_smmu_mm_invalidate_range` function, or its later renamed version `arm_smmu_mm_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs`, lacked a check for `MAX_TLBI_OPS`. This could lead to the system issuing an excessive number of per-page TLBI (Translation Lookaside Buffer Invalidation) commands when invalidating a large memory range, especially in System Virtual Addressing (SVA) cases.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A soft lockup occurs when the system attempts to invalidate a large range of TLB entries via the SMMU. The excessive TLBI commands cause the CPU to become stuck, leading to a denial-of-service condition.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by unmapping a large memory region in an SVA (System Virtual Addressing) scenario. This results in a large number of TLB invalidation requests via the SMMU.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to trigger the unmapping of a large memory region in a system using SVA with an ARM SMMUv3 that does not support range invalidation. This could involve a malicious application or a user with sufficient privileges to manipulate memory mappings."
