This vulnerability is due to improper validation of input that is passed to the VPN web client services component before being returned to the browser that is in use. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to visit a website that is designed to pass malicious requests to a device that is running Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software and has web services endpoints supporting VPN features enabled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to reflect malicious input from the affected device to the browser that is in use and conduct browser-based attacks, including cross-site scripting attacks. The attacker could not directly impact the affected device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-webvpn-LOeKsNmO>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of the following Cisco software:    + ASA Software with Cisco AnyConnect VPN or Clientless SSL VPN enabled   + FTD Software with Cisco AnyConnect VPN enabled See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.  **Determine the ASA Software Configuration**  To determine whether the software has a vulnerable feature enabled, use the **show-running-config** CLI command. In the following table, the left column lists the Cisco ASA Software features that are vulnerable. The right column indicates the basic configuration for each feature from the **show running-config** CLI command. If a device is running a vulnerable release and has one of these features enabled, it is vulnerable.       | Cisco ASA Feature | Vulnerable Configuration |   | --- | --- |   | AnyConnect Internet Key Exchange Version 2 Remote Access (with client services) | ``` crypto ikev2 enable client-services port  ``` |   | AnyConnect SSL VPN | ``` webvpn enable  ``` |   | Clientless SSL VPN | ``` webvpn enable  ``` |       **Determine the FTD Software Configuration**  To determine whether the software has a vulnerable feature enabled, use the **show-running-config** CLI command. In the following table, the left column lists the Cisco FTD Software features that are vulnerable. The right column indicates the basic configuration for each feature from the **show running-config** CLI command. If a device is running a vulnerable release and has one of these features enabled, it is vulnerable.       | Cisco FTD Feature | Vulnerable Configuration |   | --- | --- |   | AnyConnect Internet Key Exchange Version 2 Remote Access (with client services)1,2 | ``` crypto ikev2 enable  client-services port  ``` |   | AnyConnect SSL VPN1,2 | ``` webvpn enable  ``` |      1. Remote Access VPN features were introduced in Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.2.   2. Remote Access VPN features are enabled by using **Devices > VPN > Remote Access** in Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) or by using **Device > Remote Access VPN** in Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM).   Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that devices with remote access VPN services that are configured to accept only AnyConnect Internet Key Exchange Version 2 Remote Access VPN with client services disabled are not affected by this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x). This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities that are described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).  To use the tool, go to the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) page and follow the instructions. Alternatively, use the following form to search for vulnerabilities that affect a specific software release. To use the form, follow these steps:    1. Choose which advisories the tool will search-all advisories, only advisories with a Critical or High [Security Impact Rating (SIR)](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#asr), or only this advisory.   2. Choose the appropriate software.   3. Choose the appropriate platform.   4. Enter a release number-for example, **9.16.2.11** for Cisco ASA Software or **6.6.7** for Cisco FTD Software.   5. Click **Check**.
