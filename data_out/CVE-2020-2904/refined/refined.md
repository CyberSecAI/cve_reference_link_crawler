Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2904:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability lies within the MySQL database server. The provided documents indicate that multiple vulnerabilities exist in MySQL versions prior to 5.6.47, 5.7.29, and 8.0.19, with CVE-2020-2904 being one of them. While the exact technical flaw isn't detailed, it is implied to be related to the server's processing logic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The specific weakness related to CVE-2020-2904 is not explicitly mentioned. However, the documents suggest it is a vulnerability that could lead to a denial-of-service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation of CVE-2020-2904, as per the NetApp advisory, can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This means that an attacker could potentially cause the MySQL server to hang or crash repeatedly, making the database unavailable for legitimate users. The gentoo advisory states more broadly that an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process, escalate privileges, gain access to critical data or complete access to all MySQL server accessible data, or cause a Denial of Service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, as indicated by the CVSS vector string "AV:N". The attack can be launched remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
For CVE-2020-2904, the attacker would need to have high privileges on the system to exploit. As mentioned, the CVSS vector string includes "PR:H", indicating that high privileges are needed.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of MySQL, necessitating upgrades across different distributions (Fedora, Ubuntu, Gentoo, and NetApp products).
*   The provided data highlights the coordinated efforts of multiple vendors to address the vulnerabilities in their respective products using the new MySQL release which includes a fix.
*   NetApp's advisory indicates that they are aware of public discussion of these vulnerabilities.

In summary, while CVE-2020-2904 is not described in isolation, it is included within a set of MySQL vulnerabilities that could lead to a denial-of-service if exploited, with the attacker requiring high privileges on the system. The vulnerability is addressed by updating to MySQL version 8.0.20, or 5.7.30.
