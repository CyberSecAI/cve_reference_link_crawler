- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is missing general HTTP security headers in the web server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing HTTP security headers, specifically making the server vulnerable to clickjacking attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially conduct clickjacking attacks, leading to manipulation of the user interface and potentially unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. The attacker needs to trick a user into interacting with malicious content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges or authentication. The attacker must trick a user to interact with manipulated content. The vulnerability has a High attack complexity and requires User interaction to trigger the attack.
