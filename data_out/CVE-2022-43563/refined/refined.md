**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in how the `rex` search command in Splunk Enterprise handles field names, allowing an attacker to bypass SPL safeguards designed to restrict the execution of risky commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `rex` command's handling of field names is flawed.
- Insufficient safeguards exist to prevent malicious manipulation through field names.
- Risky commands can be executed by an attacker by exploiting this flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute risky commands with the permissions of a user who holds the "power" Splunk role.
- Attackers may gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify configurations, or disrupt the Splunk environment, depending on the risky commands they manage to execute.
- The vulnerability allows for high-impact attacks that could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is social engineering. The attacker needs to trick a user into initiating a request within their browser.
- This is a client-side attack, so the user's browser is the target, not the server directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request.
- The attacker must trick a Splunk user into executing the malicious request through their browser.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication or direct access to the Splunk instance.
- Exploitation requires a user interaction, specifically clicking on a malicious link or being redirected to a compromised page.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Splunk Enterprise versions below 8.2.9 and 8.1.12.
- Splunk Cloud Platform instances are being actively patched and monitored.
- Disabling Splunk Web is a workaround to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity with a CVSS score of 8.1.
