Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insecure variable substitution in Vela pipelines. Secrets could be injected into plugin parameters, image tags, and entrypoints without proper sanitization. Because these fields are often used for informational or debugging purposes (and thus logged), this allows secrets to be exposed. This bypasses the intended protection mechanism, especially for secrets restricted with the "no commands" option, giving a false sense of security.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Variable Substitution:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization when substituting variables (secrets) into pipeline configurations, particularly in parameters, image tags and entrypoints.
*   **Insufficient Log Masking:** While Vela implements log masking, it's ineffective when secrets are exposed via plugin parameters or other fields that are commonly logged by the plugin/image itself.
*   **False Sense of Security:** The "no commands" option for secrets was intended to restrict the execution of commands using those secrets, but variable substitution bypasses this protection by allowing the secrets to be passed to the plugin/image in parameters or other fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Secret Exposure:** Attackers can expose secrets by injecting them into plugin parameters, image tags, or entrypoints and subsequently logging or printing those values through the plugin's normal operation.
*   **Bypass Security Restrictions:** The vulnerability bypasses the intended restrictions set on secrets, particularly those with the "no commands" option.
*   **Increased Risk:** This unintended exposure increases the risk of secrets being compromised, potentially leading to unauthorized access to resources or systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Pipeline Configuration:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating pipeline configurations. This can be done by a malicious user who has the ability to modify the pipeline definitions or contribute pull requests.
*   **Plugin/Image Behavior:** Exploitation relies on the behavior of the plugin or image, where injected parameters are logged or printed out.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Pipeline Access:** Attackers must be able to modify or create pipeline configurations or submit pull requests with modified pipelines.
*   **Knowledge of Plugin/Image:** Attackers need to understand how a target plugin or image processes parameters, specifically if parameters are logged, printed, or otherwise exposed during execution.
*   **Basic understanding of Vela variable substitution:** Attackers need to understand how the variable substitution works and how to use it in combination with the above.

**Additional Details from the Provided Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** `go-vela/worker` versions <= 0.23.1 are affected.
*   **Patched Versions:** `go-vela/worker` versions >= v0.23.2 contain the fix.
*  **Mitigations** The provided content also details several mitigations that can be put in place to mitigate the vulnerability:
    *   Avoid providing sensitive values to plugins, especially in `parameters`.
    *   Ensure plugins follow best practices to avoid logging sensitive values.
    *   Minimize secrets with `pull_request` events enabled.
    *   Make use of build approval settings to restrict builds from untrusted users.
    *   Limit use of shared secrets.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability is rated as High severity with a CVSS score of 7.7. The CVSS vector is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N`.
*   **Fix:** The fix for this vulnerability involves splitting the environment injection based on the `allow_substitution` value. The commit `e1572743b008e4fbce31ebb1dcd23bf6a1a30297` shows changes to several files to implement this fix.
