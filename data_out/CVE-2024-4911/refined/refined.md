Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**  The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `exam` parameter of the `/view/student_exam_mark_update_form.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*  **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is located in the `/view/student_exam_mark_update_form.php` file, specifically through the `exam` parameter.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    *   Leakage of sensitive user and system data.
    *   Compromise of system security.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint with a crafted `exam` parameter containing malicious SQL code.

**Technical Details:**
The provided payload is `exam='%2B(select(0)from(select(sleep(12)))v)%2B'` which leverages a `sleep` function to demonstrate successful injection by causing a delay in response time, confirming the vulnerability.
