- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper permissions, privileges, and access controls. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from how FortiNAC handles client-initiated secure renegotiation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  CWE-264 (Improper Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls), which allows an unauthenticated attacker to trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition via client-initiated secure renegotiation in the SSL/TLS protocol.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the FortiNAC device, rendering it unavailable.
- **Attack vectors:** Unauthenticated attacker can send malicious client-initiated secure renegotiation requests to the FortiNAC device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker does not require authentication and needs network access to the FortiNAC device.
