## Tivoli Madness

**Reading Time:**   15 minutes

TL; DR: this blog post serves as an advisory for both:

* [CVE-2020-28054](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-28054): An **Authorization Bypass** vulnerability affecting **JamoDat – TSMManager Collector v. <= 6.5.0.21**
* A **Stack Based Buffer Overflow** affecting **IBM Tivoli Storage Manager** – ITSM Administrator Client Command Line Administrative Interface (dsmadmc.exe) Version 5, Release 2, Level 0.1.

Unfortunately, after I had one of the rudest encounters with an Hackerone’s triager, these are the takeaways:

* IBM Tivoli Storage Manager has reached its end of life support and will not be patched.
* No CVE number was released.
* I cannot verify if this vulnerability is also affecting the newer IBM Spectrum Protect, so, good luck with that.
