# Weak private key generation

Moderate

[drieseng](/drieseng)
published
GHSA-72p8-v4hg-v45p
May 29, 2022

## Package

SSH.NET
(.NET)

## Affected versions

2020.0.0, 2020.0.1

## Patched versions

2020.0.2

## Description

During an **X25519** key exchange, the client’s private is generated with [**System.Random**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random):

```
var rnd = new Random();
_privateKey = new byte[MontgomeryCurve25519.PrivateKeySizeInBytes];
rnd.NextBytes(_privateKey);
```

Source: [KeyExchangeECCurve25519.cs](https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET/blob/bc99ada7da3f05f50d9379f2644941d91d5bf05a/src/Renci.SshNet/Security/KeyExchangeECCurve25519.cs#L51)

[**System.Random**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random) is not a cryptographically secure random number generator, it must therefore not be used for cryptographic purposes.

### Impact

When establishing an SSH connection to a remote host, during the X25519 key exchange, the private key is generated with

a weak random number generator whose seed can be bruteforced. This allows an attacker able to eavesdrop the

communications to decrypt them.

### Workarounds

To ensure you're not affected by this vulnerability, you can disable support for `curve25519-sha256` and `curve25519-sha256@libssh.org` key exchange algorithms by invoking the following method before a connection is established:

```
private static void RemoveUnsecureKEX(BaseClient client)
{
    client.ConnectionInfo.KeyExchangeAlgorithms.Remove("curve25519-sha256");
    client.ConnectionInfo.KeyExchangeAlgorithms.Remove("curve25519-sha256@libssh.org");
}
```
