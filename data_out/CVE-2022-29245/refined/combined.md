## Package

nuget

SSH.NET
([NuGet](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anuget))

## Affected versions

< 2020.0.2

## Patched versions

2020.0.2

## Description

During an **X25519** key exchange, the client’s private is generated with [**System.Random**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random):

```
var rnd = new Random();
_privateKey = new byte[MontgomeryCurve25519.PrivateKeySizeInBytes];
rnd.NextBytes(_privateKey);
```

Source: [KeyExchangeECCurve25519.cs](https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET/blob/bc99ada7da3f05f50d9379f2644941d91d5bf05a/src/Renci.SshNet/Security/KeyExchangeECCurve25519.cs#L51)

Source commit: [sshnet/SSH.NET@b58a11c](https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET/commit/b58a11c0da55da1f5bad46faad2e9b71b7cb35b3)

[**System.Random**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random) is not a cryptographically secure random number generator, it must therefore not be used for cryptographic purposes.

### Impact

When establishing an SSH connection to a remote host, during the X25519 key exchange, the private key is generated with

a weak random number generator whose seed can be bruteforced. This allows an attacker able to eavesdrop the

communications to decrypt them.

### Workarounds

To ensure you're not affected by this vulnerability, you can disable support for `curve25519-sha256` and `curve25519-sha256@libssh.org` key exchange algorithms by invoking the following method before a connection is established:

```
private static void RemoveUnsecureKEX(BaseClient client)
{
    client.ConnectionInfo.KeyExchangeAlgorithms.Remove("curve25519-sha256");
    client.ConnectionInfo.KeyExchangeAlgorithms.Remove("curve25519-sha256@libssh.org");
}
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
