Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The application was storing LDAP user passwords in cleartext within the database upon the first login.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cleartext Storage:** The primary vulnerability is storing sensitive user passwords without any encryption or hashing. This violates fundamental security practices for password handling.
*   The `LoginController.scala` file was directly passing and storing the LDAP user's password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker gaining access to the database could read the cleartext passwords of LDAP users, compromising their accounts and potentially leading to further unauthorized access within the application or connected systems.
*   **Lateral movement:** By obtaining the LDAP credentials, an attacker could potentially use these credentials to gain access to other systems in the network that are also authenticated via LDAP.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Database Access:** The primary attack vector involves gaining unauthorized access to the application's database where the cleartext passwords were stored. This could be achieved through various means, such as SQL injection, exploiting database vulnerabilities, or compromising database credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Database Access:** The attacker needs the ability to access and read the database. This may require some privilege escalation.
*   **Knowledge of LDAP Login Usage:** The vulnerability specifically affects LDAP users, meaning the attacker would need to be targeting instances where LDAP login is enabled in the application.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Versions 1.5.0 up to 1.19.1 of the `thmmniii/fbs-core` Docker image are affected.
*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.19.2.
*   **Workaround:** The workaround is to disable LDAP login by setting `LDAP_ENABLED=false`.
*   **CVSS Score:**  The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.0 (Moderate).
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is associated with CWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format)
*   **Fix:** The fix involved modifying the `LoginController.scala` to no longer store the password during login and the commit `8d896125263e1efb1b70990987c7704426325bcf` addresses this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is specific to the feedbacksystem application developed by thm-mni-ii.
