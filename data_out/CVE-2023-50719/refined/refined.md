Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-50719:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the Solr-based search in XWiki indexes and handles user properties, specifically password hashes and potentially other sensitive information like API keys. The Solr indexing code, after a change introduced in a previous commit, started indexing password properties, which were previously excluded. This was due to a change in how single properties were indexed, where they started using the same code as the main document, which lacked the necessary filtering of password properties.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of password hashes (and potentially plain text passwords in specific cases related to CVE-2022-41933) and other sensitive data (like API keys) through the Solr search index.
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** While user profiles are generally public by default, the issue isn't about direct profile access; rather, it is that the indexed data is accessible through a search query.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Filtering:** The Solr indexer was not filtering or sanitizing sensitive properties like password hashes before indexing them.
*   **Regression:** The vulnerability was introduced as a regression, as the original Solr indexing code had a check to prevent indexing password properties.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can gain access to password hashes of all users, which could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts through offline password cracking. If plain text passwords are stored due to the previous CVE-2022-41933, this is a more critical confidentiality breach.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Other sensitive data, such as API keys stored in configurations, can also be exposed, leading to further security risks and potential compromise of integrated services.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  While not directly indicated in the report, successful password cracking could lead to privilege escalation by gaining access to administrator accounts.
*   **System Compromise:** Although not stated directly, if API keys or other configuration data allow access to systems connected with XWiki, these external systems could be compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is network-accessible, as the Solr search functionality is typically available via web interface.
*   **Search Query:** The attack is performed by crafting a specific search query `propertyvalue:?* AND reference:*.password` and deselecting the "Document" property type in the search result filtering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any user credentials or special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the XWiki instance and ability to interact with the search interface to craft and execute the search query.
*   **Basic Knowledge of XWiki Search:** The attacker needs to understand how to construct search queries and use the search result filter interface.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in XWiki versions >= 7.2-milestone-2, < 14.10.15; >= 15.0-rc-1, < 15.5.2; and >= 15.6-rc-1, < 15.7-rc-1.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in versions 14.10.15, 15.5.2, and 15.7-rc-1.
*   The fix involved changing the indexing of single properties to use the same code as the main document for getting the property's value and fixing this vulnerability.
*   A specific commit ([3e5272f](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/3e5272f2ef0dff06a8f4db10afd1949b2f9e6eea)) addresses this issue by introducing email obfuscation settings. However, this same commit also fixes the issue of indexing password properties by implementing the fix that changes the indexing of single properties.
* The vulnerability is also related to and is part of the fix for [GHSA-2grh-gr37-2283](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-2grh-gr37-2283)
