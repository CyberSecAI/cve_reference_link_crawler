# Solr search discloses password hashes of all users

High

published
GHSA-p6cp-6r35-32mh
Dec 15, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-search-solr-api
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 7.2-milestone-2, < 14.10.15
>= 15.0-rc-1, < 15.5.2
>= 15.6-rc-1, < 15.7-rc-1

## Patched versions

14.10.15
15.5.2
15.7-rc-1

## Description

### Impact

The Solr-based search in XWiki discloses the password hashes of all users to anyone with view right on the respective user profiles. By default, all user profiles are public. To reproduce, it is sufficient to search for `propertyvalue:?* AND reference:*.password` and then deselect the "Document" property under "Result type" in the "Refine your search" widget at the right of the search results. If this displays any passwords or password hashes, the installation is vulnerable.

By default, passwords in XWiki are salted and hashed with SHA-512. On XWiki versions affected by [CVE-2022-41933](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-q2hm-2h45-v5g3), passwords are stored in plain text if they have been set using the password reset feature. This might affect XWiki installations that are using an external authentication mechanism such that passwords aren't stored in the wiki.

This vulnerability also affects any configurations used by extensions that contain passwords like API keys that are viewable for the attacker. Normally, such passwords aren't accessible but this vulnerability would disclose them as plain text.

### Patches

This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.15, 15.5.2 and 15.7RC1. This vulnerability has been patched as part of patching [GHSA-2grh-gr37-2283](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-2grh-gr37-2283), the part of the fix that changes the indexing of single properties to use the same code as the main document for getting the property's value fixes this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

We're not aware of any workarounds apart from upgrading to a fixed version.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
