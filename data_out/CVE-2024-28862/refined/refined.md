- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect default file permissions for `.rb` files in versions 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 of the `rotp` gem.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `.rb` files have 0666 permissions which means they are world-writable by default. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege.
- **Impact of exploitation:** This could potentially allow any user on the system to modify the Ruby code within the `rotp` gem, leading to supply chain attacks, code injection, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need write access to the file system where the gem is installed, and then could modify the `.rb` files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs write permissions to the directory where the `rotp` gem files are installed. This could be a compromised user account on the same system, or perhaps a vulnerability in how the gem installation is managed.
