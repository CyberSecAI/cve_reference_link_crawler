The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability, which aligns with the nature of CVE-2023-31939.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `costomer_id` GET parameter is directly incorporated into a SQL query without any sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data exfiltration: The attacker can retrieve sensitive data from the database, as demonstrated by the example of retrieving the database name.
- Potential for other attacks: Depending on the database and application configuration, the attacker could potentially modify or delete data, or even gain control over the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- By sending a crafted GET request to `customer_edit.php` with a malicious payload in the `costomer_id` parameter.
- The specific vulnerable URL is `http://10.142.221.111/Travel/admin/customer_edit.php?costomer_id=104`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable URL.
- The attacker needs to understand how to construct SQL injection payloads.
