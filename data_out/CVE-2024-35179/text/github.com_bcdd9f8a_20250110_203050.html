# Unprivileged user can read files as root

Moderate

## Package

Stalwart Mail Server

## Affected versions

<= 0.7.3

## Patched versions

0.8.0

## Description

### Summary

When using `RUN_AS_USER`, the specified user (and therefore, web interface admins) can read arbitrary files as root.

### Details

Traditional UNIX services (ISC bind just to give an example) start up with these steps, in order:

1. Start as privileged binary somewhere in /usr (writable by root only)
2. Read config from /etc including the listeners (writable by root only)
3. Set up the listeners while still privileged
4. Drop the privileges
5. Access data somewhere in /var (writable by the unprivileged user)

What makes this secure is that the unprivileged user cannot write anything that is interpreted as root. stalwart-mail adopts the "privdrop after bind"-part, but ignores the "access unprivileged data only after privdrop"-part.

### PoC

1. Configure `server.listener.https.bind = "%{file:/etc/shadow}%"` (works as local user or via the API, rejected by the web interface)
2. View the log after restart (either as local user or via the web interface):

```
Failed to parse setting "server.listener.https.bind": Invalid socket address "root:$y$j9T…(redacted)

```
### Impact

Admins who have set up to run stalwart with `RUN_AS_USER` who:

1. handed out admin credentials to the mail server but expect these to only grant access according to the `RUN_AS_USER`
2. are attacked where the attackers managed to achieve Arbitrary Code Execution using another vulnerability

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
