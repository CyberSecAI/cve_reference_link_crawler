- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. Specifically, Forcepoint One Endpoint prior to version 22.01 on Microsoft Windows allows users with Administrator privileges to tamper with registry keys.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect authorization, registry key tampering vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** Users with administrator privileges can disable anti-tampering mechanisms, which then allows them to disable Forcepoint One Endpoint and the protection it offers.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access by a user with Administrator privileges on a Windows machine with vulnerable Forcepoint One Endpoint installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** User with local Administrator privileges on a machine with a vulnerable version of Forcepoint One Endpoint.
