- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of file paths when setting up an SMS media, allowing the user to specify an arbitrary file path instead of a valid GSM modem device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary File Read, Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The Zabbix server attempts to communicate with the arbitrary file using AT commands, resulting in the corruption of the file and leaking of a small portion of its content in the UI. There is also a potential for Denial of Service (DoS) if the Zabbix server is run by a more privileged user.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the GSM modem file setting in the SMS media configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires a high level of privileges within the Zabbix application to modify the SMS media settings.
