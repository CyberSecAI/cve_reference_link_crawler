Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-27095:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input within the Decidim admin panel. Specifically, an attacker can modify certain records uploaded to the server by injecting malicious code, such as `<svg onload=alert('XSS')>`. They can then manually input the returned blob ID into form fields by modifying the edit page source.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the admin panel due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the administrator's browser session, potentially leading to:

*   Data theft
*   Session hijacking
*   Malicious actions performed on behalf of the administrator
*   Defacement of the admin interface.

**Attack vectors:**
Network-based attack, where the attacker crafts a malicious payload and injects it by directly modifying the requests to the server and page source.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have high privileges, requiring access to the admin panel. This can be gained through compromised credentials or other means.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious requests and modify the page source to inject the blob ID.
*   User interaction from an administrator is required in order to trigger the vulnerability, by visiting the malicious data.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability affects versions of Decidim `0.27.5` and earlier.
* It has been patched in versions `0.27.6` and `0.28.1`.
* The severity of this vulnerability is considered Moderate, with a CVSS score of 5.4
* The vulnerability is related to OWASP ASVS v4.0.3-5.1.3.
* The official description was published after a 2-month embargo.
