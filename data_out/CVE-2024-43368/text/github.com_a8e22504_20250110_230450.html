### @afcapel **[afcapel](/afcapel)** commented [May 28, 2024](#issue-2321227344) • edited Loading

This PR fixes a security vulnerability related to pasting malicious code in a Trix editor. In [PR #1149](https://github.com/basecamp/trix/pull/1149), we added sanitation for Trix attachments with a `text/html` content type. However, Trix only checks the content type on the paste event's `dataTransfer` object. As long as the `dataTransfer` has a content type of `text/html`, Trix parses its contents and creates an `Attachment` with them, even if the attachment itself doesn't have a `text/html` content type. Trix then uses the attachment content to set the attachment element's `innerHTML`.

This PR introduces a new `HTMLSanitizer.setHTML(element, html)` [method](https://github.com/basecamp/trix/blob/e87da3fa4285d8ebf22de4a029085be4f9f1d7bd/src/trix/models/html_sanitizer.js#L10-L12) to safely set the innerHTML of an element and then replaces all instances where `innerHTML` was being directly assigned without sanitation.

Ref.

Sorry, something went wrong.
