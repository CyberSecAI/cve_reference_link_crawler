# XSS Vulnerabilities in Trix Editor

High

[afcapel](/afcapel)
published
GHSA-qjqp-xr96-cj99
May 7, 2024

## Package

npm

trix
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>= 2.0.0, <2.1.1
>=0.9.0, <1.3.2

## Patched versions

2.1.1
1.3.2

## Description

The Trix editor, versions prior to 2.1.1, is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution when copying and pasting content from the web or other documents with markup into the editor. The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of pasted content, allowing an attacker to embed malicious scripts which are executed within the context of the application.

**Vulnerable Versions**:

* 1.x series up to and including 1.3.1
* 2.x series up to and including 2.1.0

**Fixed Versions**:

* v1.3.2
* v2.1.1

**Vector**:

* **Bug 1**: When copying content manipulated by a script, such as:

```
document.addEventListener('copy', function(e){
  e.clipboardData.setData('text/html', '<div><noscript><div class="123</noscript>456<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)//"></div></noscript></div>');
  e.preventDefault();
});
```

and pasting into the Trix editor, the script within the content is executed.

* **Bug 2**: Similar execution occurs with content structured as:

```
document.write(`copy<div data-trix-attachment="{&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;text/html&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;img src=1 onerror=alert(101)&gt;HELLO123&quot;}"></div>me`);
```
### Impact:

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's session, potentially leading to unauthorized actions being performed or sensitive information being disclosed.

### Remediation:

**Update Recommendation**: Users should upgrade to Trix editor version 2.1.1 or later, which incorporates proper sanitization of input from copied content.

**CSP Enhancement**: Additionally, enhancing the Content Security Policy (CSP) to disallow inline scripts can significantly mitigate the risk of such vulnerabilities. Set CSP policies such as script-src 'self' to ensure that only scripts hosted on the same origin are executed, and explicitly prohibit inline scripts using script-src-elem.

# XSS vulnerability on copy & paste

Moderate

[rosa](/rosa)
published
GHSA-qm2q-9f3q-2vcv
Aug 14, 2024

## Package

npm

trix
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 2.1.4

## Patched versions

2.1.4

## Description

The Trix editor, versions prior to 2.1.4, is vulnerable to XSS when pasting malicious code. This vulnerability is a bypass of the fix put in place for [GHSA-qjqp-xr96-cj99](https://github.com/basecamp/trix/security/advisories/GHSA-qjqp-xr96-cj99 "GHSA-qjqp-xr96-cj99"). In [#1149](https://github.com/basecamp/trix/pull/1149), we added sanitation for Trix attachments with a `text/html` content type. However, Trix only checks the content type on the paste event's `dataTransfer` object. As long as the `dataTransfer` has a content type of `text/html`, Trix parses its contents and creates an `Attachment` with them, even if the attachment itself doesn't have a `text/html` content type. Trix then uses the attachment content to set the attachment element's `innerHTML`.

### Impact

An attacker could trick a user to copy and paste malicious code that would execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's session, potentially leading to unauthorized actions being performed or sensitive information being disclosed.

### Patches

**Update Recommendation:** Users should upgrade to Trix editor version 2.1.4 or later, which incorporates proper sanitization of input from copied content.

### Workarounds

This is not really a workaround but something that should be considered in addition to upgrading to the patched version. If affected users can disallow browsers that don't support a Content Security Policy, then this would be an effective workaround for this and all XSS vulnerabilities. Set CSP policies such as `script-src 'self'` to ensure that only scripts hosted on the same origin are executed, and explicitly prohibit inline scripts using `script-src-elem`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @afcapel **[afcapel](/afcapel)** commented [May 28, 2024](#issue-2321227344) • edited Loading

This PR fixes a security vulnerability related to pasting malicious code in a Trix editor. In [PR #1149](https://github.com/basecamp/trix/pull/1149), we added sanitation for Trix attachments with a `text/html` content type. However, Trix only checks the content type on the paste event's `dataTransfer` object. As long as the `dataTransfer` has a content type of `text/html`, Trix parses its contents and creates an `Attachment` with them, even if the attachment itself doesn't have a `text/html` content type. Trix then uses the attachment content to set the attachment element's `innerHTML`.

This PR introduces a new `HTMLSanitizer.setHTML(element, html)` [method](https://github.com/basecamp/trix/blob/e87da3fa4285d8ebf22de4a029085be4f9f1d7bd/src/trix/models/html_sanitizer.js#L10-L12) to safely set the innerHTML of an element and then replaces all instances where `innerHTML` was being directly assigned without sanitation.

Ref.

* [Sanitize HTML content in data-trix-\* attributes  #1149](https://github.com/basecamp/trix/pull/1149)
