Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-24039:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The "addCell" JavaScript function fails to properly sanitize user-controllable input before including it into the generated XML body of the XLS report document.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The application doesn't sanitize user-provided data before using it to generate an XLS report, allowing the injection of arbitrary XML content.
*   **Special Element Injection (CWE-75):** The vulnerability stems from a failure to sanitize special elements, which leads to the possibility of injecting malicious XML code into the generated report.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious XML content, an attacker could potentially deliver a crafted XLS file to a higher-privileged user (administrator). Opening this malicious file on the administrator's workstation could lead to remote code execution.
*   **Malicious File Delivery:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the application as a vehicle for distributing malicious files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability resides in the webserver application of the affected devices.
*   **XLS Report Generation:** The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious XML into content used to generate XLS reports.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Restricted Privileges:** The attacker only needs to have restricted privileges to poison content used for generating XLS reports.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires the higher-privileged user (admin) to open the maliciously crafted XLS report to trigger code execution on their workstation.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Desigo PXC4 and PXC5 devices and is fixed in version V02.20.142.10-10884 or later.
*   The document provides a CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.0 for this vulnerability.
