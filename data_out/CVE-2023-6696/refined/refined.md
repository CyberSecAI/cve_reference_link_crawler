Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6696:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in multiple AJAX functions within the "Popup Builder" WordPress plugin. While nonce checks are present in some functions, these nonces are exposed on a logged-in user's profile page. This allows low-privileged users to bypass authorization restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** Several AJAX functions in the plugin lack proper capability checks. This means that actions intended for administrators could be performed by users with lower privileges, including subscribers.
*   **Nonce Exposure:** Although some functions include nonce checks, these nonces can be easily obtained from the profile page of a logged-in user, negating their security benefits.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  The missing authorization allows for blind SSRF attacks, where an attacker can potentially make requests to internal resources via the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Actions:** Subscribers and other low-privileged users can perform actions that should be restricted to administrators.
*   **Subscriber Manipulation:** Attackers can delete subscribers.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can conduct SSRF attacks, which may lead to exfiltration of sensitive data from internal resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **AJAX Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted AJAX requests to the vulnerable plugin's endpoints.
*   **Nonce Replay:** The attacker utilizes an exposed nonce obtained from any logged-in user's profile page.
*   **Lack of Capability Check:** The plugin's AJAX functions fail to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform the requested action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Logged-in user:** The attacker must be a logged-in user of the WordPress site, even a low-privileged user such as a subscriber.
*   **Access to profile page:** The attacker needs to access a logged-in user's profile page to obtain the nonce.
*   **Knowledge of plugin endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable AJAX endpoint URLs and their expected parameters.
