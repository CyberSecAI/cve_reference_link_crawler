| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1204716#c0)  Paolo Perego   2022-10-25 16:39:25 UTC  ``` During a SUMA/UYUNI audit, an arbitrary file disclosure vulnerability it has been found in the ScapResultDownload servlet.  When downloading the openscap result for a given system, it is possible to evade from the location where the report is created and access arbitrary files.  On a default installation, tomcat is running as a non-privileged user process, so the impact on the file system confidentiality is for files viewable by tomcat user, for groups www, susemanager and tomcat and for files viewable by anyone.  To exploit this vulnerability there is no need for a particular script but an authenticated SUMA session is needed.  CVSS is 5.0: <https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:H>  PoC <https://server_ip/rhn/systems/details/audit/ScapResultDownload.do?sid=1000010000&xid=1&name=../../../../../../../etc/passwd>  Mitigation The getAbsolutePath() method in the ScapResultFile class should discard characters to evade from report output directory ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1204716#c2)  Johannes Segitz   2022-10-26 06:56:50 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2022-43753 for this ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1204716#c7)  Paolo Perego   2022-10-26 09:26:35 UTC  ``` CRD: 2022-11-04 15.00 UTC ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1204716#c10)  Paolo Perego   2022-11-04 16:13:41 UTC  ``` Fixed versions: SUMA 4.3.2, 4.2.10 and Uyuni-2022.10 ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1204716#c11)  Swamp Workflow Management   2022-11-04 17:30:14 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2022:3880-1: An update that fixes three vulnerabilities is now available.
