- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ScapResultDownload` servlet in SUMA/UYUNI does not properly sanitize the filename parameter, allowing path traversal. Specifically, the `getAbsolutePath()` method in the `ScapResultFile` class does not discard characters that would allow navigating outside the intended report output directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can access arbitrary files on the server that are readable by the tomcat user (or any user running the tomcat process). This includes files readable by the `www`, `susemanager`, and `tomcat` groups, or files that are world readable.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated user can craft a URL with a manipulated `name` parameter in the `ScapResultDownload.do` servlet request. The `name` parameter will include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../../etc/passwd`)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs an authenticated SUMA/UYUNI session to exploit the vulnerability.

The provided content gives more detail than the CVE description by detailing the vulnerable component (`ScapResultDownload` servlet and the `ScapResultFile` class) and the specific method with the vulnerability (`getAbsolutePath()`). The impact and attack vector are also clearly described, including an example URL demonstrating the vulnerability. The content also specifies the fix versions for the vulnerability.
