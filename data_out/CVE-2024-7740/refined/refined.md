{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an API endpoint in ltcms that does not validate user-supplied URLs before using them in a curl_exec() function call.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
      "Lack of input validation",
      "Lack of protocol filtering",
       "Unauthenticated access to vulnerable endpoint"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform a blind SSRF attack, potentially accessing internal network resources, performing unauthorized actions on internal services, or reading sensitive information. The use of file:// or dict:// protocols extends the possible impact.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP request to the vulnerable API endpoint `/api/test/download`",
       "Manipulating the `url` parameter within the request to control the target of the server-side request"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need authentication, the vulnerable endpoint can be called directly. Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and the parameter name is required."
