| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=8764#c0)  Shiloong   admin  2024-04-16 10:00:14 UTC  ``` (on behalf of Huai-Yuan Liu <qq810974084@gmail.com>)  The memory allocation function ACPI_ALLOCATE_ZEROED does not guarantee a successful allocation, but the subsequent code directly dereferences the pointer that receives it, which may lead to null pointer dereference.  To fix this issue, a null pointer check should be added. If it is null,  return exception code AE_NO_MEMORY. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=8764#c1)  Shiloong   admin  2024-04-16 10:20:03 UTC  ``` The bugfix has been accepted by upstream: <https://github.com/acpica/acpica/pull/946/commits/4d4547cf13cca820ff7e0f859ba83e1a610b9fd0> ``` |  |
