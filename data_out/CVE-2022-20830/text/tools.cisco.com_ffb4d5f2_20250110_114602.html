This vulnerability exists because the GUI is accessible on self-managed cloud installations or local server installations of Cisco vManage. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the exposed GUI of Cisco SD-AVC. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view managed device names, SD-AVC logs, and SD-AVC DNS server IP addresses.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-avc-NddSGB8>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected self-managed cloud installations and local server installations of Cisco vManage that have SD-AVC enabled.  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.  **Note:** Installations of cloud-based servers that are provided fully configured by the Cisco Cloud Operations Team do not expose the SD-AVC GUI. If, at the request of the customer, the SD-AVC GUI has been exposed, that environment is affected by this vulnerability. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  However, as a mitigation for this vulnerability, customers who have enabled the SD-AVC component can ensure that access from northbound networks to TCP port 10502 is restricted.  While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Fixed Releases At the time of publication, the release information in the following table(s) was accurate. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.  The left column lists Cisco software releases, and the right column indicates whether a release was affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory and which release included the fix for this vulnerability.       | Cisco vManage Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 18.3 and earlier | Not affected. |   | 18.4 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 19.2 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 20.1 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 20.3 | 20.3.4.120.3.5 |   | 20.4 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 20.5 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 20.6 | 20.6.1 |   | 20.7 | 20.7.1 |   | 20.8 | Not affected. |   | 20.9 | Not affected. |       **Note:** The vulnerability described in this advisory is associated with the vulnerability described in Cisco Security Advisory [cisco-sa-sdavc-ZA5fpXX2](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdavc-ZA5fpXX2). Cisco recommends that administrators take into account both vulnerabilities when planning for a software upgrade.
