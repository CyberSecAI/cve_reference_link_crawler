Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7479:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **improper verification of the cryptographic signature** in the `TeamViewer_service.exe` component of TeamViewer Remote full client and Host.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature:** The application fails to properly validate the cryptographic signature of the driver being installed. This allows an attacker to bypass signature verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker with local unprivileged access to escalate their privileges on the Windows system.
*   **Arbitrary Driver Installation:**  The attacker can install malicious drivers, potentially gaining complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the Windows system where the vulnerable TeamViewer client is installed.
*   The attacker exploits the improper signature verification during driver installation, likely by providing a modified or unsigned malicious driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Unprivileged Access:** The attacker must have some form of local access to the target Windows system, even with limited privileges.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   **TeamViewer Full Client (Windows):** Versions prior to 15.58.4, 14.7.48796, 13.2.36225, 12.0.259312 and 11.0.259311
*    **TeamViewer Host (Windows):** Versions prior to 15.58.4, 14.7.48796, 13.2.36225, 12.0.259312 and 11.0.259311
