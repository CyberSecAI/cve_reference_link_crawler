Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2024-26745**

*   **Root Cause:** The IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) table is not properly initialized in the kdump kernel when using SR-IOV (Single Root I/O Virtualization) on PowerPC pSeries systems. This occurs because the `iommu_table_setparms_lpar()` function only considers the "ibm,dma-window" property for IOMMU table initialization and does not handle the Dynamic DMA Windows (DDWs) that are added to the FDT (Flattened Device Tree) for SR-IOV devices during kdump.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Missing IOMMU Initialization:** When kdump is initiated, and the system is using SR-IOV, the default "ibm,dma-window" property is removed from the FDT and replaced with DDW properties. The kdump kernel does not initialize the IOMMU table with these DDW properties, which leads to the use of an uninitialized IOMMU table.
    *   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** When the device driver attempts to access the uninitialized IOMMU table to allocate Translation Control Entries (TCEs) for the SR-IOV device, it results in a NULL pointer dereference, as the necessary IOMMU structures haven't been set up.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Kernel Panic:** The vulnerability leads to a kernel panic, rendering the system unusable. The panic occurs because of a NULL pointer dereference when accessing the IOMMU table during DMA operations.
    *   **Failure of kdump:** The kdump mechanism, which is meant to save system crash data for analysis, fails due to the kernel panic, preventing post-mortem analysis of the original system failure.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **kdump with SR-IOV:** The vulnerability is triggered when a system configured with SR-IOV encounters a kernel crash, and the kdump mechanism is initiated.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Kernel Crash:** The attacker needs to trigger a kernel crash on a PowerPC pSeries system that is using SR-IOV.
    *   **kdump Trigger:** The kdump mechanism must be configured to be triggered after the kernel crash. The attacker must cause the system to attempt to use the kdump function with SR-IOV, which will then trigger the vulnerable code.

* **Additional Details:**
    *   The fix involves modifying the `pci_dma_find` function to locate both the default "ibm,dma-window" property and the DDW properties ("ibm,dma-window", "direct64" or "dma64"). If the DDW is available, it takes precedence over the default DMA window property.
    *   The code now parses the DDW properties (`liobn`, `dma_base`, `tce_shift`, and `window_shift`) and initializes the IOMMU table using these values, preventing the NULL pointer dereference.
    *   The fix also addresses the case where a dedicated adapter might have both default and DDW properties. In this scenario, the DDW property is used to initialize the IOMMU table.
