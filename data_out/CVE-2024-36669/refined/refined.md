Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2024-36669:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue. The application at `http://127.0.0.1:80/admin/type_deal.php?mudi=add` does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Lack of CSRF protection mechanisms (e.g., CSRF tokens) in the application.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can potentially modify or create data within the application by submitting forged requests through the `/admin/type_deal.php?mudi=add` endpoint. The provided proof of concept specifically attempts to add or modify deal types with crafted parameters.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack is carried out by tricking a user into loading a malicious HTML page (provided as proof of concept) which then sends a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage and entice an authenticated user of the vulnerable application to visit the webpage while having an active, valid session with the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided PoC shows how an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a form that is automatically submitted when the malicious page is loaded.
*   The vulnerable endpoint is `/admin/type_deal.php?mudi=add` in the `idccms V1.35` application.
*   The `backURL`, `dataType`, `dataTypeCN`, `dataID`, `theme`, `rank`, `x`, and `y` parameters are manipulated in the crafted request and are likely used to add or modify deal types.
