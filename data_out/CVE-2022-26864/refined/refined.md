- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an input validation issue in prior versions of Dell BIOS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Input validation vulnerability that allows a locally authenticated attacker to send malicious input to System Management Interrupt (SMI).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass security controls within the System Management Mode (SMM), potentially leading to system compromise. The impact includes high confidentiality, high integrity and low availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker requires local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be locally authenticated with high privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
