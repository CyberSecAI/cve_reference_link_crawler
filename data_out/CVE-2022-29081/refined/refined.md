Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-29081

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the request URI in `com.manageengine.ads.fw.api.RestAPIUtil.isRestAPIRequest()`. Specifically, the method does not normalize the URI, allowing attackers to bypass security checks by using manipulated URLs like `**/x/../RestAPI/**`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The core issue is the ability to bypass authentication and authorization checks meant to restrict access to certain REST API endpoints.
- **Improper URI Handling:** The lack of proper URI normalization in the `isRestAPIRequest` function is the root cause of the bypass.
- **Access Control Issues:** The vulnerability exposes sensitive API endpoints that should not be accessible to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application and invoke several operations, including:
    - Restarting the service.
    - Accessing dashboard details.
    - Applying a product license and retrieving existing license details.
    - Creating new server certificates.
    - Creating/downloading server CSRs and applying server certificates.
    - Fetching event logs and setting up synchronization schedules.
    - Terminating active RDP sessions launched via ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus (in PAM360 and Password Manager Pro).
    - Potentially filling up the file system by creating a large number of attacker-controlled certificate files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Manipulated URI:** The attacker uses a crafted URL, such as `**/x/../RestAPI/**`, to bypass the security checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable ManageEngine product.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need valid credentials.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of HTTP requests to send manipulated URLs.

**Products Affected:**
- ManageEngine Access Manager Plus (versions 4000 to 4301)
- ManageEngine Password Manager Pro (versions 10103 to 12006)
- ManageEngine PAM360 (versions 4001 to 5400)

**Fix:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in Access Manager Plus version 4302, Password Manager Pro version 12007, and PAM360 version 5401.
- The fix involved adding a security validation check on the API request URI and removing unused API URLs.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Tenable advisory provides more technical details, including the vulnerable code snippet and a proof-of-concept exploit.
- The vulnerability is rated as High severity with a CVSSv3 score of 8.6.
