## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Secure Copy Content Protection < 4.0.9 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

Go to Copy Protection > General Settings > Integrations
Add the following payload to both API fields: "><script></script><img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>

### Affects Plugins
