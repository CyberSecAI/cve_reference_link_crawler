**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-34124
*   **Vulnerability Category:** Out-of-bounds Write ([CWE-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html))
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution
*   **Severity:** Critical
*   **CVSS Base Score:** 7.8
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, which occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), indicating a flaw in memory management where data can be written outside of the intended memory region.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to run malicious code on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Attack Vector (AV):** Local (L) - The attack must occur locally, meaning the attacker would need some level of access to the system.
*   **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L) - The attack is relatively easy to perform.
*   **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N) - The attacker does not need special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R) - User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U) - The vulnerability's impact is limited to the affected component.
*   **Confidentiality Impact (C):** High (H) - There is a high impact on confidentiality.
*   **Integrity Impact (I):** High (H) - There is a high impact on integrity.
*   **Availability Impact (A):** High (H) - There is a high impact on availability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs local access to the system and requires some form of user interaction to trigger the out-of-bounds write condition to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Affected Software:**
Adobe Dimension version 3.4.11 and earlier on Windows and macOS.
