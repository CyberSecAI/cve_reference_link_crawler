Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control checks in the GLPI application when handling AJAX requests for dropdown menus. Specifically, the `entity_restrict` parameter, intended to limit results to a specific entity, could be manipulated to bypass intended restrictions, leading to unauthorized data access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inadequate Parameter Validation:** The `entity_restrict` parameter was not properly validated or sanitized, allowing an attacker to potentially access data across different entities.
*   **SQL-query-as-a-service:** The application uses the `displaywith` parameter to include specific additional fields in the response, which essentially allows arbitrary SQL queries, bypassing access controls.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** While IDOR tokens were implemented to prevent unauthorized access to dropdown data, they could be obtained and manipulated, bypassing the security mechanism.
*   **Lack of Privilege Checks:** The `Dropdown::getDropdownValue` function did not check user privileges for the requested table, allowing access to sensitive information of other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Email Enumeration:** An attacker could enumerate email addresses of all GLPI users.
*   **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** An attacker could extract sensitive data, such as password hashes and other fields, from the database.
*   **Account Compromise:** By combining the email enumeration vulnerability with password reset functionality, an attacker could obtain a reset token and potentially compromise user accounts, including admin accounts.
*   **Complete Database Access:** By abusing the IDOR tokens, an attacker could dump the content of arbitrary database tables, not just those related to users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited through network requests.
*   **AJAX Requests:** The attack relies on manipulating AJAX requests to `/ajax/actors.php` and `/ajax/getdropdownValue.php`.
*   **POST Parameters:** The vulnerability is triggered through crafting specific POST requests with malicious parameters, such as `entity_restrict`, `displaywith` and `_idor_token`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid account within the GLPI system, even with low privileges.
*   **Knowledge of GLPI API:** The attacker must have knowledge of the GLPI AJAX endpoints and their parameters.
*   **Ability to Craft Requests:** The attacker must be able to craft HTTP requests to exploit the vulnerability, including generating valid CSRF tokens and IDOR tokens.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by BorelEnzo
*   The vulnerability was patched in GLPI version 10.0.13.
*   The original CVE description is misleading, since an authenticated user could access any table, not only tables on which he has read access.
