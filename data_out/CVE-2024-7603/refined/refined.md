- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path before it's used in file operations within the HTTP API service of the Logsign Unified SecOps Platform.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability. Improper input validation allows an attacker to manipulate file paths.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation enables a remote attacker to delete arbitrary directories on the affected system with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed remotely through the HTTP API service, which listens on TCP port 443 by default.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
