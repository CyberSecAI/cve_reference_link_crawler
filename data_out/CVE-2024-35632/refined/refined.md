- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The impact varies depending on the specific actions the plugin allows.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a CSRF attack, where a malicious actor crafts a request that is then executed by an authenticated user without their knowledge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into executing the malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
