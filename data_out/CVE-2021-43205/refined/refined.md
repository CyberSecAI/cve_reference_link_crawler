- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An improper access control vulnerability in FortiClient for Linux allows an unauthenticated attacker to access the confighandler webserver via external binaries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive information due to improper access control, specifically, external access to the confighandler webserver.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can gain unauthorized access to the confighandler webserver, potentially leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation involves accessing the confighandler webserver via external binaries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable FortiClient service. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
