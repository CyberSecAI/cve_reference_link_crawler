- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Social Settings" section of the CSZ CMS admin panel. Specifically, the "Profile Link" fields for social networks are vulnerable to stored XSS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Input provided in the social settings is not sanitized before being rendered on the page.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML. This can lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to:
  - Stealing user session cookies.
  - Defacing websites.
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves crafting a malicious payload (e.g., a JavaScript snippet) and inserting it into the "Profile Link" fields of the social network settings within the CSZ CMS admin panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker needs access to the CSZ CMS admin panel.
  - They require permissions to modify the social settings.
  - No user login is needed to see the effects of the XSS injection since it affects public pages of the website
