# Improper Authentication in Tripwire Enterprise 9.1 APIs

### FI-2024-006 - Improper Authentication in Tripwire Enterprise 9.1 APIs

Severity

Critical

Published Date

03-Jun-2024

Updated Date

03-Jun-2024

Vulnerabilities

CVE-2024-4332

##### Notes

Description

---

An authentication bypass vulnerability has been identified in the REST and SOAP API components of Tripwire Enterprise (TE) 9.1.0 when TE is configured to use LDAP/Active Directory SAML authentication and its optional "Auto-synchronize LDAP Users, Roles, and Groups" feature is enabled. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication if a valid username is known. Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow remote attackers to gain privileged access to the APIs and lead to unauthorized information disclosure or modification.

Severity

Critical

CVE

CVE-2024-4332

CWE

CWE-303:Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm

Discovery Date

25-Apr-2024

CSSv3.1

9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Affected Products

Tripwire Enterprise 9.1.0

##### Vulnerability Notes

Other

---

Tripwire ExpertOps was not affected by this vulnerability

Remediation: Vendor Fix

---

**Upgrade to Tripwire Enterprise 9.1.1** to remediate this vulnerability.

If you are using the LDAP/Active Directory system login method with "Auto Synchronize LDAP Users, Roles, and Groups" checked and are unable to upgrade, the issue may be mitigated by disabling "Auto Synchronize LDAP Users, Roles, and Groups" in the Settings manager under the "Login Method".  While this will mitigate the vulnerability, it will also disable API access. To continue using the TE APIs, you will need to upgrade or choose a different login method.

Users who have not enabled Auto Synchronize are unaffected, as are those who are on versions prior to 9.1.0. However, Fortra strongly recommends upgrading to the latest release.
