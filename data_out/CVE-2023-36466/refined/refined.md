- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When editing a topic, the application fails to properly validate the topic title. This allows users to bypass validations related to title length, the number of emojis in the title, and creating blank titles.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation for topic titles.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can create topics with excessively long titles, titles containing numerous emojis, or blank titles, potentially leading to UI issues or other unexpected behavior.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user with the ability to edit topics. User interaction is required.
