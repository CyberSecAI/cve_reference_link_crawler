Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the `formSetPPTPServer` function of the Tenda AC18 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `endIp` parameter received by the `formSetPPTPServer` function is copied into a local buffer (`v9`) on the stack without proper size validation. This allows an attacker to write beyond the buffer's boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how sending a large payload via the `endIp` parameter can cause the router to crash.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The content suggests that it is possible to write an exploit (`exp`) to gain a shell on the device, thus achieving remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetPptpServerCfg` endpoint.
- **`endIp` Parameter:** The malicious payload is embedded within the `endIp` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the router's web interface, either directly or through an intermediary.
- **Valid Cookie:** The attacker needs a valid session cookie (`password=You cookie`) to authenticate with the router's web interface.
