    "vulnerabilities": [
      "The BUILTIN\\Users group is granted RX permissions to files in the %windir%\\system32\\config directory.",
      "VSS shadow copies of the system drive, which are automatically created in some configurations, allow access to these files."
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation (LPE). An attacker can extract and leverage account password hashes, discover the original Windows installation password, obtain DPAPI computer keys, and obtain a computer machine account for use in a silver ticket attack.",

      "Local access to a vulnerable Windows 10 system.",
       "Exploitation requires access to the file system."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a non-administrative, authenticated local user.",
    "additional_information": "VSS shadow copies are required for the exploitation of this vulnerability, but they are created automatically in most systems with drives larger than 128 GB when installing updates and MSIs. Vulnerable systems report `BUILTIN\\Users:(I)(RX)` when running `icacls %windir%\\system32\\config\\sam`. The vulnerability is also known as HiveNightmare and SeriousSAM."
