Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation for the `userId` parameter in the `process.php` file of the Event Calendar In PHP application. User-supplied input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code via the `userId` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can access sensitive information stored in the database.
*   **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Comprehensive System Control:**  Attackers could potentially gain control of the system through database manipulation.
*   **Service Interruption:** Exploitation could lead to service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `userId` parameter in the `process.php` file, accessible via HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a registered regular user, making this a less restrictive attack scenario.
*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application with a malicious `userId` parameter.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited using various SQL injection techniques, including time-based blind, boolean-based blind, error-based, and UNION query methods.
*   The provided GitHub issue includes a SQLmap example to demonstrate the vulnerability, which indicates an automated exploit is feasible.
*   The vulnerable file is `process.php` in the "Event Calendar In PHP" project, version v2.3

**Mitigation:**

The provided mitigation steps are:

1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This prevents SQL injection by separating SQL code from user input.
2.  **Input validation and filtering:** This involves validating user input data to ensure it meets expectations.
3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Restricting database permissions limits potential damage.
4.  **Regular security audits:** Regular audits help to identify and address security vulnerabilities promptly.
