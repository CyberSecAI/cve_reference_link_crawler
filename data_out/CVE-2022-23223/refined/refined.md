Subject: CVE-2022-23223: Password leakage in Apache ShenYu

Description:

The HTTP response will disclose the user password. This issue affected
Apache ShenYu 2.4.0 and 2.4.1.
```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The HTTP response discloses user passwords.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Password leakage in HTTP responses.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Exposure of user passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access and further compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specific HTTP request will cause the server to leak the passwords of all users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

Subject: CVE-2022-23223: Apache ShenYu (incubating) Password leakage

Severity: moderate

Description:

The HTTP response will disclose the user password.
When users send the request like the following URL
"dashboardUser?currentPage=1&pageSize=12", the response will disclose
all the passwords of the users.
This issue affects Apache ShenYu (incubating) 2.4.0 and 2.4.1.

Mitigation:

Upgrade to Apache ShenYu (incubating) 2.4.2 or apply patch
<https://github.com/apache/incubator-shenyu/pull/2357>.
```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Sending a specific HTTP request leaks user passwords in the response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Password leakage in HTTP responses.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exposure of all user passwords, leading to unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending an HTTP GET request to the `dashboardUser` endpoint with specific query parameters (e.g., `currentPage=1&pageSize=12`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

The second message provides more specific details, including the vulnerable URL and mitigation steps.
