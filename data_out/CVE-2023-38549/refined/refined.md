- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is present in Veeam ONE and allows a user with the "Veeam ONE Power User" role to obtain the access token of a user with the "Veeam ONE Administrator" role through XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with the "Veeam ONE Power User" role can gain access to the access token of a "Veeam ONE Administrator", potentially leading to privilege escalation and unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionalities.
- **Attack vectors**: By exploiting the XSS vulnerability, an attacker can inject malicious code that, when executed by a "Veeam ONE Administrator", steals their access token. This would require the attacker to have at least a "Veeam ONE Power User" role.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have a "Veeam ONE Power User" role and must be able to get a "Veeam ONE Administrator" user to interact with the malicious XSS payload.
