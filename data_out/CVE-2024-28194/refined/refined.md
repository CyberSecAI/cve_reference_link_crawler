- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses a hardcoded string `MyPrivateKey` as the secret key for signing and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Hardcoded cryptographic secret
    - Authentication bypass
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can forge valid JWTs and impersonate any user, including admin users.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network based attack
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to know the hardcoded secret (`MyPrivateKey`), which is available in the source code.
    - The attacker needs to know the `userId` of the target user, which can be obtained via the `/accounts` endpoint
    - Attackers can then forge a valid JWT for any user and use it to gain access as the target user.
