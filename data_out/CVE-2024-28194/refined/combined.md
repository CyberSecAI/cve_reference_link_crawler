# Authentication Bypass Because of Hardcoded JWT Secret

Critical

[Yooooomi](/Yooooomi)
published
GHSA-gvcr-g265-j827
Mar 13, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<1.8.0

## Patched versions

1.8.0

## Description

### Summary

YourSpotify version <1.8.0 uses a hardcoded JSON Web Token (JWT) secret to sign authentication tokens. Attackers can use this well-known value to forge valid authentication tokens for arbitrary users.

### Details

The following functions handling JWT processing in YourSpotify use the hardcoded string `MyPrivateKey` to sign and verify the tokens:

* Route `/spotify` in `server/src/routes/oauth.ts`
  + GitHub Link:

    [your\_spotify/server/src/routes/oauth.ts](https://github.com/Yooooomi/your_spotify/blob/b205bfb606fbc72f41eb79fb6fcb9a230bf8819d/server/src/routes/oauth.ts#L25)

    Line 25
    in
    [b205bfb](/Yooooomi/your_spotify/commit/b205bfb606fbc72f41eb79fb6fcb9a230bf8819d)

    |  | const token = sign({ userId: isOffline }, 'MyPrivateKey', { |
    | --- | --- |
* Middleware `baselogged` in `server/src/tools/middlewares.ts`
  + GitHub Link:

    [your\_spotify/server/src/tools/middleware.ts](https://github.com/Yooooomi/your_spotify/blob/b205bfb606fbc72f41eb79fb6fcb9a230bf8819d/server/src/tools/middleware.ts#L58)

    Line 58
    in
    [b205bfb](/Yooooomi/your_spotify/commit/b205bfb606fbc72f41eb79fb6fcb9a230bf8819d)

    |  | const userId = verify(auth, 'MyPrivateKey') as { userId: string }; |
    | --- | --- |

This JWT "secret" is the same in all installations and deployments of the application. It can easily be extracted from the source code.

This means that attackers can forge JWT signatures easily, either with custom tools or publicly available tools such as <https://jwt.io/> or CyberChef.

### Proof of Concept

After logging in with Spotify, the YourSpotify backend saves a signed JWT in the `token` cookie to save the authentication state of the current user. As an example, such a JWT may look like this:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiI2NWNlNzM5ZmNhNDhkZDI1ODk3NmE1OGEiLCJpYXQiOjE3MDgxMTAyMDIsImV4cCI6MTcwODExMzgwMn0.mIOWcMxJry4SXuD8_9ol4tUZE9sO_QfABUXv-CCUsC4

```

This token can be decoded using widely publicly available tools such as <https://jwt.io/> or CyberChef. The token from this example decodes to the following JSON header and payload:

```
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

{
  "userId": "65ce739fca48dd258976a58a",
  "iat": 1708110202,
  "exp": 1708113802
}
```

As the signature secret is hardcoded and publicly available, attackers can bypass authentication by specifying the `userId` of any YourSpotify user, setting an appropriate expiration time in `exp`, and re-signing the JWT with the hardcoded secret `MyPrivateKey`.

The following CyberChef recipe can be used to demonstrate how easy this process is: <https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=JWT_Sign('MyPrivateKey','HS256')&input=ewogICAgInVzZXJJZCI6ICJpbnNlcnQgYW55IHVzZXJJZCBoZXJlIiwKICAgICJpYXQiOiAxNzA4MTEwMjAyLAogICAgImV4cCI6IDIwMDAwMDAwMDAKfQ>

To reproduce the issue, simply change the `userId` in the token to a valid value for your specific instance and change the `token` cookie to the new JWT.

It must be noted that attackers need knowledge of valid YourSpotify `userId` for successful exploitation. However, these IDs are MongoDB IDs and are not intended to be unguessable values.

Furthermore, the `userId` of all registered users can be obtained by any other registered user or guests using guest tokens by querying the `/accounts` endpoint. It is therefore likely that attackers can obtain a valid `userId`.

### Impact

This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication and authenticate as arbitrary YourSpotify users, including admin users.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
