- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A specially crafted regular expression within a database query can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability arises from incorrect handling of regex bounds.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect Regular Expression (CWE-185). The regex parsing and execution logic has a flaw that allows a malicious or malformed regex to cause excessive resource consumption, leading to a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in a denial of service, making the database unavailable. The vulnerability does not lead to data loss or other impacts.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a database query containing a specific type of regular expression. This is a remote attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be a user authorized to perform database queries. The attacker needs to craft the regex.
