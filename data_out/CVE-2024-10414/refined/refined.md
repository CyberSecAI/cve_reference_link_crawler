Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10414

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization or validation in the `edit-brand.php` file of the PHPGurukul Vehicle Record System 1.0. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize the "Brand Name" input field before displaying it, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary weakness is the presence of an XSS vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject client-side scripts into the web page which will then be executed in the browsers of other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The injected JavaScript code can perform malicious actions in the context of the victim's browser. This includes actions like:
   -  Session Hijacking: Stealing session cookies to gain unauthorized access.
   -  Phishing: Redirecting users to fake login pages to capture credentials.
   -  Defacement: Altering the content of the web page.
   -  Malware Distribution: Redirecting users to download malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the "Brand Name" field in the `/admin/edit-brand.php` file.
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Brand Name" field.
- When the page is loaded or reloaded, the unsanitized script will be executed in the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel of the Vehicle Record System 1.0 to modify or add the vehicle brand names.
-  The attack can be initiated remotely.

**Technical Details:**

- The specific XSS payload used for testing was: `%3cIMG%20%22%22%22%3e%3cSCRIPT%3ealert(%22XSS%22)%3c%2fSCRIPT%3e%22%3e`, which decodes to `<IMG """"><SCRIPT>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>">`
- The vulnerable parameter is the "Brand Name" field (although the initial researcher advisory mentions the parameter "phone_number," which might be a mistake due to the label "Brand Name").

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the Vehicle Record System.
- An exploit is reportedly available.
