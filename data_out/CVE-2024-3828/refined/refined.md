- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Spectra Pro plugin allows lower-privileged users (Author+) to create registration forms and set the default user role to 'administrator'.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Privilege Management.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Authenticated attackers with author-level access or higher can create new administrator-level accounts, leading to full site compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based exploitation through the WordPress interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to have an account with at least 'author' privileges to create a registration form and set the default role to 'administrator'.
