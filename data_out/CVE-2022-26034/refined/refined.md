Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-26034:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to an improper authentication issue. This means the system does not correctly verify the identity of users or processes trying to access or manipulate data within the affected system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** The core weakness is that the system fails to properly authenticate users or processes attempting to access data managed by the AD server within CENTUM VP and ProSafe-RS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Data Breach/Falsification:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access, potentially resulting in the leakage or modification of data managed by the AD server.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The attack vector involves exploiting the improper authentication within the affected Yokogawa products.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   An attacker would need the capability to interact with the affected systems (CENTUM VP and ProSafe-RS) and exploit the authentication vulnerability to gain unauthorized access and potentially modify or steal data. The attacker's position in the network is not specified in this document but would need to be able to interact with the affected components.
