Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the `get_image_alt` function within the Elementor plugin. Specifically, the `alt` attribute of an image, which is user-controlled, is not properly sanitized before being rendered in the HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. User-provided data (specifically the image's alt text) is stored in the database and later rendered without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `get_image_alt` function fails to properly sanitize the `alt` attribute before using it in the image tag, allowing the injection of malicious code.
*   **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The output is not properly escaped when the `alt` attribute is rendered in the HTML, allowing the malicious code to execute in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking/Stealing:** The attacker could potentially hijack user sessions or steal cookies.
*   **Defacement/Malware Distribution:** The attacker could potentially deface websites or redirect users to malicious sites and distribute malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Image Upload/Configuration:** An attacker with Contributor or higher privileges can upload an image with malicious JavaScript code in the "alt text" field. This malicious code is stored in the database and will execute when the page containing the malicious image is loaded.
*   **Page Load:** When a user visits the page where the manipulated image is displayed the stored XSS vulnerability is triggered, and the injected malicious script is executed in their browser.
*   **User Interaction:** While the XSS is stored, the attack may still require a user to visit a page containing the malicious code. Tricking a user into clicking a link to the malicious page could be necessary.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least "Contributor" level access to the WordPress site, allowing them to upload media with malicious alt text.
*   **Ability to Upload Media:** The attacker must be able to upload images and manipulate the alt text associated with them.
*   **No Direct User Interaction Required:** Once the malicious data is stored, any user visiting a page with the vulnerable image will trigger the XSS. However, getting a user to visit the page would likely be necessary.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerability is present in the `get_image_alt` function of the `Control_Media` class located in `elementor/includes/controls/media.php`
* The vulnerable code is in  `elementor/includes/controls/groups/image-size.php` when the image HTML is generated, specifically where the `alt` attribute is included via  `Control_Media::get_image_alt( $image )`

The fix for this vulnerability was introduced in version 3.19.0. This includes sanitization of the data prior to rendering it in the HTML, using `esc_attr` on the image alt text.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` links provided in the content show the code in `elementor/tags/3.18.3/includes/controls/media.php` and `elementor/tags/3.18.3/includes/controls/groups/image-size.php`, and the change in `elementor/trunk/includes/controls/groups/image-size.php` that introduced the fix. This confirms that the vulnerability was in version 3.18.3 of the plugin.
*   The provided Wordfence article also confirms the version affected and the nature of the vulnerability.
