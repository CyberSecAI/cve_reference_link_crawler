Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetApp products incorporate the Oracle Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) software libraries. Java SE (JDK and JRE) versions below 6u132, 7u122, 8u113 are susceptible to multiple vulnerabilities that could lead to a takeover of Java, a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of Java, or to the unauthorized reading or modification of a subset or all of the data accessible to the Java process. This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available.

#### Impact

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may lead to a takeover of Java, a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of Java, or to the unauthorized reading or modification of a subset or all of the data accessible to the Java process.

# IcedTea: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201707-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in IcedTea, the worst of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/icedtea-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **7.2.6.10**< **3.4.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **7.2.6.10**>= **3.4.0** |

### Background

IcedTea’s aim is to provide OpenJDK in a form suitable for easy
configuration, compilation and distribution with the primary goal of
allowing inclusion in GNU/Linux distributions.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in IcedTea. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

Note: If the web browser plug-in provided by the dev-java/icedtea-web
package was installed, the issues exposed via Java applets could have
been exploited without user interaction if a user visited a malicious
website.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process, gain access to information, or cause a Denial
of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All IcedTea binary 7.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/icedtea-bin-7.2.6.10:7"

```

All IcedTea binary 3.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/icedtea-bin-3.4.0:8"

```

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in the bypass of
Java sandbox restrictions, denial of service, arbitrary code execution,
incorrect parsing or URLs/LDAP DNs or cryptoraphice timing side channel
attacks.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 7u121-2.6.8-2~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-7 packages.
