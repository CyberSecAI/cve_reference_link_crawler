Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-3260:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of CVE-2017-3260 is a vulnerability within the Oracle Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) software libraries. Specifically, it affects versions below 6u132, 7u122, and 8u113.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The vulnerability is present in the Java SE (JDK and JRE) software. The advisory indicates multiple vulnerabilities in Java SE, and CVE-2017-3260 is one of them. It leads to a security flaw in how Java handles certain operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
*   Takeover of the Java process, allowing an attacker to control the execution environment.
*   A hang or frequently repeatable crash of the Java process, resulting in a partial or complete denial of service (DoS).
*   Unauthorized reading or modification of a subset or all of the data accessible to the Java process, leading to data breaches or manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is primarily network-based.  An attacker could exploit the vulnerability remotely, potentially through a malicious website or application that leverages the vulnerable Java component.  Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered through a Java applet, and if the web browser plug-in provided by `dev-java/icedtea-web` was installed, the issues could have been exploited without user interaction if a user visited a malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to be able to send network requests or have a user interact with a malicious applet in a vulnerable Java environment. The attacker does not require prior authentication or access to the target system. The attack can be performed remotely. The attacker also needs to be able to entice a user to visit a malicious website.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as **HIGH** severity (8.3 CVSS v3 score) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.
*   Several NetApp products are affected because they incorporate the vulnerable Oracle Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) software libraries.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201701-65) and Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3782-1) also address this vulnerability.
* The advisory also highlights that exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.

In summary, CVE-2017-3260 is a high-severity vulnerability in Java SE that can be exploited remotely through network requests or malicious applets to gain control of the Java process, cause a DoS, or read/modify sensitive data.
