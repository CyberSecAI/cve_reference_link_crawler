| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Aironet Access Point Software Resource Exhaustion Denial of Service Vulnerability Medium   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-airo-ap-dos-PPPtcVW  First Published: 2024 March 27 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCwh81027](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwh81027)     CVE-2024-20354     CWE-460       CVSS Score: [Base 4.7](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2024-20354     CWE-460       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-airo-ap-dos-PPPtcVW/csaf/cisco-sa-airo-ap-dos-PPPtcVW.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the handling of encrypted wireless frames of Cisco Aironet Access Point (AP) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.  This vulnerability is due to incomplete cleanup of resources when dropping certain malformed frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting as a wireless client to an affected AP and sending specific malformed frames over the wireless connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause degradation of service to other clients, which could potentially lead to a complete DoS condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-airo-ap-dos-PPPtcVW>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco Aironet AP Software:    + 800 and 1900 Series ISR Integrated APs   + Aironet 1530 Series Outdoor APs   + Aironet 1552 Outdoor APs   + Aironet 1570 Series Outdoor APs   + Aironet 1700 Series APs   + Aironet 2700 Series APs   + Aironet 3700 Series APs   + Industrial Wireless 3700 Series APs For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.

Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Fixed Releases At the time of publication, the release information in the following tables was accurate. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.  The left column lists Cisco software releases, and the right column indicates whether a release was affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory and which release included the fix for these vulnerabilities.  The process to upgrade an AP requires upgrading the wireless controller to which the AP is registered. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in the following tables:  **APs Managed by Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) or Mobility Express (ME)**          | Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 8.4 and earlier | Not vulnerable. |   | 8.5 releases earlier than 8.5.171.0 | Not vulnerable. |   | 8.5.171.0 and later | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 8.6 | Not vulnerable. |   | 8.7 | Not vulnerable. |   | 8.8 | Not vulnerable. |   | 8.9 | Not vulnerable. |   | 8.10 releases earlier than 8.10.130.0 | Not vulnerable. |   | 8.10.130.0 and later | 8.10.190.81 |      1. This fix is included only in a special engineering image. This image can be obtained from Cisco TAC through a TAC Service Request. **APs Managed by Catalyst 9800 Wireless Controller or Embedded Wireless Controller (EWC)**          | Cisco Catalyst 9800 Wireless Controller Software Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 16.11 and earlier | Not vulnerable. |   | 16.12 releases earlier than 16.12.4a | Not vulnerable. |   | 16.12.4a and later | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 17.1 | Not vulnerable. |   | 17.2 | Not vulnerable. |   | 17.3 | 17.3.9 |   | 17.4 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 17.5 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 17.6 | 17.6.7 |   | 17.7 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 17.8 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 17.9 | 17.9.5 |   | 17.10 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 17.11 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 17.12 | 17.12.2 |   | 17.13 | Not vulnerable. |       The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.
