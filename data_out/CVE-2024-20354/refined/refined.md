- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incomplete cleanup of resources when dropping certain malformed encrypted wireless frames.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Resource exhaustion due to improper handling of malformed wireless frames.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device, leading to degradation of service for other clients, potentially resulting in a complete DoS.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker connects as a wireless client to an affected AP and sends specific malformed frames over the wireless connection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the affected access point and capable of sending malformed wireless frames.
