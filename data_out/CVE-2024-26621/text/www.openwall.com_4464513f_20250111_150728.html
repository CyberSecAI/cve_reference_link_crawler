I believe you're correct, but I believe what Yves-Alexis Perez is showing is the
flags that are being *passed* to the kernel (whether or not they DO anything).
Which is why there's a proposal to *make* MAP_DENYWRITE do something in this case.

My plea is that if this DOES start doing something, PLEASE document that ASAP
(including a note that it USED to be ignored). I fear that this security property
might, on some platforms, depend on a quiet undocumented change.
