For clarity, I'm going use the term "x86_32" to clarify that we're talking about
32-bit architectures & *excluding* the far-more-common 64-bit case.

So clearly there needs to be a way to provide this information :-).

Shouldn't that be MAP_EXECUTABLE, not MAP_DENYWRITE?
If you use MAP_DENYWRITE,
a program that mmaps in a large non-code dataset won't have hugepage
optimizations applied, which might be a significant performance regression.

Also, the mmap man page:
<https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html>
says that  MAP_EXECUTABLE and MAP_DENYWRITE are ignored.
There's a risk that some programs are taking that to heart & not using those flags
even when they should. If one of those flags *will* have an effect now, then it'd be a good idea
to document that :-).
