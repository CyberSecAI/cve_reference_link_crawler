Right.

I don't have one at hand unfortunately, but I'll try setting up a VM or
something just to be sure. Thanks.

I think there are not a lof of *modern* IA-32 installations, especially on
“generic” distributions, but there might still be some in network appliances
or something.

I guess setting vm.mmap_rnd_bits (or CONFIG_ARCH_MMAP_RND_BITS) to 16 at least
helps on those platforms (like they did on Ubuntu) but I wonder if a fix (or a
revert) in the kernel would be better (do we really need the alignment perfs
on IA-32 kernels?)
