And just to clarify on my use of terminology in the list above:

When I say "x86" {systems,platforms}, I mean a 32-bit Linux distribution
with an i386/i686 kernel and associated userland binaries.  This may be
virtualized on a x86_64 CPU, or emulated (in my case) on a 32-bit x86 CPU.

When I say "x86_64" {systems,platforms}, I'm referring to a common
x86_64 64-bit Linux distro.  And on such a distro, you can run 32-bit
code if you like.  In my case, I compiled test-mmap.c as a 32-bit app by
installing gcc-multilib and compiling with gcc -m32.

IOW, "x86" as I use it is 32-bit Linux.  "x86_64" is 64-bit Linux.
