I believe that most executables are writable only by root, but available
to unprivileged users.  Since the purpose of MAP_DENYWRITE seems to have
been ensuring that executables cannot change out from underneath running
programs, it would need to work when unprivileged users map the file;
thus the DoS problem.

Simple solution:
    - write the new executable under a temporary name
    - use link(2) to create a new name for the existing executable
    - use rename(2) to atomically replace the existing executable
    - use unlink(2) to remove the old version after any needed checks

You can dispense with link(2) and unlink(2) if you do not want to
preserve a backup of the old executable.  Using this method will change
the executable's inode number (meaning that it really is a different
file) and that means that the old version can remain on disk for as long
as it remains in use, even after its last name has been removed.
