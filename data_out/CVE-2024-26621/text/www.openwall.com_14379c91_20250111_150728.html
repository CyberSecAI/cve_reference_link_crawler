Hey,

I'm testing on my Debian sid laptop with Linux kernel 6.9.7-1. This is amd64
but running test-mmap built with -m32, and I get:

for i in {0..10}; do ./test-mmap < zeros; done
mmap(NULL, 2097152, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE, 0, 0) = 0xf7df3000
mmap(NULL, 2097152, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE, 0, 0) = 0xf7d98000
mmap(NULL, 2097152, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE, 0, 0) = 0xf7d6f000
mmap(NULL, 2097152, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE, 0, 0) = 0xf7de7000
mmap(NULL, 2097152, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE, 0, 0) = 0xf7df6000
mmap(NULL, 2097152, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE, 0, 0) = 0xf7cfd000
mmap(NULL, 2097152, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE, 0, 0) = 0xf7d25000
mmap(NULL, 2097152, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE, 0, 0) = 0xf7d48000
mmap(NULL, 2097152, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE, 0, 0) = 0xf7dad000
mmap(NULL, 2097152, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE, 0, 0) = 0xf7d7b000
mmap(NULL, 2097152, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE, 0, 0) = 0xf7df4000

So it *looks* to me like it's “properly” randomized (for a 32b process). I
don't have a 32b install handy so I can't test but I'd assume the -m32 to
exhibit the same behavior? This is with vm.mmap_rnd_compat_bits=8.

Or am I doing something wrong?
