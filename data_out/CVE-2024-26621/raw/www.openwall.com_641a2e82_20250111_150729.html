&gt;  |&gt; So if someone says "this  was a source of
&gt;  |&gt; denial‐of‐service attacks" then i need to wrap my head, and it is
&gt;  |&gt; not as if an in-between-the-lines reference to MAP_DENYWRITE ring
&gt;  |&gt; any bells except that i think the flag has been removed.
&gt;  |
&gt;  |The manpage indicates that, long ago, a mapping with MAP_DENYWRITE would 
&gt;  |effectively make the underlying file read-only, even to root, for as 
&gt;  |long as the mapping exists.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you.  I add a search result from Google Groups which still
&gt; exists for doing so collected just now:

&gt;   &gt;I.E. it seems like they go out of their way to ALLOW writing to the libaries.
&gt;   &gt; (I assume they KNOW the difference between MAP_DENYWRITE, MAP_COPY, and
&gt;   &gt;MAP_PRIVATE...?)
&gt; 
&gt;   Note that the kernel will refuse to honour MAP_DENYWRITE from user
&gt;   space, so I'm afraid that changing ld.so won't do a thing.
&gt; 
&gt;   The reason the kernel refuses to honour it, is that MAP_DENYWRITE is an
&gt;   excellent DoS-vehicle - you just mmap("/etc/passwd") with MAP_DENYWRITE,
&gt;   and even root cannot write to it.. Vary nasty.
&gt; 
&gt;   Which is why the kernel only allows it when the binary loader itself
&gt;   sets the flag, because security-conscious application writers are
&gt;   already aware of the "oh, a running binary may not be writable" issues.
&gt; 
&gt;   So sorry..

&gt;   &gt; I _really_ doubt that something does write() on /etc/passwd. Create a
&gt;   &gt; file and rename it over the thing - sure, but that's it.
&gt;   &gt; &lt;/nit&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;   Well, yeah, bad choice. Can you believe /var/run/utmp or similar?
&gt; 
&gt;   And yes, we could add checks for the thing being executable before we
&gt;   accept MAP_DENYWRITE instead of just ignoring the flag from user space.
&gt;   Nobody has cared enough to make the effort.
&gt; 
&gt;   Until now?
&gt; 
&gt;   Linus
&gt; 
&gt; Some findings:
&gt;   . I note that the mentioned files are writable by only root (and
&gt;   i would assume MAP_DENYWRITE to only work if i could do so
&gt;   myself).
&gt;   . Capabilities have become more fine-grained.
&gt;   . I always whimper when i have to rm(1) a running executable before
&gt;   placing an updated variant on Linux, on BSDs i simply over-cp(1)
&gt;   (and i do not understand as long as one gets either the one or
&gt;   the other when executing the path).
&gt;   . Shouldn't mandatory file locking have the same effect.
&gt; But it is ok to me, Linux is as it is, and they progress and
&gt; iterate over the code at an unbelievable speed.  And some things
&gt; are just the way they are.  (Or change.  Back.  And forth.  And
&gt; back etc etc)

Executable files and shared libraries should _never_ be modified
in-place.  They should _always_ be renamed over.  Otherwise, a program
might be a mixture of the old and new version, with completely undefined
results when the program is run.

&gt;  |&gt;   And then
&gt;  |&gt; someone who seems to know uses it nonetheless in a small showcase
&gt;  |&gt; program, likely trying to say even more in-between-the-lines.
&gt;  |
&gt;  |That commit message seems to indicate that the program was using 
&gt;  |SHM_HUGETLB when it should have been using MAP_HUGETLB, those constants 
&gt;  |represent different bits, and passing SHM_HUGETLB to mmap(2) will be 
&gt;  |interpreted as MAP_DENYWRITE, and therefore ignored.  Presumably, there 
&gt;  |is some other syscall (likely shmat(2)) that uses that bit (represented 
&gt;  |under the constant SHM_HUGETLB) to request huge pages, and the test 
&gt;  |program in question was supposed to get huge pages from mmap(2) but was 
&gt;  |not actually asking for huge pages because it was using the wrong constant.
&gt;  |
&gt;  |In other words, MAP_DENYWRITE was not being intentionally used at all.  
&gt;  |Another constant, for a different set of flags, that happens to have the 
&gt;  |same value, was being used, causing a quiet bug.  (The test program 
&gt;  |would have still worked, but was not actually exercising huge pages as 
&gt;  |intended.)
&gt; 
&gt; The Linux commit messages are tremendous books that often leave me
&gt; stunning.  I *never* get together such things in my own work
&gt; process.  So thanks for spending additional time reiterating this.
