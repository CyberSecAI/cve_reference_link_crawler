{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a change in the Linux kernel (version >=5.18) where the `thp_get_unmapped_area` function, used by certain filesystems (ext4, ext2, btrfs, xfs, and fuse), started aligning memory mappings greater than or equal to 2MB to 2MB boundaries. This was initially intended for DAX mappings but was extended to all mappings, including file-backed and anonymous mappings, leading to reduced or eliminated ASLR for larger libraries.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reduced ASLR entropy for 64-bit libraries >= 2MB (28 bits -> 19 bits).",
      "Completely broken ASLR for 32-bit libraries >= 2MB, leading to fixed base addresses."
    ],
    "impact": "For 32-bit applications, ASLR is essentially disabled. Exploits can predictably hijack pointers, especially using ROP gadgets within libraries. For 64-bit applications, the reduced ASLR entropy makes partial address overwrites on large library pointers more deterministic, allowing 2-byte overwrites instead of 1-byte previously.",
    "attack_vectors": "Exploits involve leveraging the predictability of library base addresses due to reduced or absent ASLR randomization. Partial address overwrite techniques become more effective.",
     "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to execute code on the target system and identify a vulnerability that can be exploited using known or deterministic library addresses."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The issue was initially discovered and tracked by Ubuntu as a regression, and later independently found by others. The problem affects a number of widely used filesystems. While a fix involving increasing mmap_rnd_bits is being rolled out, it does not fully address the issues with deterministic partial address overwrites. The vulnerability affects not only libc, but any library or anonymous mapping >= 2MB. The fix for CVE-2024-26621 was not completely effective on 32-bit systems because it was using `CONFIG_32BIT` which is not defined on IA-32. This was later addressed in the Linux kernel by switching to `!IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_64BIT)`"
