I can reproduce it with Ghostscript 9.52 on my openSUSE Leap 15.1 homeoffice laptop with "normal" PDFs (but not with PostScript files) like ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- # cat /usr/share/doc/release-notes/openSUSE/RELEASE-NOTES.en.pdf \  | gs -q -dSAFER -sDEVICE=txtwrite -o - - \  | cat - >openSUSE_RELEASE-NOTES.en.txt  *** Error in `gs': malloc(): memory corruption: 0x00000000011c1c60 *** ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- and ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- # cat /usr/share/doc/release-notes/openSUSE/RELEASE-NOTES.de.pdf \  | gs -q -dSAFER -sDEVICE=txtwrite -o - - \  | cat - >openSUSE_RELEASE-NOTES.de.txt  gs: malloc.c:2422: sysmalloc: Assertion `(old_top == initial_top (av)  && old_size == 0) || ((unsigned long) (old_size) >= MINSIZE  && prev_inuse (old_top)  && ((unsigned long) old_end & (pagesize - 1)) == 0)' failed. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- interestingly there are different error messages which seem to depend on the language of the openSUSE RELEASE-NOTES PDF ;-)  I found bugs at Ghostscript upstream with txtwrite memory issues like <https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=702229> and its duplicate <https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=702346> also with different error messages but perhaps all have in the end the same root cause.  I will test latest Ghostscript 9.53 (need to build that first)... ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1177922#c2)  Johannes Meixner   2020-10-20 15:02:55 UTC  ``` Ghostscript 9.53.3 from OBS home:jsmeix:branches:Printing ghostscript works with the txtwrite Ghostscript device for [https://interoperability.blob.core.windows.net/files/MS-OXCMSG/%5bMS-OXCMSG%5d-181001.pdf](https://interoperability.blob.core.windows.net/files/MS-OXCMSG/%5BMS-OXCMSG%5D-181001.pdf) and also for the other PDFs where it had failed before. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1177922#c3)  Johannes Meixner   2020-10-20 15:17:19 UTC  ``` Submitted to OBS Printing project and also directly to openSUSE:Factory because of <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/842834>  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- # osc submitrequest -m 'Ghostscript version upgrade to 9.53.3 \  that fixes [boo#1177922](http://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1177922) and fixes compilation with FreeType 2.10.3+' \  home:jsmeix:branches:Printing ghostscript Printing ghostscript  created request id 843001  # osc request accept -m 'Ghostscript version upgrade to 9.53.3 that \  fixes [boo#1177922](http://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1177922) and fixes compilation with FreeType 2.10.3+' 843001  Result of change request state: ok openSUSE:Factory  Forward this submit to it?

Corrupt value: 0x6000000000000 gs(98147,0x11082a5c0) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug fish: Job 2, 'gs -dQUIET -dSAFER -dBATCH -dNO…' terminated by signal SIGABRT (Abort)   A similar error was also reproduced on Debian Linux. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=702229#c1)  Ray Johnston    2020-05-15 18:33:39 UTC  ``` Running with memento, with paranoidAt=396200 shows that txt_add_fragment devices/vector/gdevtxtw.c line 2126:    memcpy(penum->text_state->Widths, penum->Widths, penum->text.size *           sizeof(float)); writes past the end of penum->text_state->Widths since it was allocated as 4 floats, but penum->text.size is 8  penum->TextBufferIndex is 4 which was used for the allocation at line 2121.  It may be that all that is needed is to allocate text.size floats, but this should be examined by someone that knows what it's trying to do. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=702229#c2)  Ray Johnston    2020-05-18 15:56:40 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 702346](show_bug.cgi?id=702346 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - heap-buffer-overflow at devices/vector/gdevtxtw.c:2139 (and maybe :2126) in txt_add_fragment") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=702229#c3)  Ken Sharp    2020-05-20 15:05:14 UTC  ``` I believe this is fixed in commit [8c7bd787defa071c96289b7da9397f673fddb874](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?8c7bd787defa071c96289b7da9397f673fddb874)  Certainly I don't see any problems with address sanitizer/valgrind when running either this file, the one from [bug 702346](show_bug.cgi?id=702346 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - heap-buffer-overflow at devices/vector/gdevtxtw.c:2139 (and maybe :2126) in txt_add_fragment") or the one from 701877 ``` |  |
