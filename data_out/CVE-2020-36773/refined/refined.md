{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a heap-buffer-overflow in the `txtwrite` device of Ghostscript, specifically in the `txt_add_fragment` function. The `memcpy` operation writes past the end of the allocated memory for `penum->text_state->Widths`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Heap-buffer-overflow",
    "Use-after-free"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Memory corruption, leading to application crash (SIGABRT)",
  "Attack vectors": "Processing a crafted PDF file using Ghostscript's `txtwrite` device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted PDF file to be processed by Ghostscript using the `txtwrite` device."
