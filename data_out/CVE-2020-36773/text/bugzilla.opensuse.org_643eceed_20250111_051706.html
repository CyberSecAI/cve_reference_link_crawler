I can reproduce it with Ghostscript 9.52 on my openSUSE Leap 15.1 homeoffice laptop with "normal" PDFs (but not with PostScript files) like ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- # cat /usr/share/doc/release-notes/openSUSE/RELEASE-NOTES.en.pdf \  | gs -q -dSAFER -sDEVICE=txtwrite -o - - \  | cat - >openSUSE_RELEASE-NOTES.en.txt  *** Error in `gs': malloc(): memory corruption: 0x00000000011c1c60 *** ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- and ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- # cat /usr/share/doc/release-notes/openSUSE/RELEASE-NOTES.de.pdf \  | gs -q -dSAFER -sDEVICE=txtwrite -o - - \  | cat - >openSUSE_RELEASE-NOTES.de.txt  gs: malloc.c:2422: sysmalloc: Assertion `(old_top == initial_top (av)  && old_size == 0) || ((unsigned long) (old_size) >= MINSIZE  && prev_inuse (old_top)  && ((unsigned long) old_end & (pagesize - 1)) == 0)' failed. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- interestingly there are different error messages which seem to depend on the language of the openSUSE RELEASE-NOTES PDF ;-)  I found bugs at Ghostscript upstream with txtwrite memory issues like <https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=702229> and its duplicate <https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=702346> also with different error messages but perhaps all have in the end the same root cause.  I will test latest Ghostscript 9.53 (need to build that first)... ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1177922#c2)  Johannes Meixner   2020-10-20 15:02:55 UTC  ``` Ghostscript 9.53.3 from OBS home:jsmeix:branches:Printing ghostscript works with the txtwrite Ghostscript device for [https://interoperability.blob.core.windows.net/files/MS-OXCMSG/%5bMS-OXCMSG%5d-181001.pdf](https://interoperability.blob.core.windows.net/files/MS-OXCMSG/%5BMS-OXCMSG%5D-181001.pdf) and also for the other PDFs where it had failed before. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1177922#c3)  Johannes Meixner   2020-10-20 15:17:19 UTC  ``` Submitted to OBS Printing project and also directly to openSUSE:Factory because of <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/842834>  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- # osc submitrequest -m 'Ghostscript version upgrade to 9.53.3 \  that fixes [boo#1177922](http://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1177922) and fixes compilation with FreeType 2.10.3+' \  home:jsmeix:branches:Printing ghostscript Printing ghostscript  created request id 843001  # osc request accept -m 'Ghostscript version upgrade to 9.53.3 that \  fixes [boo#1177922](http://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1177922) and fixes compilation with FreeType 2.10.3+' 843001  Result of change request state: ok openSUSE:Factory  Forward this submit to it?
