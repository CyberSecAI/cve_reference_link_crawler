| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=702229#c0)  James R Barlow    2020-03-18 04:29:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 19003](attachment.cgi?id=19003 "mallocissue.pdf") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=19003&action=edit "mallocissue.pdf") mallocissue.pdf  On macOS the error looks like:  $ gs -dQUIET -dSAFER -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=txtwrite -dTextFormat=0 -o - mallocissue.pdf -stddout=%stderr  gs(98147,0x11082a5c0) malloc: Incorrect checksum for freed object 0x7fa850d096d8: probably modified after being freed. Corrupt value: 0x6000000000000 gs(98147,0x11082a5c0) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug fish: Job 2, 'gs -dQUIET -dSAFER -dBATCH -dNO…' terminated by signal SIGABRT (Abort)   A similar error was also reproduced on Debian Linux. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=702229#c1)  Ray Johnston    2020-05-15 18:33:39 UTC  ``` Running with memento, with paranoidAt=396200 shows that txt_add_fragment devices/vector/gdevtxtw.c line 2126:    memcpy(penum->text_state->Widths, penum->Widths, penum->text.size *           sizeof(float)); writes past the end of penum->text_state->Widths since it was allocated as 4 floats, but penum->text.size is 8  penum->TextBufferIndex is 4 which was used for the allocation at line 2121.  It may be that all that is needed is to allocate text.size floats, but this should be examined by someone that knows what it's trying to do. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=702229#c2)  Ray Johnston    2020-05-18 15:56:40 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 702346](show_bug.cgi?id=702346 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - heap-buffer-overflow at devices/vector/gdevtxtw.c:2139 (and maybe :2126) in txt_add_fragment") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=702229#c3)  Ken Sharp    2020-05-20 15:05:14 UTC  ``` I believe this is fixed in commit [8c7bd787defa071c96289b7da9397f673fddb874](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?8c7bd787defa071c96289b7da9397f673fddb874)  Certainly I don't see any problems with address sanitizer/valgrind when running either this file, the one from [bug 702346](show_bug.cgi?id=702346 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - heap-buffer-overflow at devices/vector/gdevtxtw.c:2139 (and maybe :2126) in txt_add_fragment") or the one from 701877 ``` |  |
