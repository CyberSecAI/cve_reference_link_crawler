- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An incorrect bounds check within the OPTEE (Trusted Execution Environment) component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local information disclosure if a malicious actor has already obtained System privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local exploitation by a malicious actor who has already obtained System privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have already achieved System privileges on the affected device. No user interaction is needed for exploitation.
