  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `rds_conn_connect_if_down` function within the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) implementation. When a connection isn't fully established and `get_mr()` fails, the connection is not properly triggered, potentially leading to issues.",

      "Improper error handling",
      "Race condition"

    "impact": "The primary impact of this vulnerability is a potential warning in the kernel logs and a possible stall or failure to establish an RDS connection, which could lead to denial-of-service like conditions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network traffic triggering RDS connection failures"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send network traffic that will trigger a failure in establishing a connection in RDS",
