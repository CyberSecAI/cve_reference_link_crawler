Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8663

**Description:** The WP Simple Booking Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This is due to the plugin's improper use of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions without adequate output escaping.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the plugin's use of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` when generating URLs. These functions manipulate query parameters in URLs, and without proper sanitization/escaping of the parameters, it becomes possible to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input when generating URLs, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page. The injected script will be executed in the context of the user's browser when the crafted URL is visited.
* **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation:** The core issue lies in the lack of proper escaping of the URL parameters, which are then reflected back in the page output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
* **Session Hijacking:** By executing malicious scripts, an attacker can potentially steal user session cookies.
* **Phishing:** The attacker can redirect the victim to malicious sites or display fake forms to steal sensitive information.
* **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the content of the page to deface the website.
* **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could redirect the user to sites containing malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **URL Manipulation:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within the query parameters.
* **Social Engineering:** The attacker tricks a user into clicking the malicious link (e.g., via email, forum posts or comments).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need any special access to exploit this vulnerability.
* **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs containing the XSS payload.
* **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to persuade a user to click on the crafted link to trigger the exploit.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippets were found in these files:
* `/includes/base/admin/calendar/views/view-edit-calendar.php`
    - The issue was that `remove_query_arg` was used without proper sanitization, which was later replaced with `admin_url( 'admin.php' )`
* `/includes/modules/update-checker/views/view-register-website.php`
    -  URLs generated for "Register Website," "Deregister Website" and "Check for Updates" buttons were also vulnerable.

**Resolution:**

The vulnerability was addressed in version 2.0.11 by replacing the insecure `remove_query_arg()` function call with `admin_url( 'admin.php' )`. This ensures that URLs are constructed correctly and no longer reflect unfiltered user input, which prevents the execution of malicious code.

**CVSS Score:** 6.1 (Medium)
    *  CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
