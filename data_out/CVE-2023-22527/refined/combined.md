### Description

## Summary of Vulnerability

A template injection vulnerability on older versions of Confluence Data Center and Server allows an unauthenticated attacker to achieve RCE on an affected instance. Customers using an affected version must take immediate action.

Most recent supported versions of Confluence Data Center and Server are not affected by this vulnerability as it was ultimately mitigated during regular version updates. However, Atlassian recommends that customers take care to install the latest version to protect their instances from non-critical vulnerabilities outlined in Atlassian’s January Security Bulletin.

See “What You Need to Do” for detailed instructions.

Atlassian Cloud sites are not affected by this vulnerability. If your Confluence site is accessed via an [atlassian.net](http://atlassian.net/) domain, it is hosted by Atlassian and is not vulnerable to this issue.

## Affected Versions

**Note: 7.19.x LTS versions are not affected by this vulnerability**

| Product | Affected Versions |
| --- | --- |
| Confluence Data Center and Server | * 8.0.x * 8.1.x * 8.2.x * 8.3.x * 8.4.x * 8.5.0 - 8.5.3 |

## Fixed Versions

| **Product** | **Fixed Versions** |
| --- | --- |
| Confluence Data Center and Server | * 8.5.4 (LTS) |
| Confluence Data Center | * 8.6.0 or later (Data Center Only) * 8.7.1 or later (Data Center Only) |

## What You Need To Do

### **Immediately patch to a fixed version**

Atlassian recommends that you patch each of your affected installations to the latest version. The listed Fixed Versions are no longer the most up-to-date versions and do not protect your instance from other non-critical vulnerabilities as outlined in Atlassian’s January Security Bulletin.

| Product | Fixed Versions | Latest Versions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Confluence Data Center and Server | * 8.5.4 (LTS) | * 8.5.5 (LTS) |
| Confluence Data Center | * 8.6.0 or later (Data Center Only) * 8.7.1 or later (Data Center Only) | * 8.7.2 or later (Data Center Only) |

## Summary

An OGNL injection vulnerability exists in some older versions of Confluence Data Center and Server allowing an unauthenticated attacker to achieve RCE on affected instances. This post covers the details on how to set up your own vulnerable Confluence server instance and exploit it to get a shell on the server. We also go a step ahead and discuss what an attacker would do next. Lastly, we check the tracebacks for a failed OGNL injection to understand how the payload would have landed at the sink from the HTTP POST request.

# January 2024 Security Bulletin

The vulnerabilities reported in this security bulletin include 28 high-severity vulnerabilities which have been fixed in new versions of our products, as detailed below. These vulnerabilities are discovered via our Bug Bounty program and pen-testing processes, as well as third-party library scans.

NOTE: The vulnerabilities included in monthly Security Bulletins present a lower impact than those published via Critical Security Advisories. Customers can expect to receive those high-priority patches outside of our monthly schedule as necessary.

To search for CVEs or check your product versions for disclosed vulnerabilities, check the [Vulnerability Disclosure Portal](https://www.atlassian.com/trust/data-protection/vulnerabilities).
