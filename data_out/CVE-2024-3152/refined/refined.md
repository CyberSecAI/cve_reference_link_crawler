The provided content does not contain any information related to a CVE. It primarily consists of a GitHub commit diff and some unrelated site navigation and footer information.  The diff highlights a change in `server/models/workspaceThread.js` where a potential bug existed in how the update function was processing data. Specifically, it seemed to be applying the `data` twice, once with the original payload and again with the `validData` after filtering.

```
   const thread = await prisma.workspace\_threads.update({
        where: { id: prevThread.id },
        data,
        data: validData,
      });
```
The patch likely intends to remove the first `data` argument. However, this does not relate to a specific CVE.

Therefore, based on the provided information:
