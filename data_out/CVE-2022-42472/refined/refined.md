- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: HTTP Response Splitting (CWE-113)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated, remote attacker can inject arbitrary HTTP headers. This could allow for the execution of unauthorized code or commands.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted requests to the vulnerable login page of FortiOS or FortiProxy.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated and be able to send requests to the affected device.
