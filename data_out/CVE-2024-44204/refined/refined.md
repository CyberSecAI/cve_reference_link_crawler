- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A logic issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability allows a user's saved passwords to be read aloud by VoiceOver due to a logic issue in how VoiceOver handles password information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with physical or remote access to a device where a user's saved password is known to voiceover would be able to use VoiceOver to have the passwords read aloud.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves using VoiceOver, an accessibility feature, to expose saved passwords.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker would need access to a vulnerable device and knowledge of how to trigger VoiceOver's functionality to read saved passwords.
