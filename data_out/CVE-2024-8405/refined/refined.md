  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the `web-print.exe` process incorrectly creating files that don't exist when a maliciously formed payload is provided.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary file creation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "If enough files are created using this process, it may flood disk space and result in a Denial of Service (DoS).",
  "Attack vectors": "Local login access to the Windows Server hosting PaperCut NG/MF is required, along with the ability to execute low-privilege code directly on the server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must have local login access to the Windows server and the ability to execute low-privilege code on the server."
