CVE-2023-7290:

Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the 'check_for_verified_profiles' function within the Paytium plugin. This function is intended to verify the status of payment profiles, but due to the lack of proper authorization, it can be accessed by users with low-level privileges, such as subscribers.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Missing Authorization: The 'check_for_verified_profiles' function lacks a capability check, allowing unauthorized access.
- Information Disclosure: Authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access can check profile statuses which are not intended to be available to this user role.

Impact of exploitation:
The vulnerability allows authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access to check profile statuses. This is an information disclosure vulnerability, where lower-privileged users can gain access to information meant for higher-privileged users.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted request to the affected function.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site, with subscriber-level or higher access.
