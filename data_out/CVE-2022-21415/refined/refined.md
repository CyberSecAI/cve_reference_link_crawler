```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Multiple NetApp products incorporate vulnerable versions of Oracle MySQL.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Multiple vulnerabilities exist within the incorporated MySQL versions that can lead to unauthorized access, data modification, or denial of service. Specifically for CVE-2022-21415, it concerns a vulnerability within the "Server: Replication" component of MySQL.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized takeover of the MySQL server, unauthorized read or modification access to data, or cause a hang or crash (partial or complete DoS).
- Attack vectors: Network-based attacks are possible, with some vulnerabilities being remotely exploitable without authentication, while others require some level of access.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: In the case of CVE-2022-21415, while the attack vector is network, exploitation requires high privileges, indicating that an attacker would need to have valid administrative-level credentials on the MySQL server.
