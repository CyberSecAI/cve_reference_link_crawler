Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `log.Fatalf` in the `multipart` body processor when parsing the `Content-Type` header. Specifically, the `mime.ParseMediaType` function can return an error if the `Content-Type` header has a malformed syntax. Instead of returning this error gracefully, the code calls `log.Fatalf` which immediately terminates the application using `os.Exit`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper error handling: The application uses `log.Fatalf` for non-fatal errors during request processing, which leads to application termination.
- Lack of input sanitization: Although not a direct vulnerability, the vulnerability can be triggered due to the lack of robust error handling for invalid `Content-Type` header syntax.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause the application to crash by sending a crafted HTTP request with a malformed `Content-Type` header that triggers an error in `mime.ParseMediaType`. This can disrupt the availability of the service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attacker sends a malicious HTTP request to the server, exploiting the lack of robust input sanitization for the `Content-Type` header field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- No special privileges or user interaction is needed.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in commit [24af0c8](https://github.com/corazawaf/coraza/commit/24af0c8cf4f10bab558740b595712be3b85493ec).
- A proof of concept (PoC) is provided that demonstrates the vulnerability with a crafted request that includes duplicate parameters in the `Content-Type` header.
- The fix is to return the error from `mime.ParseMediaType` directly instead of calling `log.Fatalf`.
- The CVSS score is 7.5 (High).
- The affected versions are 3.0.0, and the patched version is 3.0.1.
