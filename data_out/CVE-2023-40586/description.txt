OWASP Coraza WAF is a golang modsecurity compatible web application firewall library. Due to the misuse of `log.Fatalf`, the application using coraza crashed after receiving crafted requests from attackers. The application will immediately crash after receiving a malicious request that triggers an error in `mime.ParseMediaType`. This issue was patched in version 3.0.1.
