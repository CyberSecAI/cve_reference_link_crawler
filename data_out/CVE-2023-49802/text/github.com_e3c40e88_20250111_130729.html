Use one or more of &"<> in the value of a target field.

Report an issue.

The field values are not displayed properly in the select list.

Click on the Submit Issue button.

There is an error saying invalid value for field.

Fixes issue [#10](https://github.com/mantisbt-plugins/LinkedCustomFields/issues/10)

Sorry, something went wrong.

| There is a bigger issue in release v2.0.0:  Create 2 fields. Set them to display when reporting issues. In field 1 put any value. In field 2 put the following: Item 1|Item 2\|];alert('Hello');// Link field 1 to field 2 and set the target field value to Item 1. Report an issue. The javascript alert actually runs.  Second commit fixes it properly as well as the original issue. First commit is redundant. |
