| Problem: linked fields with special characters (like &) can't be saved Solution: use htmlspecialchars\_decode in LinkedCustomFields.API.php  ``` static function getLinkedFieldId( $p_source_field_id ) {  	$t_query = "SELECT target_field_id FROM " . plugin_table( 'data' ) . " WHERE custom_field_id = " . db_param();  	$t_result = db_query( $t_query, array( $p_source_field_id ) );  	if( 0 == db_num_rows( $t_result ) ) { 		return null; 	}  	$t_array = db_fetch_array( $t_result ); 	**return htmlspecialchars_decode($t_field_values_js);** }  ``` |

GHSA-2f37-9xpx-5hhw
Dec 10, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<2.0.1

## Patched versions

2.0.1

## Description

### Impact

Cross-site scripting in MantisBT LinkedCustomFields plugin allows Javascript execution, when a crafted Custom Field is linked via the plugin and displayed when reporting a new Issue or editing an existing one.

### Patches

See commit [30e5ae7](https://github.com/mantisbt-plugins/LinkedCustomFields/commit/30e5ae751e40d7ae18bfd794fd48671477b3d286)

Fixed in release 2.0.1

### Workarounds

MantisBT's default Content Security Policy blocks script execution.

### References

[#11](https://github.com/mantisbt-plugins/LinkedCustomFields/pull/11)

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Use one or more of &"<> in the value of a target field.

Report an issue.

The field values are not displayed properly in the select list.

Click on the Submit Issue button.

There is an error saying invalid value for field.

Fixes issue [#10](https://github.com/mantisbt-plugins/LinkedCustomFields/issues/10)

Sorry, something went wrong.

| There is a bigger issue in release v2.0.0:  Create 2 fields. Set them to display when reporting issues. In field 1 put any value. In field 2 put the following: Item 1|Item 2\|];alert('Hello');// Link field 1 to field 2 and set the target field value to Item 1. Report an issue. The javascript alert actually runs.  Second commit fixes it properly as well as the original issue. First commit is redundant. |
