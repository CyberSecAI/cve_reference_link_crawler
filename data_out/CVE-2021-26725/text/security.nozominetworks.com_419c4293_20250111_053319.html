## Summary

An authenticated command path traversal vulnerability in the management interface allows an authenticated administrator to read-protected system files.

## Impact

Authenticated web GUI administrator can force the system to copy system files to the wrong location allowing him to read the contents. However, as by design web GUI administrators are allowed to use ssh keys to gain full console access, this finding has a low impact on our customers.

## Affected Products

Guardian, CMC <v20.0.7.4 or <v19.0.12

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Use internal firewall feature to limit management interface access and review user roles.

## Solutions

v19 series: Upgrade to v19.0.12. v20 series: Upgrade to v20.0.7.4.
