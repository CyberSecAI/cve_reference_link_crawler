| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Jabber Client Software Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol Stanza Smuggling Vulnerability Medium   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-jabber-xmpp-Ne9SCM  First Published: 2022 October 5 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2022 October 19 20:47 GMT  Version 1.1:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCwc24382](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc24382)     CVE-2022-20917     CWE-668       CVSS Score: [Base 4.3](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2022-20917     CWE-668       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-jabber-xmpp-Ne9SCM/csaf/cisco-sa-jabber-xmpp-Ne9SCM.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) message processing feature of Cisco Jabber could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to manipulate the content of XMPP messages that are used by the affected application.  This vulnerability is due to the improper handling of nested XMPP messages within requests that are sent to the Cisco Jabber client software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an XMPP messaging server and sending crafted XMPP messages to an affected Jabber client. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to manipulate the content of XMPP messages, possibly allowing the attacker to cause the Jabber client application to perform unsafe actions.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-jabber-xmpp-Ne9SCM>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco Jabber for Windows, Cisco Jabber for MacOS, and Cisco Jabber for mobile platforms.  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability. Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Jabber client software that is configured for either of the following modes:   + Phone-only mode   + Team messaging mode  Details  * Depending on client software and XMPP server configuration, an attacker may not be able to exploit this vulnerability at will. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be:   + Authenticated to an XMPP server that the affected software is using   + Able to send XMPP messages to an affected system  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
