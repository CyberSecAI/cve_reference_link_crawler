- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of nested XMPP messages within requests sent to the Cisco Jabber client software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the way Cisco Jabber processes XMPP messages, specifically nested messages, which leads to the potential for message manipulation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to manipulate the content of XMPP messages, potentially causing the Jabber client to perform unsafe actions.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to be authenticated to an XMPP server used by the affected Jabber client and able to send crafted XMPP messages to the client.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a remote, authenticated user on the XMPP server used by the vulnerable client.
