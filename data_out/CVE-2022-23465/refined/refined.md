The provided content relates to CVE-2022-23465.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the terminal emulator's handling of certain character escape sequences, specifically those related to setting and querying the terminal window title and icon title, and the handling of DECRQSS sequences. The terminal was returning user-controlled data in response to queries which could then be replayed by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The terminal emulator would return the current window title or icon title when requested via specific escape sequences.
- The terminal would respond with data to an invalid DECRQSS sequence

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious sequences into the terminal, for instance, by embedding them in a file. When a user views this file in the terminal, the injected sequence can modify the window title or icon title. Subsequently, the attacker can use other escape sequences to retrieve the modified content, which could contain malicious commands, and then insert it back to the command line, leading to arbitrary command execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Viewing a file containing a malicious escape sequence in the terminal
- Other mechanisms of getting the terminal to process malicious sequences

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to insert specific character escape sequences into a context that the vulnerable terminal emulator will process. For example, by controlling content of file that a user opens using the terminal.
- No special privileges are required.
- User interaction is required in that the user would need to view the content with the malicious sequence
