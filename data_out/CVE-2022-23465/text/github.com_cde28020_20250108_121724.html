Fix two possible attack vectors, where an attacker can store

information into the termianl and then get to replay it.

Two of those instances are setting the terminal title, and icon title,
and then requesting the values back (see [CVE-2003-0063](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4f3f-7mf9-qrhc "CVE-2003-0063")[2] and
<https://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=104612710031920&w=2> for details).

And another case is sending an invalid DECRQSS sequence, which the
handler would respond back with the results, see here for how this is
used: <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=510030> [CVE-2008-2383](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-94vw-2f3v-j88m "CVE-2008-2383")[3]

These bugs were found and disclosed by David Leadbeater <dgl@dgl.cx>
