- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `fluid_msg::of13::GroupDesc::unpack` routine within the Open Networking Foundation (ONF) libfluid library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the program attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A network attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition on the target component.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a network attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable component. No specific privileges are required.
