- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A race condition in an event subsystem.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap use-after-free.
- **Impact of exploitation:** App termination or unexpected control flow.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs in established audio/video calls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to trigger the race condition within an active audio/video call, which is described as having "very low probability."
