## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Chatbot Support AI <= 1.0.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Navigate to '/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=chatbot-support-ai-settings'
2. Modify the 'Starting Message' value to XSS payload: `<img src=123 onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`
3. Save the changes
4. Visit the homepage where the chatbot is present to observe the executed payload

### Affects Plugins
