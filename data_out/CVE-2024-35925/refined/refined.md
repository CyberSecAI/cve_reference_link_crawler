  "cve": "CVE-2024-35925",
  "related": true,
  "info": "The provided content describes a fix for a division-by-zero vulnerability in the Linux kernel's block layer, specifically within the `blk_rq_stat_sum()` function. This vulnerability is present due to a potential integer overflow when summing `nr_samples`, which can result in a zero divisor. The fix adds a check to prevent the division when the sum of sample counts would overflow. While the CVE description is a placeholder, this content directly relates to the identified vulnerability in the Linux kernel.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the calculation of `dst->nr_samples + src->nr_samples` can result in a zero value, leading to a division by zero in `blk_rq_stat_sum()` function.",
    "weakness": "The code lacks a check for potential overflow when accumulating the sample counts leading to division by zero. The vulnerability is in the `block/blk-stat.c` file.",
     "impact": "A division by zero error can lead to a kernel panic or denial of service.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered within the kernel code itself, specifically when aggregating block request statistics. An attacker would need to find a way to trigger the overflow to force a division by zero error.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker would need the ability to manipulate the number of samples to cause the integer overflow."
