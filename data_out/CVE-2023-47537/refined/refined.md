- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper certificate validation in FortiOS during FortiLink communication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of proper certificate validation, allowing a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacker to intercept and manipulate the communication channel.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can decipher and alter the FortiLink communication channel between the FortiOS device and a FortiSwitch instance. This leads to information disclosure and potentially allows for manipulation of the connection.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack occurs via a Man-in-the-Middle position, allowing interception and alteration of communication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker needs to be in a Man-in-the-Middle position relative to the FortiOS device and FortiSwitch instance.
