- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation, which allows for the injection of a payload.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution through the victim's browser, allowing the attacker to perform actions on the victim's behalf.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a user visiting a page containing the injected malicious payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to inject a malicious payload into a page that a user of the affected software will visit. The attacker also needs a low level of privileges and the user needs to perform an action(user interaction).
