**Vulnerability:**
The commit `321be4733d3997fc738f0118e1b9af5905f95439` addresses missing authorization gates for asset maintenance actions in Snipe-IT. This commit adds authorization checks for `edit` and `delete` operations to the `AssetMaintenancesController` and `Api\AssetMaintenancesController`, which were previously missing.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability was the **lack of proper authorization checks** in the `AssetMaintenancesController` and `Api\AssetMaintenancesController` before performing edit and delete operations on asset maintenances. This meant that a user who should not have permission to edit or delete maintenances could do so if they could reach the relevant endpoints.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authorization Checks:** The primary weakness was the absence of authorization checks before performing `edit` and `delete` operations on asset maintenances. This lack of checks allowed potentially unauthorized users to modify or remove maintenance records.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Modification:** An attacker or unauthorized user could potentially modify existing asset maintenance records.
- **Unauthorized Data Deletion:** An attacker could potentially delete important asset maintenance records, causing loss of data and potential disruptions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct API manipulation:** An attacker could directly call the API endpoints responsible for editing or deleting asset maintenance records.
- **Web Interface:** The web interface, if not properly secured, could be used by an attacker to access the vulnerable functionality through the UI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be a user with access to the Snipe-IT application.
- The attacker would need to be able to craft requests to the API or use the web UI to trigger the edit or delete operations.
- They would *not* need to be a user with explicit permissions to edit or delete asset maintenances, they would simply need a user account.

**Summary**
The commit addresses a vulnerability where missing authorization checks allowed unauthorized users to modify or delete asset maintenance records. The fix implements proper authorization gates, preventing users without the necessary permissions from performing these actions.
