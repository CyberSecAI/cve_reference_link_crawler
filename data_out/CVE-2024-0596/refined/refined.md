Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check within the `editor_html()` function of the "Awesome Support" WordPress plugin. This oversight allows unauthorized users to access content they should not be able to view.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The `editor_html()` function lacks proper checks to ensure that the user accessing it has the necessary permissions to view the requested content.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The vulnerability allows access to draft or password-protected posts through the `editor_html()` function without proper authorization validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized users with subscriber-level access and above can view the content of password-protected and draft posts. This could lead to:
  - Data exposure: Sensitive information within the posts could be revealed to unauthorized individuals.
  - Breach of confidentiality: Confidential drafts or information intended only for specific user roles are exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessed through the `editor_html()` function in the plugin, which is reachable via an AJAX request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level access.
- The attacker must be able to send a crafted AJAX request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in all versions up to and including version 6.1.7 of the Awesome Support plugin.
- The issue has been fixed in version 6.1.8 of the plugin.
- This vulnerability is related to CVE-2024-0596 and a possible duplicate of CVE-2024-35741

**Summary of changes in version 6.1.8:**

The changelog in the provided document mentions:
- Fixed an Authenticated (Subscriber+) SQL Injection.
- Fixed a Missing Authorization via `wpas_get_users()` function.
- Fixed a Missing Authorization via `editor_html()` function.

The provided code diffs show that the following changes were made in order to address the missing authorization issue in the `editor_html()` function:

- A nonce check was added to the `editor_html()` function to ensure the request is coming from a legitimate user.
- A capability check was added to the `editor_html()` function using `current_user_can('edit_post', $post_id)` to ensure the user has the correct privileges to edit the post.
- Similar nonce and capability checks were added to the `get_content()` function and the  `wpas_edit_ticket_content` function

The changes also included a fix to an SQL injection vulnerability.
