The provided content directly relates to CVE-2024-24312.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause of the vulnerability is a combination of insecure direct object reference (IDOR) and SQL injection vulnerabilities in the V-QRS application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  * **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application failed to properly validate user access to resources, allowing attackers to bypass access controls by manipulating resource identifiers (e.g., user IDs in the URL).
  * **SQL Injection:** The application exhibited lax input validation mechanisms, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries into input fields and manipulate the database backend.

**Impact of exploitation:**
  * **IDOR:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, including personal information of users (names, positions, phone numbers, email addresses, photos).
  * **SQL Injection:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database, extract sensitive information (database username and password's hash).
  * **Combined:** The vulnerabilities can be chained to facilitate further attacks such as:
    - Phishing campaigns: Personal information of employees can be used for targeted phishing attacks.
    - Brute force attacks: Gained credentials can be used to access external OWA and other login portals which can then be used to launch Active Directory login attacks and cause significant harm.

**Attack vectors:**
   * **IDOR:** Attackers can directly manipulate the user ID parameter in the URL to access profiles of other users.
   * **SQL Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into the input fields of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   * **IDOR:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the web application.
   * **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the web application and needs some understanding of SQL.
