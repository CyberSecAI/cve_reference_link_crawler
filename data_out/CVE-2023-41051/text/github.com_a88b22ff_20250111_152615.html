# Default functions in VolatileMemory trait lack bounds checks, potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory accesses

Low

[roypat](/roypat)
published
GHSA-49hh-fprx-m68g
Sep 1, 2023

## Package

cargo

vm-memory
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

<0.12.2

## Patched versions

0.12.2

## Description

### Impact

An issue was discovered in the default implementations of the `VolatileMemory::{get_atomic_ref, aligned_as_ref, aligned_as_mut, get_ref, get_array_ref}` trait functions, which allows out-of-bounds memory access if the `VolatileMemory::get_slice` function returns a `VolatileSlice` whose length is less than the function’s `count` argument. No implementations of `get_slice` provided in `vm_memory` are affected. Users of custom `VolatileMemory` implementations may be impacted if the custom implementation does not adhere to `get_slice`'s documentation.

### Patches

The issue started in version 0.1.0 but was fixed in version 0.12.2 by inserting a check that verifies that the `VolatileSlice` returned by `get_slice` is of the correct length.

### Workarounds

Not Required
