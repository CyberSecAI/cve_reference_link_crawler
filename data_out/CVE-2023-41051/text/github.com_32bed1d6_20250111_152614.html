fix: Validate return value of get\_slice in VolatileMemory

[Browse files](/rust-vmm/vm-memory/tree/aff1dd4a5259f7deba56692840f7a2d9ca34c9c8)

```
An issue was discovered in the default implementations of the
VolatileMemory::{get_atomic_ref, aligned_as_ref, aligned_as_mut,
get_ref, get_array_ref} trait functions, which allows out-of-bounds
memory access if the VolatileMemory::get_slice function returns a
VolatileSlice whose length is less than the functionâ€™s count argument.
No implementations of get_slice provided in vm_memory are affected.
Users of custom VolatileMemory implementations may be impacted if the
custom implementation does not adhere to get_slice's documentation.

This commit fixes this issue by inserting a check that verifies that the
VolatileSlice returned by get_slice is of the correct length.

|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Added |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Changed |
|  |  | ## [v0.12.2] |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Fixed |
|  |  | - [[#251]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/251): Inserted checks |
|  |  | that verify that the value returned by `VolatileMemory::get\_slice` is of |
|  |  | the correct length. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Deprecated |
|  |  | - [[#244]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/241) Deprecate volatile |
|  |  | memory's `as\_ptr()` interfaces. The new interfaces to be used instead are: |
|  |  | `ptr\_guard()` and `ptr\_guard\_mut()`. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## [v0.12.1] |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Fixed |
|  |  | - [[#241]](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/245) mmap\_xen: Don't drop |
|  |  | the FileOffset while in use #245 |
