- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The default configuration of Apache ActiveMQ 6.x does not secure the API web context, which exposes the Jolokia JMX REST API and the Message REST API without requiring authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of authentication on the API web context. This allows unauthorized access to the Jolokia JMX REST API and the Message REST API.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can interact with the broker through the Jolokia JMX REST API, and/or produce/consume messages, or purge/delete destinations through the Message REST API.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the vulnerable ActiveMQ instance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs network access to the ActiveMQ broker. No prior authentication is needed due to the lack of security on the API endpoints.
