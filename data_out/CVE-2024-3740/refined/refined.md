  "CVE-2024-3740": [
    {
      "Root cause": "The application has multiple vulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution (RCE). Specifically, vulnerabilities related to file uploads, zip file handling, and command execution.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of user-provided input.",
        "Insecure file upload handling, allowing for arbitrary file uploads.",
        "Insecure zip file extraction, leading to directory traversal (zip slip).",
        "Insecure command execution, allowing for injection of arbitrary commands.",
          "Lack of proper sanitization of input, leading to command injection",
        "Deserialization vulnerabilities (mentioned in VulDB entry)."
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote code execution, leading to potential server compromise and loss of control.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Uploading malicious zip files.",
        "Injecting commands through vulnerable input fields.",
        "Exploiting insecure deserialization of data."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have access to the web interface to exploit these vulnerabilities.",
        "Attacker position": "Remote"
    },
        {
      "Root cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities in nginxWebUI <=3.9.9 allow for RCE, including bypasses from previous versions.",
      "Weaknesses": [
       "Improper sanitization of shell metacharacters",
       "Lack of validation for zip file contents",
       "Uncontrolled extraction path for zip archives",
       "Lack of input validation for paths and executable locations",
       "Insecure command execution"
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote code execution leading to full server compromise.",
        "Attack vectors":[
        "Malicious zip file upload via /adminPage/conf/reload",
        "Command injection via various input fields"
        ],
        "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to access the web interface and send crafted requests.",
