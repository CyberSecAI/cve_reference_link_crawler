In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: config: fix iteration issue in 'usb_get_bos_descriptor()'

The BOS descriptor defines a root descriptor and is the base descriptor for
accessing a family of related descriptors.

Function 'usb_get_bos_descriptor()' encounters an iteration issue when
skipping the 'USB_DT_DEVICE_CAPABILITY' descriptor type. This results in
the same descriptor being read repeatedly.

To address this issue, a 'goto' statement is introduced to ensure that the
pointer and the amount read is updated correctly. This ensures that the
function iterates to the next descriptor instead of reading the same
descriptor repeatedly.
