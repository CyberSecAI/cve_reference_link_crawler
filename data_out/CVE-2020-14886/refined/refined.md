Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-14886:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `shader_skip_unrecognized` function in Oracle VirtualBox.
- The core issue is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, specifically shader bytecode, within this function. This can lead to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The vulnerability allows a read operation beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer. This is an information disclosure vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information from the hypervisor's memory space.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The extracted information may be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the hypervisor.
- While the vulnerability itself is an information disclosure, it can be a stepping stone for further, more severe attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker must have the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system (virtual machine). The vulnerability can be triggered through a crafted shader bytecode, indicating a guest-to-host attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to a guest virtual machine.
- Ability to execute high-privileged code within the guest operating system.
- Ability to control or influence the shader bytecode provided to the vulnerable function.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is fixed in VirtualBox version 6.1.16.
- The vulnerability is categorized as "local" and "high privilege" in the CVSS score.

This vulnerability can be used in combination with other vulnerabilities to gain code execution in the hypervisor. The official CVE description is a placeholder, the provided documents are the only source of information.
