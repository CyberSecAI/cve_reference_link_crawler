The provided content details a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Rite CMS v3.0, as described in CVE-2023-43877.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in multiple fields within the administrative interface of Rite CMS v3.0.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the application.
- The malicious script will be executed in the browsers of users who view the affected pages.
- This can lead to:
  - Session hijacking.
  - Defacement of the web application.
  - Redirection to malicious sites.
  - Unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- An attacker needs to log into the administration panel of the Rite CMS.
- The attacker injects a malicious script into the vulnerable fields via the admin interface.
