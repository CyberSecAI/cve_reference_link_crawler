- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress SEO Booster plugin versions 3.8.9 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks sufficient CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to craft malicious requests that, when triggered by an authenticated user, execute unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could force a higher-privileged user to perform unwanted actions, which could lead to a variety of consequences depending on the specific plugin functionality, such as modifying settings, deleting data, or potentially gaining further access to the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a malicious website or link that, when clicked by an authenticated user of the WordPress plugin, executes the forged request against the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and must be able to trick a logged-in user of the vulnerable WordPress plugin to unknowingly trigger the request. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated.
