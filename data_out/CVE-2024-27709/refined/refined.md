Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `searchby` parameter of `allstudents.php` and the `id` parameter of `requestmanager.php` components.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input before incorporating it into SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive data from the database, including other users' data.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to data and potentially execute administrative operations.
- **Database Compromise:** In severe cases, attackers could gain full control of the database, leading to data deletion or other administrative actions. The content states "all database has been dumped" indicating full compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through crafted HTTP POST requests to specific endpoints.
   -  `allstudents.php` via the `searchby` parameter.
   - `requestmanager.php` via the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have an account on the application to access the vulnerable endpoints. No other specific privileges are mentioned as needed for exploitation.
- The attacker would need to craft malicious SQL payloads and send them as POST request parameters.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered during a routine security assessment.
- The content explicitly mentions the usage of SQLMap for automated exploitation.
- The content provides a sample HTTP POST request demonstrating the injection point.
- Recommendations for remediation include the implementation of parameterized queries for database interactions and following secure coding standards. The text advises against relying solely on quote escaping and stored procedures, which are not secure by themselves.
