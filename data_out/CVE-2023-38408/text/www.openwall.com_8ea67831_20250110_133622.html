I see this one goes from December 2022 to present:

<https://github.com/omniosorg/omnios-build/blob/r151044/doc/ReleaseNotes.md>

and this one from May 2022 to April 2023:

<https://github.com/omniosorg/omnios-build/blob/r151042/doc/ReleaseNotes.md>

So that's already more than a year, and I don't need to look further.

Also, I note this reply by Bob Friesenhahn:

So I think we can accept OmniOS as new distros list member, if that's
desired and Dan would represent OmniOS on the list.  This subscription
on its own would not allow sharing of info with other illumos distros.

In special cases, Dan would be able to ask the issue reporters their
explicit permission to share with other illumos distros.

If those distros do typically need the info, they may request direct
list membership.

How does this sound to you, Dan?
