This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Disallow remote addition of FIDO/PKCS11 provider libraries to

ssh-agent by default.

The old behaviour of allowing remote clients from loading providers
can be restored using `ssh-agent -O allow-remote-pkcs11`.

Detection of local/remote clients requires a ssh(1) that supports
the `session-bind@openssh.com` extension. Forwarding access to a
ssh-agent socket using non-OpenSSH tools may circumvent this control.

I have a question， seems the code above " if (e->nsession\_ids != 0 && !remote\_add\_provider) {...". can avoid entering incorrect logic , however, what if the version of openssh does not have this variable 'nsession\_ids '?(openssh7.4). Can I say that our version is not affected？

Sorry, something went wrong.
