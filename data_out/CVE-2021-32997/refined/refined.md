Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the use of a weak encryption algorithm for storing and transmitting sensitive data, specifically password hashes. This is identified as "Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort."

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CWE-916:**  The vulnerability is classified under CWE-916, which specifically addresses the "Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort". This implies that the hashing algorithm used is not strong enough to resist brute-force or other cryptanalytic attacks.
*   **Weak Encryption Algorithm:** The core issue is the implementation of an algorithm that can be easily compromised, leading to potential credential exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Access to System Credentials:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain access to system credentials. This could provide the attacker with unauthorized access to the affected systems and potentially other systems on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable with low attack complexity, implying that attackers can leverage the weak hashing algorithm over a network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable systems. No specific user privileges or interaction are required. The CVSS vector string (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N) indicates:
    *   **AV:N (Network):** The attack vector is network-based.
    *   **AC:L (Low):** The attack complexity is low.
    *   **PR:N (None):** No privileges are required.
    *  **UI:N (None):** No user interaction is required.
    *   **S:U (Unchanged):** Scope is unchanged
    *   **C:H (High):** Confidentiality impact is high.
    *   **I:L (Low):** Integrity impact is low
    *   **A:N (None):** Availability impact is none.
