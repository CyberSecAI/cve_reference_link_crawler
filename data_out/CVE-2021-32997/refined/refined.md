Based on the provided document, here's the relevant information regarding CVE-2021-32997:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a weak encryption algorithm for storing and transmitting sensitive data, specifically password hashes, in the affected products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the "Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort" (CWE-916). This means the encryption algorithm used is not robust enough, making it easier for attackers to crack password hashes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to obtain system credentials. This could lead to unauthorized access to the affected systems and potentially further compromise of the industrial control systems (ICS) environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is remote (AV:N), with low attack complexity (AC:L). This indicates the vulnerability can be exploited over a network with relative ease. The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to have network access to the affected devices. They do not need any prior privileges on the system or require any user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
The affected products include:
    - System 1 6.x, Part No. 3060/00, Versions 6.98 and prior
    - System 1, Part No. 3071/xx & 3072/xx, Versions 21.1 HF1 and prior
    - 3500 Rack Configuration, Part No. 129133-01, Versions 6.4 and prior
    - 3500/22M Firmware, Part No. 288055-01, Versions 5.05 and prior
The CVSS v3 base score is 8.2 with a vector string of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N. This indicates high confidentiality impact (C:H), low integrity impact (I:L), and no availability impact (A:N) due to the vulnerability.

The advisory also provides mitigation recommendations, such as upgrading to the latest versions of the affected products, using unique passwords, implementing network security measures, and using VPNs for remote access.
