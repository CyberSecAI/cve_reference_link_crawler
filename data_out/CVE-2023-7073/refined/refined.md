Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-7073

**Vulnerability:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Root Cause:** The `upload_to_library` AJAX action in the Auto Featured Image (Auto Post Thumbnail) plugin doesn't properly validate the provided image URL, allowing attackers to make arbitrary web requests from the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unvalidated user input (specifically the `image_url` parameter in the `upload_to_library` AJAX action)
- Lack of proper sanitization and validation of URLs before making web requests.
- The application's server is making requests based on user-controlled URLs

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers can force the web server to make requests to internal or external resources that would normally be inaccessible.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially retrieve sensitive information from internal services or resources.
- **Denial of Service:** Attackers could potentially overload internal services by directing many requests to them
- **Internal Modification:** Attackers can potentially modify data or configurations on internal services.
- This could potentially be leveraged to bypass firewalls, access restricted networks, or potentially launch further attacks on other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via an AJAX call to the `upload_to_library` action.
- Attackers supply a malicious `image_url` parameter when triggering the AJAX action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** Attackers must have at least "Author" level access to the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send requests to the vulnerable WordPress site,
- No user interaction is needed beyond sending the malicious request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in all versions of the plugin up to and including 4.0.0.
- No patch is currently available; mitigation may require uninstalling the plugin until a fix is released.
- The provided code snippet from `class-apt.php` includes the vulnerable `upload_to_library` function starting around line 947.
