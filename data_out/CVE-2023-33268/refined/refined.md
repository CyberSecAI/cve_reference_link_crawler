Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `port` parameter of the SSL certificate check function within DTS Monitoring. This parameter is vulnerable to OS command injection due to insufficient input sanitization.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **OS Command Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-provided input into a system command without proper sanitization or validation. Specifically, the `port` parameter allows for the injection of shell metacharacters and commands.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server hosting the DTS Monitoring application. This can lead to:
    *   **Code Execution:** The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates the execution of a Sliver implant, granting the attacker a reverse shell and full control over the affected server.
    *   **Data Breach:** Access to the server allows attackers to potentially access sensitive data handled by the system.
    *   **System Compromise:** Attackers can manipulate the compromised system, causing disruption, data loss, or further attacks.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **Remote:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via HTTP requests.
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious POST request to `/ajax.php`, including the command injection payload in the `check_params` parameter of the POST data.
    *   **`port` parameter:** Specifically, the attack exploits the `port` parameter within the `check_params` data by injecting shell commands using command substitution.
    *   **Blind Command Injection:** The vulnerability is "blind" meaning the attacker doesn't directly see the output of the command. However, they can still achieve code execution by using methods such as reverse shells (as shown in the PoC).

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the DTS Monitoring server.
    *   **Knowledge of the API:**  The attacker needs some knowledge of how to interact with the `/ajax.php` endpoint, including the structure and format of parameters to exploit the vulnerable function.
    *   **No authentication required:**  The provided exploit code shows that the vulnerability is exploitable without authentication.

**Additional details:**
*   The PoC demonstrates the injection of the command `$(./COMPLEX_CREATIVE)` which executes a local program on the server. This allows the attacker to bypass the lack of direct output and achieve code execution by creating a reverse shell.
*   The injected commands are part of a string within the HTTP request's POST data.
* The affected parameter is `port` in the `check_params` section of the request.
* The provided exploit string `443%7C%2B%2524(.%252FCOMPLEX_CREATIVE)` when URL decoded will be `443| $(./COMPLEX_CREATIVE)`.
