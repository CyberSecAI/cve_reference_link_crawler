- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the parsing of XE files in Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt. The issue is due to the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value before it's dereferenced as a pointer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unvalidated user-supplied value is used as a pointer, leading to an untrusted pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack requires user interaction such as opening a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious XE file and convince the user to open it. The attacker does not require any special privileges on the target system.
