Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-23068

**Vulnerable Software:** ToolJet

**Affected Versions:** v0.6.0 to v1.10.2

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to HTML injection due to insufficient input sanitization. Specifically, the first name and last name fields, used when inviting a new user, are not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **HTML Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject HTML code into the first and last name fields. This falls under CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') and CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection').
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization**: The application fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing malicious HTML to be stored and rendered later.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML code, such as JavaScript, that will be executed when the invitation email is viewed by the victim.
*   **Phishing and Credential Theft:** The injected HTML can be used to create phishing attacks that can steal user credentials or redirect users to malicious websites.
*   **Defacement:** An attacker might be able to alter the visual appearance of the email by injecting HTML.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited over the network.
*   **User Interaction Required:** Exploitation requires user interaction (the victim has to open the crafted invitation email).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the ToolJet application with the ability to invite new users.
*   **Web Proxy:** The attacker needs a web proxy tool like Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request.

**Technical Details:**
*   The attacker logs into the ToolJet application.
*   Navigates to the "manage users" section and clicks on "invite user."
*   Intercepts the invitation request with a web proxy.
*   Modifies the "first name" or "last name" field to include malicious HTML (e.g., `<a href='http://evil.com'>here</a>`).
*   Forwards the request to the server.
*   The server sends an email containing the malicious HTML to the victim.
*   When the victim opens the email, the malicious HTML is rendered in their email client (or browser), executing any injected scripts or displaying injected content.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) Code:**
```html
 Click <a href='http://evil.com'>here</a> to reset your password.<div style='display:none'>
```

**Mitigation:**
*   **Upgrade:** Upgrade ToolJet to version v1.11.0 or later, which contains a fix for this vulnerability.
*   **Input Sanitization:** Implement proper input sanitization of the first name and last name fields on the server side to neutralize any HTML entities before they are stored or rendered.

**CVSS Scores:**

*   **CVSS v3.1:**
    *   Base Score: 5.4
    *   Attack Vector: Network
    *   Attack Complexity: Low
    *   Privileges Required: Low
    *   User Interaction: Required
    *   Scope: Changed
    *   Confidentiality: Low
    *   Integrity: Low
    *   Availability: None
*   **CVSS v2:**
    *   Base Score: 3.5
    *   Access Vector: Network
    *   Access Complexity: Medium
    *   Authentication: Single
    *   Confidentiality: None
    *   Integrity: Partial
    *   Availability: None

**Additional Notes**
The fix for this vulnerability was introduced in the commit: `431dc961cdfe4d26343d1c1c951ced778fbddb58` on GitHub. This commit implemented a Data Transfer Object (DTO) layer to validate and sanitize user inputs. The commit includes updates to various files, including frontend components, server-side controllers, and DTOs. Specifically, it uses the `sanitize-html` library and added validation pipes in the server.
