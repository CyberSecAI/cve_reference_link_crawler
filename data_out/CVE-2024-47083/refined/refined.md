Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in GHSA-7w3w-pjm5-m36c, which is associated with CVE-2024-47083:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A typographical error, specifically an unexpected newline character (`\n`), in the logging code of the Power Platform Terraform Provider. This error prevents the `client_secret` from being properly masked before being written to logs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Masking of Secrets (CWE-117, CWE-532):** The primary vulnerability is the failure to mask the `client_secret` in logs, which exposes the sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** If logs are persisted to a file or an external logging system, the `client_secret` used for service principal authentication can be exposed.
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who gains access to these logs can use the exposed `client_secret` to gain unauthorized access to services or resources associated with the service principal. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Log Files:** An attacker needs access to the logs where the client secret is written. This includes:
    - Log files on disk where TF_LOG_PATH is set
    - Monitoring systems where logs are sent
    - Logging services
- **Local Access:** The CVSS score indicates a Local Attack Vector, implying that the attacker needs local access to the machine where the logs are stored.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Logs:** The attacker needs to be able to access logs generated by the Terraform provider where the `client_secret` was written. This could be achieved by compromising a system where the logs are stored, or gaining access to a user's machine if logs are stored there.
- **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs low privileges to be able to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the Power Platform Terraform Provider up to and including 2.7.0-preview.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.0.0 and later. The fix includes removing all logging of sensitive content.
- The advisory recommends rotating the `client_secret` immediately, disabling persistent logging, sanitizing existing logs, updating to the latest version of the provider, and considering OIDC for authentication instead of client secrets.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v4 base score of 8.8, classifying it as high severity.
