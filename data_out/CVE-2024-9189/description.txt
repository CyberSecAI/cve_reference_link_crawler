The EU/UK VAT Manager for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the alg_wc_eu_vat_exempt_vat_from_admin() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.12.12. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the VAT status for any order.
