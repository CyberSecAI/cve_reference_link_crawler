### Description

The EU/UK VAT Manager for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the alg\_wc\_eu\_vat\_exempt\_vat\_from\_admin() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.12.12. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the VAT status for any order.
