## 3.0 Resolved Issues

This release includes the following software fixes:

Similarly, the following warning message is displayed even though the number of users in multitenancy does not exceed the license limit:  Number of users for the LOCAL will soon exceed the license limit Number of users for the Repo 1 will soon exceed the license limit. |
| Administration Portal | Sometimes, users are accidentally removed from the Advanced Authentication database after the full or fast synchronization. |
| Device Service | When a user tries to connect a PKI token to the Ubuntu system, the Device Service does not recognize the PKI token. After restarting the Device Service, the token was recognized. |
| Enrollment Portal | When a user enrolls the U2F Yubikey by using Google Chrome on Mac or Windows workstation, the following error message is displayed when the user touches the Yubikey:  Enroll failed: Device is not attested. Contact your administrator to upload your token attestation certificate. |

| Mac OS Client | The local users are able to log in to the macOS workstation even after setting the disable\_local\_accounts parameter to True. |
