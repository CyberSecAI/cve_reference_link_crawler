The provided content relates to CVE-2024-46769.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `intel_spi_populate_chip` function in the Linux kernel's SPI driver uses `devm_kasprintf` to allocate memory for `pdata->name`. However, it does not check if the allocation is successful, potentially leading to a NULL pointer dereference if `devm_kasprintf` fails.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing NULL pointer check after `devm_kasprintf` allocation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A failed allocation may lead to a kernel crash due to the subsequent use of the NULL pointer.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the `intel_spi_populate_chip` function in a low-memory situation, causing the allocation to fail.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to trigger the affected code path, likely through some SPI configuration or usage.
