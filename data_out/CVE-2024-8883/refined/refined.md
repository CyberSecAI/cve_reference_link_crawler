  "CVE-2024-8883": {
    "status": "relevant",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "Vulnerable Redirect URI Validation",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper validation of redirect URIs"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can redirect users to an arbitrary URL, potentially exposing sensitive information like authorization codes, which could lead to session hijacking.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By setting a 'Valid Redirect URI' to http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to manipulate the redirect URI parameter in an OAuth 2.0 flow. They would also need a valid Keycloak client with the misconfigured redirect URI and the ability to trick a user into initiating a login process."
