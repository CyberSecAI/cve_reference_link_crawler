- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The password of administrative accounts can be reset without requiring the current password, provided the auto login feature is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unverified Password Change (CWE-620). The application lacks proper authentication and verification mechanisms during the password reset process when auto-login is enabled.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthorized attacker can gain administrative access to the affected applications. This could lead to complete compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have network access to the device and auto login must be enabled.
