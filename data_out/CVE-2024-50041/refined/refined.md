- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Concurrent access to `vsi->mac_filter_hash` in the i40e driver. Multiple threads modifying the hash simultaneously leads to inconsistent state and memory leaks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Race condition due to lack of synchronization when accessing and modifying the `mac_filter_hash`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Memory leaks and inconsistent state within the `mac_filter_hash` structure, potentially leading to system instability or unexpected behavior.
- **Attack vectors:** Triggering concurrent macvlan operations, such as adding and deleting port VLANs or MAC filters, on Virtual Functions (VFs).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to spawn VFs and configure port VLANs on them, and trigger concurrent macvlan operations. This likely requires some level of administrative or privileged access to the system or hypervisor.
