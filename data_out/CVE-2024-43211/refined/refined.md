- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads. These scripts will be executed when users visit the affected website.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through user-supplied input within the plugin's forms.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts through the plugin's forms. The required privilege level for exploitation is an Editor role.
