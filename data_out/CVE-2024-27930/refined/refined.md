Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control in how GLPI handles dropdown menus populated via AJAX requests. Specifically, the `getDropdownValue.php` endpoint allows an authenticated user to request dropdown data for arbitrary object types (children of `CommonDBTM`) and specify fields to be returned using the `displaywith` parameter, without properly validating user permissions. This effectively allows the user to query any table in the database, bypassing access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The vulnerability exploits a weakness in the IDOR token mechanism. While tokens are used to validate the object type, they do not adequately restrict access to specific fields or tables.
*   **SQL Injection-like Behavior:** By manipulating the `displaywith` parameter, an attacker can extract arbitrary column data from database tables, including sensitive information like password hashes, email addresses, and API tokens.
*   **Missing Access Controls:** The code does not perform proper access checks on the requested object type and fields before executing the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the GLPI database, including user credentials, personal information, and potentially other confidential data related to managed assets.
*   **Account Takeover:** By obtaining password hashes and email addresses, an attacker can attempt to crack the passwords or request password resets, leading to account takeover, especially super administrator accounts.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While not a direct result, the attacker, upon gaining super admin access, could upload malicious plugins to achieve RCE.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is carried out via HTTP requests, making it a network-based attack.
*   **AJAX Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted AJAX requests to `/ajax/getdropdownValue.php` and other related endpoints.
*   **Manipulation of Parameters:** The attacker manipulates the `itemtype`, `displaywith`, and `_idor_token` parameters in the POST requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid, low-privileged user account on the GLPI instance to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of GLPI Internals:** The attacker needs knowledge of the GLPI application structure, how dropdowns are generated and populated and that any class that inherits `CommonDBTM` can be targeted via the `/ajax/cable.php` endpoint for obtaining a valid IDOR token.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests with the required parameters and headers.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided blog post provides a detailed step-by-step walkthrough of the vulnerability discovery and exploitation.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in GLPI version 10.0.13, which includes additional checks to the IDOR tokens and filtering of sensitive fields.
*   The official CVE description is noted to be inaccurate, as it states that only fields that the user has read access to can be accessed, while this is not the case.
* The fix includes validation of the `displaywith` and `condition` parameters in IDOR tokens, restricts AJAX endpoints to central interfaces and implements better filtering of sensitive fields.

This detailed breakdown is consistent with the CVE description, which states "An authenticated user can access sensitive fields data from items on which he has read access." however, the content provides more detailed information on the root cause, attack vector and the impact of exploitation than the CVE description.
