{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `formSetTimeZone` function in Tenda AC500 firmware has a stack buffer overflow vulnerability due to uncontrolled input of the `timeZone` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack buffer overflow in the `formSetTimeZone` function. The `sscanf` function is used to parse the user-controlled `timeZone` string into fixed-size variables (v12, v13), which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is too long.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit of this vulnerability can lead to a crash of the device, and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to `/goform/SetTimeZone` with a crafted `timeZone` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the device to send the malicious POST request. No authentication is explicitly mentioned."
