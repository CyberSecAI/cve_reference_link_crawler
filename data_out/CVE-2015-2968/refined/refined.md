Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The LINE@ application allows non-SSL/TLS communications, which makes it vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of secure communication protocols (SSL/TLS) exposes the application to network eavesdropping and manipulation.
- Script injection vulnerability due to the lack of secure communication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A MITM attacker can inject malicious scripts into the communication stream.
- The injected script can invoke any API within the LINE@ application, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.
- The attacker needs to be positioned within the network path between the user and the LINE@ servers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to intercept and modify network traffic between the LINE@ application and its servers. This typically involves being on the same network or having control of a network device along the communication path.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability stems from the LINE@ application's lack of secure communication (SSL/TLS), which enables MITM attacks. This allows an attacker to inject scripts that can invoke any API of the application, potentially causing severe security breaches or unauthorized operations. The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and manipulate network traffic. The vulnerability was addressed server-side, but the vendor still recommends updating the application for security.
