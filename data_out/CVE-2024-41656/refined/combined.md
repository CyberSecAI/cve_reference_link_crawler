Already mentioned, but since we changed this to `displayName` in the frontend we need to change it here as well

Sorry, something went wrong.

I see no more usage of `a href` in the APIs 👍🏻

# Stored XSS via integration external issues

High

[oioki](/oioki)
published
GHSA-fm88-hc3v-3www
Jul 23, 2024

## Package

pip

sentry
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=10.0.0, <24.7.1

## Patched versions

24.7.1

## Description

### Impact

An unsanitized payload sent by an Integration platform integration allows the storage of arbitrary HTML tags on the Sentry side. This payload could subsequently be rendered on the Issues page, creating a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability might lead to the execution of arbitrary scripts in the context of a user’s browser.

Self-hosted Sentry users may be impacted if untrustworthy Integration platform integrations send external issues to their Sentry instance.

### Patches

The patch has been released in [Sentry 24.7.1](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/tag/24.7.1)

### Workarounds

For Sentry SaaS customers, no action is needed. This has been patched on July 22, and even prior to the fix, the exploitation was not possible due to the strict Content Security Policy deployed on sentry.io site.

For self-hosted users, we strongly recommend upgrading Sentry to the latest version. If it is not possible, you could [enable CSP on your self-hosted installation](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/csp/) with `CSP_REPORT_ONLY = False` (enforcing mode). This will mitigate the risk of XSS.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
