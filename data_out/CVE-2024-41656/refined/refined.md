Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-41656

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of payloads sent by Integration platform integrations. Specifically, arbitrary HTML tags were not being properly escaped or filtered.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The unsanitized HTML payload is stored and subsequently rendered on the Issues page, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser. This could result in various malicious activities, including data theft, session hijacking, or other forms of unauthorized access and control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Integration Platform Integrations:** The attack vector involves a malicious payload being sent through an Integration platform integration.
- **Network:** The attack vector is over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Untrustworthy Integration:** The attacker needs to be able to send external issues to the Sentry instance through an integration platform.
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker may only need low level privileges to perform this attack.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires user interaction, as the injected script executes when a user views the affected issue page within Sentry.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:** Sentry versions >=10.0.0 and <24.7.1 are vulnerable.
- **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in Sentry version 24.7.1.
- **Mitigation:** Self-hosted users can mitigate the risk by upgrading to the latest version or by enabling CSP with `CSP_REPORT_ONLY = False`
