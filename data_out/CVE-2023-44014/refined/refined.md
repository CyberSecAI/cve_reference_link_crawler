- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack overflow due to insufficient length checks on user-provided parameters `macFilterType` and `deviceList` in the `formSetMacFilterCfg` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. The `macFilterType` and `deviceList` parameters are read without any length validation before being passed to functions which may lead to a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the httpd process or potentially achieve remote code execution (RCE).
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/setMacFilterCfg` endpoint with oversized `macFilterType` and/or `deviceList` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Tenda AC10U device.
