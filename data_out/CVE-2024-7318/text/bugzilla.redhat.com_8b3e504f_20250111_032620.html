A one time passcode that is valid longer than its expiration time increases the attack window for malicious actors to abuse the system and compromise accounts. Additionally, it increases the attack surface because at any given time, two OTPs are valid. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2024-10-31 13:24:52 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | | Flags: | boliveir: needinfo?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2301876#c0)  Patrick Del Bello    2024-07-31 03:08:38 UTC  ``` Expired OTP codes are still usable when using FreeOTP when OTP token period is set to 30 seconds (default). It was found that instead of expiring and being unusable around 30 seconds in, the tokens actually are valid for an additional 30 seconds, to total 1 minute. In this case, this occurs with default OTP Policy settings of: OTP Type: Time-based OTP Hash Algorithm: SHA1 Number of digits: 6 Look around window: 1 OTP Token period: 30 seconds Reusable Token: off   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2301876#c1)  Bruno Oliveira    2024-07-31 14:52:14 UTC  ``` Please add the steps to reproduce.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2301876#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:05:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 24  Via RHSA-2024:6502 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6502](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6502)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2301876#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:05:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 22  Via RHSA-2024:6503 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6503](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6503)   ``` |  |
