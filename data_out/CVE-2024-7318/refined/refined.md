Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-7318:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Keycloak handles One-Time Passcodes (OTPs). Expired OTP codes remain valid for longer than their intended expiration period.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **OTP Expiration Bypass:** Instead of expiring and becoming unusable around the configured OTP token period (e.g., 30 seconds), the OTP tokens are valid for an additional duration, effectively doubling their lifespan (e.g., valid for a total of 1 minute when the token period is 30 seconds).
- **Increased Attack Window:** The extended validity of OTPs increases the time window in which a malicious actor can attempt to use a captured or leaked OTP.
- **Dual-Valid OTPs:**  At any given time, two OTPs are valid, increasing the attack surface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Compromise:** Exploitation of this vulnerability allows malicious actors to potentially compromise user accounts by using expired OTPs.
- **Increased Attack Surface:** The extended validity of OTPs effectively doubles the window in which an attacker can attempt to authenticate.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **OTP Capture:** An attacker could obtain an OTP through various means (e.g., eavesdropping, phishing, social engineering).
- **Time-based Attack:** Exploiting the extended validity of an expired OTP would allow the attacker to utilize it within the extended timeframe.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to obtain a valid OTP. This could potentially be achieved through various methods such as:
    - Phishing
    - Man-in-the-middle attacks
    - Social engineering

**Technical Details**
- The issue is specifically reproducible when using FreeOTP as the authenticator app, and when the OTP token period is set to 30 seconds (which is the default setting).
- The default OTP policy settings that reproduce the issue are:
    - OTP Type: Time-based
    - OTP Hash Algorithm: SHA1
    - Number of Digits: 6
    - Look around window: 1
    - OTP Token period: 30 seconds
    - Reusable Token: off

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" severity.
- Red Hat has released security advisories (RHSA-2024:6502 and RHSA-2024:6503) to address this issue in the Red Hat build of Keycloak.
- The fix is implemented in version 24.0.7
