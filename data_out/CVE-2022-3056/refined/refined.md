Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-3056:

**Root Cause:** Insufficient policy enforcement in Content Security Policy (CSP).

**Weakness:** The vulnerability lies in how Content Security Policy is enforced, or rather, not enforced sufficiently. This means that the browser doesn't adequately restrict the resources a web page is allowed to load or execute based on the defined CSP.

**Impact:** An attacker could potentially bypass the CSP, allowing them to inject and execute malicious content or scripts within the context of the vulnerable web page. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as:

*   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** Executing malicious scripts that can steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or modify the page content.
*   **Data exfiltration:**  Gaining access to sensitive data displayed on the page.
*   **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance or functionality of the web page.
*   **Other malicious actions:** Depending on the page's functionality and the injected script, the attacker might be able to perform other malicious actions within the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a web page that has a vulnerable Content Security Policy implementation
*   By exploiting the insufficient policy enforcement, an attacker can inject malicious content, violating the intended restrictions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to inject content into a webpage that is protected by a vulnerable CSP.
*   This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    *   Compromising a website directly.
    *   Tricking a user into clicking a malicious link.
    *   Exploiting other vulnerabilities on the page to inject malicious content.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Chrome version 105.0.5195.125 and later versions, as well as corresponding versions of Chromium-based browsers like Microsoft Edge.
*   The vulnerability was reported by an anonymous individual.

In summary, CVE-2022-3056 is a vulnerability where insufficient enforcement of Content Security Policy allows an attacker to bypass its intended security restrictions, potentially leading to various malicious actions through injected content.
