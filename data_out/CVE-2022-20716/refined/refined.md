Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-20716:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

-   The vulnerability is due to **improper access control** on files within the affected Cisco SD-WAN system.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Inadequate file permissions:** The system allows for modification of certain files by a local user that should not have such privileges. This enables a privilege escalation vulnerability.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can gain escalated privileges, potentially obtaining **root user** access.
-   **Full System Control:** With root access, the attacker can perform any action on the system, including modifying configurations, installing malware, and disrupting services.
-   **Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability Impact**: Successful exploitation can lead to the compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable device.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the system (local attacker with CLI access).
-   **File Modification:** The attacker must be able to modify specific files on the vulnerable device.
