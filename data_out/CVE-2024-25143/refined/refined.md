- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Document and Media widget in Liferay Portal and Liferay DXP does not limit resource consumption when generating a preview image.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled resource consumption leading to a denial-of-service vulnerability. Specifically, the lack of proper checks and limits during the generation of preview images for uploaded PNG files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote authenticated users can cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by uploading crafted PNG images.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, network-based attacks via crafted PNG images uploaded through the Document and Media widget.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to upload documents to the Document and Media widget.
