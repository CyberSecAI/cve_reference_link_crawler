Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization within the Vue 2 template compiler's AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) codegen pathway. Specifically, the compiler doesn't properly handle properties that are initially unset, leading to potential prototype pollution.
- The template compiler creates a string of code to be executed which turns component templates into render functions. These render functions are evaluated by Vue within a stringified eval statement.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Prototype Pollution:** An attacker can manipulate the prototype chain of `Object.prototype` properties, such as `staticClass` or `staticStyle`, due to missing checks for `hasOwnProperty` or explicit setting to `undefined` during AST node creation.
- **Client-Side XSS:** By polluting the prototype, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser when a vulnerable component is rendered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various impacts, such as:
    - Data theft (accessing cookies, local storage, session data)
    - Session hijacking
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the network.
- **In-browser template compilation:** The vulnerability is present in the in-browser Vue template compiler, which is responsible for creating render functions from string templates.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Low Privileges:** The attacker does not need high privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Ability to influence template compilation:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the content of a Vue template in a way that will trigger the vulnerable code path. This could be through direct manipulation of the template string or by controlling the data that is used to populate the template.
- **No user interaction:** This vulnerability does not require user interaction.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in the "full build" of Vue 2, which includes the in-browser template compiler.
- The `staticClass` property is vulnerable when a template string uses the `class` attribute with a non-dynamic class.
- The issue is related to how properties of `ASTElement` are handled during codegen.
- The vulnerability is considered to be of "Medium" severity.

**Affected Versions:**

- Vue versions >= 2.0.0 and < 3.0.0.

**Patched Versions:**

- This vulnerability is fixed in Vue 3.0.0 and later.
- HeroDevs also provides a patched version for Vue 2 called "Vue 2 NES" in versions v2.6.17 and v2.7.19.
