The provided content relates to CVE-2023-41260.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from information leakage via response messages returned from requests sent through the mail-gateway REST interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Information leakage: The system exposes potentially sensitive data in the response messages.
- Vulnerable mail-gateway REST interface: The REST interface used for mail gateway is the specific attack vector.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information by analyzing the response messages from the mail-gateway REST interface.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending malicious requests to the mail-gateway REST interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send requests to the mail-gateway REST interface.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in RT versions 5.0.5 and 4.4.7, and potentially earlier versions.
- The vendor recommends restricting access to the mail-gateway REST endpoint to only the RT server itself (localhost) as a mitigation.
