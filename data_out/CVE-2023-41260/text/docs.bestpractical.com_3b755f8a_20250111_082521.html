Security

The following security issues are fixed in this release. Thanks to
Tom Wolters of Chapter8 and the National Cyber Security Centre in
The Netherlands for reporting these findings.

* RT is vulnerable to accepting unvalidated RT email headers in
incoming email and the mail-gateway REST interface. This vulnerability
is assigned [CVE-2023-41259](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-41259).

* RT is vulnerable to information leakage via response messages returned
from requests sent via the mail-gateway REST interface. This vulnerability
is assigned [CVE-2023-41260](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-41260).

Note that in addition to upgrading to this new version, access to the mail-gateway
REST endpoint can, and in most cases should, be restricted to only the RT
server itself (localhost). This access restriction can typically be applied
in the web server running with your RT (Apache or other). This configuration
is more clearly documented as part of this release and we recommend all RT
admins review your web server configuration and consider restricting access
to this mail-gateway REST endpoint.
