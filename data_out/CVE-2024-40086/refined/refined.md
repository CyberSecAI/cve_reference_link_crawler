{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `local_app_set_router_wifi_SSID_PWD()` function copies the password from a JSON payload into a fixed-size buffer without proper length checks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of `memcpy()` to copy an arbitrary-length password into a fixed-size buffer of 64 bytes. The length is determined using `strlen()`, but no check is performed to ensure the length does not exceed the buffer size.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can overwrite stack memory, potentially leading to remote code execution and gain root access to the router.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker on the LAN can interact with the service running on port 5432 by sending custom, specially crafted messages with an overlong password field using a custom protocol that uses XXTEA encryption.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be on the same LAN as the Vilo router to interact with the vulnerable service on port 5432. The attacker also needs to know the custom protocol (that uses XXTEA encryption)."
