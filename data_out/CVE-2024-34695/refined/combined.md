feat(api): Add UserAtomicLock attribute and middleware

[Browse files](/SakuraIsayeki/WOWS-Karma/tree/6cb825976f28c68d79172aeda00e955bf5853de2)

```
This commit adds the `UserAtomicLock` attribute and middleware to the API. The `UserAtomicLock` attribute is used to lock concurrency on a given action to a specific user. The `UserAtomicLockMiddleware` provides the functionality to lock a given action to a specific user. This ensures that only one request from the same user can access the locked action at a time, preventing unwanted concurrent modifications.

# Post submission bounce/timing attack

Moderate

[SakuraIsayeki](/SakuraIsayeki)
published
GHSA-v6cc-v976-mj8g
May 10, 2024

## Package

WowsKarma.Api
(API)

## Affected versions

<=0.17.4

## Patched versions

>=0.17.4.1

## Description

### Scenario

As a user, I am able to click multiple times on "create" on a post creation prompt before the modal closes, which allows me to trigger sending several post creation API requests at once.

### Impact

Due to timing, sending multiple posts simultaneously requests bypasses the cooldown validation, however are not refreshing a user's metrics more than once, due to concurrent karma updates (concurrency issue?).

### Remediation

A patch has been deployed via [#164](https://github.com/SakuraIsayeki/WOWS-Karma/pull/164), which mitigates this issue on API. Clients are still able to send multiple requests, however the vulnerability has been mitigated, and the API issues 429 responses to all but the first concurrent request.

Manual remediation methods involve the site administrator manually removing the duplicate posts (considered as a platform maintenance action).

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H
