### **[juergw](/juergw)** commented [May 2, 2024](#issue-2274909017)

| `::crypto::tink::JsonKeysetReader` parses keysets in Tink's JSON proto keyset format.  In older releases of tink-cc, there were some cases where it would crash on some invalid inputs. Here is an example:  ``` constexpr absl::string_view kJsonTink = "NDMyNjg4NTA5MjQxMjUzMDczCg=="; // Encodes an integer std::string decoded_key; absl::Base64Unescape(kJsonTink, &decoded_key); auto json_result = crypto::tink::JsonKeysetReader::New(decoded_key); EXPECT_OK(json_result); auto keyset_result = json_result.value()->Read(); // Will cause a crash  ```  also, large and highly nested inputs were able to cause the stack to overflow.  Both of these issue are fixed in release 2.1.3. See [da091f8](https://github.com/tink-crypto/tink-cc/commit/da091f80e5629da33cf202be7a05ffe2af11f90e) and [dfbbe8f](https://github.com/tink-crypto/tink-cc/commit/dfbbe8fc685ff91b8df1ad7cbe9d4345ca2c0c33). |
