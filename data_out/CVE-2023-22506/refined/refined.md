- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An injection vulnerability that allows an attacker to modify the actions taken by a system call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Injection, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system, leading to high impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation is possible via an authenticated user modifying system calls, indicating network access is required for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user.
