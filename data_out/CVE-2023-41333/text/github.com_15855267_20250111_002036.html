### @joestringer **[joestringer](/joestringer)** commented [Sep 7, 2023](#issue-1886508890) • edited Loading

Typically if the policy target EndpointSelector does not include a

namespace, parsing will inject the namespace to ensure that only Pods

within the same namespace can be selected. Furthermore, for peer

EndpointSelectors there is a similar behaviour where ingress or egress

is allowed only to the current namespace unless the user specifies which

namespace the peer exists in. However, these defaults did not previously

apply to policies that select the reserved:init Identity, since this

Identity is not inherently namespaced. Automatically injecting the

namespace would cause the policy to no longer match this Identity.

The reserved:init Identity was introduced in order to allow a different

policy to apply to Pods as they start up, iff the full Identity of those

workloads cannot be determined when they are first connecting to the

Cilium network (CNI ADD). In order to support this special reserved:init

Identity, various exceptions were introduced into CiliumNetworkPolicy

parser that removed the automatic insertion of namespace into the

policies when there were label matches for the reserved:init namespace.

The awkward part about this abstraction early on was that there was no

way to directly associate the reserved:init Identity to any specific

Kubernetes namespace, and yet CiliumNetworkPolicy was always inherently

tied to a specific namespace. Since the introduction of the

reserved:init Identity, CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy was also

introduced, which is a much better fit for the ability to select

endpoints that are not inherently namespaced. This is because CCNP is

also not restricted to any specific namespace, it applies to Endpoints

in all namespaces. This patch proposes to even extend that policy to

apply to Endpoints that are not inside a namespace, such as Endpoints

with the `reserved:init` Identity.

This patch removes support for applying network policies for the

reserved:init Identity via CiliumNetworkPolicy in favour of

CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy. As a benefit, this allows us to simplify

the logic that applies the namespaces into the policies and reduce the

likelihood of misconfigurations.

Sorry, something went wrong.
