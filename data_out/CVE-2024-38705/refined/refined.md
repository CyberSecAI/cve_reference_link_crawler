- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ElementInvader Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack can allow a malicious actor to inject scripts like redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads. These scripts will be executed when users visit the website, potentially leading to compromised user sessions, data theft, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a vulnerability in the plugin that allows injection of malicious script code, which is then executed in the browser of site visitors.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script code through the plugin's vulnerable input points, and a user needs to visit the page containing the injected code. The vulnerability requires a user with at least Contributor privileges to exploit, according to the information provided.
