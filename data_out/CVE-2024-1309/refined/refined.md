        "Vulnerable implementations of UDP-based application protocols (e.g., DNS, NTP, TFTP, Echo, Chargen, and QOTD)",

        "Overload of vulnerable services, causing instability or unresponsiveness.",

        "additional_details": "The vulnerability is demonstrated using vulnerable implementations of protocols such as DNS, NTP, TFTP, Echo (RFC862), Chargen (RFC864), and QOTD (RFC865). An attacker can initiate communication with a server spoofing the address of another vulnerable server, causing a loop of error messages between them leading to resource exhaustion.
