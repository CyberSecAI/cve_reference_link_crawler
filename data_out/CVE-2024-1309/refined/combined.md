### Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT)

The goal of our Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is to minimize customers’ risk associated with security vulnerabilities by providing timely information, guidance and remediation of vulnerabilities in our products, including software and applications, hardware and devices, services and solutions. This team manages the receipt, investigation, internal coordination, remediation and disclosure of security vulnerability information related to Honeywell offerings.

We take security concerns seriously and work to quickly evaluate and address them. Once a security concern is reported, we commit the appropriate resources to analyze, validate, and address the issue.

### Product Security Incident Response Workflow

### Discovery Phase

##### Reporting a Potential Security Vulnerability

We welcome reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, and customers. To find out more information on how to report a potential vulnerability, please visit  [Vulnerability Reporting](/us/en/product-security#vulnerability-reporting).

##### Bug Bounty Program

At the moment, Honeywell does not participate in a bug bounty program or provide any monetary incentives for discovering vulnerabilities. Honeywell does recognize reporters and security researchers on our public [acknowledgement page](/us/en/product-security#acknowledgments).

### Triage Phase

In this phase, an incident owner is assigned to the case.

### Analysis Phase

The analysis phase entails assessing and validating the security concern by conducting thorough analysis.

### Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

We use the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System version 3.1 (CVSS v3.1)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1) to evaluate the severity level of identified vulnerabilities. This enables a common scoring method and a common language to communicate the characteristics and impacts of vulnerabilities and allows responders to prioritize responses and resources according to the threat.

Severity rating scale as shown in the table below:

| Security Impact Rating | CVSS Score |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | 9.0 – 10.0 |
| High | 7.0 – 8.9 |
| Medium | 4.0 – 6.9 |
| Low | 1.0 – 3.9 |

Load More

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

When and where applicable, Honeywell will provide the CVSS v3.1 Base Score.

We recommend consulting a security or IT professional to evaluate the risk of your specific configuration and we encourage users to compute the environmental score based on their network parameters. We also recommend leveraging a security or IT professional’s assessment of the issue to prioritize responses in your own environment.

##### Different base scores

There may be instances where NVD’s score and Honeywell's score may differ. If so, this is because as owners of the product we are able to account for configurations, build, and other nuisances of the product. In the event the score differs, please use the Honeywell base score.

### Disposition and Communication Phase

Remediation timelines will depend on many factors, including: the severity, the product affected, the current development cycle, QA cycles, and whether the issue can only be updated in a major release.

Remediation may take one or more of the following forms:

1. A new release
2. A Honeywell-provided patch
3. Instructions to download and install an update or patch from a third-party
4. A workaround to mitigate the vulnerability

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we do not guarantee a specific resolution for issues and not all issues identified may be fixed.

##### Communication and Notification

At this point in time a communication plan is determined. Below are various forms of communication.

| Forms of Communication | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Security Notice | May be released to notify customers when a vulnerability is fixed. |
| Product Release Note/Update | Release notes may be used to communicate a launch of a new software/hardware product or a product update and may include latest changes, feature enhancements, or bug fixes/patches. |
| CVE Records | Records are released to inform stakeholders about specifics regarding the vulnerability discovered. The records may include information such as Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE) ID number, description of the security vulnerability, and references associated with the vulnerability such as vulnerability reports and advisories. |
| Media Statements | May be used to address any Honeywell related news or incidents. |
| End of Service Life Notice | An EOSL notice may be released to inform a Honeywell customer that the product will no longer be supported or sold. |

|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

### Disclosure Phase

##### Notifying Customers of Vulnerability

We take responsibility to ensure that our customers are notified, when necessary, in an efficient manner. Most communication will be posted after patches or workaround has been released on our [Security Notice](/us/en/product-security#security-notices) site.

We will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerability or how to reproduce. We do not distribute exploit or proof of concept code for identified vulnerabilities.

In accordance with industry practices, we do not share our findings from internal security testing or other types of security activities with external entities. It is important to note that any unauthorized scan of our services and production systems will be considered an attack.

##### Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure

Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) is indeed a crucial process in managing and mitigating vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and services. Honeywell's approach to CVD involves engaging with various stakeholders such as partners, vendors, researchers, and community coordinators to ensure that newly discovered vulnerabilities are disclosed in a controlled and coordinated manner. Multi-party coordination is essential because it helps in understanding the different parties' vulnerability disclosure policies, handling policies, and contractual agreements, which in turn fosters trusted communication and collaboration.

By increasing transparency between parties, vendors can better understand and manage the risks posed by vulnerabilities. This transparency also facilitates engagements with other parties, ensuring that everyone involved is on the same page. The primary aim of CVD is to provide timely and consistent guidance to all parties and customers, helping them protect themselves effectively.

Honeywell follows a similar approach to CVD. They encourage independent reporters who discover vulnerabilities to contact them directly, allowing Honeywell to investigate and remediate the vulnerabilities before they are publicly disclosed. The Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) coordinates with the reporter throughout the investigation and provides updates on progress. Once an update or mitigation information is publicly released, the reporter is welcome to discuss the vulnerability publicly.

This process not only helps in protecting customers but also ensures that public disclosures are coordinated appropriately, and reporters are acknowledged for their findings. If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

For more information on CVD, please review the information provided in the following links:

PSIRT

### Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT)

The goal of our Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is to minimize customers’ risk associated with security vulnerabilities by providing timely information, guidance and remediation of vulnerabilities in our products, including software and applications, hardware and devices, services and solutions. This team manages the receipt, investigation, internal coordination, remediation and disclosure of security vulnerability information related to Honeywell offerings.

We take security concerns seriously and work to quickly evaluate and address them. Once a security concern is reported, we commit the appropriate resources to analyze, validate, and address the issue.

### Product Security Incident Response Workflow

### Discovery Phase

##### Reporting a Potential Security Vulnerability

We welcome reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, and customers. To find out more information on how to report a potential vulnerability, please visit  [Vulnerability Reporting](/us/en/product-security#vulnerability-reporting).

##### Bug Bounty Program

At the moment, Honeywell does not participate in a bug bounty program or provide any monetary incentives for discovering vulnerabilities. Honeywell does recognize reporters and security researchers on our public [acknowledgement page](/us/en/product-security#acknowledgments).

### Triage Phase

In this phase, an incident owner is assigned to the case.

### Analysis Phase

The analysis phase entails assessing and validating the security concern by conducting thorough analysis.

### Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

We use the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System version 3.1 (CVSS v3.1)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1) to evaluate the severity level of identified vulnerabilities. This enables a common scoring method and a common language to communicate the characteristics and impacts of vulnerabilities and allows responders to prioritize responses and resources according to the threat.

Severity rating scale as shown in the table below:

| Security Impact Rating | CVSS Score |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | 9.0 – 10.0 |
| High | 7.0 – 8.9 |
| Medium | 4.0 – 6.9 |
| Low | 1.0 – 3.9 |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

When and where applicable, Honeywell will provide the CVSS v3.1 Base Score.

We recommend consulting a security or IT professional to evaluate the risk of your specific configuration and we encourage users to compute the environmental score based on their network parameters. We also recommend leveraging a security or IT professional’s assessment of the issue to prioritize responses in your own environment.

##### Different base scores

There may be instances where NVD’s score and Honeywell's score may differ. If so, this is because as owners of the product we are able to account for configurations, build, and other nuisances of the product. In the event the score differs, please use the Honeywell base score.

### Disposition and Communication Phase

Remediation timelines will depend on many factors, including: the severity, the product affected, the current development cycle, QA cycles, and whether the issue can only be updated in a major release.

Remediation may take one or more of the following forms:

1. A new release
2. A Honeywell-provided patch
3. Instructions to download and install an update or patch from a third-party
4. A workaround to mitigate the vulnerability

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we do not guarantee a specific resolution for issues and not all issues identified may be fixed.

##### Communication and Notification

At this point in time a communication plan is determined. Below are various forms of communication.

| Forms of Communication | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Security Notice | May be released to notify customers when a vulnerability is fixed. |
| Product Release Note/Update | Release notes may be used to communicate a launch of a new software/hardware product or a product update and may include latest changes, feature enhancements, or bug fixes/patches. |
| CVE Records | Records are released to inform stakeholders about specifics regarding the vulnerability discovered. The records may include information such as Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE) ID number, description of the security vulnerability, and references associated with the vulnerability such as vulnerability reports and advisories. |
| Media Statements | May be used to address any Honeywell related news or incidents. |
| End of Service Life Notice | An EOSL notice may be released to inform a Honeywell customer that the product will no longer be supported or sold. |

|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

### Disclosure Phase

##### Notifying Customers of Vulnerability

We take responsibility to ensure that our customers are notified, when necessary, in an efficient manner. Most communication will be posted after patches or workaround has been released on our [Security Notice](/us/en/product-security#security-notices) site.

We will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerability or how to reproduce. We do not distribute exploit or proof of concept code for identified vulnerabilities.

In accordance with industry practices, we do not share our findings from internal security testing or other types of security activities with external entities. It is important to note that any unauthorized scan of our services and production systems will be considered an attack.

##### Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure

Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) is indeed a crucial process in managing and mitigating vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and services. Honeywell's approach to CVD involves engaging with various stakeholders such as partners, vendors, researchers, and community coordinators to ensure that newly discovered vulnerabilities are disclosed in a controlled and coordinated manner. Multi-party coordination is essential because it helps in understanding the different parties' vulnerability disclosure policies, handling policies, and contractual agreements, which in turn fosters trusted communication and collaboration.

By increasing transparency between parties, vendors can better understand and manage the risks posed by vulnerabilities. This transparency also facilitates engagements with other parties, ensuring that everyone involved is on the same page. The primary aim of CVD is to provide timely and consistent guidance to all parties and customers, helping them protect themselves effectively.

Honeywell follows a similar approach to CVD. They encourage independent reporters who discover vulnerabilities to contact them directly, allowing Honeywell to investigate and remediate the vulnerabilities before they are publicly disclosed. The Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) coordinates with the reporter throughout the investigation and provides updates on progress. Once an update or mitigation information is publicly released, the reporter is welcome to discuss the vulnerability publicly.

This process not only helps in protecting customers but also ensures that public disclosures are coordinated appropriately, and reporters are acknowledged for their findings. If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

For more information on CVD, please review the information provided in the following links:

* [Guidelines and Practices for Multi-Party Vulnerability Coordination and Disclosure](https://www.first.org/global/sigs/vulnerability-coordination/multiparty/FIRST-Multiparty-Vulnerability-Coordination-latest.pdf?20180424.pdf)

## Implementations of UDP-based application protocols are vulnerable to network loops

#### Vulnerability Note VU#417980

Original Release Date: 2024-03-19 | Last Revised: 2024-10-03

---

### Overview

A novel traffic-loop vulnerability has been identified against certain implementations of UDP-based applications protocols. An unauthenticated attacker can use maliciously-crafted packets against a UDP-based vulnerable implementation of application protocols (e.g., DNS, NTP, TFTP) that can lead to Denial-of-Service (DOS) and/or abuse of resources.

### Description

The User Datagram Protocol ([UDP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc768)) is a simple, connectionless protocol that is still commonly used in many internet-based applications. UDP has a limited packet-verification capability and is susceptible to IP spoofing. Security researchers have identified that certain implementations of the UDP protocol in applications can be triggered to create a network-loop of seemingly never-ending packets. Software implementations of UDP-based application protocols DNS, NTP, TFTP, Echo (RFC862), Chargen (RFC864), and QOTD (RFC865) were specifically found to be vulnerable to such network loops.

As an example, if two application servers have a vulnerable implementation of said protocol, an attacker can initiate a communication with the first server, spoofing the network address of the second server (victim). In many cases, the first server will respond with an error message to the victim, which will also trigger a similar behavior of another error message back to the first server. This behavior has been demonstrated to be resource exhausting and can cause services to become either unresponsive or unstable.

### Impact

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in the following scenarios:
1. Overload of a vulnerable service, causing it to become unstable or unusable.
2. DOS attack of the network backbone, causing network outage to other services.
3. Amplification attacks that involve network loops causing amplified DOS or DDOS attacks.

### Solution

#### Apply updates

CERT/CC recommends that you apply the latest patch provided by the affected vendor that addresses this vulnerability in the vendor-specific implementations. Review the vendor-specific information below. If the product is end-of-life/unsupported, vendors will be unlikely to release a patch; thus, we recommend replacing the device.

#### Protect or replace UDP applications

When possible, protect UDP-based applications using network firewall rules and/or other access-control lists to prevent unauthorized access. If the same service can be implemented using a TCP or with any request-validation capability (e.g., [Message-Authenticator](https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2869.html#Message-Authenticator)) available in the UDP-based application protocol, implement such protection to prevent unknown or spoofed requests. It is recommended that you disable unnecessary and unused UDP services that may be enabled as part of your operating system to prevent exposure of these services for abuse.

#### Deploy anti-spoofing

Network providers should deploy available anti-spoofing techniques ([BCP38](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp38)) such as Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding ([uRPF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3704)) to prevent IP spoofing in protecting their internet-facing resources against spoofing and abuse.

#### Enforce network rate-limiting

Service providers should employ network rate-limiting capabilities, such Quality-of-Service (QoS) to protect their network from abuse from network loops and amplifications and to ensure their critical resources/services are protected.
