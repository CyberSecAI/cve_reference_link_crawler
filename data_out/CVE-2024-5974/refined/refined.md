- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow exists in WatchGuard Fireware OS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated remote attacker with privileged management access can execute arbitrary code with system privileges on the firewall.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, network-based attack. The attacker needs to be authenticated with privileged management access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires privileged management access to the vulnerable Firebox device. The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the device.
