Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28663:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a design flaw in the Mali GPU Android Kernel Driver. Specifically, it involves how the driver manages memory mappings and flags for GPU virtual addresses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the handling of `GPU_VA` (GPU Virtual Address) and its related memory mappings. The following steps outline the exploitation:
1. A `GPU_VA` is created and `mmap`'ed to obtain virtual addresses for the underlying physical pages.
2. An alias for the physical pages is created, but without an `mmap`, leaving the `gpu_mapping` counter as 1
3. The flags of the `GPU_VA` are changed to `BASE_MEM_DONT_NEED`, making the underlying pages evictable by the Mali driver.
4. Because a `reg` for the aliased page exists, it can be mmap'ed, thus providing read-only access from the CPU to the memory. This read-only access to GPU memory is not intended and is the crux of the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Memory Leak:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to gain read-only access to GPU memory from the CPU. This enables reading potentially sensitive information residing in GPU memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves exploiting the Mali GPU driver via a specific sequence of memory mapping and flag manipulation operations.
*   The provided PoC demonstrates how to create a GPU virtual address, alias it, and change its flags to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Mali GPU driver, likely from an application with sufficient permissions to perform the memory operations required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to create GPU virtual addresses, alias physical pages, and manipulate memory flags through system calls or interfaces provided by the GPU driver.

**Additional Notes**
*   The provided GitHub repository contains a basic Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is described as an "internal of the Android kernel backdoor vulnerability"

In summary, CVE-2021-28663 is a memory leak vulnerability in the Mali GPU Android Kernel Driver that enables unauthorized read-only access to GPU memory by manipulating the memory mapping mechanism.
