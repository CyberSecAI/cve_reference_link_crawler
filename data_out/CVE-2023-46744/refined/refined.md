- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient filtering of SVG elements when uploading assets, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code. The filtering mechanism only blocked `<script>` tags and attributes starting with "on", but didn't prevent the use of elements like `<iframe>` with a `javascript:` URI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to inadequate SVG sanitization. The application failed to block the execution of JavaScript embedded within SVG files.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser context of a targeted user of the Squidex CMS application.
    - Potential for account compromise by stealing access tokens stored in browser local storage.
    - Privilege escalation based on the compromised user's CMS role and permissions.
    - Undermining of business logic regarding file upload validation in Content Schemas.
- **Attack vectors**: Uploading a malicious SVG file through the "upload asset" functionality. Specifically, SVG files that utilize the `<iframe>` tag with the `src="javascript:..."` attribute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Authenticated user with "assets.create" permission.
    - Ability to upload SVG files as assets within the Squidex CMS.
    - Target user needs to attempt to view the malicious SVG asset.
