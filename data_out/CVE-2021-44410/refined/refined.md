The provided content is related to CVE-2021-44410.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `UpgradePrepare` API's JSON parameter parser assumes that the "param" JSON element is an object. However, if the attacker provides a different JSON type (e.g. a string, as shown in the example), the program will attempt to access the provided value using the subscription operator, causing an assert and crashing the `cgiserver.cgi` process, leading to a device reboot.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation in the `cgiserver.cgi` JSON command parser. Specifically, the code doesn't check the type of JSON elements before attempting to access their members.
- The `UpgradePrepare` API parser incorrectly assumes the 'param' JSON element is an object.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service. The device will reboot, interrupting its functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint with a JSON payload containing the "UpgradePrepare" command and an invalid "param" value in the body.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the device.
- The attacker needs to know the correct command and the fact that the `param` parameter is vulnerable.
- While most of these vulnerabilities require a logged-in user, it's possible to leverage another vulnerability TALOS-2021-1420 to bypass authentication and exploit these issues without having to authenticate.
