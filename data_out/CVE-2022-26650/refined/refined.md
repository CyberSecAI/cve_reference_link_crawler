{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `RegexPredicateJudge.java` in ShenYu-Bootstrap uses `Pattern.matches(conditionData.getParamValue(), realData)` where both parameters are user-controllable.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS). The vulnerability exists due to the use of user-provided regular expressions without proper validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause resource exhaustion by providing malicious regular expressions and input strings.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker provides malicious regular expressions as input to the `conditionData.getParamValue()` and input strings as `realData`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control the inputs to `conditionData.getParamValue()` and `realData`."
