The provided content relates to a fix for a race condition in the Linux kernel's memory management, specifically when dealing with deferred split and large folio migration. This issue is not directly related to any specific CVE, but it addresses a bug that can lead to crashes. The commits fix the issue described.

**Root Cause:**
- A race condition exists between `deferred_split_scan()` and `folio_migrate_mapping()` when migrating large folios.
- `deferred_split_scan()` moves folios to a local list without the `split_queue_lock`, making them vulnerable to concurrent operations.
- `folio_migrate_mapping()` was not properly accounting for the possibility of a folio being on the deferred split queue, leading to potential double frees.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Race condition: The core weakness is the lack of proper synchronization between `deferred_split_scan` and `folio_migrate_mapping` when a folio is in the deferred split queue.
- Double free: The race condition could lead to a double-free scenario, where the same memory region is freed multiple times, causing a crash.
- Use-after-free: As folios are manipulated concurrently in the race, use-after-free conditions may arise.
- Incorrect page state: The race may also lead to "Bad page state" errors due to inconsistencies in page flags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Kernel crashes: The primary impact is kernel crashes due to memory corruption (double frees, use-after-frees).
- System instability: Kernel crashes can lead to system instability and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Triggering folio migration: The attack vector would involve triggering a scenario where large folios are migrated while being processed by the deferred split mechanism. This could potentially be achieved through memory pressure or specific workload patterns.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to influence memory allocation and migration within the kernel, which typically requires elevated privileges. However, the bug itself exists in the kernel so that a user-mode program could, under certain conditions, trigger the bug and crash the system.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was triggered by a subtle interaction between `deferred_split_scan()` and `folio_migrate_mapping()`.
- The fix introduces a freeze/unfreeze mechanism using `folio_ref_freeze()` and `folio_ref_unfreeze()`. When a folio is being migrated, and is also in the deferred split queue, its reference count is frozen to prevent concurrent operations from other parts of the kernel and then the folio is taken off the queue via `folio_undo_large_rmappable()`.

The fix involves changes to `mm/memcontrol.c` and `mm/migrate.c`:
- In `mm/memcontrol.c`, the removal of the folio from the split queue within mem_cgroup_migrate was removed.
- In `mm/migrate.c`, `folio_undo_large_rmappable()` is now called while the folio's reference count is frozen, ensuring exclusive access to the folio during the removal from the deferred split queue.
