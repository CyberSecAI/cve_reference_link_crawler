- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The logging module in ClamAV was following symlinks on Linux and Unix systems.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of symlinks in the logging module.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with existing access to the `clamd` or `freshclam` services could use a symlink to corrupt system files.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with existing access to `clamd` or `freshclam` services can create a malicious symlink.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have existing access to either the `clamd` or `freshclam` services.
