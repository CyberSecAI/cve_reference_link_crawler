The provided content is a Jenkins Security Advisory that includes information about CVE-2022-25193.

**CVE-2022-25193**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Snow Commander Plugin does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing permission check and CSRF vulnerability. The form validation methods do not require POST requests, leading to a CSRF vulnerability. Additionally, the lack of permission checks in the form validation methods allows attackers to connect to an attacker-specified web server using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with Overall/Read permissions can connect to an attacker-specified webserver, potentially capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Attack vectors:**  A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability via HTTP requests, without needing POST requests (CSRF).
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs Overall/Read permissions. They also need to know a valid credential ID which they can use to authenticate to the attacker-controlled server.

The advisory states that Snow Commander Plugin version 2.0 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation methods, fixing this vulnerability.
