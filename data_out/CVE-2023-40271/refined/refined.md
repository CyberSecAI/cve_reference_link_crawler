The provided content discusses a fix related to FPU initialization in Trusted Firmware-M for Nordic nRF devices. It does not describe a security vulnerability, but rather a configuration issue that led to a failed assertion during initialization on nRF91 series devices.

Here's a breakdown:

- **Root Cause:** The code was attempting to configure the Floating-Point Unit (FPU) on Nordic nRF91 series devices, where the FPU is not configurable and is always non-secure. This caused an assertion failure because the FPU present field was not set for the SPU configuration on these devices.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  There is no direct security vulnerability mentioned. The issue was a configuration error.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** There is no security impact mentioned. The failed assertion in the initialization would lead to the program not running properly.
- **Attack Vectors:** There are no attack vectors as this is an initialization error, not a security vulnerability.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Not applicable as there is no security vulnerability.

Essentially, this commit fixes an incorrect FPU configuration, preventing an assertion error during initialization on specific Nordic nRF91 devices.

**Response:** NOINFO
