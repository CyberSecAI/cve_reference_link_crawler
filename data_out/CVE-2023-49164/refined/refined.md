- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Ocean Extra Plugin (<= 2.2.2) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies depending on the actions the plugin allows.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into submitting it, causing unintended actions on the WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into submitting a malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
