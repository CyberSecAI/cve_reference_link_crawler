```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses `sprintf` with format strings and command parameters without checking the size of the input parameters against the size of the stack buffer, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-120)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger the vulnerabilities.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted network packet sent to the device's `DetranCLI` interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device. The CVSS score indicates that an attacker needs high privileges on the device to exploit this vulnerability."
