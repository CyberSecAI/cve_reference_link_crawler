Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36436:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The content directly references CVE-2022-36436 and describes an authentication bypass vulnerability in Twisted VNC Authentication Proxy, which aligns with the CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the VNCAuthProxy not enforcing the "VNC Authentication" security type during the RFB handshake.
*   The proxy server advertises both "None" (no authentication) and "VNC Authentication" as supported security types.
*   The proxy server accepts the client's selection of "None" as a valid security type and proceeds without requiring authentication.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The core weakness is the lack of enforcement of the VNC Authentication security type, allowing connections without proper authentication.
*   **Hardcoded Security Types:** The supported security types are hardcoded, making it difficult to enforce specific authentication methods.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The proxy accepts the client's security type selection without validation.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can bypass authentication and connect to VNC servers protected by the proxy.
*   **Session Hijacking (Shared Access):** By setting the shared-flag option to true, attackers can join an existing VNC session, gaining the same access level as a legitimate user.
*   **Denial of Service:** By setting the shared-flag to false, attackers can disconnect legitimate users from their VNC sessions.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the proxy server.
*   **Port Scanning:**  Attackers must scan the dynamic port range (5800-5899) to identify active connections to VNC servers.
*   **RFB Handshake Manipulation:** The attacker needs to send specific RFB messages to bypass authentication

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be able to reach the proxy server over the network.
*   **VNC Client:** The attacker needs a VNC client that can be configured to request the "None" security type (or a modified client).
*   **Timing:** Attackers must identify when the proxy server is actively accepting connections for a specific target VNC server.

**Additional Information from Content:**

*   The vulnerability was identified during a security audit.
*   The fix was implemented in version 1.2.0 of Twisted VNC Authentication Proxy.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions prior to 1.2.0.
*   The content from `cert.grnet.gr` provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, exploitation, indicators of compromise, and a sample script for detecting exploitation.
*   The vulnerability can be detected in logs by looking for instances where "Successfully authenticated a client" messages exist without the corresponding "Doing VNC auth, buf" messages.
* The Github advisory page includes a CVSS v4 score of 9.3 which is critical
* The patch includes modifications to `vncap/tests/test_protocol.py` to test the fix.
* The patch modifies `vncap/vnc/protocol.py` to only allow VNC auth and remove the No auth option by sending `\x01\x02` instead of `\x02\x01\x02` as an option to client.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**

Twisted VNC Authentication Proxy fails to properly enforce authentication during the initial handshake, allowing remote attackers with network access to bypass authentication and access or terminate VNC sessions if the proxy server is currently accepting connections for the target VNC server. This is achieved by the attacker requesting the "None" security type and the server accepting the selection.
