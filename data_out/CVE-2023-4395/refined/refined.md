Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the commit `36d1d4d256cbbab028342ba10cc493e5c119172c`:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The commit addresses a vulnerability related to improper mime type detection during asset uploads. The original code was not correctly identifying and preventing the upload of potentially dangerous file types, specifically PHP and HTML files, which could lead to security risks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate file type validation:** The initial implementation failed to correctly identify and block the upload of files with extensions like `.php`, `.phps`, and `.html`.
*   **Mime type bypass:** The code initially relied on `finfo_file` with a temporary file path, which may not accurately reflect the true mime type of the uploaded file. Additionally, the code used `pathinfo` with the file path instead of using the actual uploaded file's name for extension detection, which could be manipulated.
*   **Insufficient forbidden extension checks:** The code only checked the extension in some places, missing the extension in other cases which allowed for bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** Uploading malicious HTML files could potentially lead to XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Server compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the server and associated data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The primary attack vector involves uploading files through the asset manager interface.
*   **Mime type manipulation:** Attackers could attempt to manipulate file extensions or mime types to bypass the initial checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the asset manager:** An attacker would require access to the asset manager interface to upload files.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerabilities:** The attacker would need knowledge of the vulnerabilities within the file upload process and the capability to craft a payload that could exploit them.

**Summary of Changes**

The commit includes the following changes to mitigate the vulnerability:

*   **Improved mime type detection:** Replaced using `finfo_file` with a temporary file path and instead uses `$finfo->file($files['tmp_name'][$i])` to accurately identify mime types of uploaded files.
*   **Enhanced extension checks:** Added checks to prevent the upload of files with `php`, `phps`, and `html` extensions, both from the file path as well as the uploaded file's extension. This now covers more bases for blocking malicious file uploads.
*   **Clearer change log:** An entry in the `CHANGELOG.md` indicates that the fix specifically prevents uploading `.phps` + `.(x)html` files, making the remediation clear.
