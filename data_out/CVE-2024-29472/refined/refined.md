The provided content describes multiple stored XSS vulnerabilities in OneBlog v2.3.4.

**Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it in web pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The application stores unsanitized user input in the database, which is then rendered as part of web pages without proper encoding or sanitization. This occurs in multiple areas of the application such as category lists, friendly links, notice management, privilege management, role management and user lists.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **User information theft:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts to steal sensitive information like user credentials and cookies.
*   **Session hijacking:** Attackers can steal user cookies to bypass authentication and impersonate users.
*   **Malicious redirection:** Attackers can redirect users to phishing websites or websites that distribute malware.
*  **Website tampering:** Attackers can modify webpage content to deceive users or spread malicious content.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through multiple input fields within the application's administrative interface.
*   The attacker needs to log in to the admin interface using credentials root/123456.
*   The injected scripts are stored in the database and executed when other users visit the affected pages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have access to the administrative interface of the vulnerable OneBlog instance, usually achieved via valid user credentials, for example, `root/123456`.
*   The attacker requires the ability to insert data into the various vulnerable input fields to inject their XSS payloads.
