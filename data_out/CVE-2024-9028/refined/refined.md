### Summary of Vulnerability Information for CVE-2024-9028

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the 'sgpx' shortcode of the WP GPX Maps plugin. User-supplied attributes to this shortcode are not properly handled, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a stored XSS vulnerability. Malicious scripts can be injected into the website's database through the plugin's shortcode attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
*   **User Compromise:** When a user accesses a page containing the injected script, the script executes within the user's browser, potentially leading to various malicious outcomes, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Data theft
    *   Website defacement

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** The attack vector involves using the 'sgpx' shortcode and injecting malicious JavaScript code through the shortcode's attributes.
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user views a page where the malicious shortcode has been inserted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This level of access allows users to create or modify content, which includes the ability to add shortcodes.
*   **Content Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create or edit pages or posts in order to insert the malicious shortcode.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the WP GPX Maps plugin up to and including version 1.7.08.
*   The provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, including specific shortcode attributes as the attack vector and the specific user roles required to exploit the vulnerability.
