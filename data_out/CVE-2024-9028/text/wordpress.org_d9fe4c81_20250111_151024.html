### [test your updates better](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/test-your-updates-better/)

[sjoerd72](https://profiles.wordpress.org/sjoerd72/ "Posts by sjoerd72")

Great plugin but please – test better – you should test with tracks that do not have time/date/elevation per point.
Please update wp-gpx-maps-utils.php (lines 379 – 383):
$points->maxEle = (count($\_ele) > 0 ? max( $\_ele ) : 0);
$points->minEle = (count($\_ele) > 0 ? min( $\_ele ) : 0);
$points->totalLength = max( $\_dist );
$points->maxTime = (count($\_time) > 0 ? max( $\_time ) : 0);
$points->minTime = (count($\_time) > 0 ? min( $\_time ) : 0);
If tracks do not contains times(speed) or elevation the code breaks

This plugin is easy to use.
After cycling I download the gpx cycle route from my bike nav device and then upload to my cycle route site Zozibike.com. to display the route.
developer keeps up with updates and have always been stable.
Update: it now does not work and its been 3 weeks and no updates
does not work with PHP8
