  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2024-27030",
    "description": "The provided content reveals a race condition vulnerability in the Marvell OcteonTX2 AF driver within the Linux kernel. The root cause is the use of a single interrupt handler for both Physical Function (PF) to Accelerator Function (AF) and Virtual Function (VF) to AF interrupts. This can lead to data corruption when two interrupts are raised simultaneously on different CPUs, causing two cores to attempt to handle the same event concurrently.",
    "affected_component": "Marvell OcteonTX2 AF driver in the Linux kernel",
     "root_cause": "Shared interrupt handler for PF to AF and VF to AF interrupts.",
    "weakness": "Race condition due to concurrent access to shared data structures.",
    "impact": "Data corruption when handling interrupts.",
    "attack_vector": "Triggering concurrent interrupts from PF and VF to AF.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to generate interrupts on both PF and VF."
  },
  "resolution": "The vulnerability was resolved by implementing separate interrupt handlers for PF to AF and VF to AF interrupts, preventing the race condition.",
