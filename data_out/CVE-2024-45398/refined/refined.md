Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper restrictions on file uploads in the Contao file manager. Specifically, back-end users with file manager access can upload malicious files, including scripts like PHP, and potentially execute them on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system doesn't adequately validate or sanitize uploaded files, allowing users to upload executable code.
*   **Remote Command Execution:** Uploaded malicious files can be executed on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** Successful exploitation can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Contao CMS.
*   **High Confidentiality Impact:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive data.
*  **High Integrity Impact:** An attacker could potentially modify sensitive data.
*   **Low Availability Impact**: The attacker could potentially disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Back-end Access:** The attacker needs to have a valid back-end user account with access to the file manager within the Contao CMS.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker requires a low level of privileges as a back-end user.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Contao versions 4.0 to 4.13.48
*   Contao versions 5.0 to 5.4.2

**Patched Versions:**

*   Contao 4.13.49
*   Contao 5.3.15
*    Contao 5.4.3

**Workaround:**

*   Configure the webserver to prevent execution of PHP files and other scripts within the Contao file upload directory.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as "High" severity with a CVSS score of 8.3.
*   The CWE associated with the vulnerability is CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Jakob Steeg from usd AG.
