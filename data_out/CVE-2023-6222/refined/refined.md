The provided content relates to CVE-2023-6222.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Quttera Web Malware Scanner plugin for WordPress does not properly validate user-supplied input used in file paths.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path Traversal vulnerability (CWE-22). The plugin allows an attacker to manipulate the `FILE_PATH` parameter to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrative privileges can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive information such as configuration files, credentials, or other data.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's admin interface via a crafted `FILE_PATH` parameter in an HTTP POST request to `admin-ajax.php`. The vulnerable parameter is located in the "Show File" functionality of the "Detected Threats" section after performing a scan.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges within the WordPress site to access the vulnerable functionality.
