- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Custom Twitter Feeds (Tweets Widget) plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site by tricking them into submitting a crafted request. The specific impact depends on the actions available through the vulnerable plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious link or embed a form on a website that, when visited by an authenticated user, will trigger actions on the vulnerable WordPress site on the user's behalf.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in WordPress user into visiting a malicious site or clicking a malicious link. The attacker does not need any prior authentication on the target WordPress site.
