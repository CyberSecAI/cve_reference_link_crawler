{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "An abort that is responded to by iSCSI itself is added to `tmr_list` but does not go to target core. A LUN_RESET that goes through `tmr_list` takes a refcounter on the abort and waits for completion. However, the abort will never complete because it was not started in target core.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of abort commands in the target core leading to a deadlock."
    ],
    "impact": "A deadlock occurs, leading to a denial of service. The system hangs indefinitely, blocking all related processes.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending an abort command that is handled by iSCSI rather than the target core.",
      "Triggering a LUN_RESET after sending an abort that's not handled by target core."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send SCSI commands to the target, particularly abort and reset commands. This would typically require having access to the iSCSI connection and being able to interact with the target."
