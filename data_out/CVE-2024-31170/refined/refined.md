- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `fluid_msg::of10::StatsReplyQueue::unpack` routine of the Open Networking Foundation (ONF) libfluid library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. This likely means that the code is accessing memory outside the allocated buffer when unpacking network messages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A network attacker can trigger a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition on the target component.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by network traffic, making it remotely exploitable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a network position to send crafted network packets to the vulnerable component. No specific authentication or privileges are required, the attack can be launched by an unauthenticated attacker.
