- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data when parsing PSD files within Kofax Power PDF. Specifically, the application fails to validate the length of user-provided data before copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious PSD file or visiting a malicious page designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PSD file to a user of Kofax Power PDF or lure the user to a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
