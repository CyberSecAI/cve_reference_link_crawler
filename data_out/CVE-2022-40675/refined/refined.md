- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the "wrong use of cryptographic primitives" (CWE-310) within FortiNAC. This likely means that the cryptographic algorithms, keys, or protocols are not implemented or used correctly.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the improper use of cryptographic functions, making the system vulnerable to attacks that compromise confidentiality and integrity. This could include the use of insecure algorithms, weak keys, or flawed implementations of encryption protocols.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially decipher encrypted traffic, gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, and/or forge specific packets to manipulate the system. This can lead to a compromise of confidentiality and integrity.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any special privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability (PR:N, UI:N).
