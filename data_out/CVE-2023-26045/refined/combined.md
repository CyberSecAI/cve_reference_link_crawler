# Path traversal and code execution via prototype vulnerability

Critical

[julianlam](/julianlam)
published
GHSA-vh2g-6c4x-5hmp
Jul 24, 2023

## Package

npm

nodebb
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>=2.5.0 <2.8.7

## Patched versions

2.8.7

## Description

### Impact

Due to the use of the [object destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) syntax in the user export code path, combined with a path traversal vulnerability, a specially crafted payload could invoke the user export logic to arbitrarily execute javascript files on the local disk.

### Patches

Patched in v2.8.7

### Workarounds

Site maintainers can cherry pick [ec58700](https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/commit/ec58700f6dff8e5b4af1544f6205ec362b593092) into their codebase to patch the exploit.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
