    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2024-43701",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from a flaw in the handling of Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) invalidation when a dma_buf is imported into multiple GPU devices.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free vulnerability due to improper TLB invalidation",
          "Improper GPU system calls leading to access of freed memory."
