The provided content relates to CVE-2024-28158.

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**

The Subversion Partial Release Manager Plugin does not perform a permission check on an HTTP endpoint. Additionally, this endpoint does not require POST requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing permission check:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks on an HTTP endpoint, which allows unauthorized users to trigger a build.
*   **CSRF vulnerability:** The HTTP endpoint does not require POST requests, making it susceptible to cross-site request forgery attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Attackers with Item/Read permission can trigger a build.
*   Attackers can exploit the CSRF vulnerability to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a user.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker can send an unauthorized request to the vulnerable HTTP endpoint.
*   The CSRF vulnerability can be exploited using a malicious web page or link to trigger a build.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have Item/Read permission in Jenkins.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected endpoint.
*   For the CSRF attack, the attacker would need to trick a user into visiting a malicious page or clicking a malicious link.
