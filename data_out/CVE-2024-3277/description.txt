The Yumpu ePaper publishing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the ajax_handler function in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.24. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to upload PDF files and publish them, as well as modify the API key.
