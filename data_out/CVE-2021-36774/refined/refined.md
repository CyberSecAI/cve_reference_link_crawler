Subject: CVE-2021-36774: Apache Kylin: Mysql JDBC Connector Deserialize RCE

Severity: moderate

Description:

Apache Kylin allows users to read data from other database systems using JDBC. The MySQL JDBC driver supports certain properties, which, if left unmitigated, can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code from a hacker-controlled malicious MySQL server within Kylin server processes.
This issue affects Apache Kylin Apache Kylin 2 version 2.6.6 and prior versions; Apache Kylin 3 version 3.1.2 and prior versions.

Mitigation:

Users of Kylin 2.x & Kylin 3.x should upgrade to 3.1.3 or apply patch <https://github.com/apache/kylin/pull/1694>.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The MySQL JDBC driver used by Apache Kylin supports certain properties that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by controlling a malicious MySQL server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unmitigated deserialization vulnerability in the MySQL JDBC driver.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the Kylin server processes.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker controls a malicious MySQL server that is connected to by the vulnerable Apache Kylin instance via JDBC.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to control a MySQL server that is accessible to the vulnerable Apache Kylin instance.
