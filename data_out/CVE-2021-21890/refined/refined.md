- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a stack-based buffer overflow in the `FsBrowseClean` function of the Lantronix PremierWave 2050 Web Manager application. Specifically, two calls to `sprintf` are made without proper bounds checking when constructing a file path, using a user-controlled source (`path` parameter).

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) due to the unchecked use of `sprintf`. The application doesn't validate the length of the `path` parameter before using it in `sprintf`, leading to a buffer overflow if a sufficiently long path is provided. There are two vulnerable calls to `sprintf`, depending on the `action` parameter's value ("deletedir" or "deletefile").

- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to overwrite the stack, gaining control of the program counter and leading to remote code execution on the device.

- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the device's web manager application. The request needs to include a large value in the "path" parameter within the FsBrowseClean ajax request. The "action" parameter determines which vulnerable code path is taken: either "deletedir" or "deletefile".

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.
    - The attacker must authenticate to the web manager application using valid credentials, as the code verifies that a user is logged in and has the `filesystem` permission before reaching the vulnerable `sprintf` calls.
