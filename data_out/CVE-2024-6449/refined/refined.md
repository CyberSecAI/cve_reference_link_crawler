**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser by loading scripts from a remote location controlled by the attacker.
- It is possible to perform limited enumeration of devices on the LAN where the server is located.

**Attack vectors:**
- An unauthenticated remote attacker crafts a URL with a malicious payload in a GET request parameter.
- The victim user must be tricked into opening the crafted URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require authentication.
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious payload accessible via a URL.
