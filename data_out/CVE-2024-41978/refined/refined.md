- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected devices log sensitive information related to the generation of 2FA tokens in log files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insertion of sensitive information (2FA token generation details) into log files (CWE-532).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially forge 2FA tokens of other users by accessing the logged sensitive information, potentially gaining unauthorized access to accounts or systems.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated with low privileges to access the log files containing the sensitive information.
