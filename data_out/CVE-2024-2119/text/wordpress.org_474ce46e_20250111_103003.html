I am very happy with the plugin, it is easy to use and does what it is supposed to do, it also offers many creative design options.
A small difficulty initially arose when I tried to create a table of contents from already numbered headings, as the numbering appeared twice. This was easily solved by selecting the option ‘without enumeration’ in the plugin settings under General/Enumeration.
Thank you very much!

This is a great plugin! Initially, I wasn’t sure about installing a plugin that automatically installs table of contents on every posts, instead of selected the posts I want to show the TOC on. After using it, I came to the conclusion that:
1/ It’s much better if you may uninstall the plugin, it won’t require removing code from posts;
2/ The options ensure you will make TOC available on posts that realy need it. It’s very well thought.
