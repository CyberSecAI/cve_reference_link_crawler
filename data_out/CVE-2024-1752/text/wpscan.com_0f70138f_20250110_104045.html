## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Font Farsi <= 1.6.6 - Admin+ Stored XSS in Settings

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=font-farsi-custom-font
2. In the first field, add `"><script>alert(32)</script>`
3. Click "Save Changes" and see the XSS
Note: Other fields are likely vulnerable

### Affects Plugins
