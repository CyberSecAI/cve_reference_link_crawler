**CVE-2023-5562 - Unsafe default allows for cross-site scripting attacks in KNIME Server and KNIME Business Hub**

*   **Root Cause:** An unsafe default configuration in KNIME Analytics Platform where JavaScript-based view nodes do not sanitize displayed data.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of data sanitization in JavaScript-based view nodes.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** If the data to be displayed contains JavaScript, this code is executed in the browser. The attacker can perform any operations the current user is allowed to perform silently.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious user can inject JavaScript code into the data that is displayed by the view nodes.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No specific privileges are required to inject malicious data, but user interaction is needed, as the malicious code will execute when a user views the data. The attacker must be able to influence the data being displayed.
