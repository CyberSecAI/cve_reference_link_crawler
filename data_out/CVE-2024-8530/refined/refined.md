- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authentication for a critical function. Specifically, an already generated “logcaptures” archive can be accessed directly via HTTPS without requiring authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of private data contained within the logcapture archive. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack; accessing the logcapture archive directly through HTTPS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the Data Center Expert server. They do not need prior authentication to the system; they simply need to access the URL where the log files are located.
