# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

#### Description

An unauthenticated user can retrieve the list of users through a public accessible URL

Note: the dataleak is only true in case of a closed wiki, with specific rights to allow the usage of ForgotUsername/ResetPassword pages.

Note: a "closed wiki" is when "Prevent unregistered users from viewing pages, regardless of the page rights in the User" is checked in the admin (XWiki.XWikiPreference.authenticate\_view = true)

To reproduce this access one of the following:

```

<server>/xwiki/bin/get/XWiki/ForgotUsername?xpage=getdocuments&childrenOf=XWiki&exclude=XWiki.ForgotUsername&queryFilters=unique,hidden&offset=1&limit=100&reqNo=2
```

```

<server>/xwiki/bin/get/XWiki/ResetPassword?xpage=getdocuments&childrenOf=XWiki&exclude=XWiki.ResetPassword&queryFilters=unique,hidden&offset=1&limit=100&reqNo=2
```

```

<server>/xwiki/bin/login/XWikiLogin?xpage=getdocuments&limit=10000
```

Note: ForgotUsername/ResetPassword are not accessible anymore, but the issue is still true for XWikiLogin, and needs to be solved in a general way.

II managed to make them inaccessible by removing the XwikiGuest user from objects of these pages:

* <server>/xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/ResetPassword
* <server>/xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/ForgotUsername

  But this makes the Reset password / username unusable.

Note that this issue is not directly related to ResetPassword / ForgotUsername pages: it exists for any page of the wiki available for guest user.

In addition to getdocuments from the examples above, the following templates could also be used in the same way, and have been fixed accordingly:

* getdeleteddocuments.vm
* getgroupmembers.vm
* getgroups.vm
* getusers.vm
