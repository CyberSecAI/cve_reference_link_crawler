- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The GiveWP plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the plugin. Specific impact varies based on the targeted action, but it could include changes to settings, financial transactions, user management, etc.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious request that targets a vulnerable function of the plugin. The victim must be a logged-in user of the targeted WordPress site and tricked into submitting the forged request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious request. No specific user privilege is required for the attacker but needs a logged-in user of the targeted website to execute the malicious request.
