Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2024-36942.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a memory leak introduced in the error path of the firmware download process for Qualcomm Atheros (QCA) Bluetooth controllers. Specifically, if the sanity checks on the firmware data fail, the allocated memory for the firmware buffer is not freed before returning, resulting in a leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The primary vulnerability is a memory leak in the `qca_download_firmware` function within the `drivers/bluetooth/btqca.c` file.
- Improper resource handling: The code fails to free the allocated firmware buffer when the `qca_tlv_check_data` function returns an error.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion: Repeated failures in the firmware sanity checks could lead to memory exhaustion over time.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious or corrupted firmware: An attacker could provide a maliciously crafted or corrupted firmware image that fails the sanity checks, triggering the memory leak.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the device initialization and firmware download, which could be initiated by a local process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the firmware that the driver attempts to load onto the Bluetooth controller. This would be a local attacker who has control over the firmware files being used by the system.
