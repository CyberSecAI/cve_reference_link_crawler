Affected Version: media-server 1.0.0 0d60f4d784fe7f19365a5b1fcf6d05c7bc5633fb(the current latest branch)

Vulnerability Description: This vulnerability is a UAF (Use-After-Free) vulnerability discovered in the file /media-server/libsip/src/uac/sip-uac-subscribe.c. It could be maliciously exploited, leading to a denial-of-service attack.

media-server download address:<https://github.com/ireader/media-server.git>

Defect Location and Description:

In the file /media-server/libsip/src/uac/sip-uac-subscribe.c, a struct pointer named "subscribe" is defined at line 15. This pointer is passed to the function sip\_subscribe\_remove at line 41, as shown in the following diagram.

In the sip\_subscribe\_remove function, this pointer is passed to the sip\_subscribe\_release function at line 121, as illustrated in the diagram below.

In the sip\_subscribe\_release function, the memory space pointed to by the subscribe pointer is released at line 42, as shown in the diagram below.

Finally, at line 42, the assert statement uses subscribe->ref when the memory pointed to by subscribe has already been released, thereby creating a post-release usage vulnerability, as shown in the diagram below.
