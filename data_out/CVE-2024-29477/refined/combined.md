Dolibarr ERP and CRM
# Open Source ERP & CRM for business

(SMEs, Large Companies, Freelancers, Foundations)

[Test online](/onlinedemo.php)

## One **web suite** to manage all of your **business**...

## An all-in-one suite

![Dolibarr, easy to use ERP and CRM software for businesses](/medias/image/www.dolibarr.org/images/dolibarr_box.webp)

• **Enable only the features that you want**: Whatever your needs are (Customer Relationship Management, Sales, Human Resources, Logistics, Stock, Invoicing, Accounting, Manufacturing, Marketing, Foundation Management, Surveys, ...), you can setup the application to match your needs... [See Features](#features)
• **No more double entries**: Integration between the features/modules is ready and "in-the-box". Users are immediately able to work with the software, even without customisation.
• **Upgrade at any time**: The upgrades of new versions are integrated by design into the development process. So, you can upgrade Dolibarr at any time to the latest version, irrespective of which Dolibarr version you are using, and without losing any data. Thus, users always benefit from the latest features and innovations.
• **A customisable and extensible application**: The **marketplace** is open to everybody and serves as a central repository for hundreds of external add-ons which enhance Dolibarr for specific needs.
You can also extend and enhance the features of your application by yourself, without any coding or development effort, by using the **low-code** Module Builder assistant. If the Module Builder does not offer all the customisation that you need, then you can take the route of custom development to achieve your business goals.

## A FOSS (Free Open Source Software) model

• **A more competitive solution**: Due to our **Free Open Source Software** model, several thousands of developers, testers, translators, and end users work on the Dolibarr project.That's why Dolibarr is always at the forefront of innovation.
• **The easiest ERP and CRM** system in the market: The Open Source model allows developers and users to enhance the user interface due to the constant feedback and contributions of the Dolibarr user community.
Everybody can contribute to enhance the Dolibarr application. This is an important factor that defines why Dolibarr became so user-friendly. [See Community section](#community)

## A multi-distribution model - On-premise or in the Cloud

• **Install the Dolibarr application where ever you want**: You can install and use Dolibarr **as a local application** or **online** on a dedicated/virtual machine. You can thus use Dolibarr **from anywhere and on any device**.
• **Available on all platforms**, **on-premise** or as a **SaaS application**: Dolibarr is available in various forms: From **auto-installer packages** that install Dolibarr and all prerequisites with no need of any technical knowledge, or from the **standard distribution** working on all Operating System platforms and PHP architectures (Windows, Mac, Linux).
Dolibarr is also available as a **SaaS application**. [See Cloud offers](https://saas.dolibarr.org)

• **A rich ecosystem of partners**: Because Dolibarr is Open Source software, you can rely on any Open Source company to assist you or to engage in custom development if you need it.
