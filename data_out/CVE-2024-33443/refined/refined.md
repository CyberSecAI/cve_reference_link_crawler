Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the direct use of user-controlled input within the `file_put_contents` function, leading to code injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Code Injection:** The application takes user-provided data from the `$_POST` array, specifically the `config` parameter, and directly writes this data into a PHP file (`config.php`) without any sanitization or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious PHP code into the `config` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete compromise of the application and potentially the server.
*   **Data Breaches:** An attacker could use code execution to access sensitive data, modify or delete existing data, and compromise other resources available on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to the `/admin.php?s=/Addons/build.html` endpoint with a payload containing PHP code in the `config` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Admin User:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an admin user to access the vulnerable endpoint and trigger the code injection.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send the crafted malicious POST request.
