{
  "CVE": "CVE-2022-37601",
  "description": "Prototype pollution vulnerability in function parseQuery in parseQuery.js in webpack loader-utils 2.0.0 via the name variable in parseQuery.js. The prototype pollution vulnerability can be mitigated with several best practices.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `parseQuery` function in `parseQuery.js` uses an insecure method of assigning properties to an object, which can be exploited to modify the object's prototype using the `__proto__` property",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Prototype pollution"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject properties into object prototypes, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, or other security issues depending on the application's usage of the polluted object.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a malicious query string with `__proto__` keys to the `parseQuery` function.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to control or influence the query string passed to the vulnerable `parseQuery` function."
  },
  "fix": {
     "description": "The vulnerability is fixed by migrating to `3` version or by using  `Object.create(null)` instead of `{}` when creating the result object in the `parseQuery` function, preventing prototype pollution via `__proto__`.",
    "versions": [
        "2.0.3",
        "1.4.1"
      ]
  },
    "extra_details": [
        "The vulnerability is present in version 2.0.0 of loader-utils.",
        "The vulnerable code lies in the `lib/parseQuery.js` file, specifically at line 29.",
        "The issue was reported by a static code analyzer which does not consider context.",
        "The vulnerability is related to the usage of `result[name]` assignments.",
         "The fix involves changing `const result = {};` to `const result = Object.create(null);`",
        "Some developers believe this is not a direct prototype pollution issue but 'prototype poisoning' as it does not pollute the global object prototype.",
        "The issue was also backported to 1.x version line.",
         "The vulnerability is related to the usage of `JSON.parse` within the `parseQuery` function.",
         "The vulnerability was caused by a dependency `json5` and was fixed in [CVE-2022-46175](https://github.com/json5/json5/security/advisories/GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h)."
