Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-28110:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the `cloudevents/sdk-go` library handles the `http.Client` when a custom `RoundTripper` is provided. Specifically, when a `cloudevents.Client` is created using `WithRoundTripper`, the provided `RoundTripper` is assigned to the `Transport` field of the **shared** `http.DefaultClient` if `p.Client` is nil. This modification of the default client can have unintended side effects, such as leaking credentials.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Global State Modification:** The library modifies the global `http.DefaultClient` by setting its `Transport` to the user-provided `RoundTripper`. This is problematic because the default client is a shared resource used by other parts of the application or other libraries.
- **Credential Leakage:** When the custom `RoundTripper` is an authenticated transport (e.g., `oauth2.Transport` or `idtoken.NewClient(...).Transport`), the `http.DefaultClient` will now send authorization tokens to *any endpoint* it connects to which can lead to credential exposure and unauthorized access to systems or resources.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Credential leakage:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive resources by intercepting the leaked credentials.
- **Unauthorized access:** The leaked credentials could allow an attacker to impersonate the application, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when a user creates a `cloudevents.Client` using the `WithRoundTripper` option and provides an authenticated `http.RoundTripper`. If a user uses the default http client, they will be affected.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker needs no special position. This vulnerability exists in the application's code, and an attacker would need to find a way to exploit the application to cause it to send a request to an attacker controlled endpoint. This could be done by getting a user to trigger functionality using the affected code path.

**Additional notes:**

- The fix for this vulnerability is to avoid modifying `http.DefaultClient`. The corrected code initializes a new `http.Client` if `p.Client` is nil.
- The vulnerability is considered moderate severity.
- The vulnerability affects `cloudevents/sdk-go` versions up to and including `v2.15.1`, and is patched in `v2.15.2`.
- The provided information indicates that the vulnerability was found and patched by @tcnghia and @mattmoor.
