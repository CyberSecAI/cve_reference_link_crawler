## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Formidable Registration < 2.12 - Contributor+ Arbitrary User Password Reset To Account Takeover

### Description

The plugin does not prevent users with at least the contributor role from rendering sensitive shortcodes, allowing them to generate, and leak, valid password reset URLs, which they can use to take over any accounts.

### Proof of Concept

1. ADMIN: Install Formidable Pro plugin
2. ADMIN: Install Formidable Registration plugin
3. CONTRIBUTOR: Add shortcode to any post and specify user ID and save
4. CONTRIBUTOR: Preview post and see link to reset password (at this point this can be handled by any user/non-user)
5. CONTRIBUTOR: Change the password for user through that form and hit submit
6. CONTRIBUTOR: Logout and then log into the other user with the new password
Example shortcode: `[frm-set-password-link user\_id="ANY\_USER\_ID"]`
