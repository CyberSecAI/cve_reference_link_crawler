- The contributor can use the generated link to reset any users password

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have at least the Contributor role on the affected WordPress site.
- The attacker must be able to add/edit posts or pages.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable shortcode is `[frm-set-password-link user\_id="ANY\_USER\_ID"]`.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.12 of the Formidable Registration plugin.
