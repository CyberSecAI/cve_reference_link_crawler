- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure expression evaluation in the desktop (standalone) Report Designer allows for object injection. This vulnerability stems from the use of externally-controlled input to select classes or code, also known as "Unsafe Reflection."
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-470 - Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection'). Insecure expression evaluation enables object injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A code execution attack is possible via object injection, leading to potential arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is present within the Telerik Reporting's desktop (standalone) Report Designer. An attacker can exploit insecure expression evaluation to inject malicious objects.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to manipulate the expressions used within the desktop Report Designer.
