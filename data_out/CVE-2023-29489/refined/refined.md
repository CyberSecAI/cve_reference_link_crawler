The provided content is related to CVE-2023-29489.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the `message_html` variable within the `Cpanel::Server::Handlers::Httpd::ErrorPage` module. This variable is used to display error messages, and the lack of sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- Improper input sanitization in `Cpanel::Server::Handlers::Httpd::ErrorPage`.
- The `message_html` variable, used to render error messages, is not sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution within the context of the vulnerable website.
- Ability to hijack legitimate user sessions on cPanel, including administrative sessions.
- Potential to upload web shells and gain command execution on the server after session hijacking.
- Can impact both cPanel management ports and applications running on ports 80 and 443 due to reverse proxy configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP request to any path starting with `/cpanelwebcall/`.
- The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the target server.
- No prior authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the target.
