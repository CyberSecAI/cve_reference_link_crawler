- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The rate limiting mechanism in the 'forgot password' feature of Zammad could be manipulated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Insufficient rate limiting in the forgot password functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could send numerous password reset requests for a known account, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) due to the server generating and sending a high volume of emails, which would also spam the victim.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack is conducted by sending multiple requests to the "forgot password" feature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know an existing account in the Zammad system.
