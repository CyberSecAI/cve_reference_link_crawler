Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6805:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `fetch_feed` functionality within the RSS Aggregator by Feedzy plugin. This functionality allows the plugin to retrieve RSS feeds from provided URLs. However, it lacks proper sanitization and validation, allowing an attacker to provide a malicious URL to be fetched.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The plugin makes web requests to arbitrary locations based on user-supplied URLs. It's "blind" because the attacker doesn't directly see the response, but the requests are still made by the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Internal Service Modification:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to make requests to internal services that are not publicly accessible. If internal services are vulnerable, this could lead to data breaches, modification of internal systems, or other unauthorized actions.
- **Information Gathering:** The attacker can use the vulnerability to scan the internal network or enumerate running services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An authenticated user with "contributor" access or higher can supply a malicious URL through the plugin's settings, leading the server to make requests to an attacker-controlled endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account on the target WordPress site with at least "contributor" privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the RSS feed URLs used by the plugin.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.4.8.
- The same vulnerability was fixed for author-level users in version 4.4.8.
- The plugin versions <= 4.4.7 are vulnerable.
