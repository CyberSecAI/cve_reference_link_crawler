# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine in OctoPrint

Moderate

[foosel](/foosel)
published
GHSA-fwfg-vprh-97ph
Oct 9, 2023

## Package

pip

OctoPrint
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<1.9.3

## Patched versions

>=1.9.3

## Description

### Impact

OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.9.2 contain a vulnerability that allows malicious admins to configure a specially crafted [GCODE script](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/features/gcode_scripts.html) through the Settings that will allow code execution during rendering of that script.

An attacker might use this to extract data managed by OctoPrint, or manipulate data managed by OctoPrint, as well as execute arbitrary commands with the rights of the OctoPrint process on the server system.

Please note that GCODE files uploaded to be printed are *not* affected! This vulnerability exclusively affects GCODE Scripts to be executed on connection to the printer, print pause, resume etc, as described [in the documentation](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/features/gcode_scripts.html), to be found under Settings > GCODE Scripts and configurable only by users with the `ADMIN` permission.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.9.3.

### Workarounds

OctoPrint administrators are strongly advised to thoroughly vet who has admin access to their installation and to not blindly configure arbitrary GCODE scripts found online or provided to them by third parties.

### Credits

This vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed to OctoPrint by tianxin Wu (Bearcat), Vulnerability Researcher at Numen Cyber Labs, Singapore.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## ✋ Heads-ups

**The heads-ups from 1.9.0 still apply**, please read this release's [release notes](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.9.0) as well for a full picture of what you should be aware of and what changed!

## ⛈ Issues while updating?

On every new OctoPrint release we see some people run into the same issues with outdated or broken environments all over again. If you encounter a problem during update, please check [this collection of the most common issues](https://community.octoprint.org/t/my-octoprint-update-fails/37880) encountered over the past couple of release cycles first, and test if the included fixes solve your problem.

## ♻ Changes

### 🔒 Security fixes

* Severity Medium (6.4): It was possible for a malicious admin to configure a specially crafted [GCODE script](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/features/gcode_scripts.html) through the Settings that would allow code execution during rendering of that script. An attacker could have used this to extract data managed by OctoPrint, or manipulate data managed by OctoPrint, as well as execute arbitrary commands with the rights of the OctoPrint process on the server system.

  Please note that GCODE files uploaded to be printed were not affected! This vulnerability exclusively affected GCODE Scripts to be executed on connection to the printer, print pause, resume etc, as described [in the documentation](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/features/gcode_scripts.html), to be found under Settings > GCODE Scripts and configurable only by users with the `ADMIN` permission.

  See also the [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/security/advisories/GHSA-fwfg-vprh-97ph) and [CVE-2023-41047](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41047).

### 🐛 Bug fixes

* [#4849](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/4849) & [PR#4860](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/4860): Fix for not being able to extrude/retract from the control panel in the UI after editing the extrusion speed in the printer profile.
* [#4893](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/4893): Pin pydantic dependency to 1.10.12. This works around an issue existing in some environments with pydantic version 1.10.13, which was released on September 26 2023. Said issue causes OctoPrint to no longer be able to start. See also [pydantic/pydantic#7689](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/7689).

## 🎉 Special thanks to all the contributors!

Special thanks to everyone who contributed to this bugfix release, especially to [@srLinux](https://github.com/srLinux) for their PR!

Also a big thank you to tianxin Wu (Bearcat), Vulnerability Researcher at Numen Cyber Labs, Singapore, for responsibly disclosing the security vulnerability that was fixed in this release.
