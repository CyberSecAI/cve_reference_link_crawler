The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21948.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer overflow in the `GfFile::readDatHeadVec` function within the AnyCubic Chitubox plugin. This overflow is caused by using 32-bit registers for multiplication instead of 64-bit registers, leading to truncation of the result and an incorrect size calculation for the buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow due to an integer overflow during buffer size calculation. The calculated size is too small, leading to memory corruption when data is read into the buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow by providing a specially crafted GF file, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other forms of compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by an attacker providing a malicious GF file to the Chitubox software using the affected plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted GF file to the application. This could involve getting the user to open the file in Chitubox.
