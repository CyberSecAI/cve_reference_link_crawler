Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-2844:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content confirms that CVE-2018-2844 is a vulnerability in Oracle VM VirtualBox, specifically affecting Linux hosts as described by voidsecurity.in.  The Gentoo security advisory also lists CVE-2018-2844 as a vulnerability in VirtualBox. The Oracle advisory also mentions CVE-2018-2844 and links it to Oracle VM VirtualBox. All sources indicate that this CVE is related to VirtualBox.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Double Fetch/TOCTOU Vulnerability:** The root cause is a Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability arising from a double fetch in the `vboxVDMACmdExec()` function within VirtualBox's Video Acceleration (VBVA) feature on Linux hosts.
*   **Compiler Optimization:** The compiler optimizes the switch case statement into a jump table. Due to the lack of `volatile` keyword for the shared memory variable `pCmd->enmType`, the compiler optimizes it to read from memory twice, without considering if it changed.
*   **Shared Memory:** The vulnerability is located in code that handles Video DMA (VDMA) commands passed from the guest to the host through a shared memory region (VRAM buffer).
*  **Lack of ASLR in certain cases:** According to voidsecurity.in, "There is no randomization between shared libs/mmap'ed pages etc or load order randomization." which makes exploitation more reliable.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:** A race condition exists where the guest can modify the command type in the shared memory between the first check and the actual use of the value.
*  **Non-Volatile Memory Access:** The compiler's optimization of the `switch` statement, combined with the lack of `volatile`, leads to reading the command type twice. This opens a window for a race condition.
*   **Insecure Handling of Guest Controlled Data:** The host relies on data in shared memory provided by the guest without sufficient checks, which allows the guest to manipulate the control flow of the host process.
*   **RWX Memory Region:** The VRAM buffer is mapped with Read, Write and Execute permissions, which allows an attacker to write and execute arbitrary code in this region.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can gain arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the VirtualBox process.
*   **VM Escape:** The vulnerability can lead to a VM escape, meaning the guest operating system can break out of the virtualized environment and execute code on the host system.
*  **Denial of Service:** In addition to arbitrary code execution, the Gentoo advisory also mentions the possibility of a denial of service.
*   **Other unspecified impacts:**  The Gentoo advisory notes "other unspecified impacts".

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Guest-to-Host:** The attack vector is from the guest operating system to the host operating system.
*  **Shared Memory Interface (HGSMI):** Attackers exploit the Host-Guest Shared Memory Interface (HGSMI) to send malicious VDMA commands from the guest to the host.
*   **Video DMA Commands:** The vulnerability is triggered via specially crafted Video DMA commands.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Guest Access:** The attacker needs to have control over a guest operating system running within VirtualBox.
*   **Timing Control:** Requires some timing control from within the guest to manipulate data in shared memory during the race condition.
*  **Multiple vCPUs:**  The exploit is more reliable on guests with multiple virtual CPUs because it increases the probability of winning the race condition.

**Additional Information from the blog post:**

*   The vulnerability only affects Linux hosts due to compiler optimizations that were not present in Windows or OSX.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable even though the race window is very small.
*   The exploit detailed involves:
    *   Filling VRAM with NOP instructions.
    *   Placing shellcode at the end of the VRAM region.
    *   Using a carefully crafted value found in the VBoxDD.so library to calculate a relative jump address into the VRAM region to execute the shellcode.
*  The blog post also notes that this is a TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) bug, a type of vulnerability where a system checks a condition, and then uses it, but the condition may have changed in between.

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-2844 is a critical vulnerability in VirtualBox on Linux hosts that allows an attacker with control over a guest to execute arbitrary code on the host. It's caused by a double fetch/TOCTOU bug due to compiler optimizations and insufficient validation of data passed via shared memory. This could lead to a full compromise of the host system.
