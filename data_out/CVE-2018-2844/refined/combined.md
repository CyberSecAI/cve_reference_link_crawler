# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2018

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2018

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 255 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2018 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2383583.1).

The January 2018 Critical Patch Update provided patches in response to the Spectre (CVE-2017-5753, CVE-2017-5715) and Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754) processor vulnerabilities. Please refer to this Advisory and the Addendum to the January 2018 Critical Patch Update Advisory for Spectre and Meltdown MOS note ([Doc ID 2347948.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2347948.1)) for information on how to obtain these patches.

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com](//www.java.com/en/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2018verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 12 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  11 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2018verbose.html#EBS).

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (April 2018), [My Oracle Support Note 2369524.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2369524.1).

### Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 10 new security fixes for the Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite.  8 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these fixes are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have the Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2018verbose.html#EM).

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2018 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2353306.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2353306.1).

### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 40 new security fixes for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  31 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2018verbose.html#FMW).

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2018 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2353306.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2353306.1).

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 14 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE.  12 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2018verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

### From Compiler Optimization to Code Execution - VirtualBox VM Escape - CVE-2018-2844

Oracle fixed some of the issues I reported in VirtualBox during the Oracle Critical Patch Update - April 2018. CVE-2018-2844 was an interesting double fetch vulnerability in VirtualBox Video Acceleration (VBVA) feature affecting Linux hosts. VBVA feature works on top of VirtualBox Host-Guest Shared Memory Interface (HGSMI), a shared memory implemented using Video RAM buffer.
The VRAM buffer is at physical address 0xE0000000

```
sudo lspci -vvv

00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: InnoTek Systemberatung GmbH VirtualBox Graphics Adapter (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
 ...
 Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 10
 Region 0: Memory at e0000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=16M]
 Expansion ROM at  [disabled]
 Kernel modules: vboxvideo

```
The guest sets up command buffer using HGSMI as below and writes the offset in VRAM to IO port VGA\_PORT\_HGSMI\_GUEST (0x3d0) to notify the host.

```
 HGSMIBUFFERHEADER header;
 uint8_t data[header.u32BufferSize];
 HGSMIBUFFERTAIL tail;

```
The bug specifically occurs in code handling Video DMA (VDMA) commands passed from Guest to Host. The VDMA command handling function vboxVDMACmdExec() dispatches to specific functions based on VDMA command types. This is implemented as switch case statements.

```
static int
vboxVDMACmdExec(PVBOXVDMAHOST pVdma, const uint8_t *pvBuffer, uint32_t cbBuffer)
{
 /* pvBuffer is shared memory in VRAM */
        PVBOXVDMACMD pCmd = (PVBOXVDMACMD)pvBuffer;

        switch (pCmd->enmType) {
                case VBOXVDMACMD_TYPE_CHROMIUM_CMD: {
                        ...
                }
                case VBOXVDMACMD_TYPE_DMA_PRESENT_BLT: {
                        ...
                }
                case VBOXVDMACMD_TYPE_DMA_BPB_TRANSFER: {
                        ...
                }
                case VBOXVDMACMD_TYPE_DMA_NOP: {
                        ...
                }
                case VBOXVDMACMD_TYPE_CHILD_STATUS_IRQ: {
                        ...
                }
                default: {
                         ...
                }
        }
}

```
The compiler optimizes the switch cases to jump tables. This is what it looks like after optimization:

```
; first fetch happens for cmp
.text:00000000000B957A                 cmp     dword ptr [r12], 0Ah ; switch 11 cases
.text:00000000000B957F                 ja      VBOXVDMACMD_TYPE_DEFAULT ; jumptable 00000000000B9597 default case

; second fetch again for pCmd->enmType from shared memory
.text:00000000000B9585                 mov     eax, [r12]
.text:00000000000B9589                 lea     rbx, vboxVDMACmdExec_JMPS
.text:00000000000B9590                 movsxd  rax, dword ptr [rbx+rax*4]
.text:00000000000B9594                 add     rax, rbx
.text:00000000000B9597                 jmp     rax             ; switch jump

```
```
.rodata:0000000000185538 vboxVDMACmdExec_JMPS dd offset VBOXVDMACMD_TYPE_DEFAULT - 185538h
.rodata:0000000000185538                                         ; DATA XREF: vboxVDMACommand+1D9o
.rodata:0000000000185538                 dd offset VBOXVDMACMD_TYPE_DMA_PRESENT_BLT - 185538h ; jump table for switch statement
.rodata:0000000000185538                 dd offset VBOXVDMACMD_TYPE_DMA_BPB_TRANSFER - 185538h

.rodata:0000000000185538                 dd offset VBOXVDMACMD_TYPE_DEFAULT - 185538h
.rodata:0000000000185538                 dd offset VBOXVDMACMD_TYPE_DMA_NOP - 185538h
.rodata:0000000000185538                 dd offset VBOXVDMACMD_TYPE_DMA_NOP - 185538h
.rodata:0000000000185538                 dd offset VBOXVDMACMD_TYPE_DEFAULT - 185538h
.rodata:0000000000185538                 dd offset VBOXVDMACMD_TYPE_DMA_NOP - 185538h
.rodata:0000000000185564                 align 20h

```
The issue is quite clear, its a TOCTOU bug. Since the variable is not marked volatile, GCC optimizations resulted in double fetch from shared VRAM memory. I didn't see such optimization in VirtualBox for Windows and OSX. Only Linux hosts are affected.

Note that this kind of issue is not new. We have prior research [Xenpwn - Breaking Paravirtualized Devices](https://www.ernw.de/download/xenpwn.pdf) by Felix Wilhelm on similar issue found in [Xen](https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-155.html)

**Exploitation:**

Though the race window is really small, it can be reliably won on guests having more than one vCPU.

```
 RAX  0xdeadbeef
 RBX  0x7fff8abf2538 ◂— rol    byte ptr [rdx - 0xd], 1
 RCX  0x7fff9c508ac0 —▸ 0x7ffff7e30000 ◂— 0x5

 R13  0xf3b
 R14  0x7fff9c50d0e0 —▸ 0x7fff9c508ac0 —▸ 0x7ffff7e30000 ◂— 0x5
 R15  0x7fff89d20030 ◂— 0xffffffdc0f3b0eeb
 RBP  0x7fffba44dc40 —▸ 0x7fffba44dca0 —▸ 0x7fffba44dce0 —▸ 0x7fffba44dd00 —▸ 0x7fffba44dd50 ◂— ...
 RSP  0x7fffba44db80 —▸ 0x7fffba44dbb0 —▸ 0x7fff9c508ac0 —▸ 0x7ffff7e30000 ◂— 0x5
 RIP  0x7fff8ab26590 ◂— movsxd rax, dword ptr [rbx + rax*4]

 ► 0x7fff8ab26590    movsxd rax, dword ptr [rbx + rax*4]
   0x7fff8ab26594    add    rax, rbx
   0x7fff8ab26597    jmp    rax

```
RAX is controlled by guest. R8, R12 and R15 points to offsets within HGSMI buffer during the crash. The jump table uses relative addressing, hence once cannot directly call into a pointer. First plan was to find a feature, which allows to write a controlled value in VBoxDD.so from guest and further use it as fake jump table. However, I failed to find one.

Next option is to directly jump to the VRAM buffer mapped with RWX permissions using whatever value available for fake jump table.

```
    // VRAM buffer
    0x7fff88d21000     0x7fff89d21000 rwxp  1000000 0

    // VBoxDD.so
    0x7fff8aa6d000     0x7fff8adff000 r-xp   392000 0      /usr/lib/virtualbox/VBoxDD.so
    0x7fff8adff000     0x7fff8afff000 ---p   200000 392000 /usr/lib/virtualbox/VBoxDD.so
    0x7fff8afff000     0x7fff8b010000 r--p    11000 392000 /usr/lib/virtualbox/VBoxDD.so
    0x7fff8b010000     0x7fff8b018000 rw-p     8000 3a3000 /usr/lib/virtualbox/VBoxDD.so

```
Find a value in VBoxDD.so (assume as some fake jump table), which during relative address calculation will point into the 16MB shared VRAM buffer. For the proof-of-concept exploit fill the entire VRAM with NOP's and place the shellcode at the final pages of the mapping. No ASLR bypass is needed since the jump is relative.

In the guest, add vboxvideo to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf. vboxvideo.ko driver has a custom allocator to manage VRAM memory and HGSMI guest side implementations. Blacklisting vboxvideo reduces activity on VRAM and keeps the payload intact. The exploit was tested with Ubuntu Server 16.04.3 64-bit as guest and Ubuntu Desktop 16.04.4 64-bit as host running [VirtualBox 5.2.6.r120293](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.2.6/virtualbox-5.2_5.2.6-120293~Ubuntu~xenial_amd64.deb).

The proof-of-concept exploit code with process continuation and connect back over network can be found at [virtualbox-cve-2018-2844](https://github.com/renorobert/virtualbox-cve-2018-2844)

   I have a question. What is about relative offset between VRAM and VBoxDD.so because of ASLR affects them or not?

     Valentin,

     The relative offset between VRAM and VBoxDD.so remains the same in the Ubuntu host I tested. There is no randomization between shared libs/mmap'ed pages etc or load order randomization.

   Do the vbox newer version still have VRAM remaining rwx? Or Oracle fixed it?
