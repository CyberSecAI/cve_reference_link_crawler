{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by incorrect calculation of memcpy length when writing data to the TX FIFO of the NXP FlexSPI controller. When writing data that is not 4-byte aligned, the memcpy function reads beyond the allocated buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Incorrect memory access"
    ],
    "impact": "The out-of-bounds read can lead to a Kernel crash (KASAN report) and potentially other undefined behaviors.",
    "attack_vectors": "Writing data to the NOR chip via the /dev/mtd0 interface using the 'dd' command with a size that is not a multiple of 4 bytes.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to write to the /dev/mtd0 device."
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "affected_code": "The issue is in the nxp_fspi_fill_txfifo function within the drivers/spi/spi-nxp-fspi.c file.",
    "reproduction": "The issue can be reproduced by writing 3 bytes of data to the NOR chip using the command `dd if=3b of=/dev/mtd0`."
  }
