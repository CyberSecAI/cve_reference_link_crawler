- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authorization in Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE) API key creation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An API key created with specific privileges could be used to create new API keys with elevated privileges, bypassing intended access controls.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with a limited-privilege API key could escalate their privileges by creating new API keys with higher privileges, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable via the ECE RESTful API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires a valid, but limited-privilege, API key to exploit this vulnerability.
