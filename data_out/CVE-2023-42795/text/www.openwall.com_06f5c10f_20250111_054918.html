Subject: CVE-2023-42795: Apache Tomcat: Failure during request clean-up leads
 to sensitive data leaking to subsequent requests

Severity: important

Affected versions:

- Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M11
- Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.13
- Apache Tomcat 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.80
- Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 through 8.5.93

Description:

Incomplete Cleanup vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.When recycling various
internal objects in Apache Tomcat from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M11,
from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.13, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.80 and from
8.5.0 through 8.5.93, an error could cause Tomcat to skip some parts of
the recycling process leading to information leaking from the current
request/response to the next.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M12 onwards, 10.1.14
onwards, 9.0.81 onwards or 8.5.94 onwards, which fixes the issue.
