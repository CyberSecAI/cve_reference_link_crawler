Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1810

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `shortcode_attributes` parameter. Specifically, the plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied data within the `shortcode_attributes` parameter before using it in output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- If a user clicks on a malicious link crafted by the attacker, the injected script will execute within the user's browser.
- This can lead to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, redirecting users to phishing pages, or modifying content on the site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript in the `shortcode_attributes` parameter.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and distribute them to potential victims, often relying on social engineering to encourage a click.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in all versions of the "Archivist â€“ Custom Archive Templates" plugin up to and including 1.7.5.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.7.7 by adding input escaping using `esc_attr()` where previously the plugin was not escaping user-controlled data.
- The Wordfence report indicates that the vulnerable parameter is `shortcode_attributes`, while the provided code changes show escaping being applied to various other parameters.
- The plugin's changelog in the `readme.txt` file explicitly mentions that version 1.7.7 includes a fix for "security issues (XSS)".
