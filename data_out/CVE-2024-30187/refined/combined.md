| **Description**  Suspended a nick. a person was able to reset the password. Was able to change the password, confirm, and forcefully identify Nick who was suspended.  **Steps to reproduce the issue:**   1. set up a test account 2. suspended the test account 3. Change the password for the test account.   **Describe the results you received:**  The password was able to change and forcefully identify to account. The user was able to drop the nick (while still showing suspended) and able to re-register the account, thus removing the suspension completely.  **Describe the results you expected:** The user shouldn't be able to receive an email to change the password while the account is suspended.  **Additional information you deem important (e.g. issue happens only occasionally):** I tried this on two networks that have anope set up. It occurred on both networks.  **Output of `services --version`:** Notice- {from ChanServ} VERSION Anope-2.0.12 services.technet.chat :UnrealIRCd 4+ - (enc\_sha256) -- build [#8](https://github.com/anope/anope/pull/8), compiled 01:33:11 Jul 29 2023 and Notice- {from ChanServ} VERSION Anope-2.0.9 services.freenode.net :InspIRCd 3 - (enc\_sha256) -- build [#19](https://github.com/anope/anope/pull/19), compiled 01:56:18 Apr 20 2022, flags D Notice- {from ChanServ} VERSION Anope-2.0.10 services.irc-nerds.net :UnrealIRCd 4+ - (enc\_sha256) -- build [#14](https://github.com/anope/anope/pull/14), compiled 07:41:07 Oct 28 2021 |

| How are you force identifying the user? There's nothing for this that ships with Anope afaik.  If you're using `os_forceid` then thats a third-party module and you should contact the author. |

| The person is changing their password, and when confirming the new password it force identifies them. [@nickserv](https://github.com/nickserv)> COMMAND: Guest14893!~Lebanese@ip used CONFIRM to confirm RESETPASS and forcefully identify as test11  [10:35:41] <[@nickserv](https://github.com/nickserv)> COMMAND: Betelgeuse!~Betelgeus@\*\*\* used CONFIRM to confirm RESETPASS and forcefully identify as j [10:35:46] <[@nickserv](https://github.com/nickserv)> COMMAND: Betelgeuse!~Betelgeus@\*\*\*\* (j) used SET PASSWORD to change their password  The Nick J is still suspended but the user was able to identify it after it was suspended. We don't have os\_forceid on freenode but it is on the other two networks. It was not being used at the time of this testing. |
