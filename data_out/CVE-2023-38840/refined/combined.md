### **[winkler-winsen](/winkler-winsen)** commented [Jul 7, 2020](#issue-652276490)

| There is an article in German IT-magazine [c't 15/2020](https://www.heise.de/select/ct/2020/15/2015514091680573293) page 28. "Passwortmanager: Sicherheitstest | Dichtheitsprüfung | Passwortmanagern auf Speicher und Netzwerkverkehr geschaut" (translated: Password managers: security test | leak test | password managers on memory and network traffic protected" (behind pay wall)  The authors test common password managers if they keep (master) password in memory before and after login and after logout. It seems they test only the windows versions.  For Bitwarden, they found **multiple copies of master passwords in memory dumps** after login. Before login and after logout, they didn't find master password no more in memory.  [grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43114182/86779970-7aeb8100-c05c-11ea-9ac0-71ce701a0629.png)  Dieser Wunsch blieb unerfüllt: Lediglich vor der Eingabe des Masterpassworts konnten wir bei keinem Produkt die Existenz dieses Generalschlüssels im Speicher nachweisen. Sobald aber das Masterpasswort eingegeben war, konnte man es bei fast allen Programmen im Klartext im Speicher vorfinden. Manche vervielfältigten es sogar im Speicher. Es taucht an bis zu 20 verschiedenen Adressen auf. Dass das auch anders geht, zeigen Keepass und Sticky Password. Bei denen gelang es uns nicht, das Masterpasswort im Speicher zu finden.  Nur einem Teil der Programme gelang es, beim Verriegeln auch das Masterpasswort wieder aus dem Speicher zu entfernen: 1Password, Bitwarden, Keepass, Keeper und Sticky Password. Bei den anderen blieb es weiter zugänglich. Trauriger Rekordhalter war Blur: Es verdoppelte die Anzahl der Fundstellen des Masterpassworts von der Anmeldung mit rund 20 auf fast 40 nach der Abmeldung. Ebenso vervielfachten sich bei Avira die Fundstellen auf immerhin zwölf.

ToDo:   * Please check if it is possible to erase master password after login (windows versions) * Please check the same issue on desktop for other platforms (OS X/macOS, Linux) * Please check browser extentions, if they leak master password   If you need a translated version, I can try to translate article for you. Pls message me. |

| Hi. Bitwarden uses Electron for our desktop application which does not allow for us to manage address spaces of the UI (renderer) thread where your master password is entered. This is similar to how a webpage works. As I believe your article points out (I do not speak German), we do clean up memory promptly whenever a user logs out or locks the application. We do this by reloading the renderer process (similar to refreshing a webpage). |

| Ok, that was easy! 1.) Just export the current memory from the Bitwaren process in a dump file: [RAM_Export](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1895086/86959650-80c98b00-c15e-11ea-8f6b-b3c7cdabc207.PNG)  2.) Check the dump file with a hex editor of your choice and search for your clear text master password -> **et voilà** [HxD-screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1895086/86959652-81fab800-c15e-11ea-8b62-d23dc86b29fd.PNG)   * You don´t need any Administrator permissions for that attack * A malware could do the same and extract all the readable text out of memory for the bitwarden process. Since bitwarden is an online service, the attacker can directly try out the discovered clear text passages as password * I´m sure most of the users keep bitwaren open (unlocked) so there is a wide attack vector * 2FA could help but does not solve the main problem   I have to say that i don´t feel that secure anymore with that conclusion |

| Taking notes and linking this thread from nodejs: [nodejs/node#30956](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/30956). Perhaps certain values should be stored in the user's keystore directly vs. in memory in electron; although once a string is allocated not sure you can prevent that. Just thinking out loud on this one. |

| Maybe i am naive but wouldn't it make sense to directly hash the masterpassword after typing it into the form? That way it would not be stored as plain text in memory from the beginning. Currently it gets passed in plain text through some methods in [auth.service.ts](https://github.com/bitwarden/jslib/blob/57ace4084556758fdc2989cf1a8cf6a5d1736a29/src/services/auth.service.ts#L118) before it actually gets hashed. |

| Just an idea: What about to redirect to another freshly loaded page after successful authentication showing the unlocked vault? Maybe some kind of session cookie holding a token could be used (I am not an expert in this, just thinking out load). That way the references to the old form fields *could* be garbage collected... |

## Type of change

```
- [x] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature development
- [ ] Tech debt (refactoring, code cleanup, dependency upgrades, etc)
- [ ] Build/deploy pipeline (DevOps)
- [ ] Other

```
## Objective

Change the reload mechanism on desktop to use [`forcefullyCrashRenderer`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/web-contents#contentsforcefullycrashrenderer) instead of `win.reload`. Chromium has a bad habit of persisting sensitive form values in memory longer than we would like with no clear way to eliminate them. So far the best approach seems to be to forcefully crash the renderer process which causes electron to create a new chromium process for the renderer the next time we reload the application.

To make the process reload less noticeable the window flashing is removed by setting the css background to `transparent`, and instead setting the theme on the electron window, ensuring the background always is the correct color when reloading the process.

Resolves [#3166](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/issues/3166)

## Before you submit

* Please add **unit tests** where it makes sense to do so (encouraged but not required)
* If this change requires a **documentation update** - notify the documentation team
* If this change has particular **deployment requirements** - notify the DevOps team
* Ensure that all UI additions follow [WCAG AA requirements](https://contributing.bitwarden.com/contributing/accessibility/)

| [@00xc](https://github.com/00xc) I submitted a request for a CVE about a month ago, but still haven't heard anything back from `CVE-Request@mitre.org` team, not sure what happened. I also wrote a little proof of concept <https://github.com/markuta/bw-dump> which abuses this vulnerability, it works on versions Bitwarden Desktop `2023.7.0` and below. |

# BW-Dump

**Updated 2**: This vulnerability was assigned `CVE-2023-38840`.

**Updated**: A patch was released on GitHub pull request ([5813](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/pull/5813)) which fixes the vulnerability. The affected versions are Bitwarden Desktop `2023.7.0` and below.

## Description

A proof-of-concept tool that extracts the master password from a locked Bitwarden vault (must be unlocked at least once) from Windows systems. It only works for the current session, meaning it will not work after a system reboot. Administrative privileges are NOT required.

A blog was published and is available at: <https://redmaple.tech/blogs/2023/extract-bitwarden-vault-passwords/>

### Demo

A short demo of using bw-dump with Microsoft Edge and the Bitwarden browser extension. The latest tool only works on the Bitwarden Desktop.

## Building

> **Warning**: Windows Defender will report the compiled binary as malicious!

To build a stripped binary, type:

```
go build -ldflags="-s -w"

```

To build on a Linux system, type:

```
env GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags="-s -w"
```

## Running

Simply build and execute the binary. It does NOT require admin rights. Make sure the Bitwarden process is running. In addition, the vault needs to be unlocked at least once. After which, the master password will be stored in memory for a period of time.

You can also pass the `-d` option to dump memory regions when a pattern is found. For each result, a filename `dump-pid-<PID>-<MEM-REGION>.hex` is created in the current working directory.

BW-Dump is a Windows forensics tool that extracts Bitwarden master passwords from locked vaults
(must be unlocked at least once) by reading process memory using Windows API functions which
searches for magic byte patterns. The tool doesn't require any special (admin) permissions.

Now supports Bitwarden Desktop App (v2023.1.1) running on Windows 10 or 11. The tool (may)
still support older Bitwarden Chromium extension versions (v2022.6.0) and below.

## Is there a solution or workaround?

There are two ways (probably more) the master password can be trashed from memory:

1. Once locked, enter any random WRONG password. This should replace your password stored in memory.
2. Terminate the `Bitwarden.exe` process which Windows should do some garbage collection.

## What's next?

* Create a Volaility3 plugin that can extract master passwords from saved memory dumps.

## About

A proof-of-concept for (CVE-2023-38840) that extracts plaintext master passwords from a locked Bitwarden vault.
