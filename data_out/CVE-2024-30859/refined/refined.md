Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw in the `/admin/config_ISCGroupSSLCert.php` endpoint of the Netcom NS-ASG application security gateway.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `GroupId` parameter, which is then used in a SQL query, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Server Harm:** The content states that attackers can exploit the vulnerability to cause harm to servers, potentially leading to data breaches, server compromise, or denial of service.
- **Data Extraction:** Specifically, the provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates the ability to extract sensitive information, in this case, the admin username and database name, by using `extractvalue` and `concat` functions to craft a malicious SQL query.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Malicious SQL Injection:** The `GroupId` parameter within the URL is manipulated to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Direct Access:** Attackers would need to directly access the vulnerable page `/admin/config_ISCGroupSSLCert.php` to exploit this flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Netcom NS-ASG instance.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:**  The attacker needs knowledge of the specific vulnerable path, `/admin/config_ISCGroupSSLCert.php`.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Ability to craft HTTP GET requests and manipulate URL parameters.
- **SQL Injection knowledge:** Knowledge of SQL injection techniques, such as the use of `extractvalue` and `concat` functions.
