Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-25155:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is related to a "Reverse Tabnabbing" issue in the demo code of DOMPurify. Specifically, when links with `target="_blank"` are opened, the newly opened tab can potentially control the opener window/tab via the `window.opener` property.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The demo code for DOMPurify was vulnerable to Reverse Tabnabbing. When a link with `target="_blank"` was opened, the new page could access and potentially manipulate the original page via the `window.opener` property. This could be used to redirect the user to a malicious page.
- The demo code was missing the `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute on links with `target="_blank"`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could use this vulnerability to redirect a user from a legitimate page to a malicious one, even after they had clicked on a seemingly safe link.
- An attacker could potentially steal user information or perform other malicious actions through the ability to control the original page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the demo HTML code which contains a link with `target="_blank"`. An attacker could get a victim to click on such a link within the demo page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a page that can be loaded via a link with `target="_blank"` within a vulnerable DOMPurify demo context.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves adding `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to links with `target="_blank"`. This prevents the new tab from being able to access the original tab through `window.opener`, thus mitigating the Reverse Tabnabbing vulnerability.
- The pull request #337 shows the exact code change that fixes this issue, adding the attribute  `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to links with the target="_blank" attribute.
