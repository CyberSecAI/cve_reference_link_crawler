Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1724:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient AppArmor rules for the `home` interface in the snapd package manager. Specifically, the existing rules only disallowed direct writes to the `$HOME/bin` directory but didn't prevent the creation of a symbolic link named `bin` pointing to a directory controlled by the snap. This allowed a malicious snap to bypass the intended restriction and inject executables into the user's PATH.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient AppArmor rules:** The primary weakness was the incomplete AppArmor rule set, which failed to account for symbolic link creation. The initial rule only blocked direct writes and access to `$HOME/bin` but overlooked symlink creation to bypass that rule.
*   **Automatic granting of `home` permission:**  The default policy of automatically granting the `home` permission to snaps requesting it, without explicit user approval, increased the potential for exploitation.
*   **Reliance on user's PATH:** The vulnerability leverages the standard shell behavior of adding `$HOME/bin` to the beginning of the user's PATH which allows for the malicious injection of executables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** By creating a symbolic link named `$HOME/bin` that points to a directory controlled by the snap, the attacker can inject and execute arbitrary code outside the snap sandbox, with the privileges of the user.
*   **Privilege escalation:** Although the code is executed with user privileges, it allows a snap to break out of its sandbox and perform actions outside its intended scope.
*   **Data compromise:** Once outside the sandbox, the attacker can read, modify, or delete user data.
*   **System compromise:** The vulnerability could be used to install malware, backdoors, or further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Snap Package:** The attacker crafts a malicious snap package that exploits the insufficient AppArmor rules.
*  **Symbolic Link Creation:** The attacker creates a symbolic link called `$HOME/bin` which points to a directory they control.
*   **Executable Injection:** The attacker places malicious executables in that controlled directory.
*   **User Action:**  The user logs out and back in, updating their `$PATH` which now contains the symlinked `bin` directory. Then, by running a command that matches the injected executable the malicious code is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create a snap package:** The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious snap package.
*   **`home` permission:** The snap package must request and be granted the `home` permission. This was automatically granted in the default configuration.
*   **User interaction:** The user must log out and back in for the `$PATH` to be updated and the injected executable to be accessible.
*   **Basic understanding of Linux file system:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of symbolic links and the usage of the `$PATH` variable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by adding a new AppArmor rule that blocks symbolic links creation named `bin` within the user's home directory.
*   The blog post mentions that other directories in the user's `$HOME` might be exploitable as well, highlighting that snaps have unrestricted access to "normal" files, which poses a risk.
* The fix was implemented in commit `aa191f9` and merged into the master branch of the snapd repository.
*   The author of the exploit has a proof-of-concept available.
