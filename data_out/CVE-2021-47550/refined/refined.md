The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47550.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory leak occurs in the `amdgpu_get_xgmi_hive` function within the AMDGPU driver.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Failure to release allocated memory (`hive`) when `kobject_init_and_add` fails, leading to a memory leak. The kobject and the associated memory is not freed by calling `kobject_put` and `kfree`, respectively.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Repeated failures of `kobject_init_and_add` will lead to memory exhaustion as allocated memory is not properly freed.

**Attack vectors:**
- This vulnerability is triggered by a failed `kobject_init_and_add` call within the `amdgpu_get_xgmi_hive` function. An attacker could potentially trigger this failure by providing inputs that lead to a failed initialization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to trigger the execution of the vulnerable code path in the AMDGPU driver and cause the `kobject_init_and_add` function to fail repeatedly. This would typically require some level of access to the system to interact with the graphics driver, and the ability to cause XGMI initialization to fail.
