Based on the provided information, all the commits relate to the same vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing devlink lock in the `mlx5_fw_reset_complete_reload` function within the Mellanox mlx5 driver. Specifically, during a synchronous reset reload, when a remote host updates devlink with reload actions, the code calls `devlink_remote_reload_actions_performed()` without first acquiring the necessary devlink lock.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Lock:** The primary weakness is the absence of a lock before calling `devlink_remote_reload_actions_performed()`. This leads to a race condition when multiple threads are modifying the devlink state.
- **Lock Assert Triggered**: The missing lock triggers an assertion failure (`devl_assert_locked`) in the `net/devlink/core.c` file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Kernel Panic/Assert**: The immediate impact is a kernel warning and assertion failure, potentially leading to a system crash or denial of service. The log output shows the system stops with `devl_assert_locked+0x3e/0x50`.
- **System Instability**: The race condition can cause unpredictable behavior and instability in the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Synchronous Firmware Reset Reload:** The vulnerability is triggered during a synchronous reset reload operation of the Mellanox mlx5 network device.
- **Remote Host Interaction:** The vulnerability occurs when a remote host initiates updates to devlink during a reload action.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to Trigger Synchronous Reset Reload**: The attacker must be able to trigger a synchronous firmware reset reload of an affected mlx5 device.
- **Remote Access or Control**: The attacker needs to be in a position to interact with the affected device via a remote host and initiate devlink updates during the reload. This implies some level of control over the network environment and the interacting remote host.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided commit logs include a call trace showing the exact location where the assertion is triggered.
- The fix involves acquiring the devlink lock before calling `devlink_remote_reload_actions_performed()` and releasing it afterwards to prevent the race condition.
- The fix also sets the `DEVLINK_RELOAD_ACTION_DRIVER_REINIT` and `DEVLINK_RELOAD_ACTION_FW_ACTIVATE` flags when calling the function.
- The commits consistently mention the same "Fixes" tag pointing to commit `84a433a40d0e`, indicating a previous attempt to address similar issues.
