- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the FortiOS Web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated access to a JavaScript file (`fweb_all.js`) containing platform information.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can gain platform information, such as the FortiOS version, which may be used in further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by accessing the vulnerable JavaScript file via the web interface without authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make network requests to the web interface of the affected FortiOS device.
