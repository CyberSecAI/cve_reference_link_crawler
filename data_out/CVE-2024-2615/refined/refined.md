Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2615:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by memory safety bugs present in Firefox 123. Specifically, it is caused by three bugs: a crash in `webrtc::videocapturemodule::DeviceInfoPipeWire::CreateCapabilityMap`, a poison crash in `mozilla::widget::DirectManipulationOwner::Destroy` from `AutoWidgetPickerState::PickerState`, and a heap-use-after-free in `mozilla::dom::Document::TitleChangeEvent::Run`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The vulnerabilities are memory safety bugs. Specifically, it involves a crash and a heap-use-after-free.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact is rated as "critical". The description mentions that some bugs showed evidence of memory corruption, and it is presumed that with enough effort, these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This means successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to take full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The specific attack vectors are not detailed, but the vulnerabilities are within the Firefox browser. An attacker would likely need to craft a malicious web page or otherwise find a way to trigger the vulnerable code paths within Firefox, possibly through JavaScript or other web technologies. The specific attack vector would depend on the detailed nature of each memory corruption bug.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to be able to cause the vulnerable code paths to execute within the context of a Firefox instance. This may involve:
*   Luring a victim to a malicious website.
*   Finding a way to trigger the vulnerability through crafted content or browser interactions.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The specific bugs are identified by their Bugzilla IDs: 1882438, 1881650, and 1881074.
*   The vulnerabilities were fixed in Firefox 124.
*   The severity is rated as "critical", suggesting a high level of risk.
*  The affected components are "WebRTC", "Widget: Win32" and "DOM: Events"
