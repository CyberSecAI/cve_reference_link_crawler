The FileOrganizer â€“ Manage WordPress and Website Files plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.7 via the 'fileorganizer_ajax_handler' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data including backups or other sensitive information if the files have been moved to the built-in Trash folder.
