## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# NinjaTeam Header Footer Custom Code <= 1.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS via CSS Styles

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to the plugin settings
2. In the CSS field, enter the payload: `h2 { color: red !important; }</style><script>alert(4)</script>`
3. Save and view the site to see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
