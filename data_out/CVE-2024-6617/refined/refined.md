- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, specifically the CSS field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious code into the CSS field within the plugin's settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have admin-level privileges to access the plugin settings.
