The provided content relates to CVE-2024-6390.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape some of its Quiz settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the Quiz settings that will be executed when a user views the quiz, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
A high-privilege user, such as a contributor, can create or edit a quiz and insert a malicious payload in the "Retake Quiz Button" label setting. When any user views the quiz on a page/post where it is embedded or while previewing it, the XSS will be triggered by hovering the mouse over the "Retake" button.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access in WordPress to edit Quiz settings.
