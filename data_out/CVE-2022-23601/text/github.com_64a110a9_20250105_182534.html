# CSRF token missing in forms

High

[fabpot](/fabpot)
published
GHSA-vvmr-8829-6whx
Jan 29, 2022

## Package

composer

symfony/framework-bundle
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

=5.3.14,=5.4.3,=6.0.3

## Patched versions

5.3.15,5.4.4,6.0.4

## Description

## Description

The Symfony form component provides a CSRF protection mechanism by using a random token injected in the form and using the session to store and control the token submitted by the user.

When using the FrameworkBundle, this protection can be enabled or disabled with the configuration. If the configuration is not specified, by default, the mechanism is enabled as long as the session is enabled.

In a recent change in the way the configuration is loaded, the default behavior has been dropped and, as a result, the CSRF protection is not enabled in form when not explicitly enabled, which makes the application sensible to CSRF attacks.

## Resolution

Symfony restored the default configuration to enable the CSRF protection by default.

The patch for this issue is available [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/f0ffb775febdf07e57117aabadac96fa37857f50) for branch 5.3.
