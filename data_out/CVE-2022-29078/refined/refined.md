Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29078:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates) library handles options during template rendering. Specifically, when rendering a template using `renderFile` function in an Express.js application, the `view options` within the `data.settings` object are shallow copied into the template options without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the template's compilation process by manipulating the `outputFunctionName` option.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The core vulnerability is that user-controlled data can influence the template rendering process by injecting code within the `outputFunctionName`.
*   **Insecure Option Handling:** The library copies options from `data.settings['view options']` without validating or sanitizing them. This allows arbitrary options to be set that directly affect template compilation, especially `outputFunctionName`.
*   **Code Injection:** The `outputFunctionName` option is directly used in the generated Javascript code, leading to the execution of injected code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `outputFunctionName`, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.
*   **Information Disclosure, Data Modification, Denial of Service:** NetApp's advisory states successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameter Injection:** The exploit is triggered by manipulating query parameters (in the provided example using an Express.js application) to set the `settings[view options][outputFunctionName]` option.
*   **Direct Manipulation of Options:** In environments where user-controlled data is used as template options, the vulnerability can be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests with malicious parameters to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of the application using EJS**: The attacker needs to identify where the application is using EJS and that user-controlled data is used to populate template options.
*   **No authentication or special permissions required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content describes how the vulnerable code is located within the `render` and `renderFile` functions of the EJS library.
*   The attacker leverages the `outputFunctionName` option which directly includes the attacker provided code into the template's compiled JavaScript code.
*   The provided content also includes a proof-of-concept exploit that demonstrates how an attacker can gain a reverse shell using the vulnerability
*   The vulnerability was fixed in EJS version 3.1.7 by preventing the injection of code in the options, especially in `opts.outputFunctionName`.
*   The NetApp advisory states that they are aware of the public discussion of this vulnerability. It also indicates that none of the NetApp products are affected
