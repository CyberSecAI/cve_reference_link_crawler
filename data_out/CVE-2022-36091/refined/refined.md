Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks within the `suggest.vm` template file in XWiki. This allows unauthorized access to string and list properties of objects, including those containing sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the absence of adequate access control mechanisms when using the `suggest.vm` template. This allows users, even unauthenticated ones, to potentially access data they shouldn't have access to.
*   **Information Exposure:** The vulnerability exposes private personal information, such as email addresses and salted password hashes of registered users. It can also expose sensitive configuration data, like passwords for LDAP or SMTP servers, stored as properties of objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive user data and configuration details, potentially leading to identity theft, unauthorized access to systems, and other malicious activities.
*   **Private Wiki Exposure:** The vulnerability can be exploited even on private wikis, especially for string properties, due to an additional vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
*   **Direct Access to `suggest.vm`:** The vulnerability can be exploited by directly accessing the `suggest.vm` template through a specific URL crafted with parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior privileges or credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The attack doesn't require any interaction from a legitimate user.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable XWiki instance.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 13.10.4 and 14.2.
*   The issue is tracked in XWiki's Jira as XWIKI-18849.
*   The `suggest.vm` template is used for the suggestion feature, which is where the vulnerability is located.
*   The vulnerability is related to other information disclosure vulnerabilities in XWiki, such as XWIKI-18851, XWIKI-16544, and XWIKI-18850.
*   The fix involves removing password properties from being displayed, and adding rights checks on the properties to ensure only authorized users can view them.
*   A workaround is provided by replacing the `suggest.vm` template with a patched version.

**CWEs:**
* CWE-359:  Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor
* CWE-862: Missing Authorization
