# Missing Authorization and Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor in org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates

High

[surli](/surli)
published
GHSA-599v-w48h-rjrm
Sep 8, 2022

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 1.3

## Patched versions

13.10.4, 14.2

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

< 13.10.4, < 14.2

13.10.4, 14.2

## Description

### Impact

Through the suggestion feature, string and list properties of objects the user shouldn't have access to can be accessed. This includes private personal information like email addresses and salted password hashes of registered users but also other information stored in properties of objects. Sensitive configuration fields like passwords for LDAP or SMTP servers could be accessed. By exploiting an additional vulnerability, this issue can even be exploited on [private wikis](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Access%20Rights/#HPrivateWiki) at least for string properties.

### Patches

The issue is patched in version 13.10.4 and 14.2. Password properties are no longer displayed and rights are checked for other properties.

### Workarounds

The template file `suggest.vm` can be replaced by a patched version without upgrading or restarting XWiki unless it has been [overridden](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Skin%20Application#HHowtooverrideatemplate), in which case the overridden template should be patched, too. This might need adjustments for older versions, though.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
