Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-2849.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unrestricted file upload in the `upload` function of the Simple File Manager Web App using PHP and MySQL Database Free Source Code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The application does not properly validate or restrict the types of files that can be uploaded.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file (e.g., `shell.php`) and then execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the application.
- No authentication required: The vulnerability can be exploited without logging in to the website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges or access to the server is required other than network access to the server.
- The attacker does not need to be logged in to the application to exploit the vulnerability.

**Detailed Explanation:**

The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the following:
1. **Upload a malicious PHP file:**
   - The attacker sends a POST request with `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` to upload a file named `shell.php` containing PHP code for command execution using `@eval($_POST['cmd'])`.
2. **Execute code through the uploaded file:**
   - After successfully uploading the shell file, the attacker sends a GET or POST request to the path where the uploaded file is located. The attacker sends a `cmd` parameter that contains the code to be executed. In the provided example, the attacker sends `cmd=phpinfo()`, which will display the PHP information for debugging and verification of execution.

This unrestricted file upload allows an attacker to upload arbitrary code and gain full control over the vulnerable server.
