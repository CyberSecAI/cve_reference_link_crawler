| Itsourcecode Online Discussion Forum Project in PHP with Source Code v1.0 change\_profile\_picture.php Unrestricted UploadNAME OF AFFECTED PRODUCT(S)  * Online Discussion Forum Project in PHP with Source Code  Vendor Homepage  * <https://itsourcecode.com/free-projects/php-project/online-discussion-forum-project-in-php-with-source-code/>  AFFECTED AND/OR FIXED VERSION(S)submitter  * N3xu5Cr4ck37  Vulnerable File  * change\_profile\_picture.php  VERSION(S)  * V1.0  Software Link  * <https://itsourcecode.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/bcc_forum.zip>  PROBLEM TYPEVulnerability Type  * Unrestricted Upload  Root Cause  * In line 13 of the change\_profile\_picture.php file,The input obtained through $- FILES is directly used to determine the storage location of the file, without conducting a complete security check. The specific code snippet is as follows:   [1](https://github.com/L1OudFd8cl09/CVE/assets/151617791/26ab63e8-e0a0-414f-af55-87b5250da8bc) Impact  * Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to upload malicious files without restriction, which can lead to file overwrite, file injection, directory traversal attacks, and denial of service attacks. Exploiting malicious files can lead to remote attacks on RCE  DESCRIPTION  * The file upload operation was triggered on line 13 of the "change\_profile\_picture.php" file, and the uploaded file was received using the "$- FILES" variable. Due to the lack of appropriate input validation and cleaning, remote attackers only need to use regular user login to pass malicious payloads through this file upload function, resulting in unrestricted file uploads, which may further lead to remote code execution (RCE).
