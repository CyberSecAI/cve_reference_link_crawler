| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2319212#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-10-16 15:23:48 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in PAM. The secret is in memory, while the attacker can trigger the victim program to execute by sending characters to its stdin. In-between, they then train the branch predictor to speculatively execute a ROP chain.  Moreover, when stdin is a pipe or file, the FILE IO buffer malloc'd will receive the just-freed IO buffer that was used to read /etc/shadow, so it is also possible to have the secret conveniently available in the uninitialized memory of the stdin's FILE buf.=20  This makes several registers reference the /etc/shadow contents during the read-loop of the fgets call that the polkit agent uses in the pam conversation.=20  The attack is difficult to pull of: - Attacker needs to find a gadget chain in the mapped-in executable memory of the victim - Attacker needs to trigger TLB entries to be prefetched to win the race and fit the transient operations in the misspeculation window. - Attacker needs to tweak the attack to break ASLR. This they also can do using Spectre as well.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2319212#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-19 04:38:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.4 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:9941 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9941](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A9941)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2319212#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-26 15:20:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:10379 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10379](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10379)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2319212#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-12-17 12:32:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:11250 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:11250](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A11250)   ``` |  |
