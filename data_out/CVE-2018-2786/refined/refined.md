Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the relevant information regarding CVE-2018-2786:

**1. Vulnerability Description**

*   The vulnerability is related to an unspecified flaw in the InnoDB storage engine of MySQL.
*   It is a security vulnerability identified in the April 2018 Oracle Critical Patch Update.

**2. Root Cause**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is not specified in the provided documents. The documents state that the vulnerability is within InnoDB but don't detail the precise flaw

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**

*   The primary weakness is within the InnoDB storage engine. The documents do not detail specifics.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

*   The impact of the vulnerability includes unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all of the MySQL Server accessible data
*   It can also result in a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete denial of service) of MySQL Server.
*   In some cases, privilege escalation could also occur.

**5. Attack Vectors**

*   The attack vector is via the MySQL Protocol
*   Some documents classify it as a "network" attack vector, meaning it can be exploited over a network connection, but often this means a network connection to the database server.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   Typically requires low privilege access to the target system to carry out the attacks.
*   For remote exploits, while no authentication is listed, the documents imply it requires a connection to the database server. Some documents state the exploits require a user account, and that exploits may require high privileges to succeed.
*   Some sources also suggest that user interaction may be required.

**7. Affected Products**

*   The vulnerability is known to affect MySQL Server versions 5.5.59 and prior, 5.6.39 and prior, and 5.7.21 and prior.
*   It also affects MariaDB versions prior to 10.1.38-r1 and 10.2.22, rh-mariadb102 versions prior to 10.2.22-1, and mysql-server versions prior to 5.6.42 and 5.7.24.
*  Multiple NetApp products are also affected. These include Active IQ Unified Manager, OnCommand Insight, OnCommand Workflow Automation, and SnapCenter

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is referenced in multiple advisories including USN-3629-1, USN-3629-3, RHSA-2018:3655, and RHSA-2019:1258.
*   Multiple vendors have released patches to address this and other related MySQL vulnerabilities, as specified in the provided documents.
*   Oracle's advisory recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible.

**Summary of CVE-2018-2786:**
The vulnerability is a flaw in MySQL's InnoDB storage engine that can lead to data breaches, DoS, and in some cases, privilege escalation. Attackers require network access to a vulnerable MySQL instance, and could potentially perform an unauthenticated remote attack. This vulnerability is listed as having medium to high severity scores.
