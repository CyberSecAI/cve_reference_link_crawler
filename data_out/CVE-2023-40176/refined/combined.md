# SXSS in the user profile via the timezone displayer

Critical

[mflorea](/mflorea)
published
GHSA-h8cm-3v5f-rgp6
Aug 21, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

4.1-milestone-2

## Patched versions

14.10.5, 15.1-rc-1

## Description

### Impact

Any registered user can exploit a stored XSS through their user profile by setting the payload as the value of the time zone user preference. Even though the time zone is selected from a drop down (no free text value) it can still be set from JavaScript (using the browser developer tools) or by calling the save URL on the user profile with the right query string. Once the time zone is set it is displayed without escaping which means the payload gets executed for any user that visits the malicious user profile, allowing the attacker to steal information and even gain more access rights (escalation to programming rights).

The problem is present [since version 4.1M2](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-7847) when the time zone user preference was introduced.

### Patches

The issue has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.5 and 15.1RC1 by [d11ca5d](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/d11ca5d781f8a42a85bc98eb82306c1431e764d4) . The main fix is in the [`displayer_timezone.vm`](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/d11ca5d781f8a42a85bc98eb82306c1431e764d4#diff-57ffb6e10fa8768e59948f2becf755699570d97b78bb12a9623e0de49e6c5c7d) precisely at this [line](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/d11ca5d781f8a42a85bc98eb82306c1431e764d4#diff-57ffb6e10fa8768e59948f2becf755699570d97b78bb12a9623e0de49e6c5c7dR40):

```
$!escapetool.xml($value)

```

By escaping the displayed time zone value we make sure the attacker's payload is not executed.

### Workarounds

If you want to fix this problem on older versions of XWiki that have not been patched then you need to edit `displayer_timezone.vm` and escape the displayed time zone value [here](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/xwiki-platform-14.10.4/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-web/xwiki-platform-web-templates/src/main/resources/templates/displayer_timezone.vm#L32):

```
- $!value
+ $!escapetool.xml($value)

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
