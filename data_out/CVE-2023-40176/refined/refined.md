{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The timezone value in the user profile was displayed without proper escaping, allowing for the execution of malicious scripts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper output sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into their user profile by setting a crafted time zone value. This code would then execute whenever another user visited the attacker's profile, enabling the attacker to steal information, and potentially gain elevated privileges (escalation to programming rights).",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious user could set the payload as a timezone value by using JavaScript in browser developer tools, or directly through the user profile save URL with a crafted query string.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a registered user and have the ability to modify their user profile settings. No special privileges are required.",
       "more_details": "The vulnerability was introduced with the timezone user preference in version 4.1M2. The fix involves escaping the displayed timezone value in the `displayer_timezone.vm` template file using `$!escapetool.xml($value)`."
