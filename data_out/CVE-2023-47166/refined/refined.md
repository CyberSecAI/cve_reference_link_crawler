- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Milesight UR32L router does not validate the uploaded firmware during the firmware upgrade process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Authorization (CWE-285). The lack of firmware validation allows for arbitrary firmware updates.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can upload and install a malicious firmware, potentially gaining full control of the device.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted network request to the router.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable router. The report specifies that the attacker needs to be able to authenticate to the router (as the CVSS score has a low Privileges Required value), but does not specify what the privileges are necessary to exploit the vulnerability.
