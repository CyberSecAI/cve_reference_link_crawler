- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in Adobe Substance 3D Sampler.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, and user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs local access to the system and requires user interaction to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker does not require any special privileges.
