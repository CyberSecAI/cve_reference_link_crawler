- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application has an issue with the DLL search path, which may lead to insecurely loading Dynamic Link Libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure DLL loading (CWE-427).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the running application.
- **Attack vectors:** Local. An attacker needs to trick the user into placing a malicious DLL file in a specific folder.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the capability to place a malicious DLL in a location where the application will load it from. This typically requires local access. The user must also be tricked into placing the malicious DLL.
