{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Conan API incorrectly processes JWT-encoded Personal Access Tokens by using the PAT ID instead of the actual token value for authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper authentication mechanism.",
      "Use of a less secure identifier (PAT ID) instead of the token itself."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with knowledge of the server secret (`Settings.attr_encrypted_db_key_base`), a username, and a Personal Access Token ID can gain unauthorized access to the Conan API, impersonating the targeted user. This includes discovering, downloading, and uploading Conan packages.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves crafting a malicious JWT using the server's secret, target user's ID, and a valid PAT ID. This crafted JWT is then used to authenticate with the Conan API.",
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Knowledge of server secret `Settings.attr_encrypted_db_key_base`.",
      "A valid user ID.",
      "A Personal Access Token ID.",
       "Ability to make API requests."
    ],
     "details": "The vulnerability lies in the `API::Helpers::Packages::Conan::ApiHelpers#find_personal_access_token_from_conan_jwt` method which uses `PersonalAccessToken.find_by_id_and_user_id` instead of `PersonalAccessToken.find_by_token_and_user_id`."
