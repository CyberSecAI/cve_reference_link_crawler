Caution

**The NEXT MAJOR release of Snipe-IT (v7.0.0) will require PHP 8.1 or greater**

As we wrap it all up for v7 (which you can preview on the `snipeit_v7_laravel10` branch, we knew there would be a few more things we needed to handle. Most of these are small bugfixes (that have already been merged into the v7 branch) but we also came across some security issues that we wanted to patch as we close off the v6 line. Users are encouraged to upgrade to v6.4.2 - and of course, encouraged to make sure your servers are ready for v7 with PHP8.1.

### @snipe **[snipe](/snipe)** commented [May 21, 2024](#issue-2307767803)

This tightens up the code around syncing user group membership when using the API and adds a bunch of tests for conditions we weren't testing before.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### **[what-the-diff](/apps/what-the-diff) bot** commented [May 21, 2024](#issuecomment-2122133974)

| PR Summary  * **Improved User Permission Handling**   The file `app/Http/Controllers/Api/UsersController.php` is now more robust with added clarifications for user permissions processing. We've also enhanced the conditions for user group assignments to account for superusers. * **User Interface Text Changes**   In `resources/views/groups/view.blade.php`, we've updated the text to offer a clearer user interface. * **Added Test Cases for User Management**   In `tests/Feature/Api/Users/UpdateUserApiTest.php`, we've added new test scenarios to comprehensively check non-superuser cases as well as superuser group assignments. This will make sure our user management functionality is more accurate and reliable. |
