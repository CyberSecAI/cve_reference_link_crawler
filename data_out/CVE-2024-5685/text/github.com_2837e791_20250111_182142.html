Caution

**The NEXT MAJOR release of Snipe-IT (v7.0.0) will require PHP 8.1 or greater**

As we wrap it all up for v7 (which you can preview on the `snipeit_v7_laravel10` branch, we knew there would be a few more things we needed to handle. Most of these are small bugfixes (that have already been merged into the v7 branch) but we also came across some security issues that we wanted to patch as we close off the v6 line. Users are encouraged to upgrade to v6.4.2 - and of course, encouraged to make sure your servers are ready for v7 with PHP8.1.
