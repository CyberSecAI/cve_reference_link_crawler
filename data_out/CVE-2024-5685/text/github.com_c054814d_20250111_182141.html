### @snipe **[snipe](/snipe)** commented [May 21, 2024](#issue-2307767803)

This tightens up the code around syncing user group membership when using the API and adds a bunch of tests for conditions we weren't testing before.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| PR Summary  * **Improved User Permission Handling**   The file `app/Http/Controllers/Api/UsersController.php` is now more robust with added clarifications for user permissions processing. We've also enhanced the conditions for user group assignments to account for superusers. * **User Interface Text Changes**   In `resources/views/groups/view.blade.php`, we've updated the text to offer a clearer user interface. * **Added Test Cases for User Management**   In `tests/Feature/Api/Users/UpdateUserApiTest.php`, we've added new test scenarios to comprehensively check non-superuser cases as well as superuser group assignments. This will make sure our user management functionality is more accurate and reliable. |
