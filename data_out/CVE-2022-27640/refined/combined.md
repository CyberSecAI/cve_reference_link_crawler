PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Communication Processor (CP) of the Redundant Network Access (RNA) series have been designed
to connect SIMATIC S7-400 CPUs to Industrial Ethernet.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-27640

The affected devices improperly handles excessive ARP broadcast requests.

This could allow an attacker to create a denial of service condition by performing ARP storming attacks,
which can cause the device to reboot.
