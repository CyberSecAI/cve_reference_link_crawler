- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected Siemens Communication Processor (CP) devices improperly handle excessive ARP broadcast requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The devices are susceptible to uncontrolled resource consumption due to the improper handling of ARP requests, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This is categorized as CWE-400.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial of service condition, potentially forcing the device to reboot, by performing ARP storming attacks. This impacts availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A). This means an attacker must be within the same network segment to perform the attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be positioned on the same network segment as the vulnerable device and have the capability to generate excessive ARP broadcast requests. No privileges or user interaction is required (PR:N, UI:N).
