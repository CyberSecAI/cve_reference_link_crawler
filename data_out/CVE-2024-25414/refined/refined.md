{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the system upgrade functionality of CSZ CMS, which allows users to upload and extract ZIP files. This functionality does not properly sanitize or validate the uploaded files, leading to the potential upload of malicious files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Remote Command Execution"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector is through the system upgrade functionality in the admin panel. An attacker uploads a malicious zip file containing a PHP file. When the zip is extracted, the php file is also extracted and can be accessed via the url"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires administrative access to the CSZ CMS to access the upgrade page. The attacker also needs the ability to create zip archives"
  }
