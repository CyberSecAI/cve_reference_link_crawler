  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress Events Manager plugin does not implement sufficient protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the website while authenticated.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious request that, when submitted by a logged-in user, performs an action on the user's behalf without their knowledge or consent.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into submitting the malicious request (e.g., via a link, email, or other method of social engineering).  The attacker does not need to be authenticated."
