- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An authorization vulnerability exists due to insufficient access control checks in PAM360.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authorization leading to the ability of non-admin users to perform privileged operations.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Non-admin users can execute privileged operations, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control over sensitive resources.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending crafted requests to the PAM360 server, bypassing intended authorization mechanisms.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a non-admin user with the ability to send requests to the PAM360 server.
