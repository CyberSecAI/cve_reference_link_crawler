# Mastodon

> ⚠️ This release is an important security release fixing multiple **critical security issues** (CVE-2023-36460, CVE-2023-36459).
>
> Corresponding security releases are available for the [4.1.x branch](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.1.3) and the [4.0.x branch](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.0.5).
>
> If you are using nightly builds, **do not use this release** but update to `nightly-2023-07-06-security` or newer instead. If you are on the `main` branch, update to the latest commit.

## Upgrade overview

## Upgrade notes

To get the code for v3.5.9, use `git fetch && git checkout v3.5.9`.

> As always, **make sure you have backups of the database before performing any upgrades**. If you are using docker-compose, this is how a backup command might look: docker exec mastodon\_db\_1 pg\_dump -Fc -U postgres postgres > name\_of\_the\_backup.dump

### Dependencies

Apart from ImageMagick, external dependencies have not changed compared to v3.5.8, the compatible Ruby, PostgreSQL, Node, Elasticsearch and Redis versions are the same, that is:

* Ruby: 2.7 to 3.0
* PostgreSQL: 9.5 or newer
* Elasticsearch (optional, for full-text search): 7.x
* Redis: 4 or newer
* Node: >= 12.22, < 18
* ImageMagick: 6.9.7-7 or newer

If your uploaded images are broken after the upgrade, it means your installed ImageMagick version is older than the new minimum version (6.9.7-7), for example if you are running Ubuntu 18.04. If this happens, you can find more informations and ways to fix it [on this page](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/25776).

### Update steps

The following instructions are for updating from 3.5.8.

If you are upgrading directly from an earlier release, please carefully read the upgrade notes for the skipped releases as well, as they often require extra steps such as database migrations.

**Non-Docker only:**

1. Install dependencies: `bundle install` and `yarn install`

**Both Docker and non-Docker:**

ℹ️ The recommended configuration for reverse proxies has been updated. Unlike updating Mastodon itself, this is not urgent, but hardening. The change is about setting `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; form-action 'none'` and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` on assets. Check `dist/nginx.conf` for more information, and [the documentation](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/optional/object-storage-proxy/) if you are proxying external object storage.

1. Restart all Mastodon processes
