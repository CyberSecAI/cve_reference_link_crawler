# Verified profile links can be formatted in a misleading way

Moderate

[Gargron](/Gargron)
published
GHSA-55j9-c3mp-6fcq
Jul 6, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

>= 2.6.0

## Patched versions

4.1.3, 4.0.5, 3.5.9

## Description

### Summary

An attacker can craft a verified profile link using specific formatting to conceal arbitrary parts of the link, enabling it to appear to link to a different URL altogether.

### Impact

The link is visually misleading, but clicking on it will reveal the actual link. This can still be used for phishing, though, similar to IDN homograph attacks.

### Severity

Moderate

5.4

# CVSS overall score

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-36462

# Mastodon

> ⚠️ This release is an important security release fixing multiple **critical security issues** (CVE-2023-36460, CVE-2023-36459).
>
> Corresponding security releases are available for the [4.1.x branch](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.1.3) and the [4.0.x branch](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.0.5).
>
> If you are using nightly builds, **do not use this release** but update to `nightly-2023-07-06-security` or newer instead. If you are on the `main` branch, update to the latest commit.

## Upgrade overview

This release contains upgrade notes that deviate from the norm:

ℹ️ Requires streaming API restart

ℹ️ There are suggested reverse proxy configuration changes

⚠️ The minimal supported ImageMagick version has been bumped to 6.9.7-7

For more information, scroll down to the upgrade instructions section.

## Changelog

### Fixed

* Fix soft-deleted post cleanup scheduler overwhelming the streaming server ([ThisIsMissEm](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/25519))
* Fix incorrect pagination headers in `/api/v2/admin/accounts` ([danielmbrasil](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/25477))
* Fix performance of streaming by parsing message JSON once ([ThisIsMissEm](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/25278), [ThisIsMissEm](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/25361))
* Fix CSP headers when `S3_ALIAS_HOST` includes a path component ([ClearlyClaire](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/25273))
* Fix `tootctl accounts approve --number N` not aproving N earliest registrations ([danielmbrasil](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/24605))

* Fix inefficiencies in indexing content for search ([VyrCossont](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/24285), [VyrCossont](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/24342))

### Security

* Update dependencies
* Add hardening headers for user-uploaded files ([ClearlyClaire](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/25756))
* Fix verified links possibly hiding important parts of the URL (CVE-2023-36462)
* Fix timeout handling of outbound HTTP requests (CVE-2023-36461)
* Fix arbitrary file creation through media processing (CVE-2023-36460)
* Fix possible XSS in preview cards (CVE-2023-36459)

## Upgrade notes

To get the code for v3.5.9, use `git fetch && git checkout v3.5.9`.

> As always, **make sure you have backups of the database before performing any upgrades**. If you are using docker-compose, this is how a backup command might look: docker exec mastodon\_db\_1 pg\_dump -Fc -U postgres postgres > name\_of\_the\_backup.dump

### Dependencies

Apart from ImageMagick, external dependencies have not changed compared to v3.5.8, the compatible Ruby, PostgreSQL, Node, Elasticsearch and Redis versions are the same, that is:

* Ruby: 2.7 to 3.0
* PostgreSQL: 9.5 or newer
* Elasticsearch (optional, for full-text search): 7.x
* Redis: 4 or newer
* Node: >= 12.22, < 18
* ImageMagick: 6.9.7-7 or newer

If your uploaded images are broken after the upgrade, it means your installed ImageMagick version is older than the new minimum version (6.9.7-7), for example if you are running Ubuntu 18.04. If this happens, you can find more informations and ways to fix it [on this page](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/25776).

### Update steps

The following instructions are for updating from 3.5.8.

If you are upgrading directly from an earlier release, please carefully read the upgrade notes for the skipped releases as well, as they often require extra steps such as database migrations.

**Non-Docker only:**

1. Install dependencies: `bundle install` and `yarn install`

**Both Docker and non-Docker:**

ℹ️ The recommended configuration for reverse proxies has been updated. Unlike updating Mastodon itself, this is not urgent, but hardening. The change is about setting `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; form-action 'none'` and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` on assets. Check `dist/nginx.conf` for more information, and [the documentation](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/optional/object-storage-proxy/) if you are proxying external object storage.

1. Restart all Mastodon processes

## Upgrade notes

To get the code for v4.1.3, use `git fetch && git checkout v4.1.3`.

> As always, **make sure you have backups of the database before performing any upgrades**. If you are using docker-compose, this is how a backup command might look: docker exec mastodon\_db\_1 pg\_dump -Fc -U postgres postgres > name\_of\_the\_backup.dump

### Dependencies

Apart from ImageMagick, external dependencies have not changed compared to v4.1.2, the compatible Ruby, PostgreSQL, Node, Elasticsearch and Redis versions are the same, that is:

* Ruby: 2.7 to 3.0
* PostgreSQL: 9.5 or newer
* Elasticsearch (optional, for full-text search): 7.x
* Redis: 4 or newer
* Node: >= 14, < 18
* ImageMagick: 6.9.7-7 or newer

If your uploaded images are broken after the upgrade, it means your installed ImageMagick version is older than the new minimum version (6.9.7-7), for example if you are running Ubuntu 18.04. If this happens, you can find more informations and ways to fix it [on this page](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/25776).

### Update steps

The following instructions are for updating from 4.1.2.

If you are upgrading directly from an earlier release, please carefully read the upgrade notes for the skipped releases as well, as they often require extra steps such as database migrations.

**Non-Docker only:**

1. Install dependencies: `bundle install` and `yarn install`

**Both Docker and non-Docker:**

ℹ️ The recommended configuration for reverse proxies has been updated. Unlike updating Mastodon itself, this is not urgent, but hardening. The change is about setting `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; form-action 'none'` and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` on assets. Check `dist/nginx.conf` for more information, and [the documentation](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/optional/object-storage-proxy/) if you are proxying external object storage.

1. Restart all Mastodon processes
