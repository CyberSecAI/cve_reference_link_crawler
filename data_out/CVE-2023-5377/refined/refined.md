{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a missing check in `gf_isom_set_audio_layout` function. It doesn't validate that `channels_count` is less than 64 when `definedLayout` is 0 which could lead to a heap overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap overflow due to missing size validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A heap overflow can lead to denial of service, code execution, or data corruption.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted MP4 files with a `chnl` box that contains an invalid channel layout could be used to trigger the overflow by passing a channels_count value equal or greater than 64 while definedLayout is 0.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted MP4 file which would require user interaction to open or have the media player parse it on a website."
