The provided content relates to CVE-2023-45998.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the ability to customize global HTML within the kodbox file manager, which allows for the storage of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of sanitization or proper handling of user-supplied HTML within a global context, leading to a stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web interface that can be executed within the browsers of other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves injecting a malicious HTML payload through the interface that allows customization of the global HTML elements in the kodbox file manager.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be in a position to interact with the administrative interface to inject the malicious HTML code.
