Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the use of hard-coded credentials within the `pkg/token/token.go` file. Specifically, the `config.key` used to sign JWT tokens is a hardcoded string: `"Rtg8BPKNEf2mB4mgvKONGPZZQSaJWNLijxR42qRgq0iBb5"`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Hard-coded credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of a hard-coded secret key, which is used for signing JWT tokens. This key should never be directly embedded in the source code.
- **Exposure of secret key:** Anyone with access to the source code can obtain the secret key, which compromises the security of the token system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized access:** An attacker who obtains the hard-coded key can forge legitimate JWT tokens, granting them unauthorized access to resources protected by the authentication system.
- **Sensitive operations:** With the ability to forge tokens, attackers can perform unauthorized actions as legitimate users, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Source code access:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by gaining access to the source code repository (e.g., through a compromised developer account, or by finding a public repository).
- **Configuration access:** If the application is deployed with configuration files containing this hard-coded key, this can also be a way for the attacker to find the key.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the source code or configuration files where the hard-coded secret is located.
- No other specific system level access is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported in issue #1 of the `Go-Tribe/gotribe` repository.
- The issue was addressed by commit `4fb9b9e80a2beedd09d9fde4b9cf5bd510baf18f`, which replaces the hard-coded key with an environment variable.
- The vulnerability has been assigned VulDB entry `275706`.

This is a classic example of a severe security vulnerability arising from poor coding practices and highlights the importance of never storing secret keys directly in code.
