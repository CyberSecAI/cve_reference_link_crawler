Multiple issues were found in libde265, an open source implementation of the
h.265 video codec, which may result in denial of or have unspecified other
impact.

CVE-2020-21599

    libde265 v1.0.4 contains a heap buffer overflow in the
    de265_image::available_zscan function, which can be exploited via a crafted
    a file.

CVE-2021-35452

    An Incorrect Access Control vulnerability exists in libde265 v1.0.8 due to
    a SEGV in slice.cc.

CVE-2021-36408

    libde265 v1.0.8 contains a Heap-use-after-free in intrapred.h when decoding
    file using dec265.

CVE-2021-36409

    There is an Assertion `scaling_list_pred_matrix_id_delta==1' failed at
    sps.cc:925 in libde265 v1.0.8 when decoding file, which allows attackers to
    cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by running the application with a crafted
    file or possibly have unspecified other impact.

CVE-2021-36410

    A stack-buffer-overflow exists in libde265 v1.0.8 via fallback-motion.cc in
    function put_epel_hv_fallback when running program dec265.

CVE-2021-36411

    An issue has been found in libde265 v1.0.8 due to incorrect access control.
    A SEGV caused by a READ memory access in function derive_boundaryStrength of
    deblock.cc has occurred. The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and
    application crash, which leads to remote denial of service.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.0.3-1+deb10u1.
