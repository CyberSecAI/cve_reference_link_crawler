Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-36411

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Incorrect access control in the `derive_boundaryStrength` function within `deblock.cc`. This leads to an out-of-bounds read, resulting in a segmentation fault.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The code attempts to access memory outside the valid range due to improper access control.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The segmentation fault and application crash resulting from the out-of-bounds read lead to a denial of service, preventing the program from functioning correctly.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted HEVC/H.265 video file: The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted video file that causes the vulnerable code path to be executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted video file: An attacker needs to be able to supply the vulnerable application with a specially crafted HEVC/H.265 video file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs at line 298 of `deblock.cc` in the `derive_boundaryStrength` function, specifically when accessing `shdrP->RefPicList[0][ mviP.refIdx[0] ]`.
- The provided GitHub issue and Debian security advisories confirm this issue and its resolution in later versions.
- The vulnerability was found in libde265 v1.0.8
- A Proof of Concept (POC) was provided by the reporter as a `poc.zip` archive.
- The issue was fixed by checking for NULL `shdr` references.
