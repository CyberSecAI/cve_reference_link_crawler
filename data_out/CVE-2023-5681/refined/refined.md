Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of input validation in the `list_addr_fwresource_ip.php` script when handling user-supplied data, specifically within the `ResId[]` parameter. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection vulnerability. The application directly incorporates user-provided input into a SQL query without sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, or other confidential data. The provided example reveals the database name as a direct result of the injected SQL query.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:**  Although not demonstrated in the provided POC, SQL injection can often be used to modify or delete data within the database.
- **Potential for Complete System Compromise:** Depending on the database user permissions and the application's architecture, a successful SQL injection could potentially lead to remote code execution or other severe system compromises.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/admin/list_addr_fwresource_ip.php` endpoint.
- **Manipulated Request Parameter:** The `ResId[]` parameter is manipulated with a crafted SQL injection payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid administrator credentials for the Netcom NS-ASG (specifically SuperAdmin) to access the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable URL path: `/admin/list_addr_fwresource_ip.php` and the vulnerable parameters.
