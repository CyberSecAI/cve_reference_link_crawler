{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Couchbase Cluster Manager lacks access controls during a cluster node restart. During the start of a couchbase server node there is a short time period where the security cookie is set to \"nocookie\" which lacks access controls over the Erlang distribution protocol.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of access control during a cluster node restart, specifically when the security cookie is set to \"nocookie\". This allows for unauthenticated access to the Erlang distribution protocol.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code remotely on any cluster node with the same privileges as the Couchbase Server. The attacker can maintain the connection and execute code at any point of time until the connection is dropped",
  "Attack vectors": "Network access to the Erlang distribution protocol during the short time window where the security cookie is set to \"nocookie\" during a node restart.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the Erlang distribution protocol of a restarting Couchbase node during the small time window before authentication is established."
