Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-24766:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the CasaOS login page's distinct error responses based on whether the username or password is incorrect. Specifically, it returns "User does not exist" for an invalid username and "User does not exist or password is invalid" for an invalid password. This behavior allows an attacker to differentiate between the two scenarios.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Username Enumeration:** The application's responses leak information about whether a username exists in the system, leading to username enumeration.
- **Information Disclosure:** The different error messages disclose sensitive information that should not be exposed to unauthenticated users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can identify valid usernames on the CasaOS system, which can be used in subsequent attacks such as brute-force password attempts.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack can be performed remotely.
- The attacker sends login requests with different usernames and observes the responses to determine valid usernames.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker only needs to access the CasaOS login page.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in CasaOS v0.4.4.3 and patched in v0.4.7. The vulnerability was also present in version 0.4.7 and was patched in v0.4.8
- The fix implemented changes the error message to a generic message "**User does not exist or password is invalid**"  for both invalid usernames and passwords to prevent username enumeration.
- The vulnerability is classified as moderate with a CVSS score of 6.2.
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-204: Improper Handling of Credentials.
- The vulnerability was reported by DrDark1999.
