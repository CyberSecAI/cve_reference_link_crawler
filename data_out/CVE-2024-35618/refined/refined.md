Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35618:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how TiDB handles output columns during query planning and execution. Specifically, the output columns of the top plan are directly passed as `parentUsedCols`. Subsequently, modifications to `parentUsedCols` during pruning lead to unexpected changes in the output columns. This inconsistency causes errors and crashes during query execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL pointer dereference:** The vulnerability manifests as a NULL pointer dereference within the `SortedRowContainer` component during the `Add` operation, specifically when handling a modified `parentUsedCols`. This is due to a change in the output columns.
- **Index out of range:** There are also instances of index out of range errors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database crash:** The primary impact is a database crash, which can lead to service unavailability. The provided logs show multiple panic messages due to the index out of range and null pointer dereference errors.
- **Denial of Service:** By triggering the vulnerability with a crafted SQL query, an attacker could cause the TiDB server to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted SQL Query:** The vulnerability is triggered by executing specific SQL queries. The provided files `valid.txt` and `error3.txt` demonstrate a sequence that first creates some data using valid.sql, then crashes the database with error.sql.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute SQL queries against the TiDB database. This implies the attacker would need some level of access to the database, whether through a local or remote connection.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple LTS versions of TiDB, specifically versions 6.1.x, 6.5.x, 7.1.x, 7.5.x, and 8.1.x.
- The issue was discovered by researchers from Beihang University.
- A fix has been implemented and is available in pull request #53325.
- The specific vulnerable function is `(*SortedRowContainer).Add`.

In summary, the vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the query planning and execution process of TiDB, leading to a null pointer dereference and index out of bounds errors when specific queries are executed. The impact is a database crash, which can result in a denial of service. An attacker needs the ability to execute SQL queries to trigger the vulnerability.
