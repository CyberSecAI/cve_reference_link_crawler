|  | CVE-2024-35618 |
|  | [PRODUCT] |
|  | PingCAP TiDB |
|  | [VERSION] |
|  | =v7.5.1 |
|  | [PROBLEM TYPE] |
|  | buffer overflow |
|  | [DESCRIPTION] |
|  | PingCAP TiDB v7.5.1 was discovered to contain a NULL pointer |
|  | dereference via the component SortedRowContainer. The output |
|  | columns of the top plan are directly passed as the parentUsedCols |
|  | and then the parentUsedCols is modified during the pruning. |
|  | So the output columns changed unexpectedly. |
