The provided content relates to CVE-2024-30262.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that "remember-me" tokens are not cleared when a front-end member changes their password. This allows existing tokens to remain valid, potentially granting unauthorized access if they are compromised.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate session management
- Failure to invalidate "remember-me" tokens upon password change

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with access to an old, valid "remember-me" token could potentially gain unauthorized access to a user's account, even after the user has changed their password. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to obtain a valid "remember-me" token before the user changes their password. This token could then be used for unauthorized access even after the password change.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have obtained a valid "remember-me" token. This could be through various means, such as eavesdropping on network traffic, accessing a compromised device, or exploiting other vulnerabilities.
- The attacker does not need to know the new password.
- Low privileges are required.
- No user interaction is required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Contao versions prior to 4.13.40.
- The fix involves adding a function to delete remember me tokens by username to the RememberMeRepository, then calling that function in the ModuleChangePassword, ModulePassword and ModulePersonalData modules after the user changes their password.
- A workaround is provided which involves disabling the "Allow auto login" option in the login module.
- The CVSS v3 base metrics are: Attack vector: Network, Attack complexity: Low, Privileges required: Low, User interaction: None, Scope: Unchanged, Confidentiality: Low, Integrity: Low, Availability: None.
