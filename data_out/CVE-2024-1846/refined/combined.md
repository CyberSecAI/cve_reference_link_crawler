## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Responsive Tabs < 4.0.7 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to "Tab Sets > Add New" in WP Admin
2. Add a new tab and fill out values.
3. Intercept the request and for the `tabs\_color` parameter, add the payload `"+onmouseover='alert(1)'"`
4. Send the request and then preview the tab group to see the XSS
