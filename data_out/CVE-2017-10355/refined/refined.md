Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2017-10355:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `FtpClient` implementation in the Networking component of OpenJDK did not set default connect and read timeouts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Lack of default network operation timeouts in the `FtpClient` implementation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A malicious FTP server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition by blocking the execution of a Java application that is attempting to connect to an FTP server. This is done by keeping the socket open indefinitely, as no timeouts are set.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Man-in-the-middle attacks: An attacker can intercept and manipulate network traffic.
*   Malicious FTP servers: An attacker could control the FTP server a Java application connects to.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in a position to control network traffic between the Java application and an FTP server or control an FTP server that the Java application will connect to.
*   No special capabilities, privileges or authentication are required from the target application.

**Additional Notes**

*   This vulnerability was found in both OpenJDK and IBM JDK.
*   Multiple sources list CVE-2017-10355 as being addressed in various updates to java-1.8.0-openjdk, java-1.7.0-openjdk and java-1.8.0-ibm.
*   The severity of this vulnerability is noted as "Important" in Red Hat Security Advisories, and "normal" in Gentoo's GLSA. Red Hat also notes the impact of the vulnerability as potentially "Critical".
*   The flaw is present in the component described as the FtpClient implementation in the Networking component of OpenJDK, meaning the Java application has to use the vulnerable functionality for the attacker to trigger the vulnerability.
*   Red Hat states that "All running instances of OpenJDK Java must be restarted for this update to take effect", implying that applications using the vulnerable functionality will have to be restarted.
*   Gentoo mentions the vulnerability can be exploited remotely, and multiple sources mention "man-in-the-middle" as attack vector, meaning the attacker does not necessarily have to compromise the target application itself.
