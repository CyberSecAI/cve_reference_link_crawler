Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2018-13381:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is a buffer overflow vulnerability present in the SSL VPN portal. This occurs due to a failure to properly parse message payloads.
*   Specifically, this vulnerability is triggered when a crafted POST request with a large `msg` value is sent to the SSL VPN portal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow. Sending a crafted POST request containing a large `msg` value will write past the buffer's allocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This means the affected system or service becomes unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The attack is conducted over a network.
*   **Crafted POST Request:**  The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specifically crafted POST request with a large `msg` value to the SSL VPN portal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated, Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need any authentication or access to the target network. They can be remote from the vulnerable system.

**Affected Products:**
*   **FortiProxy:** Specifically, FortiProxy version 2.0.0 is vulnerable.
*   **FortiOS:**  Affected versions include:
    *   FortiOS 6.0.0 to 6.0.4
    *   FortiOS 5.6.0 to 5.6.7
    *   FortiOS 5.4 and below

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported under responsible disclosure by Meh Chang and Orange Tsai from DEVCORE Security Research Team.
*   Fortinet recommends upgrading to the following versions:
    * FortiProxy 1.2.9 and above or 2.0.1 and above for FortiProxy
    * FortiOS 5.6.8, 6.0.5 or 6.2.0 for FortiOS
*   A workaround is available for FortiOS which involves disabling the SSL-VPN web portal service, if upgrading isn't immediately feasible.
