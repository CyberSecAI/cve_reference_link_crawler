Schneider Electric Security Notification

If customers choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately
apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:

•  Employ application allow list software on the machine running the CanBRASS software.
•  Apply principles of least privilege to limit access to the CanBRASS machine and the

CanBRASS software to only those persons requiring access.

•  Do not click on unknown links or open attachments from unknown source.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for

that device.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

Practices document.
