## Summary

Adobe has released security updates for ColdFusion versions 2021 and 2018. These updates resolve multiple [critical](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/severity-ratings.html)  vulnerabilities that could lead to security feature bypass.

## Affected Versions

| **Product** | **Update number** | **Platform** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ColdFusion 2018 | Update 11 and earlier versions | All |
| ColdFusion 2021 | Version 1 and earlier versions | All |

## Solution

Adobe categorizes these updates with the following [priority rating](/security/severity-ratings.html) and recommends users update their installations to the newest versions:

| **Product** | **Updated Version** | **Platform** | **Priority rating** | **Availability** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ColdFusion 2018 | Update 12 | All | 2 | [Tech note](https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/kb/coldfusion-2018-update-12.html) |
| ColdFusion 2021 | Update 2 | All | 2 | [Tech note](https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/kb/coldfusion-2021-update-2.html) |

Note:

Adobe recommends updating your ColdFusion JDK/JRE to the latest version of the LTS releases for 1.8 and JDK 11. Applying the ColdFusion update without a corresponding JDK update will NOT secure the server.  See the relevant Tech Notes for more details.

Adobe  also recommends customers apply the security configuration settings as outlined on the ColdFusion Security page as well as review the respective Lockdown guides.

## ColdFusion JDK Requirement

**COLDFUSION 2021 (version 2021.0.0.323925) and above**

**For Application Servers**

On JEE installations, set the following JVM flag, "-Djdk.serialFilter= !org.mozilla.\*\*;!com.sun.syndication.\*\*;!org.apache.commons.beanutils.\*\*", in the respective startup file depending on the type of Application Server being used.

For example:

Apache Tomcat Application Server: edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘Catalina.bat/sh’ file

WebLogic Application Server:  edit JAVA\_OPTIONS in the ‘startWeblogic.cmd’ file

WildFly/EAP Application Server:  edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘standalone.conf’ file

Set the JVM flags on a JEE installation of ColdFusion, not on a standalone installation.

**COLDFUSION 2018 HF1 and above**

**For Application Servers**

On JEE installations, set the following JVM flag, "-Djdk.serialFilter= !org.mozilla.\*\*;!com.sun.syndication.\*\*;!org.apache.commons.beanutils.\*\*", in the respective startup file depending on the type of Application Server being used.

For example:

Apache Tomcat Application Server: edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘Catalina.bat/sh’ file

WebLogic Application Server:  edit JAVA\_OPTIONS in the ‘startWeblogic.cmd’ file

WildFly/EAP Application Server:  edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘standalone.conf’ file

Set the JVM flags on a JEE installation of ColdFusion, not on a standalone installation.
