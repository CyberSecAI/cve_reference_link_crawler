The provided content is related to CVE-2022-4229.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Book Store Management System (bsms_ci) v1.0 does not implement proper access controls, allowing unauthenticated users to access sensitive functionalities and data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The application fails to restrict access to administrative functions and data to authenticated users, allowing anyone to perform actions like adding, editing, and deleting user accounts.
- **Lack of Authentication:** The application does not require users to be logged in to access and modify administrative functionalities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can access all parts of the application without logging in.
- An attacker can create, modify, and delete user accounts, including admin accounts.
- An attacker can potentially manipulate or delete sensitive application data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP requests:** Sending crafted HTTP requests directly to vulnerable endpoints.
- **Browser:** Utilizing a standard web browser to navigate to vulnerable endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No authentication is required, meaning that a remote unauthenticated user can exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to know or discover vulnerable URL paths, such as those found in the Proof of Concept section.
