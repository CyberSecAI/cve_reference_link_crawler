- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization on the `columnindex` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote authenticated attacker can execute unauthorized code or commands in the context of other users' browsers by injecting malicious scripts.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP request containing a malicious payload in the `columnindex` parameter to the FortiPortal management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to interact with the FortiPortal management interface.
