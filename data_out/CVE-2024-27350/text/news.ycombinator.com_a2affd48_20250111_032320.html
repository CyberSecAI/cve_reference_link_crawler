It allows for apps to have almost free reign over the filesystem of other apps (read, write, modify), among other powerful capabilities. No flagship Android phones on the market allow this. It would be like if the Facebook app on your iOS device could read all of the files of your banking app, or notes app. It's just not something that is enabled in any Android system claiming to have some level of security. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [barnabee](user?id=barnabee) [10 months ago](item?id=39499652)   | [parent](#39498023) | [next](#39499922) [–]  With my permission an app *should* be able to read all the files on the device, even those created by other apps. It’s *my* device not the OS or app manufacturer’s! I’m totally onboard with per-app segregated storage as a default, but this feature is clearly gated behind user permission. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [buran77](user?id=buran77) [10 months ago](item?id=39500431)   | [root](#39498023) | [parent](#39499652) | [next](#39500299) [–]  > but this feature is clearly gated behind user permission You're right that the owner of the device should have the ultimate say. But the sad reality is that most owners aren't necessarily good caretakers of those devices. They don't understand what that permission entails, and they don't actually want to take responsibility for the outcome of the decision. But they will want to hold the manufacturer accountable for the damage. I can't count how many times I heard people say "this decision should be mine to make" only to follow it up after some time with "somebody should have warned me not to do it". It's human nature and the solution for this can't/won't be technical. Windows XP was a good example of letting the person decide what's good for their device and it was also the OS with the slowest adoption of updates. People collectively decided that the discomfort of rebooting once in a while was worse than letting malware completely wreck their device and data. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [barnabee](user?id=barnabee) [10 months ago](item?id=39500982)   | [root](#39498023) | [parent](#39500431) | [next](#39500875) [–]  > I can't count how many times I heard people say "this decision should be mine to make" only to follow it up after some time with "somebody should have warned me not to do it". The correct response, if (as in this case) they were warned, is to say “someone did warn you, pay more attention next time”, then walk away[1]. Just like if a beginner ignores the black piste markets and the “for good skiers only” sign at the top of a slope then complains that they fell over. It is problematic to create in users an expectation that if they blindly mash at their globally-networked, bank-account-connected devices without paying a modicum of attention to anything that appears on the screen when they do so, that everything will be fine, and if it’s not it’s someone else’s fault.

In reality, this does far more harm than good. In almost all cases this goes wrong because of the 'little learning is a dangerous thing' problem. People tend to be in two camps: - Don't care, don't want to fiddle with the thing, the manufacturer has to do everything - Knowing just enough to break things, but not enough to fix it (and thus it is the fault of the manufacturer) Other types like the 'I am the owner, I make the rules' crowd are insignificantly small. This means that in the real world (so not in an echochamber) you only get one scaled and realistic scenario: the user creates problems (for themselves, others), but cannot fix them, and everyone/everything not-user then has to care for them to deal with it. In an ideal theoretical world we might say that the end-user has to be responsible, and they have to make infinite mistakes and learn everything so they can become good caretakers of their networked systems. But that is not reality, and is not realistic. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [barnabee](user?id=barnabee) [10 months ago](item?id=39523041)   | [root](#39498023) | [parent](#39501095) | [next](#39500875) [–]  > In reality, this does far more harm than good Harm reduction isn't always the most important goal, especially when it's other people's harm and reducing it also involves restricting what they can do. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Krasnol](user?id=Krasnol) [10 months ago](item?id=39500875)   | [root](#39498023) | [parent](#39500431) | [prev](#39500982) | [next](#39500299) [–]  The argument goes for default availability here. You don't have to allow all users everything, but you should allow those who want, to do as they please. You can always hide the option behind some kind of mechanism. A mechanism a general user wouldn't use because they don't if the rest works as intended. Those who still do, should suffer the consequences, but this is not the manufacturers' problem. They have all kinds of safeguards to prevent liability because of those "special choices". | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [buran77](user?id=buran77) [10 months ago](item?id=39501033)   | [root](#39498023) | [parent](#39500875) | [next](#39500985) [–]  People would go to great lengths to follow tutorials on the internet to disable things they were told were bad for them. The less qualified, the more likely that they fell for the "updates are bad, they ruin your computer" narrative. As long as there's an option that can be abused, people will be tricked into allowing it. This is less relevant for the current discussion about the FireTV and this feature. It's for the more general discussion of being able to do whatever you want on a device you own. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [TeMPOraL](user?id=TeMPOraL) [10 months ago](item?id=39503565)   | [root](#39498023) | [parent](#39501033) | [next](#39500985) [–]  > *The less qualified, the more likely that they fell for the "updates are bad, they ruin your computer" narrative.* Bad example; this "narrative" is true as often as it isn't. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [MichaelZuo](user?id=MichaelZuo) [10 months ago](item?id=39500985)   | [root](#39498023) | [parent](#39500875) | [prev](#39501033) | [next](#39501100) [–]  Some fraction will still stumble upon it anyways and will still refuse to take any responsibility for enabling it, what then?

The real answer: users are captive. For the vendors, they're cattle. And like with any good big farm, it does not matter how much it sucks for the cattle - but it *does* matter the cattle is safe, because few bad cases can become known and risk your farm getting shut down. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [MichaelZuo](user?id=MichaelZuo) [10 months ago](item?id=39513647)   | [root](#39498023) | [parent](#39503599) | [next](#39523078) [–]  I didn't say anything about who should or should not?

You countered that there will be "some fraction" of users incapable of not hurting themselves with those features, who "will still stumble upon it anyways and will still refuse to take any responsibility for enabling it". My counter to *that* is that we shouldn't remove such power features just because "some fraction" may find and misuse them. That's the should/should not part. The rest is my take on why companies remove those features anyway - they have no incentive to provide anything above bare minimum, especially not when they could be on the hook for "some fraction"'s mishaps. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [MichaelZuo](user?id=MichaelZuo) [10 months ago](item?id=39533827)   | [root](#39498023) | [parent](#39531759) | [next](#39523078) [–]  Perhaps you are misreading my comment?

So let them? I keep hearing this argument but I have yet to hear a good explanation of why it's a problem or why I should care. If a thief walks up to someone's door and asks to be let in, and the person opens the door and lets them in, is that a security flaw on the door's part? Should we make doors harder or even impossible to open by their owners to prevent them from letting a criminal in? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [barnabee](user?id=barnabee) [10 months ago](item?id=39500911)   | [root](#39498023) | [parent](#39500299) | [prev](#39500761) | [next](#39500776) [–]  Cool, ok… you either learn from your mistakes or you don’t. Developers aren’t responsible for the general population doing dumb shit, as long as they don’t trick them into it, and it doesn’t happen as a result of bugs in their software. Imagine if the makers of stoves or kitchen knives believed that they should design out every possible way someone could burn or cut themselves… “Do you want to let [application] access [the calendar|your photos|files created by other apps]?” seems totally reasonable; stopping users from running programs that do this altogether, not at all. The biggest problem with it all is: that which OS developers do to “protect users” becomes what application developers use constrain users and prevent them accessing their data, in order to extract more money or control how people use their own devices. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [woodruffw](user?id=woodruffw) [10 months ago](item?id=39501017)   | [root](#39498023) | [parent](#39500911) | [next](#39501004) [–]  My butterknife doesn’t have the ability to upgrade itself to a chainsaw over the internet.

In the world of mega-apps (WeChat, Facebook, etc), do you really want these apps to be able to ask for or even require permissions like this? In an older, kinder, gentler era of computing, if I granted a permission to an app [0], it was probably doing something with that permission that *I* wanted. Nowadays, not so much — apps are generally actively hostile to the user, and even apps that are friendly are frequently purchased by more or less malicious companies that turn them into malware.

ADB is a debugging tool that seems to have been used by certain applications. It shouldn't be required for any normal app functionality including storage access.

Your average person with a smartphone, who is not so technically inclined, downloads a game of some sort. The game upon first launch pops up a dialog which says "to provide you with the best experience, we need to clean up temporary files on your device, when prompted by the dialog (screenshot of system dialog), please press 'OK'." The user is then presented with the relatively scary system dialog which says "Allow this app to use system debugging features?", which they have seen 100 times and never understood, decides that this time they will press 'OK'. The game then proceeds to send all of their photos to a malicious actor for whatever purposes. The average person simply isn't cognizant of the dire security and privacy consequences of many of the things that they do when interacting with a computer. Note that I am NOT advocated for the removal of ADB. As an Android developer, I once used adb on a daily basis. I also love the idea of using adb to ftp my filesystem to my local machine for the sake of backups and whatever other useful purposes. In the case of the FireTV, I believe that if the device is put into developer mode, ADB can still be accessed over a USB cable. I think this great, and necessary for development and other use cases. The point here is about making a system less likely to cause incomprehensible harm to the average person. Android and iOS were an opportunity to rethink the security model of computing (for computers that most people carry with them and use every few minutes), and I think that's great. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bakugo](user?id=bakugo) [10 months ago](item?id=39504558)   | [root](#39498023) | [parent](#39503704) | [next](#39500147) [–]  I am not the average person. It's none of my business what the average person does. Just because the average person can't be trusted with something, doesn't mean I should have to suffer because of it. Permission dialogs should be as informative as possible, sure, warn people that they're giving the app full access to their files if a permission is granted. If people still accept, then they accepted, it's their device and the device should respect their choice. It's not anyone else's responsibility to make that decision for them. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kllrnohj](user?id=kllrnohj) [10 months ago](item?id=39505380)   | [root](#39498023) | [parent](#39504558) | [next](#39500147) [–]  A sufficiently advanced user can still install something like LADB or shizuku or even a custom rom.

You must be able to put yourself into the shoes of a person that isn't you and doesn't have that experience to recognize what I'm saying.

The point is that most people don't use ADB and therefore don't have that mental model. Many people have used an ATM, so if an article talked about someone stealing cards/pins on an ATM, most people would know what it meant. There are certain abbreviations that are so commonplace it *may* be safe to assume people know what they mean, even if they do not know what they stand for. ADB is not one of those. This is the point, and this is the thing that anyone who is arguing against that point fails to recognize. It's myopia, or self-centered thinking.

The product idea was great, a <$50 device that gave you access to all the media you could want. Bonus there were apps and games. However in practice its a deeply unreliable product thats deeply frustrating to use. It appears that not even amazon targets the stick for optimisation, as even the home screen is exceptionally slow. Moreover it looses network connection frequently, but doesn't tell you. So you need to reboot the stick, but that takes an age because often there is some sort of memory leak causing the whole device to crawl. Updates appear to be optimised to happen during use of your apps. The virtual remote is deeply unreliable (and has been for years) I didn't realise how bad it was until I tried a friend's apple TV.

Same way as with desktop: installing != running. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [MBCook](user?id=MBCook) [10 months ago](item?id=39507168)   | [root](#39497153) | [parent](#39499726) | [prev](#39503534) | [next](#39497222) [–]  But the example wasn’t about apps not running when the user didn’t want them, it was about wasted cache space. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [supertrope](user?id=supertrope) [10 months ago](item?id=39497222)   | [parent](#39497153) | [prev](#39497806) | [next](#39497270) [–]  When devices ship with 8GB of storage, average users may or may not follow system prompts to free up storage on an ad hoc basis. (This is analogous to 16GB iPhones and constantly having to free up space). More savvy users can figure out that FireTV is Android compatible and use adb as a power tool. Or just buy a different streaming device that doesn't run at 75% storage full after installing YouTube and Netflix. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [BlueTemplar](user?id=BlueTemplar) [10 months ago](item?id=39498018)   | [root](#39497153) | [parent](#39497222) | [next](#39497353) [–]  Don't even get me started on Samsung's Nexus S, which is partitioned into 1 Go "internal" and 15 Go "external" space with a bunch of apps being extremely annoying about insisting on being installed in "internal" space only... | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [MBCook](user?id=MBCook) [10 months ago](item?id=39497353)   | [root](#39497153) | [parent](#39497222) | [prev](#39498018) | [next](#39497270) [–]  But none of that should be necessary. Caches should be managed by the system. If they get too big the system should empty some of it. Giving the user a prompt is a bandaid on the OS failing to do its job. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [roneythomas6](user?id=roneythomas6) [10 months ago](item?id=39497644)   | [root](#39497153) | [parent](#39497353) | [next](#39497270) [–]  It does. But cache clearing only goes to a certain point after that it will stop you from updating apps and installing new apps, until you free up space by uninstalling an app. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [MBCook](user?id=MBCook) [10 months ago](item?id=39507176)   | [root](#39497153) | [parent](#39497644) | [next](#39497270) [–]  That I understand. That’s a user caused issue, it’s fair to ask the user a question. Or you could provide a feature like iOS where unused apps are unloaded automatically (if enabled). But the user should never have to manually manage cache space. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [roneythomas6](user?id=roneythomas6) [10 months ago](item?id=39509435)   | [root](#39497153) | [parent](#39507176) | [next](#39497270) [–]  User never has to manage cache space which has always been the case. Also your normal user cannot do that, without system level privileges. Third party apps where to able to call adb directly on FireTV which is not the case on other Android devices with GMS. In fact if you build Android with access for third party to call adb, Google will never let you pass CTS and you cannot have Google Play on it. It’s a huge misstep from security point for Amazon sell devices with adb access for third party apps. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mvdtnz](user?id=mvdtnz) [10 months ago](item?id=39497270)   | [parent](#39497153) | [prev](#39497222) | [next](#39501384) [–]  Because users want to do it. It's absolutely none of your (or Amazon's) business why. How did we ever get into this bizarre situation where supposed "tech people" are questioning whether basic functionality should even exist? This billion dollar company is not your friend. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [MBCook](user?id=MBCook) [10 months ago](item?id=39497373)   | [root](#39497153) | [parent](#39497270) | [next](#39501384) [–]  Users want to do *what*? That was my question. What useful thing does this allow besides the single example in the article? And if you don’t want to be beholden to a billion dollar company, maybe don’t buy suspiciously under priced hardware from them that is obviously subsidized by their ad/service empire? And again, I contend *this is not basic functionality*. The example in the article isn’t basic functionality, it’s a bandaid on a broken OS. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [TeMPOraL](user?id=TeMPOraL) [10 months ago](item?id=39498416)   | [root](#39497153) | [parent](#39497373) | [next](#39498417) [–]  Storage and memory management *is* basic functionality. OSes universally suck at this. Partly because they can't predict the future and are mostly reactive in their behavior. Partly because they can't reason. The user can. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mvdtnz](user?id=mvdtnz) [10 months ago](item?id=39498417)   | [root](#39497153) | [parent](#39497373) | [prev](#39498416) | [next](#39501384) [–]  >Users want to do what?

It’s crucial to the business model Amazon has chosen to use for the Fire TV and if customers don’t like it, they don’t have to buy one. Why are some people like this? I would assume fanboyism is the answer, but this isn't Apple. If a business chooses a flawed business model, they should fail. Consumers should always go for what benefits them the most, not make sacrifices to try and protect a business. If the business is unsustainable, it should die so that actual sustainable business can take its place. If Amazon based their business model for FireTV around homescreen ads, yet customers found a way to easily get around them, then Amazon chose a stupid business model and should face the consequences. Crippling the product with a software update is an action that is harmful to customers, and should be illegal. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ipython](user?id=ipython) [10 months ago](item?id=39497251)   | [prev](#39501384) | [next](#39497819) [–]  Not surprising. Amazon is terrible at delivering consumer apps. The Apple TV prime video app freezes often, then after they added ads, the app now actively prevents you from muting them! You can mute during an ad, but then the app will immediately turn the volume back up. It’s straight out of black mirror. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [foepys](user?id=foepys) [10 months ago](item?id=39497761)   | [parent](#39497251) | [next](#39497819) [–]  Not to mention that on all devices I used the official Prime Video app (yes, even Fire TV Sticks), there we massive audio latency issues up to the point where I stopped watching. On FireTV Netflix had also lagging behind audio, which it never did on any other platform. I am talking about a like 1 second delay here, not 50ms (which is already not good). Amazon doesn't care about the viewer/user experience. It is always a disaster. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [1letterunixname](user?id=1letterunixname) [10 months ago](item?id=39497819)   | [prev](#39497251) | [next](#39497312) [–]  Amazon broke customizing branded buttons, took away Prime Video, and now this. Dumped FireTV for Apple TV. Much nicer experience overall except for a lack of related content in major apps. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [extraduder\_ire](user?id=extraduder_ire) [10 months ago](item?id=39499842)   | [parent](#39497819) | [next](#39497312) [–]  Surprised nobody's developed a custom rom for these things, since I've seen so many other random cheap android devices get custom roms on the xda site. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [1letterunixname](user?id=1letterunixname) [10 months ago](item?id=39502726)   | [root](#39497819) | [parent](#39499842) | [next](#39497312) [–]  I don't see how that would work. Although there was adb access, they weren't rooted. Note you can add a microusb USB hub, other USB devices including external storage, and Ethernet to most Fire TVs regardless. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ChocolateGod](user?id=ChocolateGod) [10 months ago](item?id=39497312)   | [prev](#39497819) [–]  I mean, sounds like these apps were using a feature to do something it was not designed for, can't really complain that Amazon plugs the hole. | | --- | --- | --- | | |
