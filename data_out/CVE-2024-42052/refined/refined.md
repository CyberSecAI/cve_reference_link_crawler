- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The MSI installer for Splashtop Streamer for Windows versions prior to 3.5.8.0 uses a temporary folder with weak permissions during installation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Weak permissions on the temporary folder used by the installer.
  - The installer attempts to execute a non-existent binary (`wevtutil.exe`) from a user-writable folder in the user's `%TEMP%` directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local authenticated user can achieve privilege escalation to `SYSTEM`.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - The attacker needs to force a reinstall of the product by either having the original installer or copying the installer to the original path from where it was executed.
  - The attacker then places an arbitrary binary named `wevtutil.exe` in the user-writable temporary folder.
  - During the reinstall process, the installer will execute the malicious binary in `SYSTEM` context.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - Local authenticated user access is required.
  - The attacker needs to be able to force a reinstall of Splashtop Streamer by having access to the original MSI or the location where it was executed originally.
