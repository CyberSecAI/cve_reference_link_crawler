- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An uncaught exception in Elasticsearch occurs when an encrypted PDF is passed to an attachment processor.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The attachment processor fails to handle encrypted PDFs, leading to an uncaught exception.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The Elasticsearch ingest node attempting to parse the encrypted PDF crashes, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted encrypted PDF to the Elasticsearch REST API via the attachment processor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the ability to send requests to the Elasticsearch REST API. They also need to be aware of which fields use the attachment processor and be able to craft a malicious PDF with encryption.
