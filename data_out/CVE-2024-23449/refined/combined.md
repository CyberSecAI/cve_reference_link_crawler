**Elasticsearch Uncaught Exception (ESA-2024-05)**

An uncaught exception in Elasticsearch >= 8.4.0 and < 8.11.1 occurs when an encrypted PDF is passed to an [attachment processor](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/attachment.html) through the REST API. The Elasticsearch ingest node that attempts to parse the PDF file will crash. This does not happen with password-protected PDF files or with unencrypted PDF files.

**Affected Versions:**

Affects versions >= 8.4.0 and < 8.11.1

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

The issue is resolved in version 8.11.1.

This requires the attachment processor to be enabled. Users unable to upgrade can ensure that the [attachment processor](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/attachment.html) is disabled.

**Severity:** CVSSv3: 4.3(Medium) - [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-23449
