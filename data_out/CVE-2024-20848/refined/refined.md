The provided document is a security bulletin from Samsung Mobile, detailing security updates and vulnerabilities addressed in their devices. While it doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2024-20848, it does contain information regarding **SVE-2023-2367 (CVE-2024-20848)**

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**CVE-2024-20848 (SVE-2023-2367):**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper input validation in the text parsing implementation of `libsdffextractor`.
*   **Weakness:**  The vulnerability lies in the way `libsdffextractor` parses text, specifically a failure to prevent integer overflows. This lack of validation can lead to writing data beyond the allocated memory buffer.
*   **Impact:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to write out-of-bounds memory, which can potentially lead to memory corruption.
*   **Attack Vector:** A local attacker.
*   **Required Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code locally on the device.
*   **Affected Versions:** Android 12, 13, and 14 are listed as affected.
*   **Mitigation:** The patch adds proper logic to prevent integer overflow.
*   **Disclosure Status:** Privately disclosed
*   **Reported On:** December 22, 2023
*   **Fixed in:** SMR Apr-2024 Release 1
