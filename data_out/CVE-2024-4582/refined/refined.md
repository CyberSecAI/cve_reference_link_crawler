  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Faraday Technology GM828x/GM8181 DVR devices contain a command injection vulnerability in the `ntp_srv` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "OS Command Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the device with the privileges of the NTP process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited via a network command protocol.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network commands to the device. The vulnerability is present in Internet-connected devices, meaning a remote attacker can exploit this."
