- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `RunSystemCmd` function executes commands with user-provided input (username and password) without proper sanitization, leading to command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Blind command injection: The vulnerability lies in the lack of input validation when handling user-provided username and password during the password change process. Specifically the username (`auStack1160`) and password (`auStack1096`) variables are directly passed to `RunSystemCmd` function.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Arbitrary command execution: Attackers can inject malicious commands into the username or password fields.
    - Full control over the device: Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute any command on the router, potentially gaining full control over it. This could include downloading malicious files via `wget`.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Malicious input: The attack vector is through the web interface or API used to change the router's username and password.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Network access: The attacker needs to be able to reach the router's web interface or API.
    - Basic understanding of command injection to craft the payload.
