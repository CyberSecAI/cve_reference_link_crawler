# Local Information Disclosure Vulnerability in Netty on Unix-Like systems due temporary files for Java 6 and lower in io.netty:netty-codec-http

Moderate

[normanmaurer](/normanmaurer)
published
GHSA-269q-hmxg-m83q
May 6, 2022

## Package

maven

netty-common
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<= 4.1.76.Final

## Patched versions

4.1.77.Final

## Description

### Description

[GHSA-5mcr-gq6c-3hq2](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-5mcr-gq6c-3hq2) ([CVE-2021-21290](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5mcr-gq6c-3hq2 "CVE-2021-21290")) contains an insufficient fix for the vulnerability identified.

### Impact

When netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled.

This only impacts applications running on Java version 6 and lower. Additionally, this vulnerability impacts code running on Unix-like systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they all share the system temporary directory between all users.

### Vulnerability Details

To fix the vulnerability the code was changed to the following:

```
    @SuppressJava6Requirement(reason = "Guarded by version check")
    public static File createTempFile(String prefix, String suffix, File directory) throws IOException {
        if (javaVersion() >= 7) {
            if (directory == null) {
                return Files.createTempFile(prefix, suffix).toFile();
            }
            return Files.createTempFile(directory.toPath(), prefix, suffix).toFile();
        }
        if (directory == null) {
            return File.createTempFile(prefix, suffix);
        }
        File file = File.createTempFile(prefix, suffix, directory);
        // Try to adjust the perms, if this fails there is not much else we can do...
        file.setReadable(false, false);
        file.setReadable(true, true);
        return file;
    }
```

Unfortunately, this logic path was left vulnerable:

```
        if (directory == null) {
            return File.createTempFile(prefix, suffix);
        }
```

This file is still readable by all local users.

### Patches

Update to 4.1.77.Final

### Workarounds

Specify your own `java.io.tmpdir` when you start the JVM or use `DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)` to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user or update to Java 7 or above.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
