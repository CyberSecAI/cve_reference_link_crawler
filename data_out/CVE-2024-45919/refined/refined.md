Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is an **Improper Access Control** in the `SetAction` endpoint of the Solvait application, specifically related to leave requests. The application doesn't properly validate if a user is authorized to change the status of a leave request, allowing manipulation of request IDs and action types.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to directly reference and manipulate the approval status of any leave request by knowing its Request ID. The application does not properly verify that the user is authorized to modify the request.
*   **Lack of Authorization Checks:** The system lacks proper checks to ensure that only managers can approve or change the status of leave requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can escalate their privileges by approving their own leave requests or any other user's requests, bypassing the intended approval process.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers may gain unauthorized access to resources or approvals, potentially leading to fraudulent activities.
*   **Compromised Integrity:** The vulnerability compromises the integrity of the approval process, undermining trust in the system's security.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious POST request to the `/AssignToMe/SetAction` endpoint, manipulating parameters like `ReqNum`, `RequestId`, and `ActionTypeRequest`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a regular employee with a valid account in the Solvait system to initiate a leave request and obtain a request ID.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker must know the structure of the vulnerable request parameters and the endpoint URL.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to use tools to craft and send POST requests, such as cURL, Postman, or a browserâ€™s developer tools.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was tested on version 24.4.2 of Solvait.
*   The specific endpoint affected is `https://<domain>/AssignToMe/SetAction`.
*   The parameters susceptible to manipulation are: `ReqNum`, `TableName`, `ActionTypeRequest`, `Comment`, `RequestId`, `WordkerId`, and `DelegateUserId`.
* The attack involves crafting a POST request to `/AssignToMe/SetAction` with the manipulated parameters to force an approval of the request.
