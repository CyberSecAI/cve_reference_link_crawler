Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46677:

**Verification:**
The provided content from `fluidattacks.com` directly references CVE-2023-46677 and provides details about the vulnerability. The other provided document is unrelated and is ignored.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input validation in the `sign-up.php` resource. Specifically, the `txt_uname` parameter, which is intended to be the user's username, is not sanitized or validated before being inserted into the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Because the input from `txt_uname` is inserted directly into an SQL query without sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive data stored in the database including user credentials, potentially leading to a significant data breach.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** Beyond data retrieval, the attacker might be able to modify or delete data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some circumstances, a successful SQL injection could lead to further compromise and privilege escalation within the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to `sign-up.php` with a malicious payload in the `txt_uname` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote and Unauthenticated:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without requiring any prior authentication.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL:**  A basic understanding of SQL is necessary to craft a successful SQL injection payload.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet is:

```php
$uname = strip_tags($_POST['txt_uname']);
$upass = strip_tags($_POST['txt_upass']);
$pic=$_FILES["img"]["name"];
...
$sql= mysqli_query($con,"insert into registration(name,email,image,password) values('$uname','$umail','$pic','$upass')");
```

- The code uses `strip_tags`, which is intended to remove HTML tags. However, this function does not protect against SQL injection, as it does not remove or escape special characters that are used in SQL syntax.
- The variable `$uname` is then directly embedded into the SQL query, creating a vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

- The content indicates that the vendor is `Projectworlds Pvt. Limited` and the product is `Online Job Portal v1.0`.
- The `fluidattacks.com` document also mentions a related vulnerability `CVE-2023-46679` which occurs in `index.php` related to the parameter `txt_uname_email`.
- There is no patch available at the time of writing the document.
- The CVSS v3 score for this vulnerability is 9.8, which is critical.
