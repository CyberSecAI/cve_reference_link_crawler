Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `delete-mark.php` script of the SourceCodester Interactive Map App 1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (specifically the `mark` parameter) before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromise of the application:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Data Access:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Data Modification:** An attacker could modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Exploit database vulnerabilities**: The attacker can leverage the vulnerability to exploit underlying database vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `delete-mark.php` script, specifically the `mark` parameter within the URL.
*   The vulnerable URL is `http://localhost/interactive-map-marker/endpoint/delete-mark.php?mark=7`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application, and specifically needs to be able to modify the URL parameter `mark`.
*  No prior authentication seems to be required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is confirmed by a submission to VulDB which is marked as "accepted".
*   The vulnerable code is mentioned to exist in a repository on Github: `https://github.com/BurakSevben/CVEs/blob/main/Interactive%20Map%20App/Interactive%20Map%20App%20-%20SQL%20Injection.md`
