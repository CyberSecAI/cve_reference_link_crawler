Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-29886:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of an older, less secure password hashing algorithm in the `serverpod_auth_server` module. The old algorithm was susceptible to rainbow attacks if the database was compromised.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Password Hashing:** The primary weakness was the use of a password hashing algorithm that did not provide adequate protection against offline attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromised User Credentials:** If an attacker gains access to the database containing password hashes, they could potentially use rainbow attacks to recover the original passwords. This would allow the attacker to impersonate legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Database Compromise:** The main attack vector is gaining unauthorized access to the database containing the stored password hashes. Once the database is compromised, an attacker could attempt offline password cracking using rainbow tables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Database Access:** The attacker needs to gain access to the database where the user password hashes are stored.
*   **Technical Skills:** The attacker needs knowledge of rainbow table attacks and how to utilize them.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is mitigated by switching to the more secure Argon2Id password hashing algorithm.
*   **Migration Strategy:** The `serverpod_auth_server` module provides a method (`Emails.migrateLegacyPasswordHashes`) to migrate existing legacy password hashes to the new algorithm. The migration process is designed to be idempotent and can be implemented as a web server route or during server startup.
*   **Tandem Authentication:** During the migration, the system calculates password hashes using both the old and new algorithms. Upon successful authentication, the stored hash is updated to use only the new algorithm.
*   **Affected Versions:**  All versions of `serverpod_auth_server` before `1.2.6` are affected.
*  **Patch:** Upgrading to version `1.2.6` resolves the issue.
