- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Privilege Escalation issue in the HUSKY plugin for WordPress.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin has an identification and authentication failure that allows for privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor with low-level privileges could escalate their account to a higher privilege level, potentially gaining full control of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin itself, as the vulnerability exists within its code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have a low-privileged account (e.g. Shop manager) on the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
