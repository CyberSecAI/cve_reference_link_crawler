# Path Traversal

Moderate

## Package

npm

@jasonraimondi/url-to-png
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<2.1.0

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

I was trying to add a `BLOCK_LIST` feature when I noticed we don't sanitize the `ImageId` in the code, which leads to path traversal vulnerability. Now, this is different from our traditional path traversal issue, because as of NOW I can store the image in any place arbitrarily, and given enough time I might be able to come up with a working exploit BUT for the time being I am reporting this.

### Details

We are not sanitizing the `ImageID` as in not removing special chars from the params [(extract\_query\_params.ts#l75)](https://github.com/jasonraimondi/url-to-png/blob/e43098e0af3a380ebc044e7f303a83933b94b434/src/middlewares/extract_query_params.ts#L75)

```
const imageId = dateString + "." + slugify(validData.url) +configToString(params);
```

This when fed to other parts of the code such as ([filesystem.ts#L34](https://github.com/jasonraimondi/url-to-png/blob/8afc00247c1d7e6c7b37356a5f6282b486e596fa/src/lib/storage/filesystem.ts#L34))

```
return path.join(this.storagePath, imageId) + ".png";
```

Would result in path traversal issue.

### PoC

```
# Configuration for filesystem storage provider (optional)
STORAGE_PROVIDER=filesystem
IMAGE_STORAGE_PATH=poc

```

Set this in your `.env` file and use this as your payload.

```
http://localhost:3089/?url=http://example.com&width=400&isDarkMode=../../../../../../../../../../../../tmp/hack

```

This will create a `.png` file in the `/tmp` section of the system.

Loom POC: <https://www.loom.com/share/bd7b306cdae7445c97e68f0626e743a6>

This is valid for pretty much all the arguments (except for numeric values)

A simple fix would be to use the `slugify` for the params as well like so ([#L75](https://github.com/jasonraimondi/url-to-png/blob/e43098e0af3a380ebc044e7f303a83933b94b434/src/middlewares/extract_query_params.ts#L75))

```
- const imageId = dateString + "." + slugify(validData.url) + configToString(params);
+ const imageId = dateString + "." + slugify(validData.url) + slugify(configToString(params));
```
### Impact

This would be path traversal vulnerability which allows arbitrary write as of now.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-39918

### Weaknesses

[CWE-23](/advisories?query=cwe%3A23)
