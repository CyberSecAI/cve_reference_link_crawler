```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application does not sanitize the `ImageId` generated from user-supplied parameters, which results in a path traversal vulnerability. Specifically, the `configToString` function was not sanitized before being used in the file path.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Path traversal (CWE-23), leading to arbitrary file write.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the server's filesystem by manipulating the `url`, `width`, and `isDarkMode` parameters.
- Attack vectors: By crafting a URL with path traversal sequences in the query parameters, an attacker can control the destination where the generated image file is saved.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server with crafted query parameters.
