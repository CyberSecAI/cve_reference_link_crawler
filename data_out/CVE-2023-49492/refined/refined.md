Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `imgstick` and `v` parameters within the `select_images.php` file of DedeCMS-V5.7.111.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application reflects unsanitized input from the `imgstick` and `v` URL parameters directly into the HTML output. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking: Stealing cookies to gain unauthorized access to the user's account.
    *   Data theft: Accessing sensitive information within the application.
    *   Defacement: Modifying the content displayed on the page.
    *   Malware distribution: Redirecting users to malicious websites or initiating downloads.
    * The provided proof of concept demonstrates this by executing an `alert(document.cookie)` which in a real scenario could be any malicious JS code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the vulnerable parameters (`imgstick` or `v`) and tricks a user (typically an administrator in this context) into clicking on the link. This could be achieved via phishing.
* The vulnerable parameters are `imgstick` and `v` in `select_images.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL with the XSS payload in the vulnerable parameters.
*   The attacker needs to be able to get a victim (likely an admin) to click the crafted URL.

**Technical Details:**
* Vulnerable parameters: `imgstick` and `v`
* Vulnerable file: `select_images.php`
* Vulnerable version: DedeCMS-V5.7.111
* The `activepath` may vary depending on the site configuration and whether it runs in the uploads directory
