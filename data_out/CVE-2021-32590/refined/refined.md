- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command (CWE-89).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerabilities are present in FortiPortal.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with regular user privileges can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying SQL database via crafted HTTP requests. This could lead to unauthorized code or command execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Specifically crafted HTTP requests are used to exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have regular user privileges on FortiPortal to exploit these vulnerabilities.
