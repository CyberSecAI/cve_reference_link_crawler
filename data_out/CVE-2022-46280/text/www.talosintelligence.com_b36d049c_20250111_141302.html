# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1670

## Open Babel PQS format pFormat uninitialized pointer dereference vulnerability

##### July 21, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-46280

##### SUMMARY

A use of uninitialized pointer vulnerability exists in the PQS format pFormat functionality of Open Babel 3.1.1 and master commit 530dbfa3. A specially crafted malformed file can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Open Babel 3.1.1

Open Babel master commit 530dbfa3

##### PRODUCT URLS

Open Babel - <https://openbabel.org/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

9.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-824 - Access of Uninitialized Pointer

##### DETAILS

Open Babel is a popular library for converting chemical file formats, currently supporting about 130 different file formats. It implements bindings for several programming languages. Because of the nature of the library, and since there are many online chemical format converters and molecule viewers which might be using Open Babel in their backend for parsing and conversion, we consider this software as potentially accessible via network.

Open Babel ships a simple converter application called `obabel` that can be used to trigger the issue described in this advisory. `obabel` supports `-i` and `-o` parameters, which select the input and output formats to perform the conversion. `obabel` supports multiple input and output files (as does the Open Babel library itself): this technically allows multiple vulnerabilities to trigger in sequence, which in turn could make some vulnerabilities easier to exploit. In this advisory, however, we focus on only one input file and a corresponding output file.

When a single input file and output file are supplied, `obabel.cpp` records the input and output formats (if supplied) and calls `OBConversion::FullConvert` in `obconversion.cpp`. Inside this function, there’s a call to `OpenAndSetFormat`, which uses `FormatFromExt` to derive the input format from the filename extension if no `-i` parameter was supplied. Similarly, `OpenInAndOutFiles` can be used to derive both input and output formats from the filename extensions when none are supplied.

Depending on how the `obabel` application is invoked, different paths could actually take place. Eventually, `pInFormat` and `pOutFormat` (of base class `OBFormat`) objects are allocated, which are instances of the classes that implement the selected input and output formats.

The code then proceeds with a call to `OBConversion::Convert`, which eventually leads to calling `pInFormat->ReadMolecule` and `pOutFormat->WriteMolecule`.

In this advisory, we describe an issue in the “Parallel Quantum Solutions” (`PQS`) file format (`formats/PQSformat.cpp.cpp`) when parsing an input file via `ReadMolecule`.

```
    bool PQSFormat::ReadMolecule(OBBase* pOb, OBConversion* pConv)
    {
      ...
[1]   const char* title = pConv->GetTitle();

[2]   char buffer[BUFF_SIZE];
      char coord_file[256];
      char full_coord_path[256]="\0";
      ifstream coordFileStream;
      ...
[3]   while (!geom_found && ifs.getline(buffer,BUFF_SIZE))
        {
          lowerit(buffer);      //look for geom except in title or text
          if (strstr(buffer, "geom") != nullptr &&
              (strncmp(buffer,"text",4)!=0 && strncmp(buffer,"titl",4)!=0))
            {
              ...
[4]           if (strstr(buffer, "file=") != nullptr)
                {  //external geometry file
[5]               strncpy(coord_file,strstr(buffer,"file=")+5, sizeof(coord_file));
                  coord_file[sizeof(coord_file) - 1] = '\0';
                  if (strrchr(coord_file, ' ') != nullptr)
                    *strrchr(coord_file,' ')='\0';
                  if (coord_file[0]!='/')
                    {
                      strncpy(full_coord_path,title, sizeof(full_coord_path));
                      full_coord_path[sizeof(full_coord_path)-1] = '\0';
                      if (strrchr(full_coord_path, '/') != nullptr)
                        *(strrchr(full_coord_path,'/')+1)='\0';
                      else
                        full_coord_path[0] = '\0';
                    }
[6]               strcat(full_coord_path,coord_file);
                  full_coord_path[sizeof(full_coord_path) - 1] = '\0';
                  stringstream errorMsg;
                  errorMsg <<"External geometry file referenced: "<< \
                    full_coord_path<<endl;
                  obErrorLog.ThrowError(__FUNCTION__, errorMsg.str(), obInfo);

```

At [1], the `title` of the file is retrieved (this corresponds to the filename of the input file). Then, for each line in the input file [3], if the line contains the string “file=”, the condition at [4] matches. At [5] the coordinates file path is built, depending on what comes after “file=” (set to `coord_file`). If `coord_file` is a relative path, it is concatenated to the directory path of the input file, and the result is stored in `full_coord_path` [6]. If `coord_file` is an absolute path, `full_coord_path` is simply set to `coord_file`.

```
                  ...
[7]               coordFileStream.open(full_coord_path);
                  if (!coordFileStream)
                    {
                      obErrorLog.ThrowError(__FUNCTION__, "Cannot read external geometry file!", obError);
                      return(false);
                      //                    exit (-1);
                    }
                  else
[8]                 {
                      ifs.seekg(0, ios::end); //move .inp file pointer to the end of file

                      //New framework mods
                      OBConversion coordconv(&coordFileStream);
[9]                   OBFormat* pFormat;
                      if (strstr(buffer, "=car" ) != nullptr)
                        pFormat =OBConversion::FindFormat("BIOSYM");
                      if (strstr(buffer, "=hin" ) != nullptr)
                        pFormat = OBConversion::FindFormat("HIN");
                      if (strstr(buffer, "=pdb" ) != nullptr)
                        pFormat = OBConversion::FindFormat("PDB");
                      if (strstr(buffer, "=mop" ) != nullptr)
                        pFormat = OBConversion::FindFormat("MOPAC");
[10]                  return pFormat->ReadMolecule(&mol,&coordconv);

```

`full_coord_path` is then opened [7], and if the open succeeds (it will succeed with any user-readable file or directory), we enter the block at [8].

At [9], a `pFormat` is declared but not initialized. Then, a series of conditions try to match strings within the current line, setting `pFormat` accordingly. Finally [10] `pFormat` is used to call `ReadMolecule` with the proper format conversion function. The issue is that, if none of the conditions between [9] and [10] succeed, `pFormat` will be uninitialized, and at [10] an uninitialized pointer dereference will happen.

As `ReadMolecule` is a virtual function referenced from `pFormat`, this allows direct control of the control flow. The pointer is stored on the stack, and, depending on how the code is compiled and the stack is laid out, the pointer could be under full control of an attacker, who could in turn use this to execute arbitrary code.
