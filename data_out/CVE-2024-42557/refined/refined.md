Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Hotel Management System application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The application lacks proper CSRF protection mechanisms for the `/admin_modify_room.php` endpoint. This means it doesn't verify if the request originated from a legitimate user session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially modify room booking details on the application by tricking an authenticated user into submitting a forged request.
- This could lead to unauthorized changes to bookings, impacting the availability of rooms and causing disruptions.
- The provided analysis indicates that the exploitation leads to an escalation of privileges (likely admin user modifying the room details).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a malicious website or email that contains a crafted HTML form.
- This form, when loaded by an authenticated user in their browser, will submit a forged request to the vulnerable `/admin_modify_room.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host or inject the malicious HTML code.
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to visit the malicious page. The user needs to be already authenticated to the Hotel Management System application.
- The attacker doesn't need to directly interact with the application server to carry out the attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided PoC shows a form that modifies the "book_id" and "checkout" fields. This example, if successfully executed by an authenticated admin user, would lead to changing the details of booking #10017 to checkout on 2024-07-20.
- The vulnerable code is identified in the commit <= 91caab8e505a1791780594d23408fb31fcc272cc of the Hotel-Management-System GitHub repository.
