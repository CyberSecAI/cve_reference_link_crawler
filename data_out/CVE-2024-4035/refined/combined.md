### Description

The Photo Gallery – GT3 Image Gallery & Gutenberg Block Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via image alt text in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.7.21 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
