Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-4035:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the Photo Gallery â€“ GT3 Image Gallery & Gutenberg Block Gallery WordPress plugin. Specifically, the image alt text was not properly sanitized before being output in the HTML, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that are then stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.
- Improper Input Sanitization: The plugin fails to sanitize user-provided image alt text, allowing for the inclusion of potentially malicious HTML/JavaScript code.
- Insufficient Output Escaping: The plugin does not properly escape the image alt text when rendering it on the page, allowing injected scripts to be executed by the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:
- Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- Potentially steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information.
- Deface the website or redirect users to malicious sites.
- Perform actions on behalf of a user if they are logged in.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the image alt text field within the WordPress plugin's functionality.
- An attacker would need to be authenticated with author-level privileges or higher.
- The injected script is triggered when a user visits a page that includes the affected gallery.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with at least author-level access to the WordPress site.
- They must be able to upload images and modify their alt text within the affected plugin.
- No direct user interaction is required other than viewing the page with the malicious payload.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.7.7.22 of the plugin by implementing proper output escaping using `esc_attr()` on the image alt attribute.
- The provided code diff highlights the specific change where the alt attribute is now properly escaped.
