Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the insecure inclusion of files within the `/index.php` page. The application uses a user-controlled parameter `page` from the GET request to include files without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application directly includes files specified in the `page` parameter. The application does not sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to manipulate the file path and include arbitrary files.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** There's no validation or sanitization of the `page` parameter, making it vulnerable to path traversal.
- **Use of PHP Wrapper:**  The vulnerability is exploited using the `php://filter` wrapper to read the content of PHP files by base64 encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Reading:** An attacker can read the source code of any PHP file on the server. This could expose sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or other application secrets.
- **Information Disclosure:** Reading source code may provide further insights into the application's logic which can be used for more advanced attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:**  The attacker crafts a GET request to `/index.php` with a malicious `page` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
<?php $page = isset($_GET['page']) ? $_GET['page'] :'home'; ?>
<?php include $page.'.php' ?>
```

The attacker leverages the `php://filter` wrapper in combination with base64 encoding to read the content of the PHP files. Example payload: `php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index`
