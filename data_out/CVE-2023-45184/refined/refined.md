- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure storage of passwords by allowing the password encryption key to be retrieved.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure password storage. The encryption key can be retrieved.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows an attacker to retrieve the password encryption key, potentially leading to the decryption of stored passwords.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not detailed, but it involves exploiting the mechanism used to store or protect the password encryption key.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the capability to retrieve the encryption key. The exact method is not specified in the provided content.
