The provided content is related to CVE-2023-37935.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the GET request method with sensitive query strings within the FortiOS SSL VPN component.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Plaintext credentials in GET requests: Sensitive data, such as usernames and passwords for remote services (e.g., RDP, VNC), are included directly in the URL query string of GET requests. This is a violation of secure data handling practices.
- Exposure of sensitive data in logs/caches: GET requests are often logged by web servers, stored in browser history, or cached by intermediate devices (proxies, etc), leading to potential exposure of the plaintext credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: Attackers who gain access to the GET requests (from logs, referers, caches, etc.) can view the plaintext passwords for remote services.
- Possible lateral movement: Gaining access to remote service passwords may enable an attacker to compromise other machines/services within the network.

**Attack vectors:**
- Reading server logs: An attacker with access to server logs can retrieve the plaintext credentials from the logged GET requests.
- Accessing browser history or caches: An attacker who has access to the victim's browser history or caches may be able to recover the GET requests containing credentials.
- Interception: Network attackers might intercept the requests during transit, although this is less likely given the use of SSL/TLS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to GET requests: The attacker needs access to the GET requests that contain the plaintext credentials. This may involve access to server logs, browser history, caches, or other network monitoring positions.
- Low-privilege access: The attacker could be a low-privileged user within the network (i.e., an employee) with access to the information.
