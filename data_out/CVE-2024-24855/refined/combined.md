| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=8149#c0)  Shiloong   admin  2024-02-01 17:16:12 UTC  ``` 上报人信息：   - 白家驹 <baijiaju@buaa.edu.cn>   - 北京航空航天大学网络空间安全学院  成因： phba->fcf.fcf_flag的写操作需要spinlock phba->hbalock保护，lpfc_unregister_fcf_rescan函数中phba->fcf.fcf_flag = 0语句没有被对应的spinlock保护，可以发生关于phba->fcf.fcf_flag的数据竞争。  	 危害： bug触发后，phba->fcf.fcf_flag的置0操作可能被覆盖，phba->fcf.fcf_flag用于记录HBA FCF状态，是lpfc模块的核心变量，决定了驱动函数行为，置0操作被覆盖会导致如lpfc_linkdown、lpfc_work_done等函数发生错误，导致lpfc功能异常，可以用于拒绝服务，甚至触发双重释放等严重的内存问题。   缓解：    -  把lpfc_unregister_fcf_rescan函数中的phba->fcf.fcf_flag |= FCF_INIT_DISC语句两侧添加相应的spin_lock，防止数据竞争。  修复： 补丁已提交给Linux Kernel并被接收，补丁链接：<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=0e881c0a4b6146b7e856735226208f48251facd8> ``` |  |
