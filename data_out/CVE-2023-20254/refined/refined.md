- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient user session management within the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authorization bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain access to another tenant's information, make configuration changes, or potentially cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by taking a tenant offline.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted request to an affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated, remote user. The multi-tenant feature must be enabled on the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager instance.
