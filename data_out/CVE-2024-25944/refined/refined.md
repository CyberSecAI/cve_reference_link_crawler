- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Path traversal vulnerability in Dell OpenManage Enterprise.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when accessing files on the server's file system. This allows a malicious actor to use path traversal sequences (e.g., "../") to navigate outside the intended directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker could gain unauthorized access to files stored on the server's filesystem, with the privileges of the running web application. This could lead to sensitive data disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated attacker on the same network as the vulnerable Dell OpenManage Enterprise instance.
