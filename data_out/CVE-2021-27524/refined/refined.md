The provided content is related to CVE-2021-27524.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `braft-editor` is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in the `Embed/index.jsx` component. This function directly renders user-provided input without sanitization, allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Improper input sanitization.
- Use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with user-controlled input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the application.
- This can lead to stealing user cookies.

**Attack vectors:**
- Injecting a crafted HTML element (e.g., `<img/src=1 onerror=alert(1)>`) into the editor through the embed media element.
- The malicious HTML is rendered by `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to interact with the `braft-editor`'s interface.
- Capability to input text or HTML.
