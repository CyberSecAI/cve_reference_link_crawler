# PAM module may allow accessing with the credentials of another user

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 0.3.5

## Patched versions

0.3.5

## Description

Authd PAM module up to version 0.3.4 can allow broker-managed users to impersonate any other user managed by the same broker and perform any PAM operation with it, including authenticating as them.

This is possible using tools such as `su`, `sudo` or `ssh` (and potentially others) that, so far, do not ensure that the PAM user at the end of the transaction is matching the one who initiated the transaction.

Authd 0.3.5 fixes this by not allowing changing the user unless it was never set before in the PAM stack.

`su` version that will include [util-linux/util-linux#3206](https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/pull/3206) will not be affected

`ssh` version that will include [openssh/openssh-portable#521](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/521) will not be affected

`sudo` version that will include [sudo-project/sudo#412](https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo/pull/412) will not be affected

`login` not affected

`passwd` not affected

Old report
### Summary

An user can access as another user using its own credentials

### Details

I feel we’ve a security issue that is due to the fact that we allow changing the user in the cases in which that’s already provided by PAM, I’ve not tested this using the entra-id broker but it’s reproducible with the example one, but unless I’m missing something it should be independent from the broker in use.

Basically, by going to the user selection page we allow to login as any user by entering the use own credentials.

See for example: <https://asciinema.org/a/VIcjpDImomaGu0wxsJJxNdmlf> or <https://asciinema.org/a/CV3D1gaEhn2yclqSMKCnifYPo>

Basically it’s possible to logging in as `user1` using the credentials of `user2` or `user3`.

The issue doesn’t affect login or passwd, but it does affect `su` and `sshd`, since in both cases they don’t check if the `PAM_USER` changed before the final authentication.

Now, while those tools should likely be fixed to only read the PAM\_USER once pam gave them the final ok, I think authd should not allow changing the user at all when it has been provided by PAM.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
