Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the `serverMServerAdmin.asmx` function of OpenPetra v.2023.02. Specifically, the `tab` parameter in the URL is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input in the `tab` parameter of the `serverMServerAdmin.asmx` function. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Stealing:** An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the `tab` parameter, which can then be executed in the context of a victim's browser when they hover over a specific element on the page. This code can steal the victim's cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking and unauthorized access to the user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The attack vector is through crafting a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload in the `tab` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker doesn't need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker must be able to create URLs with malicious payloads.
- **Social Engineering (or similar):**  The attacker would need the victim to visit the crafted URL, and then hover over a specific part of the page for the payload to execute.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `tab` parameter in the URL `http://target.com/api/serverMServerAdmin.asmx?bnd=TMServerAdminWebServiceSoap&op=TServerAdminWebConnector_LoginServerAdmin&page=op&tab=x" onmouseover=alert(document.cookie) x="`
- **XSS Payload Example:** `x" onmouseover=alert(document.cookie) x="`
- **Trigger:** Hovering the mouse over the left index item triggers the injected JavaScript.
