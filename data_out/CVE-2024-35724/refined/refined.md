Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Broken Access Control issue. This means there's a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The plugin lacks proper checks to ensure users have the necessary permissions to perform certain actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unprivileged user (subscriber) could potentially perform actions they are not authorized to do. The specific impact will vary depending on the vulnerable function, but it could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is likely exploited through direct interaction with the vulnerable function within the WordPress plugin, without proper permission checks.
*   The exact attack vector would depend on the specific function and how it was intended to be used, but it involves using the functionality without the intended access level.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with "subscriber" privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is considered to have a low severity and is unlikely to be exploited.
*   A virtual patch is available from Patchstack to mitigate the issue.
*   The plugin version affected is <= 1.0.12, and the issue is fixed in version 1.0.13.
