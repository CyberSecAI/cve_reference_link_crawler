The provided content describes a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability, which is related to CVE-2024-22722.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application uses the Twig template engine, and the 'group name' input field in the 'add form' section does not sanitize user-supplied data before processing it with the template engine. This allows an attacker to inject template syntax which is then executed by the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the server
- Potential for stealing sensitive data
- Server compromise
- Full control over the server environment

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload using Twig template syntax, injecting it into the 'group name' input field, accessible through the 'add form' section of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator to access the vulnerable functionality.
- The attacker needs to identify the input field where SSTI is possible (the 'group name' field).
