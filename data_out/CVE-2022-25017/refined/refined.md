{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied data in the dynamic DNS service configuration logic.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command injection (CWE-77)",
    "Denial of service (CWE-400)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Execution of arbitrary OS commands with root privileges, potentially leading to full system compromise. It can also cause a denial of service by injecting a continuous command that renders the router unstable and unable to handle HTTP requests. The injected command persists after a restart, requiring a hard factory reset to recover.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP requests to the web interface (specifically the 'Device/DDNS' endpoint).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be authenticated for web access to the router to exploit this vulnerability. They need to be able to send crafted HTTP PUT requests."
