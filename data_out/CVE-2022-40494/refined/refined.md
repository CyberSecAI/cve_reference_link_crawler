- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an authentication bypass due to the way the `auth_key` and `timestamp` parameters are handled in the nps web API. The `auth_key` in the configuration file is commented out by default, making it empty, and the system relies on the `timestamp` to generate the `auth_key` on the fly.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect access control, authentication bypass
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can gain access to proxy information and control traffic by bypassing authentication. They can access the nps web interface and potentially control the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed remotely by sending requests with the generated `auth_key` and `timestamp` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target nps server and be able to calculate the correct auth_key based on the current timestamp. No special access or privileges are required.
