Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1644

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw in SuiteCRM. The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input when constructing file paths, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary local files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The core issue is the ability to include local files via user-controlled input. Specifically, the `LegacyRedirectHandler.php` extracts the path from the request, and this path is directly used in a require statement in `index.php` without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):**  By including a malicious PHP file, an attacker can achieve RCE on the server. The provided text describes a scenario where an attacker uploads a malicious image containing PHP code and then uses the LFI to include the image, leading to code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request that includes a path to a malicious file that will be used by the vulnerable `require` statement. The path is taken from the request URL path.
- **File Upload:** An attacker can upload a malicious file (e.g., a PHP file disguised as an image) to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have at least minimal privileges within the SuiteCRM application to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable path:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL path.
- **Ability to Upload Malicious File:** The attacker needs to upload a malicious file.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is located in the following files and functions:

- `index.php`: The entry point, which includes the vulnerable `require` statement.
- `Kernel.php`: Handles legacy routing
- `LegacyRouteHandler.php`: Handles legacy non-view actions.
- `LegacyRedirectHandler.php`: Extracts the URL path.

The vulnerable code path is:

1.  `index.php` retrieves the legacy route from `Kernel.php`.
2.  `Kernel.php` retrieves the legacy route from `LegacyRouteHandler.php`.
3.  `LegacyRouteHandler.php` retrieves the include file from `LegacyRedirectHandler.php`.
4.  `LegacyRedirectHandler.php` extracts a file path from the request and returns it to `index.php`.
5.  `index.php` then includes the file specified by the extracted path using `require`.

This chain allows an attacker to control the included file by controlling the request path.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided text mentions that there is currently no patch available for this vulnerability in version 7.14.2 of SuiteCRM.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Fluid Attacks' Offensive Team.
- The CVSS v3.1 base score is 9.9, indicating a critical vulnerability.
