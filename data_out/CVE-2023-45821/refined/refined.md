  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `registryIsDockerHub` function incorrectly checked if a registry domain was a Docker Hub registry by only verifying if the domain ended with `docker.io`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect input validation",
      "Insufficient verification of registry domain"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could purchase a domain ending with `docker.io` and deploy a fake OCI registry on it. If Artifact Hub was configured to use credentials to access the Docker Hub, those credentials could be sent to the attacker's fake registry, potentially allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access or perform other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to purchase a domain name ending in `docker.io` and deploy a fake OCI registry on it. The attacker also needs a low level of privileges and no user interaction is required for exploitation."
