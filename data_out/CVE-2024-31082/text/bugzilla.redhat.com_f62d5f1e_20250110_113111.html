This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2271999#c0)  TEJ RATHI    2024-03-28 04:27:03 UTC  ``` The ProcAppleDRICreatePixmap() function uses the byte-swapped length of the return data for the amount of data to return to the client, if the client has a different endianness than the X server. This function is only found in the Xquartz server for MacOS systems, and not in Xwayland, Xorg, or any other X servers.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2271999#c1)  Sandipan Roy    2024-04-04 08:21:34 UTC  ``` Created tigervnc tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2273331](show_bug.cgi?id=2273331 "CLOSED EOL - TRIAGE CVE-2024-31082 tigervnc: xorg-x11-server: Heap buffer overread/data leakage in ProcAppleDRICreatePixmap [fedora-all]")]   Created xorg-x11-server tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2273329](show_bug.cgi?id=2273329 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - TRIAGE CVE-2024-31082 xorg-x11-server: Heap buffer overread/data leakage in ProcAppleDRICreatePixmap [fedora-all]")]   Created xorg-x11-server-Xwayland tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2273330](show_bug.cgi?id=2273330 "CLOSED EOL - TRIAGE CVE-2024-31082 xorg-x11-server-Xwayland: xorg-x11-server: Heap buffer overread/data leakage in ProcAppleDRICreatePixmap [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |
