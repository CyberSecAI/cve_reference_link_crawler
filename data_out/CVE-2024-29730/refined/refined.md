**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability within the SportsNET application. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the `/app/ax/consejoRandom/` endpoint, where the `idCat` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:
- Retrieve sensitive information from the database.
- Update existing records in the database.
- Delete records from the database.
In short, the attacker can potentially fully compromise the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- The attack vector is a specially crafted SQL query within the `idCat` parameter of the `/app/ax/consejoRandom/` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated (PR:N).
- The attacker needs network access to the application (AV:N).
- The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
