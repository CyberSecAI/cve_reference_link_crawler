Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-45801

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a combination of two weaknesses:
    1.  Malicious HTML using special nesting techniques can bypass the depth checking mechanism implemented in DOMPurify.
    2.  Prototype pollution could be used to weaken the depth check, making it ineffective.
- This combination could allow attackers to bypass DOMPurify's sanitization and execute Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Bypass of Depth Checking:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the depth-checking mechanism implemented to prevent excessive nesting, which can lead to mXSS.
- **Prototype Pollution:** The vulnerability is further exacerbated by the ability to use prototype pollution to weaken the depth check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **XSS Attack:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to inject and execute malicious scripts in the context of the vulnerable application, leading to XSS.
- **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability**: Specifically, this can result in a low impact to confidentiality, high impact to integrity and low impact to availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is via the network, meaning the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is considered high.
- The attacker needs to craft specific malicious HTML with special nesting techniques and possibly use prototype pollution to weaken the depth check

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Versions:** Versions of `dompurify` prior to 2.5.4 and 3.1.3 are affected.
- **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in versions 2.5.4 and 3.1.3 of `dompurify`.
- **Fix Commit:** The fix was implemented in commit [1e52026](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/commit/1e520262bf4c66b5efda49e2316d6d1246ca7b21) (3.x branch) and [26e1d69](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/commit/26e1d69ca7f769f5c558619d644d90dd8bf26ebc) (2.x branch).
- **CWE:** CWE-1321
