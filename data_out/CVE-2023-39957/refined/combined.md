| [@mahibi](https://github.com/mahibi) Hello, I saw this path traversal vulnerability and its fix. It seems to be a little problematic, because getCanonicalPath returns a path string that is not terminated with a slash, which means that external input may still be copied to siblings of cacheDir, rather than just its children, such as "data/data/package/cachexxxx" <https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/java/java-partial-path-traversal/> |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
