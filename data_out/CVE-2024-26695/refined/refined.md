{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) platform device can be shut down with a null `psp_master` pointer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A null pointer dereference can lead to a general protection fault and a system crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be triggered during device shutdown, e.g., when using `DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE`.",
      "The vulnerability can be triggered by shutting down the SEV platform device with a null psp_master"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to trigger a device shutdown with a null `psp_master` pointer, which could be achieved through actions that force the device removal, such as `DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE`."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The fix involves adding a check for a null `psp_master` pointer and a null `sev_data` pointer before dereferencing them in the `__sev_platform_shutdown_locked` function."
