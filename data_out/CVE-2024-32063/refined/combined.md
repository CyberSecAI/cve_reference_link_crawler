SSA-976324: Multiple IGS File Parsing Vulnerabilities in PS/IGES Parasolid Translator Component before V27.1.215

| Publication Date: | 2024-05-14 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-05-14 |
| Current Version: | V1.0 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.8 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 7.3 |

SUMMARY

PS/IGES Parasolid Translator Component contains multiple file parsing vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the application reads files in IGS file formats. If a user is tricked to open a malicious file with any of the affected products, this could lead the application to crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

Siemens has released a new version for PS/IGES Parasolid Translator Component and recommends to update to the latest version.
