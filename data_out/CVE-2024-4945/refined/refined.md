Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `view_parcel.php` file of the "Best courier management system project in php" version 1.0.
- The PHP code dynamically executes user-controlled code through the `$_Variable` element. Specifically, the "id" parameter in the `view_parcel.php` file is not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of input sanitization on the "id" parameter allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access and Data Extraction:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database and extract sensitive information.
- **Database Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation can lead to attackers obtaining database privileges.
- **Server Host Compromise:** If the database user has DBA privileges, it could potentially lead to the attacker gaining control of the server host.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request parameter "id" in the `view_parcel.php` file.
- The attacker crafts malicious SQL queries within the "id" parameter value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
- The attacker does not need any specific credentials or privileged access before exploitation.
- The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameter and craft suitable SQL injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by user zebra11.
- The issue is tracked as issue #28 in the CveSecLook/cve GitHub repository.
- The provided content contains various payloads that can be used to exploit the vulnerability. Examples include:
  - Boolean-based blind SQL injection
  - Error-based SQL injection
  - Time-based blind SQL injection
  - UNION query-based SQL injection
- The provided payloads demonstrate how to extract data or potentially gain database privileges through SQL injection.

This vulnerability is a standard SQL injection vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-controlled data being used in a SQL query.
