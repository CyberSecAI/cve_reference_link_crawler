- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of user-supplied paths during the parsing of CAB files. This lack of validation allows for directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path before using it in file operations. This can lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by getting a user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file, which contains a specially crafted CAB file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious CAB file. The target user must then interact with this file, either by visiting a malicious page that triggers the CAB file parsing or by opening the malicious file directly. This means the attacker needs some mechanism for the user to trigger the vulnerable code path (e.g. through social engineering).
