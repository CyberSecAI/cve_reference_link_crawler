{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `com.j2eefast.framework.sys.controller.SysUserController: com.j2eefast.common.core.utils.ResponseData list()` function of J2EEFAST does not filter `sql_filter` parameters.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability exists due to the lack of sanitization of the `sql_filter` parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious SQL payloads into the `findPage` function in `SysUserMapper.xml`, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can pass a malicious payload into the `sql_filter` parameter, which is then used within a SQL query.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the affected endpoint and control the `sql_filter` parameter."
