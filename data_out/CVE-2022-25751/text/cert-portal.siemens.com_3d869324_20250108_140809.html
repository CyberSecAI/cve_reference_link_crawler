SUMMARY

Several SCALANCE X-300 switches contain multiple vulnerabilities. An unauthenticated attacker could
reboot, cause denial of service conditions and potentially impact the system by other means through
heap and buffer overﬂow vulnerabilities.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to ports 22/tcp, 161/udp, and 443/tcp to trusted

IP addresses only

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

• Disable SNMP service, if possible

• Deactivate the webserver if not required, and if deactivation is supported by the product

Product speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE X switches are used to connect industrial components like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs).

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-25751

Affected devices do not properly validate the HTTP headers of incoming requests. This could allow an
unauthenticated remote attacker to crash affected devices.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score

CWE

8.2
CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-20: Improper Input Validation

Vulnerability CVE-2022-25752

The webserver of affected devices calculates session ids and nonces in an insecure manner. This
could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to brute-force session ids and hijack existing sessions.

CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overﬂow

Vulnerability CVE-2022-25754

The integrated web server of the affected device could allow remote attackers to perform actions with
the permissions of a victim user, provided the victim user has an active session and is induced to
trigger the malicious request.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

7.3

CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Vulnerability CVE-2022-25755

The webserver of an affected device is missing speciﬁc security headers. This could allow an remote
attacker to extract conﬁdential session information under certain circumstances.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector

2.6
CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-284: Improper Access Control

Vulnerability CVE-2022-25756

The integrated web server could allow Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if unsuspecting users are
tricked into accessing a malicious link. This can be used by an attacker to trigger a malicious request
on the affected device.
