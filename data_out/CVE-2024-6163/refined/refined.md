- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect configuration and ordering within the site's Apache configuration, failing to properly restrict access to internal HTTP endpoint pages. These pages were intended to be accessed only by local processes, but due to the misconfiguration, they became accessible from the network when the site Apache port is directly exposed.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The primary weakness lies in the failure of the site Apache to filter internal page URIs, specifically `run_cron.py` and `ajax_graph_images.py`, allowing access from non-local network sources. The outdated configuration and improper configuration ordering contributed to this. The system incorrectly relies on the `X-Forwarded-For` header for client IP recognition, which is not reliable when no reverse proxy is present.

- **Impact of exploitation:**  The impact of successful exploitation is that external network hosts could potentially access and execute internal scripts (`run_cron.py`, `ajax_graph_images.py`). The provided CVSS score indicates low impact on confidentiality, no impact on integrity and no impact on availability.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send HTTP requests to the exposed site Apache port (typically 5000) targeting the vulnerable internal endpoint URLs (e.g., `/###SITE###/check_mk/run_cron.py` or `/###SITE###/check_mk/ajax_graph_images.py`).

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Checkmk server's site Apache port (typically 5000) and be able to send HTTP requests. They do not need any prior authentication or special privileges (PR:N).
