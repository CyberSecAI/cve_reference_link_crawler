# Possible sandbox bypass

High

published
GHSA-6j75-5wfj-gh66
Sep 9, 2024

## Package

composer

twig/twig
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>1.0.0,<=1.44.7 || >2.0.0,<=2.16.0 || >3.0.0,<=3.11.0 || >=3.12.0,<3.14.0

## Patched versions

1.44.8,2.16.1,3.14.0

## Description

### Description

Under some circumstances, the sandbox security checks are not run which allows user-contributed templates to bypass the sandbox restrictions.

The security issue happens when all these conditions are met:

* The sandbox is disabled globally;
* The sandbox is enabled via a sandboxed `include()` function which references a template name (like `included.twig`) and not a `Template` or `TemplateWrapper` instance;
* The included template has been loaded before the `include()` call but in a non-sandbox context (possible as the sandbox has been globally disabled).

### Resolution

The patch ensures that the sandbox security checks are always run at runtime.

### Credits

We would like to thank Fabien Potencier for reporting and fixing the issue.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-45411

### Weaknesses
