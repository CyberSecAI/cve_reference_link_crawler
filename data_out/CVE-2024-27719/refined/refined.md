Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding when handling user-provided data in the "Frequently Asked Question" field. The application directly stores the user input and renders it in the application, allowing for the injection of malicious script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS because it saves user-supplied input (specifically in the "question" parameter) without sanitizing it. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then stored in the database. When other users visit the application's homepage or view the stored FAQ, the malicious script is executed in their browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of unsuspecting users.
*   **Confidentiality Impact:** Low, as the attacker can potentially steal cookies, session tokens, and sensitive information accessible by the victim user.
*   **Integrity Impact:** Low, as the attacker can potentially deface the website content, redirect the user to malicious sites, or alter data within the application on the userâ€™s behalf.
*  **Availability Impact:** None, as the attack does not directly cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker interacts with the web application over the network.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction. The victim user needs to visit the page where the malicious script is stored and executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privilege Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability. They can inject the malicious script as a regular user of the application.
*   **Ability to submit a new FAQ**: The attacker needs to be able to access the form to add a new FAQ.
*   **Knowledge of XSS:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of XSS to craft the malicious script.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) uses the payload `<img/src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>`, demonstrating that arbitrary JavaScript code can be executed.
*   The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the FAQ Management System and possibly prior versions.
* The application uses PHP and MySQL.
* The advisory states that there is no vendor fix for this issue.
