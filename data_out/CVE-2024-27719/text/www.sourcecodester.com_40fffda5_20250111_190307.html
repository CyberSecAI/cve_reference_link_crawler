3. **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Front-end technologies utilized to create the user interface and enhance interactivity. HTML structures the content, CSS styles the layout and appearance, while JavaScript provides dynamic functionality such as toggling FAQ visibility and handling user interactions.
4. **Bootstrap Framework**: Bootstrap is employed for its responsive grid system and pre-styled UI components, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design across different screen sizes and devices.

### **How to Use:**

1. **Adding a New FAQ**: To add a new FAQ, click on the "Add FAQ" button. A modal window will appear, prompting you to enter the question and its corresponding answer. Upon submission, the new FAQ will be added to the system.
2. **Managing Existing FAQs**: Existing FAQs are listed on the main page. You can expand each FAQ by clicking on the question to reveal its answer. To update a FAQ, click on the "Manage FAQ" button and select the desired FAQ. A modal window will allow you to edit the question and answer fields before saving the changes.
3. **Deleting a FAQ**: If you wish to delete a FAQ, click on the corresponding delete button. A confirmation dialog will appear to confirm your decision. Upon confirmation, the FAQ will be permanently removed from the system.
