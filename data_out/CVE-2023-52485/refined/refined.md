  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The DMCUB (Display Microcontroller Unit) can be in a low power state when commands are sent to it, leading to hangs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper power state management of DMCUB",
      "Potential deadlock when invoking DMCUB command within DM execution helper"
    ],
    "impact": "System hangs when trying to send commands to DMCUB while it's not powered on, leading to denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "Directly sending commands to the DMCUB while it's in a low-power state.",
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to trigger display-related operations that require DMCUB interaction."
  },
  "additional_details": "This commit introduces `dc_wake_and_execute_dmub_cmd` and `dc_wake_and_execute_dmub_cmd_list` which wrap the existing `dm_execute_dmub_cmd` and `dm_execute_dmub_cmd_list`. These new functions ensure that the DMCUB is powered on before sending commands and attempts to re-enter a low-power state if command submission is successful. The DM will need to manage the enter/exit sequencing manually for direct submissions. Also, it is clarified that a DMCUB command cannot be invoked directly within the DM execution helper to avoid deadlocks."
