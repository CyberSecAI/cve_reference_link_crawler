Package        : php-phpseclib
Version        : 2.0.30-2~deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2024-27354 CVE-2024-27355

Security issues were discovered in php-phpseclib, a PHP library for
arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic, which could lead to Denial of
Service.

CVE-2024-27354

    An attacker can construct a malformed certificate containing an
    extremely large prime to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption
    for an `isPrime` primality check).

    This issue was introduced when attempting to fix CVE-2023-27560.

CVE-2024-27355

    When processing the ASN.1 object identifier of a certificate, a sub
    identifier may be provided that leads to a denial of service (CPU
    consumption for `decodeOID`).

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.0.30-2~deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your php-phpseclib packages.

For the detailed security status of php-phpseclib please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/php-phpseclib>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

[**phpseclib-cves-feb-2024.md**](#file-phpseclib-cves-feb-2024-md)

phpseclib has released versions 3.0.36, 2.0.47, and 1.0.23 to address problems related to maliciously formed certificates that could lead to a denial of service attack.

The first issue, CVE-2024-27354, can be triggered by a malformed certificate with an extremely large prime that is attempted to be read by phpseclib.

The second issue, CVE-2024-27355, can be triggered by a certificate with a very large ASN.1 sub-identifier.

Both affect versions >= 1.0.0 and <= 1.0.22 for the 1.x branch, >= 2.0.0 and <= 2.0.46 for the 2.x branch, and >= 3.0.0 and <= 3.0.35 for the 3.x branch

Both are resolved in the new releases at <https://github.com/phpseclib/phpseclib/releases>
