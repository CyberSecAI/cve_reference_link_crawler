Package        : phpseclib
Version        : 1.0.19-3~deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2024-27354 CVE-2024-27355

Security issues were discovered in phpseclib, a PHP library for
arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic, which could lead to Denial of
Service.

CVE-2024-27354

    An attacker can construct a malformed certificate containing an
    extremely large prime to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption
    for an `isPrime` primality check).

    This issue was introduced when attempting to fix CVE-2023-27560.

CVE-2024-27355

    When processing the ASN.1 object identifier of a certificate, a sub
    identifier may be provided that leads to a denial of service (CPU
    consumption for `decodeOID`).

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.0.19-3~deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpseclib packages.

For the detailed security status of phpseclib please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/phpseclib>
