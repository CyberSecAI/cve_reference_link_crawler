Based on the provided information, all of the content relates to the same vulnerability fix in the Linux kernel. Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability and its fix:

**Root Cause:**
- The `dmirror_device_evict_chunk` function in `lib/test_hmm.c` uses `kcalloc` to allocate memory for `src_pfns` and `dst_pfns`.
- If physical memory is exhausted, `kcalloc` can return NULL.
- The code then dereferences these potentially NULL pointers, leading to a null pointer dereference bug.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a null pointer dereference due to the lack of proper handling for memory allocation failures.
- **Memory Allocation Failure:** The code does not handle the case where memory allocation with `kcalloc` fails which leads to the null pointer dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A null pointer dereference can lead to a system crash or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to trigger the `dmirror_device_evict_chunk` function in a way that causes memory allocation to fail. This might be achieved by exhausting system memory or by specific device configurations that trigger the path in a way that leads to allocation failure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would likely need to have the ability to trigger the `dmirror_device_evict_chunk` function by interacting with the HMM (Heterogeneous Memory Management) subsystem.
- They would need to be able to cause memory allocation to fail.

**Fix:**
The fix addresses the vulnerability in the following ways:
1.  **`__GFP_NOFAIL` Flag:** The `__GFP_NOFAIL` flag is added to the `kcalloc()` calls. This ensures that `kcalloc()` will not return NULL, instead it will retry allocating the memory until it is successful which prevents the null pointer dereference in the short term.
2.  **Switch to `kvcalloc`**: `kcalloc` is replaced with `kvcalloc`. `kvcalloc` allocates virtually contiguous memory, while `kcalloc` allocates physically contiguous memory. Since physical contiguity is not needed, `kvcalloc` is used, which is more likely to succeed and less prone to allocation failures.
3.  **Use `kvfree`**: The calls to `kfree` are updated to `kvfree` to match the new memory allocation functions.
