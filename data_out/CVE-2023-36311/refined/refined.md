Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-36311:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `column` parameter of the Document Creator script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `column` parameter when constructing SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass authentication and read sensitive data stored in the database, including user credentials, customer profiles, and document contents.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could also potentially modify or delete data in the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database configuration, the attacker might gain elevated privileges within the database server.
- **Denial of Service:** Malicious SQL queries could be used to overload the database server, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests, where the attacker crafts a malicious SQL payload within the `column` parameter in a request to the `index.php` page of the Document Creator script.
- The specific payload mentioned in the article is:
  `1 AND (SELECT 4172 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x71786a7071,(SELECT (ELT(4172=4172,1))),0x716a6a7871,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a)&direction=ASC&row_count=15&page=18`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable Document Creator script.
- **Knowledge of the Application:**  The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameter (`column`) and how to inject SQL code.

**Additional Notes:**
