- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Caxton WordPress plugin <= 1.30.1 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, other HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts will execute when visitors access the site.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits a page with injected malicious scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the plugin. The report mentions "Contributor" privilege is required, implying that the attacker would require an account with that permission on the target WordPress site.
