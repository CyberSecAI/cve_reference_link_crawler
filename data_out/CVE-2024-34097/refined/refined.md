- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Use-After-Free (UAF)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a use-after-free, meaning that the program attempts to access memory after it has been freed, which leads to undefined behavior.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction (opening a specially crafted file).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to entice a user to open a malicious file in the vulnerable application.
