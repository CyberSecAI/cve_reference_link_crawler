| As the title says, this great plug-in has an XSS bug. I noticed you filtered out part of the XSS payload. But you're missing this: `<svg><script>alert(/1/)</script>` When I typed this code into a Markdown document and opened it with obsidian-mind-map. Aw, something wonderful happened. JavaScript generates a popover for me. But fortunately, the hook of BEEF-XSS is not in effect, so I think it is only a low-risk vulnerability at present. This bug stopped me from being able to open the mind maps that my mischievous friends had sent me. Who knows if there's a malicious PIECE of XSS code in there? |
