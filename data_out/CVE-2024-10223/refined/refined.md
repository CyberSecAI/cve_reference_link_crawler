Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10223

**Vulnerability Description:**
The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw found in the "WP Team – WordPress Team Member Plugin" (ht-team-member), specifically in versions up to and including 1.1.4. The vulnerability arises from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `htteamember` shortcode.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-provided input when generating the HTML output of the plugin's `htteamember` shortcode.  Specifically, the `implode` function was used to generate HTML class names, without proper escaping. This allows the injection of malicious HTML and Javascript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- Insufficient input sanitization
- Inadequate output escaping

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that utilize the `htteamember` shortcode.
- These injected scripts execute whenever a user accesses the compromised page, potentially leading to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing cookies and session data.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.
    - Defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `htteamember` shortcode.
- Attackers can inject malicious scripts by manipulating the shortcode's attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least Contributor-level access. This level of access is required to create or edit content that includes shortcodes.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.1.5 of the plugin by applying proper output escaping using `esc_attr()` when creating the class attribute. It is recommended to update to version 1.1.5 or higher.
