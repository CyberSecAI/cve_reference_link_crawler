# `server.fs.deny` did not deny requests for patterns with directories.

## Package

npm

vite
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>=2.7.0, <= 2.9.17
>=3.0.0, <=3.2.8
>=4.0.0, <=4.5.2
>=5.0.0, <=5.0.12
>=5.1.0, <=5.1.6
>=5.2.0, <=5.2.5

## Patched versions

2.9.18
3.2.10
4.5.3
5.0.13
5.1.7
5.2.6

## Description

### Summary

[Vite dev server option](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-fs-deny) `server.fs.deny` did not deny requests for patterns with directories. An example of such a pattern is `/foo/**/*`.

### Impact

Only apps setting a custom `server.fs.deny` that includes a pattern with directories, and explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using `--host` or [`server.host` config option](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-host)) are affected.

### Patches

Fixed in vite@5.2.6, vite@5.1.7, vite@5.0.13, vite@4.5.3, vite@3.2.10, vite@2.9.18

### Details

`server.fs.deny` uses picomatch with the config of `{ matchBase: true }`. [matchBase](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch/blob/master/README.md#options:~:text=Description-,basename,-boolean) only matches the basename of the file, not the path due to a bug ([micromatch/picomatch#89](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch/issues/89)). The vite config docs read like you should be able to set fs.deny to glob with picomatch. Vite also does not set `{ dot: true }` and that causes [dotfiles not to be denied](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch/blob/master/README.md#options:~:text=error%20is%20thrown.-,dot,-boolean) unless they are explicitly defined.

**Reproduction**

Set fs.deny to `['**/.git/**']` and then curl for `/.git/config`.

* with `matchBase: true`, you can get any file under `.git/` (config, HEAD, etc).
* with `matchBase: false`, you cannot get any file under `.git/` (config, HEAD, etc).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
