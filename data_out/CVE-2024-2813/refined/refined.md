- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow in the `form_fast_setting_wifi_set` function due to insufficient bounds checking on the `ssid` parameter received via a POST request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `strcpy` function is used to copy the user-controlled `ssid` parameter into fixed-size buffers (`s` and `dest` of 64 bytes) without validating its length. This allows the user to provide an overly long `ssid`, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A stack-based buffer overflow can potentially allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent data on the stack, including return addresses. This could result in arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request with a crafted `ssid` parameter to the `/goform/fast_setting_wifi_set` endpoint of the Tenda router.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router's web interface, typically being on the same network or having access to it through a vulnerable interface.
