### CVE-2024-4370

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the "Image Box" widget of the WPZOOM Addons for Elementor plugin. This allows the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS due to the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-provided input within the image box widget.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into pages.
- **Compromise of User Sessions:** When a user visits an affected page, the injected script executes in their browser, potentially leading to:
  - Data theft,
  - Session hijacking,
  - Malicious redirects,
  - Defacement of websites

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the "Image Box" widget.
- Attacker modifies settings of the "Image Box" widget via Elementor to inject malicious JavaScript into a page

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
- **Minimum Access Level:** The attacker requires contributor-level access or higher.
- **Ability to Modify Content:** The attacker must be able to modify content using the Elementor page builder.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the `image-box.php` file of the plugin, where the `link` URL and `class` attributes are not properly sanitized and escaped before being rendered into the HTML output, specifically at lines 1229, 1242 and 1256 of the `image-box.php` file.

- The vulnerable code before the fix looks like this:

  ```php
  $attrs .= ' href="' . $settings['link']['url'] . '"';
  ```
    ```php
    $attrs .= ' class="' . $classes . '"';
    ```
  ```php
  printf(
      '<%1$s%2$s><span><strong>%3$s</strong></span></%1$s>',
  ```
- The fix applies `esc_url()` and `esc_attr()` functions to these attributes:

  ```php
  $attrs   .= ' href="' . esc_url( $settings['link']['url'] ) . '"';
  ```
    ```php
  $attrs .= ' class="' . esc_attr( $classes ) . '"';
  ```
  ```php
   printf(
      '<%1$s%2$s><span>%3$s</span></%1$s>',
  ```

- The fix was released in version 1.1.37 of the plugin.

- The Wordfence article notes that the vulnerability was discovered by stealthcopter.
