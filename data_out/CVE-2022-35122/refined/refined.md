The provided content is related to CVE-2022-35122.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The ECOWITT GW1102 Home Weather Station exposes sensitive information via HTTP endpoints without proper authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Lack of Authentication:** Multiple endpoints, such as `/get_network_info`, `/get_ws_settings` and others are accessible without any authentication.
*   **Insecure Transmission:** The login page transmits credentials over HTTP, exposing them to interception.
*   **Exposed Sensitive Information:** The `/get_network_info` endpoint discloses the WiFi SSID and password. The `/get_ws_settings` endpoint exposes API keys for external weather reporting services. The device password can also be retrieved via an unauthenticated endpoint.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Exposure of WiFi Credentials:** An attacker can gain access to the victim's WiFi network, potentially compromising all connected devices.
*   **Exposure of API Keys:** An attacker can access the victim's external weather reporting site's data/services and potentially disrupt them.
*   **Device Compromise:** The attacker can change device settings, including the device password and reboot the station without authorization.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** An attacker on the same network as the weather station can directly send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** An attacker intercepting the HTTP request to `/set_login_info` can steal the device password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be on the same network as the weather station.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the weather station's local IP address.
