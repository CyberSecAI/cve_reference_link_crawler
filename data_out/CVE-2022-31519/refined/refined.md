The provided content describes a path traversal vulnerability in multiple Flask applications.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the usage of `flask.send_file` or `os.path.join` with untrusted user input, without proper sanitization. Specifically, user-controlled input is used to specify the filename or path to be accessed, allowing attackers to traverse the file system.
- `os.path.join` is vulnerable as it doesn't sanitize absolute paths, effectively ignoring the base directory if an absolute path is provided as part of the input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal (CWE-22, CWE-36): The applications are susceptible to path traversal attacks, allowing access to files and directories outside of the intended web root.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server's file system, potentially gaining access to sensitive information, source code, configuration files, passwords, and other critical data.
- In some cases, it could also lead to a partial denial of service by repeatedly requesting large files.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is over the network.
- Manipulating the `filename` or `path` parameters, typically in a URL, with sequences like `../` or with absolute paths.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs the ability to make HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
