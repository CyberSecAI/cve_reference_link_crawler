# Improving the **collaboration**, the **communication** and the **connection**

We believe in the work efficiency by the collaboration, by knowledge-sharing
and by a rapid feedback, and we want to extend and improve this way of thinking and of
working.
Therefore, we have built a collaborative and social-networking platform that is both intuitive
and ready to be used: Silverpeas.

Accessible from a simple web browser or from a Smartphone, Silverpeas is used every days
by ourselves. It makes it possible for users to work together, share their knowledge and
good practices, and in general to improve their reciprocal empathy, therefore their
willingness to collaborate.
The introduction in the latest version of the conversational and relational (social
network) functions has once again improved its benchmark coverage.

## Collaborative workspaces

Use Silverpeas to build an Intranet or Extranet and feed web 2.0 sites optimizing sharing
and performance.

Based on it's collaborative bus, Silverpeas is used to share documents (EDM for Electronic
Documentation Management), to optimize project managment, content management and knowledge
and skills management.

networks, thanks to improved workflow and information management.
