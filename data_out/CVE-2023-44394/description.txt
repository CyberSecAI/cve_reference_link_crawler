MantisBT is an open source bug tracker. Due to insufficient access-level checks on the Wiki redirection page, any user can reveal private Projects' names, by accessing wiki.php with sequentially incremented IDs. This issue has been addressed in commit `65c44883f` which has been included in release `2.258`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable wiki integration ( `$g_wiki_enable = OFF;`).
