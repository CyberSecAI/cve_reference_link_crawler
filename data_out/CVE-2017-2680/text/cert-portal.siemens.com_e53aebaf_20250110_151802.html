SSA-546832: Vulnerabilities in Medium Voltage SINAMICS and
SIMOTION Products

SUMMARY

The latest updates for medium voltage SINAMICS products ﬁx two security vulnerabilities that could allow
an attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service condition either via specially crafted PROFINET DCP broadcast
packets or by sending specially crafted packets to port 161/udp (SNMP). Precondition for the PROFINET
DCP scenario is a direct Layer 2 access to the affected products. PROFIBUS interfaces are not affected.

• Apply cell protection concept and implement Defense-in-Depth: https://www.siemens.com/cert/

operational-guidelines-industrial-security.

• Protect network access to port 161/udp of affected devices.

• Use VPN for protecting network communication between cells.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SINAMICS medium voltage converter family is used to control a wide variety of medium voltage
converters or inverters in different applications.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2017-2680

Specially crafted PROFINET DCP broadcast packets could cause a Denial-of-Service condition of
affected products on a local Ethernet segment (Layer 2). Human interaction is required to recover the
systems. PROFIBUS interfaces are not affected.
