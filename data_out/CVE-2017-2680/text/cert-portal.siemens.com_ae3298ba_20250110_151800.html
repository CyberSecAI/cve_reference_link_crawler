SSA-546832: Vulnerabilities in Medium Voltage SINAMICS and SIMOTION Products

| Publication Date: | 2018-05-03 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2020-02-10 |
| Current Version: | V1.2 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.5 |

SUMMARY

The latest updates for medium voltage SINAMICS products fix two security vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service condition either via specially crafted PROFINET DCP broadcast packets or by sending specially crafted packets to port 161/udp (SNMP). Precondition for the PROFINET DCP scenario is a direct Layer 2 access to the affected products. PROFIBUS interfaces are not affected.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* Apply cell protection concept and implement Defense-in-Depth: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>.
* Protect network access to port 161/udp of affected devices.
* Use VPN for protecting network communication between cells.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SINAMICS medium voltage converter family is used to control a wide variety of medium voltage converters or inverters in different applications.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the same firmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) ([https://www.first.org/cvss](https://www.first.org/cvss/)). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed
list of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found
at: <https://cwe.mitre.org/>.

Vulnerability CVE-2017-2680

Specially crafted PROFINET DCP broadcast packets could cause a Denial-of-Service condition of affected products on a local Ethernet segment (Layer 2). Human interaction is required to recover the systems. PROFIBUS interfaces are not affected.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 6.5 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |
| CWE: | CWE-20: Improper Input Validation |

Vulnerability CVE-2017-12741

Specially crafted packets sent to port 161/udp could cause a Denial-of-Service condition. The affected devices must be restarted manually.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.5 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |
| CWE: | CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') |
