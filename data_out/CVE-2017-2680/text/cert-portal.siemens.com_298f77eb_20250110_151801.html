SUMMARY

Several industrial devices are affected by a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to cause a Denial-of-
Service condition via PROFINET DCP network packets under certain circumstances. Precondition for
this scenario is a direct Layer 2 access to the affected products. PROFIBUS interfaces are not affected.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products, is working on updates for the remaining
affected products and recommends speciﬁc countermeasures until ﬁxes are available.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with
appropriate mechanisms. In order to run the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens particularly
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SIMATIC CP 1242-7 and CP 1243-7 LTE communication processors connect the S7-1200 controller
to Wide Area Networks (WAN). It provides integrated security functions such as ﬁrewall, Virtual Private
Networks (VPN) and support of other protocols with data encryption.

The SIMATIC CP 1243-8 IRC communication processor connects S7-1200 controllers via the SINAUT
ST7 telecontrol protocol to a control center or master ST7 stations.

SIMATIC CP 1626 enables SIMATIC PGs/PCs and PCs equipped with a PCI Express slot to be connected
to PROFINET IO.

Extension Units PROFINET are available in different sizes to extend Simatic HMI Comfort PRO devices.
All elements inside the extension unit are connected to PROFINET IO.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability (CVE-2017-2680)

Specially crafted PROFINET DCP broadcast packets could cause a Denial-of-Service condition of
affected products on a local Ethernet segment (Layer 2). Human interaction is required to recover the
systems. PROFIBUS interfaces are not affected.
