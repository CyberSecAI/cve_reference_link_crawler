SSA-546832: Vulnerabilities in Medium Voltage SINAMICS and SIMOTION Products

| Publication Date: | 2018-05-03 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2020-02-10 |
| Current Version: | V1.2 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.5 |

SUMMARY

The latest updates for medium voltage SINAMICS products fix two security vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service condition either via specially crafted PROFINET DCP broadcast packets or by sending specially crafted packets to port 161/udp (SNMP). Precondition for the PROFINET DCP scenario is a direct Layer 2 access to the affected products. PROFIBUS interfaces are not affected.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* Apply cell protection concept and implement Defense-in-Depth: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>.
* Protect network access to port 161/udp of affected devices.
* Use VPN for protecting network communication between cells.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SINAMICS medium voltage converter family is used to control a wide variety of medium voltage converters or inverters in different applications.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the same firmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) ([https://www.first.org/cvss](https://www.first.org/cvss/)). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed
list of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found
at: <https://cwe.mitre.org/>.

Vulnerability CVE-2017-2680

Specially crafted PROFINET DCP broadcast packets could cause a Denial-of-Service condition of affected products on a local Ethernet segment (Layer 2). Human interaction is required to recover the systems. PROFIBUS interfaces are not affected.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 6.5 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |
| CWE: | CWE-20: Improper Input Validation |

Vulnerability CVE-2017-12741

Specially crafted packets sent to port 161/udp could cause a Denial-of-Service condition. The affected devices must be restarted manually.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.5 |

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SINAMICS medium voltage converter family is used to control a wide variety of medium voltage
converters or inverters in different applications.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

* Use VPN for protecting network communication between cells
* Apply defense-in-depth

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to run the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens particularly recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. The Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security can be found at:
<https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>

For more information on this vulnerability and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-284673 at the following location:
<http://www.siemens.com/cert/en/cert-security-advisories.htm>

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.

SUMMARY

Several industrial devices are affected by two vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to cause a denial
of service condition via PROFINET DCP network packets under certain circumstances. The precondition
for this scenario is a direct layer 2 access to the affected products. PROFIBUS interfaces are not affected.

Siemens has released new versions for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends specific countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet
available.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Development Kit DK-16xx PN IO permits an easy integration of CP 1616 and CP 1604 in non-Windows
operating system environments.

The IE/AS-i LINK PN IO is a compact network transition between PROFINET/Industrial Ethernet
(PROFINET IO-Device) and AS-Interface.

IE/PB-Link devices enable existing PROFIBUS devices to be integrated into a PROFINET application.

PN/PN coupler is used for connecting two PROFINET networks.

SIMATIC RF600 Readers are used for the contactless identification of every kind of object, e.g. transport
containers, pallets, production goods, or it can be generally used for recording goods in bulk.

SCALANCE M-800, MUM-800 and S615 as well as the RUGGEDCOM RM1224 are industrial routers.

SCALANCE W-700 products are wireless communication devices based on IEEE 802.11ax or 802.11n
standard. They are used to connect all to sorts of WLAN devices (Access Points or Clients, depending on
the operating mode) with a strong focus on industrial components, like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and others.

SCALANCE X switches are used to connect industrial components like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs).

The SIMATIC CM 1542-1 communication module is used to connect S7-1500 controllers to PROFINET
as IO-Controller.

SIMATIC CP 1604 and CP 1616 are PCI/PCI-104 cards for high-performance connection of field devices
to Industrial Ethernet with PROFINET.

SIMATIC CP 1243-1 communications processors connect S7-1200 controllers to Ethernet networks. They
provide integrated security functions such as firewall, Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and support of other
protocols with data encryption.

SIMATIC CP 1543-1, CP 1543SP-1, CP 1542SP-1 and CP 1542SP-1 IRC communications processors
connect SIMATIC S7-1500 controllers to Ethernet networks. They provide integrated security functions
