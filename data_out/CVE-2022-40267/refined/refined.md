The content is related to CVE-2022-40267.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a predictable seed in the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used in the WEB server function of the affected Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC iQ-F and iQ-R Series products.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the use of a predictable seed for the PRNG. This allows an attacker to potentially guess the random numbers used for authentication, effectively bypassing the intended security measures.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to an attacker gaining unauthorized access to the WEB server function of the affected devices.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is remote, as the vulnerability affects the WEB server function of the devices.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the ability to interact with the WEB server functionality of the affected devices over a network, and knowledge of the PRNG algorithm used to guess the seed. The attacker does not need any specific privileges to initiate the exploit.
