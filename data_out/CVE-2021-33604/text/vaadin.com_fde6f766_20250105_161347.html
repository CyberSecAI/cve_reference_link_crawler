# Reflected cross-site scripting in development mode handler in Vaadin 14, 15-19

Severity:

 Low (Base score 2.5) [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

CVE entry:

 [CVE-2021-33604](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-33604)

## Overview

URL encoding error in development mode handler in `com.vaadin:flow-server` versions 2.0.0 through 2.6.1 (Vaadin 14.0.0 through 14.6.1), 3.0.0 through 6.0.9 (Vaadin 15.0.0 through 19.0.8) allows local user to execute arbitrary JavaScript code by opening crafted URL in browser.

See [CWE-172: Encoding Error](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/172.html)

## Description

Improper URL sanitation with the frontend development server made it possible for attacker to gain access to a locally running Vaadin application in the browser by executing cross-site scripting from another web page the developer has opened. To exploit this vulnerability, the following is required:

1. There is an application running on the system with the frontend development server started and the application contains some sensitive data like a production data base clone;
2. The attacker is aware of application running on the developer’s system, what data it provides and the Vaadin version it is running on;
3. The developer opens an external site that executes the malicious script.

This vulnerability is not exploitable on deployed applications, but only for development time on developer’s machine.

## Affected products and mitigation

Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation or upgrade. Releases that have fixed this issue include:

| Product version | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Vaadin 14.0.0 - 14.6.1 | Upgrade to 14.6.2 or newer 14 version |
| Vaadin 15 - 18 | No longer supported. Upgrade to 19.0.9 or newer version |
| Vaadin 19.0.0 - 19.0.8 | Upgrade to 19.0.9 or newer 19 version |

Please note that Vaadin versions 15-18 are no longer supported and you should update either to the latest 19 version.
