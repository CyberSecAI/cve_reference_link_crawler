*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) is present.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs local access to the system. User interaction (UI:R) is required, meaning the user needs to perform some action to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system, and the user must interact with the application to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N).
