{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not sanitize user input in the 'docname' parameter of the `admin/add-doctor.php` and `admin/edit-doctor.php` files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts that could compromise user data, hijack user accounts, or install malware on the host machine.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker injects a malicious script into the 'Doctor Name' field when adding or editing a doctor.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel to add or edit doctor information. They must be able to input arbitrary text into the docname parameter field."
