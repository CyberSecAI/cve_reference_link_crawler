   - **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not properly clean or validate user-provided input, allowing the injection of arbitrary code.
   - **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly encode output, allowing injected scripts to be rendered and executed in the user's browser.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the affected website.
    - **Malicious Actions:** This injected code can perform a wide range of malicious actions, including:
