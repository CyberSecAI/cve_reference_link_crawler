- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CSRF token was mistakenly included as a query parameter in certain URLs when navigating Checkmk.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF token leakage via URL parameters, specifically the `csrf_token=` parameter. This can lead to the token being saved in bookmarks or shared unintentionally.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The leaked token, while not an immediate security threat, could potentially enable phishing attacks targeting the specific user for the duration of the token's validity. A successful phishing attack could allow an attacker to impersonate the user and perform actions as that user.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Unintentional exposure via sharing bookmarks or URLs containing the CSRF token.
    - Phishing attacks targeting users with leaked CSRF tokens.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to acquire a leaked CSRF token. This can happen through social engineering (phishing) or via leaked bookmarks.
    - The attacker needs to target a user within the validity of the leaked token (session duration).
    - The attacker needs to trick the user into visiting a malicious site with the user's valid CSRF token, which allows the attacker to perform actions on the user's behalf.
