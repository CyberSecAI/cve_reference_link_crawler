- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `adm.cgi` script directly concatenates the received POST data into a system command without any sanitization, leading to command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the vulnerable device.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted POST request to the `adm.cgi` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to send a POST request, and there needs to be an active session on the device.
