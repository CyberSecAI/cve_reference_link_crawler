Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1091

This bug report describes two separate issues that, when combined,
allow any user on a Linux host system on which VirtualBox is installed
to gain code execution in the kernel. Since I'm not sure which one of
these issues crosses something you consider to be a privilege boundary,
I'm reporting them together.

To reproduce, download the attached file
virtualbox-host-r3-to-host-r0-crasher.tar, ensure that at least one VM
is running, then:

/tmp$ tar xf virtualbox-host-r3-to-host-r0-crasher.tar
/tmp$ cd virtualbox-host-r3-to-host-r0-crasher/
/tmp/virtualbox-host-r3-to-host-r0-crasher$ ./attack.sh
./attack.sh: line 7: 82634 Killed                  QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH=fake_qt_platform_plugins /usr/lib/virtualbox/VirtualBox --startvm
/tmp/virtualbox-host-r3-to-host-r0-crasher$ dmesg
[...]
[279468.028025] BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at 0000000013370028
[...]

The first step of the attack is to get access to the device
/dev/vboxdrv, which can normally only be opened by root:

~$ ls -l /dev/vboxdrv
crw------- 1 root root 10, 54 Jan 17 16:23 /dev/vboxdrv

In order to be able to open this device, the main VirtualBox binary is
setuid root:

$ ls -l /usr/lib/virtualbox/VirtualBox
-r-s--x--x 1 root root 35240 Jan 16 19:55 /usr/lib/virtualbox/VirtualBox

VirtualBox uses its root privileges to open /dev/vboxdrv, then quickly
drops its privileges. However, it retains the open file descriptor to
/dev/vboxdrv. Therefore, an attacker can gain access to the device
/dev/vboxdrv by injecting code into a VirtualBox userspace process.

After dropping privileges, VirtualBox loads various libraries,
including QT, that are not designed to run in a setuid context.
See https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qcoreapplication.html#setSetuidAllowed :
"Qt is not an appropriate solution for setuid programs due to its
large attack surface." Using the environment variable
QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH, an attacker can let QT load a library
from an arbitrary directory.

The second step is to use the device /dev/vboxdrv to corrupt the
kernel. The SUP_IOCTL_CALL_VMMR0 ioctl takes a pointer to a structure
in ring 0 as an argument (pVMR0) and ends up calling the function
VMMR0EntryEx(). With the attached PoC, this function crashes when
attempting to read pVM->pVMR0. However, an attacker who supplies a
pointer to attacker-controlled kernel memory could reach any point in
the function. For some operations, e.g.
VMMR0_DO_VMMR0_INIT, the attacker-controlled pointer pVM is then used
in vmmR0CallRing3SetJmpEx() to save and restore various kernel
registers, including RSP. By supplying a pointer to which the attacker
can concurrently write data, an attacker can therefore control the
kernel stack and thereby perform arbitrary operations in the kernel.
(As far as I can tell, a comment in VMMR0EntryEx points out this
issue: "/** @todo validate this EMT claim... GVM knows. */")

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
