{
  "CVE-2017-3561": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from two combined issues: (1) an attacker can gain access to the /dev/vboxdrv device by injecting code into a VirtualBox userspace process due to insecure usage of setuid privileges and the QT library; and (2) the SUP_IOCTL_CALL_VMMR0 ioctl takes a pointer to a structure in ring 0 and uses it in vmmR0CallRing3SetJmpEx() to save and restore kernel registers, allowing an attacker to control the kernel stack.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Insecure use of setuid privileges by the main VirtualBox binary, which opens /dev/vboxdrv as root and then drops privileges but retains the file descriptor.",
      "Loading of libraries (QT) not designed for setuid context, allowing code injection via the QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable.",
      "Unvalidated pointer in the SUP_IOCTL_CALL_VMMR0 ioctl, leading to a crash when an attacker-controlled pointer is used, with the potential to take control of kernel registers and stack via vmmR0CallRing3SetJmpEx()"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows any unprivileged user on a Linux host system with VirtualBox installed to gain code execution in the kernel.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Injecting code into a VirtualBox userspace process using environment variables to influence library loading.",
      "Utilizing the open file descriptor for /dev/vboxdrv gained through the injected code.",
      "Crafting a malicious pointer to pass to the SUP_IOCTL_CALL_VMMR0 ioctl to gain kernel code execution."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker requires the ability to execute code on the host system, which has VirtualBox installed. No elevated privileges are initially required."
