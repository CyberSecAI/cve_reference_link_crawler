- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Mendix Encryption module versions V10.0.0 and V10.0.1 use a hard-coded default value for the EncryptionKey constant. This key is used when no specific encryption key is configured in the project.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is the use of a hard-coded, security-relevant constant, specifically the encryption key (CWE-547). This makes the default encryption key easily compromised.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can decrypt any encrypted project data if the default encryption key was used in the Mendix project.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability (PR:N, UI:N). They just need to be able to access the encrypted data.
