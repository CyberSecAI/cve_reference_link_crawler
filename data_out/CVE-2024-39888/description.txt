A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Encryption (All versions >= V10.0.0 < V10.0.2). Affected versions of the module define a specific hard-coded default value for the EncryptionKey constant, which is used in projects where no individual EncryptionKey was specified.

This could allow to an attacker to decrypt any encrypted project data, as the default encryption key can be considered compromised.
