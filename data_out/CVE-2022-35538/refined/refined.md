The provided content details multiple command injection vulnerabilities in various WAVLINK router models (WN572HP3, WN533A8, WN530H4, WN535G3, WN531P3). The vulnerabilities stem from a lack of input sanitization in multiple CGI scripts.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:**  The root cause is the lack of input sanitization on user-supplied parameters in multiple CGI scripts (`adm.cgi`, `firewall.cgi`, `login.cgi`, `nas.cgi`, `qos.cgi`, `wireless.cgi`). These scripts directly use these parameters in shell commands without proper validation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Command Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is command injection. By injecting shell metacharacters (like `;`) into vulnerable parameters, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the router.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core weakness is the failure to sanitize user inputs before using them in system commands. This allows the attacker to control the shell commands executed by the router.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the router. This may allow the attacker to gain full control over the device.
    *   **Device Compromise:**  Full control of the router allows the attacker to potentially monitor network traffic, modify router settings, install malware, create backdoors and use the device for malicious purposes.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerabilities are exploitable through HTTP requests (POST requests) to the vulnerable CGI scripts.
    *   **Web Interface:** The attacker can use the router's web interface (various pages such as `/wizard_router_mesh.shtml`, `/ledonoff.shtml`, `/wan.shtml`, `/wizard_rep.shtml`, `/cli_black_list.shtml`, `/man_security.shtml`, `/login.shtml`, `/nas_disk.shtml`, `/qos.shtml`, `/wifi_multi_ssid.shtml`, `/wifi_mesh.shtml`) to trigger the vulnerabilities.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the router's web interface, which typically requires being on the same network or having access through port forwarding.
    *   **Authentication:** In most cases, successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires the attacker to log in to the router's web interface first. However, the login page itself is also vulnerable to command injection.

**Specific Vulnerable Parameters and Pages (as detailed in the document):**

*   **`/ledonoff.shtml`:** `led_switch` (in `adm.cgi`) and hidden parameter `ufconf` (in `api.cgi`)
*   **`/wan.shtml`:** `ppp_username`, `ppp_passwd`, `rwan_gateway`, `rwan_mask`, `rwan_ip`
*   **`/wizard_rep.shtml`:** `wlan_signal`, `web_pskValue`, `sel_EncrypTyp`, `sel_Automode`, `wlan_bssid`, `wlan_ssid`, `wlan_channel`
