- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when handling Doc objects in Foxit PDF Reader. This can lead to a read operation beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires user interaction, where the target user has to either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious PDF document.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file or website to trigger the out-of-bounds read vulnerability. The attacker is remote, and no special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability. The user needs to interact with the malicious file/page for the exploit to work.
