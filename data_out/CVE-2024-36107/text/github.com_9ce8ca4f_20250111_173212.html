# Information disclosure in GetObject with If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since headers

## Description

### Impact

[If-Modified-Since](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Modified-Since)

[If-Unmodified-Since](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Unmodified-Since)

Headers when used with anonymous requests by sending a random object name requests you can figure

out if the object exists or not on the server on a specific bucket and also gain access to some amount of

information such as

```
Last-Modified (of the latest version)
Etag (of the latest version)
x-amz-version-id (of the latest version)
Expires (metadata value of the latest version)
Cache-Control (metadata value of the latest version)

```

This conditional check was being honored before validating if the anonymous

access is indeed allowed on the metadata of an object.

### Patches

Yes this issue has been already fixed in

```
commit e0fe7cc391724fc5baa85b45508f425020fe4272 (HEAD -> master, origin/master)
Author: Harshavardhana <harsha@minio.io>
Date:   Mon May 27 12:17:46 2024 -0700

    fix: information disclosure bug in preconditions GET (#19810)

    precondition check was being honored before, validating
    if anonymous access is allowed on the metadata of an
    object, leading to metadata disclosure of the following
    headers.

    ```
    Last-Modified
    Etag
    x-amz-version-id
    Expires:
    Cache-Control:
    ```

    although the information presented is minimal in nature,
    and of opaque nature. It still simply discloses that an
    object by a specific name exists or not without even having
    enough permissions.

```

Users must upgrade to RELEASE.2024-05-27T19-17-46Z for the fix

### Workarounds

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
