{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that pre-condition checks for `If-Modified-Since` and `If-Unmodified-Since` headers were being honored before validating if anonymous access was allowed on the metadata of an object.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information disclosure due to improper access control."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could use the vulnerability to determine if an object exists on a specific bucket and gain access to metadata such as `Last-Modified`, `Etag`, `x-amz-version-id`, `Expires`, and `Cache-Control`, even without proper permissions.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending anonymous GET requests with `If-Modified-Since` or `If-Unmodified-Since` headers to the server with random object names.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires network access to the MinIO server and the ability to send HTTP requests."
  },
  "cve": "CVE-2024-36107"
