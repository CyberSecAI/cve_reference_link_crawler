**Overview**

The DCS-5220 all hardware revisions, have reached End of Life ("EOL") /End of Service Life ("EOS") of there Life-Cycles.

As a  general policy, when products reach EOS/EOL, they can no longer be supported, and all firmware development for the products ceases. Products  purchased in the US that have reached EOS/EOL are moved to our Legacy Products site ([legacy.us.dlink.com](https://legacy.us.dlink.com)) which is the final archive as of the EOS/EOL date. **Please read information and recommendations**below.

Recommendation for End of Support /End of Life Products

From time to time, D-Link will decide that some of its products have reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life (“EOL”). D-Link may choose to EOS/EOL a product due to evolution of technology, market demands,  new innovations, product efficiencies based on new technologies, or the product matures over time and should be replaced by functionally superior technology.

**For US Consumer**

If a product has reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life ("EOL"), there is normally no further extended support or development for it. Once a product reaches its EOL/EOS date, it is transferred to <https://legacy.us.dlink.com/> .

Typically for these products, D-Link will be unable to resolve device or firmware issues since all development and customer support has ceased.

D-Link strongly recommends that this product be retired and cautions that any further use of this product may be a risk to devices connected to it. If US consumers continue to use these devices against D-Link's recommendation, please make sure the device has the most recent firmware from <https://legacy.us.dlink.com/> installed, make sure you frequently update the device's unique password to access its web-configuration, and always have WIFI encryption enabled with a unique password.
