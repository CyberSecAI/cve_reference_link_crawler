Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of the filename when exporting gene panels. The `panel_name`, which is user-controlled, is directly used in the `Content-Disposition` header, allowing for injection of malicious content and bypassing the intended file extension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Output Sanitization/Escaping (CWE-116):** The application fails to sanitize or escape the `panel_name` before using it in the `Content-Disposition` header's filename parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary characters, including those that can alter the file extension and potentially lead to the execution of the malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Download:** An attacker can craft a malicious panel name that, when exported, results in a file with an arbitrary extension being downloaded (e.g., .html instead of .txt).
*   **Malicious Code Execution:** If a user downloads and opens the file with a malicious extension, it can lead to the execution of injected code, potentially compromising the user's device or data. This could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) or other forms of attack, depending on the content injected.
*   **Social Engineering:** The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking users into downloading malicious files from a trusted source, making them more likely to open the file.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by manipulating the filename within the application and then having the victim download the resulting crafted file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs the ability to create a new gene panel, which is a low-privileged operation within the application.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to download the exported file for the exploit to be successful.
*  **Knowledge of Application Functionality**: The attacker needs to know how to create and export gene panels within the Scout application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `downloaded_panel_name` function within the `controllers.py` file, which generates the filename for downloaded panel exports. The `panel_name` from the panel object is directly included in the filename without proper sanitization or escaping.
*   The filename is then used in the `Content-Disposition` header in the `panel_export_txt` function in `views.py`.
*   The proof-of-concept demonstrates how a panel name such as `"poc_letm3.html";` will be injected in the filename and cause the browser to treat the file as HTML, which allows arbitrary Javascript code to be executed when opened in a browser.
*   The fix involves sanitizing the filename by escaping double quotes and ensuring the proper file extension is used for downloading the files.
*   The provided code snippet from `controllers.py` shows the sanitization logic is added to the panel id before exporting the file.

```
 sanitized\_panel\_id = re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z\_\-]+", "", panel\_obj["panel\_name"])
```

*   The provided code snippet from `panels.html` shows the stricter check of the ID of newly created gene panels to prevent the vulnerability:
```
pattern="[A-Za-z0-9\_\-]+"
```

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 4.6.
*   The suggested fix is to start the default filename with a double quote and escape any double quote received from the input, which seems to address the vulnerability by preventing injection.
