Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2408:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `openssl_private_decrypt` function within PHP when used with PKCS#1 padding (which is the default). The timing of the function's execution is dependent on whether a message is returned or not, creating a timing side channel that is exploitable. This timing difference can be used as an oracle to perform the Bleichenbacher attack, also known as the Marvin Attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Timing Side-Channel:** The `openssl_private_decrypt` function exhibits a timing difference based on whether decryption is successful or not when using PKCS#1 v1.5 padding.
- **Vulnerable RSA Decryption:** The implementation of RSA decryption with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding is vulnerable to the Marvin Attack.
- **Missing Implicit Rejection:** The vulnerability exists because the PHP OpenSSL implementation is missing changes from OpenSSL to include `rsa_pkcs1_implicit_rejection`, introduced in OpenSSL 3.2.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Decryption of Ciphertexts:** An attacker can potentially decrypt captured ciphertexts.
- **Forging Signatures:** An attacker can potentially forge signatures using the key used in the decryption API.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Exploitation leads to unauthorized access to sensitive information by decrypting data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely, as the vulnerability is related to the processing of encrypted data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send crafted encrypted data to the vulnerable server.
- **Timing Measurements:** An attacker needs to accurately measure the time taken for the `openssl_private_decrypt` operation.
- **Ciphertext Interception:** In some attack scenarios, the attacker may need to intercept ciphertexts.
- **No Privileges or User Interaction:** No special privileges or user interaction is required to carry out the attack.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided GitHub advisory ([https://github.com/php/php-src/security/advisories/GHSA-hh26-4ppw-5864](https://github.com/php/php-src/security/advisories/GHSA-hh26-4ppw-5864)) includes a detailed description of the vulnerability and a proof-of-concept (PoC) using the marvin-toolkit. The PoC demonstrates how to measure the timing differences and confirms the vulnerability using statistical analysis.

- The vulnerability is present in PHP versions using vulnerable OpenSSL versions. The fix includes using an OpenSSL version that includes the `rsa_pkcs1_implicit_rejection` fix (OpenSSL 3.2 or backported fix)

- The vulnerability is rated as moderate with a CVSS score of 5.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

- The provided Fedora update notifications (for Fedora 39 and 40) confirm the vulnerability and indicate that a fix has been implemented by updating the PHP package to use a patched OpenSSL build or PHP version.
