| Hi,  I would like to report another potential vulnerability in the current version of RT-Thread. Please let me know if you plan to ask for a CVE ID in case the vulnerability is confirmed. I'm available if you need further clarifications. Potential out-of-bounds static array access in RT-Thread var\_export utilitySummary I spotted a potential out-of-bounds static array access at the following location in the RT-Thread var\_export utility source code: <https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/blob/master/components/utilities/var_export/var_export.c#L97-L122> Details Improper size check due to the use of `RT_ASSERT()` in the `var_export_init()` function at the marked line, which if compiled out in production code could lead to multiple out-of-bounds `ve_exporter_tab` static array accesses in the next lines:  ``` int var_export_init(void) {     /* initialize the var export table.*/ #if defined(__ARMCC_VERSION)                        /* for ARM C Compiler */     ve_exporter_table = &__ve_table_start + 1;     ve_exporter_num = &__ve_table_end - &__ve_table_start; #elif defined (__IAR_SYSTEMS_ICC__)                 /* for IAR Compiler */     ve_exporter_table = &__ve_table_start + 1;     ve_exporter_num = &__ve_table_end - &__ve_table_start - 1; #elif defined (__GNUC__)                            /* for GCC Compiler */     extern const int __ve_table_start;     extern const int __ve_table_end;     ve_exporter_table = (const ve_exporter_t *)&__ve_table_start;     ve_exporter_num = (const ve_exporter_t *)&__ve_table_end - ve_exporter_table; #elif defined (_MSC_VER)                            /* for MS VC++ compiler */     unsigned int *ptr_begin = (unsigned int *)&__ve_table_start;     unsigned int *ptr_end = (unsigned int *)&__ve_table_end;     static ve_exporter_t ve_exporter_tab[2048];     static char __vexp_strbuf1[1024];     static char __vexp_strbuf2[1024];     ve_exporter_t ve_exporter_temp;     rt_size_t index_i, index_j;      /* past the three members in first ptr_begin */     ptr_begin += (sizeof(struct ve_exporter) / sizeof(unsigned int));     while (*ptr_begin == 0) ptr_begin++;     do ptr_end--; while (*ptr_end == 0);      /* Find var objects in custom segments to solve the problem of holes in objects in different files */     ve_exporter_num = ve_init_find_obj(ptr_begin, ptr_end, ve_exporter_tab);      /* check if the ve_exporter_num is out of bounds */     RT_ASSERT(ve_exporter_num < (sizeof(ve_exporter_tab) / sizeof(ve_exporter_t))); /* VULN: size check is implemented via assertion */      /* bubble sort algorithms */     for (index_i = 0; index_i < (ve_exporter_num - 1); index_i++)     {         for (index_j = 0; index_j < ((ve_exporter_num - 1) - index_i); index_j++)         {             /* splice ve_exporter's module and ve_exporter's identifier into a complete string */             rt_snprintf(__vexp_strbuf1,                         sizeof(__vexp_strbuf1),                         "%s%s",                         ve_exporter_tab[index_j].module,                         ve_exporter_tab[index_j].identifier);             rt_snprintf(__vexp_strbuf2,                         sizeof(__vexp_strbuf2),                         "%s%s",                         ve_exporter_tab[index_j + 1].module,                         ve_exporter_tab[index_j + 1].identifier);             if (rt_strcmp(__vexp_strbuf1, __vexp_strbuf2) > 0)             {                 ve_exporter_temp = ve_exporter_tab[index_j];                 ve_exporter_tab[index_j] = ve_exporter_tab[index_j + 1];                 ve_exporter_tab[index_j + 1] = ve_exporter_temp;             }         }     }      ve_exporter_table = ve_exporter_tab; #endif /* __ARMCC_VERSION */      return ve_exporter_num; } ``` Impact If the unchecked input above is confirmed to be attacker-controlled and crossing a security boundary, the impact of the reported buffer overflow vulnerability could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution. |

| Hi, it's been one month since I reported this vulnerability, and I wanted to ask if you have any update. As standard practice, I plan to request a CVE ID for every confirmed vulnerability. I also intend to publish an advisory by February at the latest, unless there's a specific reason to postpone. Thanks! |
