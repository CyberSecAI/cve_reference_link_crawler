Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown for CVE-2024-26037:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The weakness is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). This means that malicious script can be injected and stored within the application and executed when other users access the affected functionality
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the victim's browser session.
*   **Attack Vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring low attack complexity (AC:L). A low-privileged attacker (PR:L) can inject the malicious script. The user interaction is required (UI:R) because another user needs to trigger the injected script. The scope of the vulnerability is changed (S:C).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: An attacker with low privileges (PR:L) is needed and they can inject the script through the network (AV:N). The attacker needs to make a user (UI:R) to interact with the malicious script for successful exploitation.
