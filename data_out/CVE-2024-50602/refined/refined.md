The provided content relates to CVE-2024-50602.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in `XML_StopParser` where it could be called on an uninitialized parser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Calling `XML_StopParser` on an uninitialized parser leads to a NULL pointer dereference in `normal_updatePosition` via `XML_ResumeParser`.
- The parser was not checking if it was in a parsing state before updating the position.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A crash due to a segmentation fault or undefined behavior due to a null pointer dereference. Specifically, a crash occurs in `normal_updatePosition` function when called through `XML_ResumeParser` after `XML_StopParser` was called on an uninitialized parser.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to trigger a sequence of calls where `XML_StopParser` is called on an uninitialized parser and then `XML_ResumeParser` is called.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the calls to `XML_StopParser` and `XML_ResumeParser`.
