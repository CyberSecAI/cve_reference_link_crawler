Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formSetDebugCfg` function of the Tenda W15EV1.0 firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `formSetDebugCfg` function takes parameters `enable`, `level`, and `module` from a POST request. These are then used in a `sprintf` function call.
- The `sprintf` function copies the provided parameters into a buffer named `cmd`.
- There is no proper input validation or size check performed on `enable`, `level`, and `module` parameters. This allows an attacker to supply excessively long input strings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By sending a crafted POST request with oversized values for `enable`, `level`, or `module`, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow.
- This could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite parts of the stack, which may lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered via a POST request to the `/goform/setDebugCfg` endpoint of the router's web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device. This usually means the attacker must be on the same network as the router, or have access to it through another vulnerability.
- The attacker does not require authentication based on the information provided.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is within the `formSetDebugCfg` function, specifically the `sprintf` call:
  ```c
  sprintf(
      (char *)cmd,
      "echo enable=%s level=%s > /var/debug/%s",
      (const char *)pEnable,
      (const char *)pLevel,
      (const char *)pModule
  );
  ```
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) uses a long string of "a" characters as the `module` parameter to trigger the overflow:
  ```python
  payload = b"a"*2000
  data = {
          'module':payload,
      }
  ```

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable firmware version is Tenda W15EV1.0 V15.11.0.14.
- The vulnerability was discovered by an individual named abcdefg-png, according to the github link.

This information provides a clear description of the stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability, its cause, impact, and method of exploitation.
