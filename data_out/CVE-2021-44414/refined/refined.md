{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `cgiserver.cgi` process improperly validates the JSON input, specifically the `param` field in API requests. The code assumes that the JSON element of `param` is always an object, accessing it with the subscription operator. When a non-object value (like an empty string) is provided for the `param` field, the program will assert, causing the `cgiserver.cgi` process to crash and the device to reboot.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) - The application does not properly validate the type of JSON input for the `param` field, leading to a type mismatch.",
      "Denial of Service (DoS) - The vulnerability allows an attacker to crash the `cgiserver.cgi` process, leading to a reboot of the device."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition, causing the camera to reboot.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint with a JSON body that contains a command with a `param` value that is not a JSON object.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. While most of the vulnerable API calls require a logged-in user, this can be bypassed using the vulnerability TALOS-2021-1420. Thus unauthenticated requests are possible."
