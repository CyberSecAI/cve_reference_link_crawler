The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47071.

**Root Cause:**
A memory leak occurs in the `uio_hv_generic` driver's error handling paths. Specifically, if `vmbus_establish_gpadl()` fails during the probe, the `recv_gpadl` or `send_gpadl` members of the private data structure will not be updated. As a result, the cleanup function `hv_uio_cleanup()` will not free the corresponding buffer, leading to a memory leak.

**Weakness:**
The code does not explicitly free the allocated receive (`recv_buf`) and send (`send_buf`) buffers if `vmbus_establish_gpadl()` fails.

**Impact:**
A memory leak occurs which could lead to resource exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker could trigger the error conditions during the probe by providing invalid parameters or other mechanisms to cause `vmbus_establish_gpadl()` to fail.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to be able to influence the parameters of the `uio_hv_generic` device setup to cause the `vmbus_establish_gpadl()` call to fail. This could be done via a malicious hypervisor or by interacting with the device setup in some privileged context.
