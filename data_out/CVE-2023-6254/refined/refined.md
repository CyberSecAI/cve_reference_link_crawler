The provided content is related to CVE-2023-6254.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that OTRS AgentInterface and ExternalInterface send plain text passwords back to the client in the server response.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials. The system is not adequately protecting sensitive password data, exposing it in plain text.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially gain access to user passwords, which could then be used to access the system.
-  CAPEC-555 Remote Services with Stolen Credentials, indicating the possibility of using stolen credentials to access remote services.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is present in the OTRS AgentInterface and ExternalInterface, suggesting the attack vector involves interacting with these interfaces.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be in a position to intercept or access the server response to the client in order to view the plaintext passwords. This suggests a network-level attack or access to logs.
- The CVSS vector indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker on the adjacent network without any privileges.

The vulnerability affects OTRS versions from 8.0.x through 8.0.37 and is resolved in OTRS 2024.1.1 and OTRS 7.0.49 (Long Term Support Users).
