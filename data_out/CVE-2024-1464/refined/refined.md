Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1464:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the "Elementor Addons by Livemesh" plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the 'style' attribute of the Posts Slider widget is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling the 'style' attribute of the Posts Slider widget. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the website's database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** When a user accesses a page containing the injected malicious script, the script executes within the user's browser.
*   **Malicious Actions:** An attacker could use this to perform a wide range of malicious actions, including:
    *   Redirecting users to phishing sites
    *   Stealing session cookies
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Posts Slider Widget:** The 'style' attribute within the Posts Slider widget is the entry point for the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress website. This is necessary to have the ability to modify the content.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerable code was located in multiple template files, which were updated in version 8.3.6 to properly escape the settings attributes. Specifically:
    * `addons-for-elementor.php`
    * `includes/helper-functions.php`
    * `plugin.php`
    * `readme.txt`
    * Multiple template files for various widgets such as `animated-text`, `heading`, `piecharts`, `posts-carousel`, `posts-gridbox-slider`, `posts-multislider`, `posts-slider`, `services`, `team-members`, `testimonials-slider`, `testimonials`, and `timeline`.
* The fix involved using `esc_attr()` to escape the output of the settings.

The provided changeset shows that the fix in version 8.3.6 consists of sanitizing and escaping the settings being outputted into the HTML code, using `esc_attr()` to prevent execution of any malicious code that might be present.
