The provided content relates to CVE-2024-26756.

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the direct registration of a synchronization thread (`sync_thread`) during a reshape operation within the `raid10` and `raid5` MD (Multiple Devices) drivers. Specifically, when a reshape operation is interrupted and the array is reassembled, the `sync_thread` is registered directly from `pers->run()`. In this scenario, the flag `MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING` is set, but there's no guarantee that `md_do_sync()` will execute. This can cause `stop_sync_thread()` to hang because the `MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING` flag might not be cleared correctly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability stems from a race condition where the `sync_thread` can be started without ensuring that the `md_do_sync()` function will be called.
-   **Incorrect Flag Handling:** The `MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING` flag is set directly without guaranteeing its eventual cleanup, leading to a potential hang state.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **System Hang:** Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a system hang.  The `stop_sync_thread` function gets stuck waiting for `MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING` to be cleared.
-   **Denial of Service:** The inability to stop the sync thread can result in a denial-of-service condition, where the system becomes unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
-   The attack vector involves interrupting a reshape operation, which triggers the incorrect registration of the sync thread.
-   This interruption can happen due to various administrative actions like device removal.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to trigger a reshape operation on a RAID device using the md driver.
- The attacker also needs to have the capability to interrupt the reshape operation.

**More details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING` is set but `md_do_sync` is not guaranteed to run.
- The stack trace in the provided content indicates a clear path to a hang scenario.
- The fix involves removing the direct registration of the sync thread in `raid10` and `raid5` and letting `md_check_recovery()` handle the registration.
- The fix ensures that `md_do_sync` is guaranteed to be called, avoiding the hang condition.
