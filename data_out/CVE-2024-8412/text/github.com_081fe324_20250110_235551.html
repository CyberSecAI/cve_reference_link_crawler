### **[gtqbhksl](/gtqbhksl)** commented [Aug 31, 2024](#issue-2498833346)

| The code uses the user-controlled next variable to redirect. If next is not verified, an attacker could induce users to redirect to a malicious website.  First:  ```  Snippets of code comments/urls.pypy (line 10) : path('odpovedat/<int:parent>/', views.Reply.as_view(), name='reply'),  Snippet of code comments/views.py (lines 97 through 97) : next_url = self.request.POST.get('next', '')  Snippet of code comments/views.py (lines 100 to 100) : return http.HttpResponseRedirect(next_url + '#link_' + str(comment.pk))  ```  Second:  ``` Snippets of code comments/urls.pypy (line 12) : path('sledovat/<int:pk>/', views.Watch.as_view(), name='watch'),  Snippets of code comments/views.py (lines 140 through 140) : def post(self, request, **kwargs):  Snippets of code comments/views.py (lines 152 through 152) : return HttpResponseRedirect(request.POST['next'])  ```  Third:  ``` Snippets of code comments/urls.pypy (line 13) : path('zabudnut/<int:pk>/', views.Forget.as_view(), name='forget'),  Snippet of code comments/views.py (lines 161 through 161) : def get(self, request, **kwargs):  Snippet of code comments/views.py (lines 165 through 165) : return HttpResponseRedirect(request.GET['next'])  ```  Safety advice: Verify the next parameter: Make sure that the next parameter points to a predefined, secure list of urls, or use a whitelist to limit acceptable values.  Use security functions: If the Django framework is being used, consider using Django's is\_safe\_url or a similar method to verify the security of the URL.  Encoded output: Ensure that the redirected target URL is properly encoded to prevent injection attacks.  Logging: Logging relevant information prior to redirection helps in tracing and debugging in the event of a security incident.  Error handling: If the next\_url is invalid or points to an insecure address, there should be an explicit error handling mechanism rather than a simple redirect. |
