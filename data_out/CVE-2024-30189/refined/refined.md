- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Affected devices queue Wi-Fi frames before changing the security context. These queued frames are then leaked, potentially in cleartext, when the security context is updated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Wi-Fi encryption bypass due to improper handling of queued frames during security context changes. This is related to "Framing Frames" attacks. Specifically, this vulnerability is identified as scenario 1 "Leak frames from the Wi-Fi queue" of CVE-2022-47522.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A physically proximate attacker can intercept frames that are meant for the target device, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be physically proximate to the vulnerable device, and needs to manipulate the Wi-Fi communication to trigger the queuing of frames. The attack also requires user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in physical proximity to the affected device and have the ability to inject/manipulate Wi-Fi frames.
