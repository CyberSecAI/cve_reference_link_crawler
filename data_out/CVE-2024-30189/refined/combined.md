WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* CVE-2024-30189, CVE-2024-30191:

+ Use TLS based communication

+ Use VLAN based segregation of clients (802.1q)

* CVE-2024-30191:

+ Recommendation for upper layers: Do not allow associations to use MAC addresses that are duplicates used by internal services on the LAN

+ Use Wi-Fi Management Frame Protection (802.11w)

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.
Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE W-1700 products are wireless communication devices based on IEEE 802.11ac standard. They are used to connect all to sorts of WLAN devices (Access Points or Clients, depending on the operating mode) with a strong focus on industrial components, like Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and others.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-30189

This CVE refers to Scenario 1 "Leak frames from the Wi-Fi queue" of CVE-2022-47522.

Affected devices queue frames in order to subsequently change the security context and leak the queued frames. This could allow a physically proximate attacker to intercept (possibly cleartext) target-destined frames.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 6.1 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N |
| CWE | CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-30190

This CVE refers to Scenario 2 "Abuse the queue for network disruptions" of CVE-2022-47522.

Affected devices can be tricked into enabling its power-saving mechanisms for a victim client. This could allow a physically proximate attacker to execute disconnection and denial-of-service attacks.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 6.1 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H |
| CWE | CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-30191

This CVE refers to Scenario 3 "Override client’s security context" of CVE-2022-47522.

Affected devices can be tricked into associating a newly negotiated, attacker-controlled, security context with frames belonging to a victim. This could allow a physically proximate attacker to decrypt frames meant for the victim.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 8.4 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H |
| CWE | CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing |
