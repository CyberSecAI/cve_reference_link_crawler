| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2256786#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2024-01-04 14:46:47 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() improperly updates the refcnt on `struct net_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq` global queue.  ZDI security advisory (possibly yet to be published): <https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-CAN-22236/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2256786#c1)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2024-01-04 14:47:34 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2256787](show_bug.cgi?id=2256787 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2023-6270 kernel: AoE: improper reference count leads to use-after-free vulnerability [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2256786#c5)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2024-01-04 20:37:26 UTC  ``` Is this handled upstream? Do you by chance have a reference to the upstream proposed fix?  To the best of my knowledge, there is no recent commit in drivers/block/aoe/ area upstream in mainline which might go in that direction.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2256786#c6)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2024-01-05 08:01:04 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=2256786#c5): > Is this handled upstream? Do you by chance have a reference to the upstream > proposed fix?  We've got this from ZDI, the Linux kernel security team (security) should be aware of this bug too.  > To the best of my knowledge, there is no recent commit in drivers/block/aoe/ > area upstream in mainline which might go in that direction.  I couldn't find any relevant upstream discussion or commit either, hopefully ZDI will publish their advisory soon and we'll get more information there.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2256786#c8)  michaelian ennis    2024-06-11 19:41:53 UTC  ``` This appears to have been addressed upstream now.    <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/drivers/block/aoe?h=v6.10-rc3&id=f98364e926626c678fb4b9004b75cacf92ff0662>   ``` |  |
