- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Affected devices use a weak encryption scheme to encrypt the debug zip file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Usage of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm (CWE-327).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can decrypt the contents of the debug file and retrieve debug information about the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the device.
