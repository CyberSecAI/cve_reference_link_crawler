- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin allows a malicious actor to cause the website to execute website requests to an arbitrary domain controlled by the attacker.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially find sensitive information of other services running on the system or conduct further attacks by making requests to internal services.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor could exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted requests to the vulnerable plugin that causes it to make requests to an attacker-controlled server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber to exploit the vulnerability.
