The Testimonial Carousel For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'save_testimonials_option_callback' function in versions up to, and including, 10.2.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the OpenAI API key, disabling the feature.
