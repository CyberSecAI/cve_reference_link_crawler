*   **Root Cause:** The WordPress Pexels: Free Stock Photos plugin (versions <= 1.2.2) is vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The plugin allows a malicious actor to make the server execute requests to an arbitrary domain controlled by the attacker.

    *   Cause the website to make requests to attacker-controlled domains.
    *   Potentially find sensitive information of other services running on the same system or network.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's functionality that allows it to make requests to external servers, where this functionality is not properly secured.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to trigger the vulnerable functionality, likely through normal plugin usage by a contributor level user.
