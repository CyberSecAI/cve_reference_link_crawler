## 4. MITIGATIONS

Emerson recommends users take the following measures to mitigate the risks associated with each of the identified vulnerabilities:

* CVE-2022-2793: SRTP and SNP protocols support cryptographically secure authentication using the SRP-6a protocol, a feature which Emerson recommends users employ. Affected devices currently support encrypted authentication for session establishment and when escalating privileges; additional encryption features will be added over time.
* CVE-2022-2792: Emerson plans to fix this vulnerability in a future version. Emerson recommends users ensure they are using the latest version of PAC Machine Edition and employ good physical security of devices and transmission paths.
* CVE-2022-2791: Emerson recommends operators of the affected devices be well verified and restrict which users can upload files. The affected devices do not have any file verification systems for checking the files that have been uploaded.
* CVE-2022-2790: See recommendations for CVE-2022-2791.
* CVE-2022-2789: See recommendations for CVE-2022-2791.
* CVE-2022-2788: See recommendations for CVE-2022-2791. Emerson recommends Proficy Machine Edition be installed as an administrator, but run as a non-administrator, unless necessary for specific functions. Users should ensure PLCs are not programmed using an untrusted network; PLCs should be programmed using a flat/bridged network. Users should also enable authentication on the PLCs.

For additional details on any of these recommendations, see Emerson’s [security advisory](https://www.emerson.com/en-us/support/security-notifications).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

Social Engineering ATTACK CODE

CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014) for more information on social engineering attacks.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
