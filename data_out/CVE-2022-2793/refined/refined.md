The provided content is an ICS advisory from CISA which includes CVE-2022-2793 among other CVEs.

**CVE-2022-2793**

*   **Root Cause:** Missing Support for Integrity Check
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of authentication or authorization of data packets after establishing a connection for the SRTP protocol in Proficy Machine Edition Version 9.00 and prior.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to remote hidden code execution on the connected programmable logic controller (PLC).
*  **Attack Vectors:** Physical access
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires physical access to the affected device and user interaction.

The advisory also lists additional vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2022-2792**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper Access Control
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper access control lists for project data directories in Proficy Machine Edition Version 9.00 and prior.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Modification or deletion of project data.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Local access
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires local access to the machine with low privileges and user interaction.

**CVE-2022-2791**

*   **Root Cause:** Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The software uploads any file written into the PLC logic folder to the connected PLC without any verification in Proficy Machine Edition Version 9.00 and prior.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Upload of malicious files to the connected PLC.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Local access
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires local access to the machine with low privileges and user interaction.

**CVE-2022-2790**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of proper verification of compiled logic (PDT files) and data blocks (BLD/BLK files) in Proficy Machine Edition Version 9.00 and prior.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Upload of malicious code.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Local access
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires local access to the machine with low privileges and user interaction.

**CVE-2022-2789**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The software can display logic different than the compiled logic in Proficy Machine Edition Version 9.00 and prior.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The user may believe that the displayed logic is the logic that is being executed.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Local access
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires local access to the machine with no privileges and user interaction.

**CVE-2022-2788**

*   **Root Cause:** Path Traversal: '\..\FILENAME'
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Vulnerable to a ZipSlip attack through an upload procedure, which enables attackers to implant a malicious .BLZ file on the PLC in Proficy Machine Edition Version 9.80 and prior.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The malicious code can then execute on a Windows machine.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Local access
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires local access to the machine with low privileges and user interaction.
