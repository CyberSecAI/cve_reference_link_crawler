Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-2793:

**CVE-2022-2793**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Missing support for integrity check in Proficy Machine Edition. Specifically, after establishing a connection for the SRTP protocol, there is no authentication or authorization of data packets.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Lack of integrity check on data packets transmitted via the SRTP protocol.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to remote hidden code execution on the connected Programmable Logic Controller (PLC).
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network-based attacks exploiting the SRTP protocol.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need network access to the affected device and to be able to send manipulated data packets via the SRTP protocol.
