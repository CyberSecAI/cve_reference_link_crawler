Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input in the `emp_fname`, `emp_lname`, `emp_nat_idno`, and `emp_addr` parameters. These parameters are directly echoed into the HTML code without any filtering or encoding, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application stores unsanitized user input, which is later displayed to other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking (stealing cookies)
  - Defacement of the website
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of users
  - Stealing user's sensitive data

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the vulnerable input fields, specifically `emp_fname`, `emp_lname`, `emp_nat_idno`, and `emp_addr`, located in the `/admin/admin-add-employee.php` and `/admin/admin-update-employee.php` pages. This payload is then stored in the application's database and executed when the page is rendered for any user who accesses the affected pages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an authenticated session as an administrator to access the vulnerable pages and input fields.
- The attacker must have the ability to submit the malicious payload through the forms in the `/admin/admin-add-employee.php` and `/admin/admin-update-employee.php` pages.
