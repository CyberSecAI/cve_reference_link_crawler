Product Support Notices

Discontinuation of Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 1.2 in a future major vSphere release: VMware intends in a future major vSphere release to discontinue

support of TPM 1.2 and associated features such as TPM 1.2 with TXT. To get full use of vSphere features, you can use TPM 2.0 instead of TPM 1.2. Support for

TPM 1.2 continues in all vSphere 7.0.x releases, updates, and patches. However, you will not see a deprecation warning for TPM 1.2 during installation or updates

of 7.0.x releases.

Your vCenter Server system must reboot after an update to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 2c: After updating your vCenter Server system to version vCenter

Server 7.0 Update 2c from a previous version of vCenter Server 7.0.x, a reboot is required to ensure critical kernel patches are applied. You must manually

restart vCenter Server.

Resolved Issues

The resolved issues are grouped as follows.

Storage Issues

Security Issues

vSAN Issues

vCenter Server and vSphere Client Issues

Installation, Upgrade and Migration Issues

Auto Deploy Issues

Miscellaneous Issues

vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues

Guest OS Issues

Virtual Machine Management Issues

Networking Issues

vCenter Server High Availability Issues

Storage Issues

NEW: If you have ESXi hosts of version 6.5.x in a vCenter Server system of version 7.0 Update 2 and later, some vSphere Web Services API calls might not

work on such hosts

Some managed objects in ESXi 6.5.x, such as vim.vslm.vcenter.VStorageObjectManager, define the apiVersion by only 2 digits separated by a single dot, such as <a>.

<b>. However, starting from vCenter Server 7.0 Update 2, for some tasks, such as deleteVStorage_task, the apiVersion must be defined by a minimum of 3 digits.

For example <a>.<b>.<c> or <a>.<b>.<c>.<d>. As a result, when you use the deleteVStorage_task method on an ESXi host of version 6.5.x in a vCenter Server system

of version 7.0 Update 2 and later, it does not complete successfully. If you use a Java client, you see an error such as A specified parameter was not correct:

version.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You cannot register Dell EMC Unity 500 or 600 vSphere API for Storage Awareness (VASA) provider to a vCenter Server system

Attempts to register a Dell EMC Unity 500 or 600 VASA provider to a vCenter Server system from Configure > Security > Storage Providers persistently fail with

an error. In the vSphere Client, you see the message A problem was encountered while provisioning a VMware Certificate Authority (VMCA) signed certificate for

the provider. The issue occurs in both fresh installations and upgraded environments.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vCenter Server upgrades fail, because in the GUI installer you do not see the option to change the export directory to a larger partition

In stage 2 of the vCenter Server upgrade, you do not see the option to change the export directory to a larger partition from the default. As a result, upgrade of

the vCenter Server fails. In the GUI installer, you see an error such as Insufficient space on the source export partition ‘/’.

This issue is resolved in this release. The Export directory option is available.

Security Issues

Updates to OpenSSL library

The OpenSSL-1.1.1 library is updated to version 1.1.1k.

The OpenSSL-1.0.2 library is updated to version 1.0.2y.

Update to cURL

cURL is updated to version 7.74.0.

Update to JRE

Oracle (Sun) JRE is updated to version 8.0.291.

Update to the Python libraries

The Python 3.7 library is updated to version 3.7.10.

Update to the Spring Framework

The Spring Framework is updated to version 5.2.13.

Update to the Apache Tomcat server

The Apache Tomcat server is updated to version 8.5.63.

Responses from a remote web server on port 9087 might not have an HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) response header

Responses from a remote web server on port 9087 might lack an HSTS response header and allow unencrypted connections.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Upgrade of Eclipse Jetty

Eclipse Jetty is upgraded to version 9.4.39.

vSAN Issues

You see incorrect scheduled time for resynchronization tasks in a vSAN cluster

In a vSAN cluster, when you navigate to Monitor > vSAN > Resyncing Objects to see the status of ongoing, scheduled or pending resynchronization tasks,

the Scheduled resyncing time might be in the past. The issue occurs only when the Object repair timer value is set to a big number, 36000 minutes and more, as

compared to the default 60 min.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vCenter Server services might fail due to full log directory

In rare cases, if the vmware-vsan-health-service.log fails to rotate, vCenter Server services might fail when the log directory becomes full.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vCenter Server and vSphere Client Issues

You see only CPU, Memory and Hard disks in the Edit Settings dialog box of some virtual machines

When a virtual machine has 6 or more hard disks, the Hard disks section in the Edit Settings dialog box takes most of the screen. As a result, you have the

impression that the Edit Settings dialog box displays only CPU, Memory and Hard disks from the virtual machine settings. All settings are available if you scroll

down in the dialog box.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Installation, Upgrade and Migration Issues

You cannot log in to your vCenter Server system after a multi-step upgrade to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 2

If you perform a multi-step upgrade of your vCenter Server system with an external Platform Services Controller from 5.5 to 6.0 to 6.5 to 6.7 to 7.0 Update 2, the

original trusted roots might be missing from the VMware Endpoint Certificate Store (VECS) and tokens issued by the Security Token Service (STS) appear as

invalid. As a result, you cannot log in to the vCenter Center system after the upgrade. In the vSphere Client, you see a message similar to [500] An error occurred

while fetching identity providers. Try again.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You see an unexpected error message in Update Planner

If the PNID of the management network of your vCenter Server system contains lower and upper case characters, the Update Planner fails to fetch updates and

generate interoperability reports. In the vSphere Client, you see an error such as Unexpected error occurred while fetching the updates.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Auto Deploy Issues

Due to a caching issue, ESXi hosts might fail to boot from Auto Deploy after an upgrade to vCenter Server 7.0 and later

After you upgrade your system to vCenter Server 7.0 and later, stale cache data might cause Auto Deploy to stop provisioning ESXi hosts. The hosts fail with an

error such as Could not boot: HTTP 5xx Server Error.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Miscellaneous Issues

NEW: You see vCenter Server event reports that Trusted Hosts attestation status is unset on every 5 minutes

In the vSphere Client Events tab, you see reports that Trusted Hosts attestation status is unset on every 5 minutes.

Messages are similar to:

Description: dd/mm/yyyy, hh:mm:ss

Trusted Host attestation status unset.

Type: Information

Target: Event

Type ID: com.vmware.vc.TaHostAttestUnsetEven

This issue is resolved in this release.

A ConfigTarget call delays virtual machine response time

A ConfigTarget call that determines VM configuration choices regarding available ESXi host resources might cause a delay in acquiring disk information from the

host. As a result, you might see a delay in virtual machine response time. For example, opening the Edit Settings of a VM takes unusually long.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix optimizes ConfigTarget VMODL API requests.

You do not see historical data in Performance Charts in the vSphere Client

You see real-time data, but no historical data for the past day, week or month in the Performance Charts in the vSphere Client. The stats data is present in the

vCenter Server database, but not displayed.

This issue is resolved in this release.

The Host view of vCenter Server performance charts displays a no data error

In the vSphere Client, when you navigate to the Host view of vCenter Server performance charts, you see an error such as no performance data is available for

the currently selected metrics in the Memory Usage, Disk (KBps), Disk (Number), and CPU Usage charts. The issue occurs after an upgrade to vCenter Server 7.0

Update 1.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues

vSphere Lifecycle Manager cluster image scan fails with a VIB relation error when the image contains the Intel-icen Component

If you add the Intel-icen Component to a vSphere Lifecycle Manager image by using a vendor add-on or as a standalone Component, vSphere Lifecycle Manager

might not handle the custom Component properly as a replacement of the icen Component in the base image. In the vSphere Client, you see an error such as

Component metadata error or VIB relation error.

In the imageservice.log, you see logs such as:

ERROR Generating effective image failed: Final validation failed with these errors: "["File path of '/usr/lib/vmware/vmkmod/icen' is claimed by multiple non-

overlay VIBs: {'VMW_bootbank_icen_', 'INT_bootbank_icen_'}", "File path of '/usr/share/hwdata/default.pciids.d/icen.ids' is claimed by multiple non-overlay

VIBs: ... .

This issue is resolved in this release.

vCenter Server 7.0 Update 2 does not support No Proxy settings

No Proxy configurations of hardware support manager plug-ins or local depot servers do not work on vCenter Server 7.0 Update 2.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Guest OS Issues

You see low-memory warnings for vCenter Server even when the system is not busy

A kernel memory accounting issue might cause vCenter Server to consume more memory than usual, even when the system is not busy. In the vCenter Server

Appliance Management Interface (VAMI) you see a warning such as Appliance is running low on Memory. Add more memory to the machine.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Virtual Machine Management Issues

If host encryption mode does not automatically switch on, all encrypted VMs in the host might be in a locked state

In rare occasions, host encryption mode might not be automatically enabled when vSphere Native Key Provider or a trusted key provider register virtual

machines for encryption. For example, after you complete a test recovery of your system by using the Site Recovery Manager. As a result, all encrypted VMs in

the host might be in a locked state.

This issue is resolved in this release.

After a vCenter Server or ESXi host reboot, all encrypted VMs in the host might be in a locked state

In rare cases, vCenter Server might lose track of virtual machine keys reference records on an ESXi host. As a result, after a restart of the vCenter Server or the

host, all encrypted virtual machines in that host are in a locked state.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure that vCenter Server never clears VM key reference records in the vCenter Server database, even if host

encryption fails.

Networking Issues

When you create a distributed port group, you do not see any ESXi hosts in the ESXi hosts list

After you add a distributed port group to a vSphere Distributed Switch, you might not see any ESXi hosts in the ESXi hosts list, although you have hosts

connected to the VDS.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vCenter Server High Availability Issues

If the Active Directory domain in your vCenter Single Sign-On is an external identity source, vCenter Server High Availability deployment might fail

If the Active Directory domain in your vCenter Single Sign-On is an external identity source, vCenter Server High Availability deployment might fail with an error

that PostgreSQL server is not configured correctly.

This issue is resolved in this release.

VM Component Protection (VMCP) does not respond to All Paths Down (APD) events

If you have VMCP enabled in your vSphere environment, a rare issue with the vSphere High Availability management agent on ESXi hosts, FDM, might prevent

response to APD events. As a result, affected virtual machines do not restart on another host.

In the /var/log/vobd.log file you see messages such as:

2021-03-11T09:49:57.123Z: [APDCorrelator] 460296002450us: [vob.storage.apd.timeout] Device or filesystem with identifier [naa.600601607b477826e60ef95ed62e643f]

has entered the All Paths Down Timeout state after being in the All Paths Down state for 140 seconds. I/Os will now be fast failed.

In the /var/log/fdm.log file, you see messages such as:

2021-03-11T09:49:57.754Z warning fdm[2104475] [Originator@6876 sub=Election opID=SWI-3ab50c2a] IM reprts no locally accessible datastores

This issue is resolved in this release.

Known Issues

The known issues are grouped as follows.

Installation, Upgrade and Migration Issues

vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues

vCenter Server and vSphere Client Issues

Known Issues from Prior Releases

Installation, Upgrade and Migration Issues

ESXi upgrade from 7.0.x to a later version on a 7.0 vCenter Server system fails

On a vCenter Server system of version 7.0, if you attempt to update ESXi hosts of version 7.0.x to a later version, for example 7.0 Update 1 to 7.0 Update 2a, by

using an vSphere Lifecycle Manager upgrade baseline, the upgrade fails. In the vSphere Client, you see an error such as Upgrade is not supported for host.

Workaround: You must first upgrade your vCenter Server to the required 7.0.x version and then upgrade ESXi hosts by using a vSphere Lifecycle Manager

upgrade baseline. Alternatively, use an interactive upgrade from a CD, DVD or USB, a scripted upgrade, or ESXCLI instead of a vSphere Lifecycle Manager

upgrade baseline.

Upgrade to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 2 by using the GUI installer stops at 50%

Upgrade to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 2 by using the GUI installer stops at 50%. In stage 2 of the deployment, you see an error message such as Unable to

authenticate user.

Workaround: Use https://appliance-IP-address-or-FQDN:5480 in a Web browser to complete the installation.

vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues

When you try to check VMware Tools or VM Hardware compliance status, you see a status 500 error and the check returns no results

In the vSphere Client, when you navigate to the Updates tab of a container object: host, cluster, data center, or vCenter Server instance, to check VMware Tools

or VM Hardware compliance status, you might see a status 500 error. The check works only if you navigate to the Updates tab of a virtual machine.

Workaround: None

vCenter Server and vSphere Client Issues

You cannot migrate vSphere Cluster Services (vCLS) agent virtual machines and see a no privileges error

vSphere admins might not automatically get Containerized Permissions that protect vCLS VMs. As a result, although you have admin permissions, you might not

be able to migrate vCLS VMs. In the vSphere Client, you see an error such as:

You have no privileges to view vCLS (1) object

Workaround: Log out of the vSphere Client and then log in as admin.
