The provided content is related to CVE-2024-33595.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the WordPress Master Addons for Elementor Plugin. This missing check allows an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Broken Access Control: The plugin lacks proper checks to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user (specifically a 'contributor' role is mentioned) can perform actions intended for higher-privileged users, potentially leading to unintended modifications or access to sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the vulnerable function that lacks the necessary access control checks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the 'contributor' privilege to exploit the vulnerability.
