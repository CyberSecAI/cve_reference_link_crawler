2. Use the following options to manage the Access Manager hotfix file:

| Option | Description | Command on Linux server | Command on Windows server |
| -qa | Lists all installed hotfixes. | patch -qa | patch.cmd -qa |
| -q | Lists details of an installed hotfix. | patch âq  Example: patch âq HF3-15 | patch.cmd âq  Example: patch.cmd âq HF3-15 |
| -i | Installs a hotfix. During installation of a hotfix, all running services are stopped temporarily. After a hotfix is installed, all services are restarted and details of the operation are written to log files. | patch âi <location and hotfix name>  Example: patch âi /opt/novell/nam/Patches/AM\_4443/AM\_4443-15.patch | patch.cmd âi <location and hotfix name>  Example: patch.cmd âi C:/Patches/AM\_4443/AM\_4443-15.patch |
| -e | Removes an installed hotfix. The hotfix maintains content relationship among hotfixes. So, if you have installed hotfix 1 and hotfix 2, hotfix 1 cannot be removed without removing hotfix 2. This is because hotfix 2 contains details of hotfix 1 as well.During the hotfix process, all the running services are stopped temporarily. | patch âe <hotfix name>  Example: patch âe HF3-15 | patch.cmd âe <hotfix name>  Example: patch.cmd âe HF3-15 |
| -qpl | Lists details of a hotfix that is not installed. If you want to view the changes that are included in the hotfix file without installing it on your server, use this option | patch âqpl <location and hotfix name>  Example: patch âqpl /opt/novell/nam/Patches/AM\_4443/ AM\_4443-15.patch | patch.cmd âqpl <location and hotfix name>  Example: patch.cmd âqpl C:/Patches/AM\_4443/ AM\_4443-15.patch |
| -v | Verifies integrity of a hotfix. | patch âv <location and hotfix name>  Example: patch âv /opt/novell/nam/Patches/AM\_4443/ AM\_4443-15.patch | patch.cmd âv <location and hotfix name>  Example: patch.cmd âv C:/Patches/AM\_4443/ AM\_4443-15.patch |
| -t | Verifies if services can be restored by the installer. Use this option to stop/start all services after the installation of hotfix. | patch ât <location and hotfix name>  Example: patch ât /opt/novell/nam/Patches/AM\_4443/ AM\_4443-15.patch | patch.cmd ât <location and hotfix name>  Example: patch.cmd ât C:/Patches/AM\_4443/ AM\_4443-15.patch |
