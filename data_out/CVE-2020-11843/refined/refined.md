Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11843:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a potential information leakage when the administrator-enabled debug mode is active within NetIQ Access Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information through the debug mode. The nature of the "information leakage" is not specified in these release notes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to the exposure of sensitive information. The exact nature of the leaked information and the potential impact on security are not detailed.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is related to the administrator enabling debug mode in the application. The debug mode might expose sensitive data through logging or other debugging mechanisms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would likely need to have knowledge of the target system and its configuration to know that the debug mode is active. They may also need to have some means of accessing the debug logs or outputs depending on the nature of the leakage. The release note does not clarify how this information would be exposed, so specific capabilities are hard to define.

**Summary**
The content indicates a vulnerability exists when debug mode is enabled in NetIQ Access Manager. This could leak potentially sensitive information. The fixes are included in Access Manager 4.4 Service Pack 4 Hotfix 3 (4.4.4.3) and Access Manager 4.5 Service Pack 2 Hotfix 1 (4.5.2.1).
