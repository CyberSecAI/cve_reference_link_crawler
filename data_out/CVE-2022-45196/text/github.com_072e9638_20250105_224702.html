| System information: version: fabric 2.3 OS: ubuntu 20.04  Experiments setup: Using first-network in <https://github.com/SmartBFT-Go/fabric-samples>. Repeatedly sending fuzzed channel tx with the same Channel name.  Expected behavior: Orderers run as usual.  Actual behaviour: orderers crash down, and can not be recovered.  Bug location: <https://github.com/SmartBFT-Go/fabric/blob/release-2.3-bft/orderer/common/multichannel/registrar.go>  ``` // CreateChain makes the Registrar create a consensus.Chain with the given name. func (r *Registrar) CreateChain(chainName string) { 	lf, err := r.ledgerFactory.GetOrCreate(chainName) 	if err != nil { 		logger.Panicf("Failed obtaining ledger factory for %s: %v", chainName, err) 	} 	chain := r.GetChain(chainName) 	if chain != nil { 		logger.Infof("A chain of type %T for channel %s already exists. "+ 			"Halting it.", chain.Chain, chainName) 		chain.Halt() 	} 	r.newChain(configTx(lf)) }   ```  In line 529, should not panic directly.  log info:  ``` 2022-11-06 03:12:09.321 UTC [orderer.commmon.multichannel] createNewChain -> PANI 028 Error creating chain support: error creating consenter for channel: fuzztest: failed to restore persisted raft data: failed to create or read WAL: failed to open WAL: fileutil: file already locked panic: Error creating chain support: error creating consenter for channel: fuzztest:  failed to create or read WAL: failed to open WAL: fileutil: file already locked  goroutine 118 [running]: go.uber.org/zap/zapcore.(*CheckedEntry).Write(0xc00002c000, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0) /go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/vendor/go.uber.org/zap/zapcore/entry.go:230 +0x545   ``` |

| I remember that to create a channel you need to sign the transaction by enough administrators in the network. I think you can restrict it to a threshold of a majority, so I am not sure this is possible in a production network.  In any case, can you check the same problem on the official Fabric with Raft? |

| Sorry for the delayed response.  In the oficial Fabric with Raft, there are a locking mechanism in function 'CreateChain' and a exsiting name check in function 'newChain' to prevent this problem. The detailed code is in : [hyperledger@9da0410](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/commit/9da0410f622e49d92750ace50246ac75c381ac0a)  ``` func (r *Registrar) CreateChain(chainName string) { 	lf, err := r.ledgerFactory.GetOrCreate(chainName) 	if err != nil { 		logger.Panicf("Failed obtaining ledger factory for %s: %v", chainName, err) 	} 	chain := r.GetChain(chainName) 	if chain != nil { 		logger.Infof("A chain of type %T for channel %s already exists. "+ 			"Halting it.", chain.Chain, chainName) 		r.lock.Lock() 		chain.Halt() 		delete(r.chains, chainName) 		r.lock.Unlock() 	} 	r.newChain(configTx(lf)) }  ```  ``` func (r *Registrar) newChain(configtx *cb.Envelope) { 	r.lock.Lock() 	defer r.lock.Unlock()  	channelName, err := channelNameFromConfigTx(configtx) 	if err != nil { 		logger.Warnf("Failed extracting channel name: %v", err) 		return 	}  	// fixes https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/issues/2931 	if existingChain, exists := r.chains[channelName]; exists { 		if _, isRaftChain := existingChain.Chain.(*etcdraft.Chain); isRaftChain { 			logger.Infof("Channel %s already created, skipping its creation", channelName) 			return 		} 	}  	cs := r.createNewChain(configtx) 	cs.start() 	logger.Infof("Created and started new channel %s", cs.ChannelID()) }  ```  Maybe similar mechnism should be added here? |

| That's why I asked you to check in Fabric... I know this bug.  [hyperledger#2934](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/2934)  Do you want to push a fix? |
