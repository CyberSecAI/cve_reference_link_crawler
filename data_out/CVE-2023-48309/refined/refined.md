{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way NextAuth.js handles JWTs during an interrupted OAuth sign-in flow. Specifically, it was possible to obtain a JWT containing minimal information (just an opaque randomly generated string) from an interrupted flow (state, PKCE, or nonce), and then use this to bypass the basic authentication middleware. The middleware would interpret the presence of a valid (but minimal) JWT as an authenticated session.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper session handling",
      "Insufficient validation of JWT content in middleware"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could create a mock session by manually setting the `next-auth.session-token` cookie to a minimal JWT obtained from an interrupted OAuth flow. This would allow the attacker to bypass the basic authentication middleware and access pages that are supposed to be protected, although not access any specific user data. The user would have no associated information (name, email, access_token, etc.), and this vulnerability does not grant access to other users' data or resources that require proper authorization via scopes or other means.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, requiring the attacker to intercept or obtain a partially-created JWT from a OAuth flow, and then manually set a cookie in the victim's browser.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to obtain a NextAuth.js-issued JWT from an interrupted OAuth flow and have the ability to manipulate browser cookies."
