# Possible user mocking that bypasses basic authentication

Moderate

published
GHSA-v64w-49xw-qq89
Nov 20, 2023

## Package

npm

next-auth
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<4.24.5

## Patched versions

4.24.5

## Description

### Impact

`next-auth` applications prior to version **4.24.5** that rely on the default [Middleware authorization](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/nextjs#middleware) are affected.

A bad actor could create an empty/mock user, by getting hold of a NextAuth.js-issued JWT from an interrupted OAuth sign-in flow (state, PKCE or nonce).

Manually overriding the `next-auth.session-token` cookie value with this non-related JWT would let the user simulate a logged in user, albeit having no user information associated with it. (The only property on this user is an opaque randomly generated string).

This vulnerability does **not** give access to other users' data, neither to resources that require proper authorization via scopes or other means. The created mock user has no information associated with it (ie. no name, email, access\_token, etc.)

This vulnerability can be exploited by bad actors to peek at logged in user states (e.g. dashboard layout).

*Note: Regardless of the vulnerability, the existence of a NextAuth.js session state can provide simple authentication, but not authorization in your applications. For role-based access control, you can check out [our guide](https://authjs.dev/guides/basics/role-based-access-control).*

### Patches

We patched the vulnerability in `next-auth` `v4.24.5`. To upgrade, run one of the following:

```
npm i next-auth@latest

```

```
yarn add next-auth@latest

```

```
pnpm add next-auth@latest

```
### Workarounds

Upgrading to `latest` is the recommended way to fix this issue. However, using [a custom authorization callback for Middleware](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/nextjs#advanced-usage), developers can manually do a basic authentication:

```
// middleware.ts
import { withAuth } from "next-auth/middleware"

export default withAuth(/*your middleware function*/, {
  // checking the existence of any property - besides `value` which might be a random string - on the `token` object is sufficient to prevent this vulnerability
  callbacks: { authorized: ({ token }) => !!token?.email }
})
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
