**Content Description:**

The provided content consists of two separate HTML documents: one from `packetstormsecurity.com` and the other from `github.com`. The `packetstormsecurity.com` content appears to be a generic webpage with a menu and footer. The `github.com` content displays the page of a GitHub repository named "Liferay_exploit_Poc", which contains a single Python file called `Life_ray exploit.py`.

**CVE Relevance:**

The content from the GitHub repository, specifically the existence of a repository named "Liferay_exploit_Poc" and a file named `Life_ray exploit.py`, suggests that it might contain proof-of-concept exploit code for a vulnerability in Liferay.

However, the provided content alone does not contain the vulnerability details for CVE-2021-33990. To confirm this, it would be necessary to review the contents of the `Life_ray exploit.py` file and compare that with the official description of CVE-2021-33990.
