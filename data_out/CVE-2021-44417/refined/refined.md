The provided content is related to CVE-2021-44417.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `cgiserver.cgi` JSON command parser in Reolink RLC-410W camera improperly handles JSON parameters, specifically when a JSON object is expected but a different type, such as a string, is provided. This leads to an assertion failure within the parsing code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-20 - Improper Input Validation:** The `cgiserver.cgi` does not validate the type of the `param` JSON element in API requests. It assumes a JSON object when parsing, leading to a crash if a different type is provided.
- Improper handling of JSON parameters, specifically the `param` field.

**Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit of this vulnerability results in a denial of service. The `cgiserver.cgi` process crashes due to an assertion failure, which will ultimately cause the device to reboot.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint.
- The HTTP request includes a JSON array in the body with a command and the `param` set to a string instead of a JSON object. For example: `[{"cmd": "GetAlarm", "action": 0, "param": ""}]`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the Reolink RLC-410W camera.
- While most commands require a valid session token (authentication), this can be bypassed using TALOS-2021-1420.

**Specific details for CVE-2021-44417:**
- The specific vulnerability is triggered by sending a request to the `GetAlarm` API with a `param` that is not a JSON object (e.g., an empty string).
- This triggers an assertion failure within the JSON parsing code, causing the `cgiserver.cgi` process to crash and the device to reboot.
