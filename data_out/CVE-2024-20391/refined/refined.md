- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication on a specific function within the Network Access Manager (NAM) module of Cisco Secure Client for Windows.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Lack of authentication, which allows for unauthorized access to a privileged function.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with *SYSTEM* privileges on an affected device. This would grant the attacker complete control over the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the affected device is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs physical access to the machine running the vulnerable Cisco Secure Client for Windows with the NAM module installed. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the system.
