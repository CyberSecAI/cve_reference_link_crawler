## Description

Plane version 0.7.1 allows an unauthenticated attacker to view all stored
server files of all users.

## Vulnerability

In the application users can change the photo of their avatar and upload
different types of files of different extensions which are all stored in
the same folder and there is no restriction. Any unauthenticated person
can access and download the resources. Knowing that Plane is created to
create issues on projects and manage them, this is critical, because if
bugs are reported on an application, an attacker can obtain the evidence
and files of the same issue.

## Exploit

## Evidence of exploitation

the server.
