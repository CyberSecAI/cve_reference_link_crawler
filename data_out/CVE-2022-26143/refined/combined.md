# CVE-2022-26143: TP240PhoneHome reflection/amplification DDoS attack vector

03/08/2022

* [![Alex Forster](/TX3t7/a22e24bf3db8b089c4431410c4844c43aa976a11.png)](https://archive.ph/o/TX3t7/https%3A//blog.cloudflare.com/author/alex-forster/)
  [Alex Forster](https://archive.ph/o/TX3t7/https%3A//blog.cloudflare.com/author/alex-forster)

Beginning in mid-February 2022, security researchers, network operators, and security vendors observed a spike in DDoS attacks sourced from UDP port 10074 targeting broadband access ISPs, financial institutions, logistics companies, and organizations in other vertical markets.Upon further investigation, it was determined that the devices abused to launch these attacks are MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems produced by [Mitel](https://archive.ph/o/TX3t7/https%3A//www.mitel.com/), which incorporate TP-240 VoIP- processing interface cards and supporting software; their primary function is to provide Internet-based site-to-site voice connectivity for PBX systems.Approximately 2600 of these systems have been incorrectly provisioned so that an unauthenticated system test facility has been inadvertently exposed to the public Internet, allowing attackers to leverage these PBX VoIP gateways as DDoS reflectors/amplifiers.Mitel is aware that these systems are being abused to facilitate high-pps (packets-per-second) DDoS attacks, and have been actively working with customers to remediate abusable devices with patched software that disables public access to the system test facility.In this blog, we will further explore the observed activity, explain how the driver has been abused, and share recommended mitigation steps. This research was created cooperatively among a team of researchers from Akamai SIRT, Cloudflare, Lumen Black Lotus Labs, NETSCOUT ASERT, TELUS, Team Cymru, and The Shadowserver Foundation.
### DDoS attacks in the wild

While spikes of network traffic associated with the vulnerable service were observed on January 8th and February 7,th 2022, we believe the first actual attacks leveraging the exploit began on February 18th.Observed attacks were primarily predicated on packets-per-second, or throughput, and appeared to be UDP reflection/amplification attacks sourced from UDP/10074 that were mainly directed towards destination ports UDP/80 and UDP/443. The single largest observed attack of this type preceding this one was approximately 53 Mpps and 23 Gbps. The average packet size for that attack was approximately 60 bytes, with an attack duration of approximately 5 minutes. The amplified attack packets are not fragmented.This particular attack vector differs from most UDP reflection/amplification attack methodologies in that the exposed system test facility can be abused to launch a sustained DDoS attack of up to 14 hours in duration by means of *a single spoofed attack initiation packet*, resulting in a record-setting packet amplification ratio of *4,294,967,296:1*. A controlled test of this DDoS attack vector yielded more than 400 Mmpps of sustained DDoS attack traffic.It should be noted that this single-packet attack initiation capability has the effect of precluding network operator traceback of the spoofed attack initiator traffic. This helps mask the attack traffic generation infrastructure, making it less likely that the attack origin can be traced compared with other UDP reflection/amplification DDoS attack vectors.
### Abusing the tp240dvr driver

The abused service on affected Mitel systems is called tp240dvr (“TP-240 driver”) and appears to run as a software bridge to facilitate interactions with TDM/VoIP PCI interface cards. The service listens for commands on UDP/10074 and is not meant to be exposed to the Internet, as confirmed by the manufacturer of these devices. It is this exposure to the Internet that ultimately allows it to be abused.The tp240dvr service exposes an unusual command that is designed to stress-test its clients in order to facilitate debugging and performance testing. This command can be abused to cause the tp240dvr service to send this stress-test to attack victims. The traffic consists of a high rate of short informative status update packets that can potentially overwhelm victims and cause the DDoS scenario.This command can also be abused by attackers to launch very high-throughput attacks. Attackers can use specially-crafted commands to cause the tp240dvr service to send larger informative status update packets, significantly increasing the amplification ratio.By extensively testing isolated virtual TP-240-based systems in a lab setting, researchers were able to cause these devices to generate massive amounts of traffic in response to comparatively small request payloads. We will cover this attack scenario in greater technical depth in the following sections.
### Calculating the potential attack impact

As previously mentioned, amplification via this abusable test facility differs substantially from how it is accomplished with most other UDP reflection/amplification DDoS vectors. Typically, reflection/amplification attacks require the attacker to continuously transmit malicious payloads to abusable nodes for as long as they wish to attack the victim. In the case of TP-240 reflection/amplification, this continuous transmission is not necessary to launch high-impact DDoS attacks.Instead, an attacker leveraging TP-240 reflection/amplification can launch a high-impact DDoS attack using a single packet. Examination of the tp240dvr binary reveals that, due to its design, an attacker can theoretically cause the service to emit 2,147,483,647 responses to a single malicious command. Each response generates two packets on the wire, leading to approximately 4,294,967,294 amplified attack packets being directed toward the attack victim.For each response to a command, the first packet contains a counter that increments with each sent response. As the counter value increments, the size of this first packet will grow from 36 bytes to 45 bytes. The second packet contains diagnostic output from the function, which can be influenced by the attacker. By optimizing each initiator packet to maximize the size of the second packet, every command will result in amplified packets that are up to 1,184 bytes in length.In theory, a single abusable node generating the upper limit of 4,294,967,294 packets at a rate of 80kpps would result in an attack duration of roughly 14 hours. Over the course of the attack, the “counter” packets alone would generate roughly 95.5GB of amplified attack traffic destined for the targeted network. The maximally-padded “diagnostic output” packets would account for an additional 2.5TB of attack traffic directed towards the target.This would yield a sustained flood of just under 393mb/sec of attack traffic from a single reflector/amplifier, all resulting from a single spoofed attack initiator packet of only 1,119 bytes in length. This results in a nearly unimaginable amplification ratio of 2,200,288,816:1 — a multiplier of *220 billion percent*, triggered by a single packet.
### Upper boundaries of attack volume and simultaneity

The tp240dvr service processes commands using a single thread. This means they can only process a single command at a time, and thus can only be used to launch one attack at a time. In the example scenario presented above, during the 14 hours that the abused device would be attacking the target, it cannot be leveraged to attack any other target. This is somewhat unique in the context of DDoS reflection/amplification vectors.Although this characteristic also causes the tp240dvr service to be unavailable to legitimate users, it is much preferable to having these devices be leveraged in parallel by multiple attackers — and leaving legitimate operators of these systems to wonder why their outbound Internet data capacity is being consumed at much higher rates.Additionally, it appears these devices are on relatively low-powered hardware, in terms of their traffic-generation capabilities. On an Internet where 100/Gbps links, dozens of CPU cores, and multi-threading capabilities have become commonplace, we can all be thankful this abusable service is not found on top-of-the-line hardware platforms capable of individually generating millions of packets per second, and running with thousands of parallelized threads.Lastly, it is also good news that of the tens of thousands of these devices, which have been purchased and deployed historically by governments, commercial enterprises, and other organizations worldwide, a relatively small number of them have been configured in a manner that leaves them in this abusable state, and of those, many have been properly secured and taken offline from an attacker’s perspective.
### Collateral impact

The collateral impact of TP-240 reflection/amplification attacks is potentially significant for organizations with Internet-exposed Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems that are abused as DDoS reflectors/amplifiers.This may include partial or full interruption of voice communications through these systems, as well as additional service disruption due to transit capacity consumption, state-table exhaustion of NATs, and stateful firewalls, etc.Wholesale filtering of all UDP/10074-sourced traffic by network operators may potentially overblock legitimate Internet traffic, and is therefore contraindicated.
### Recommended actions

TP-240 reflection/amplification DDoS attacks are sourced from UDP/10074 and destined for the UDP port of the attacker’s choice. This amplified attack traffic can be detected, classified, traced back, and safely mitigated using standard DDoS defense tools and techniques.Flow telemetry and packet capture via open-source and commercial analysis systems can alert network operators and end customers of TP-240 reflection/amplification attacks.Network access control lists (ACLs), flowspec, destination-based remotely triggered blackhole (D/RTBH), source-based remotely triggered blackhole (S/RTBH), and intelligent DDoS mitigation systems can be used to mitigate these attacks.Network operators should perform reconnaissance to identify and facilitate remediation of abusable TP-240 reflectors/amplifiers on their networks and/or the networks of their customers.  Operators of Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems should proactively contact Mitel in order to receive specific remediation instructions from the vendor.Organizations with business-critical public-facing Internet properties should ensure that all relevant network infrastructure, architectural, and operational Best Current Practices (BCPs) have been implemented, including situationally specific network access policies that only permit Internet traffic via required IP protocols and ports. Internet access network traffic to/from internal organizational personnel should be isolated from Internet traffic to/from public-facing Internet properties, and served via separate upstream Internet transit links.DDoS defenses for all public-facing Internet properties and supporting infrastructure should be implemented in a situationally appropriate manner, including periodic testing to ensure that any changes to the organization’s servers/services/applications are incorporated into its DDoS defense plan.It is imperative that organizations operating mission-critical public-facing Internet properties and/or infrastructure ensure that all servers/services/application/datastores/infrastructure elements are protected against DDoS attack, and are included in periodic, realistic tests of the organization’s DDoS mitigation plan. Critical ancillary supporting services such as authoritative and recursive DNS servers must be included in this plan.Network operators should implement ingress and egress source address validation in order to prevent attackers from initiating reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.All potential DDoS attack mitigation measures described in this document ***MUST*** be tested and customized in a situationally appropriate manner prior to deployment on production networks.
### Mitigating factors

Operators of Internet-exposed TP-240-based Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems can prevent abuse of their systems to launch DDoS attacks by blocking incoming Internet traffic destined for UDP/10074 via access control lists (ACLs), firewall rules, and other standard network access control policy enforcement mechanisms.Mitel have provided patched software versions that prevent TP-240-equipped MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems from being abused as DDoS reflectors/amplifiers by preventing exposure of the service to the Internet. Mitel customers should contact the vendor for remediation instructions.Collateral impact to abusable TP-240 reflectors/amplifiers can alert network operators and/or end-customers to remove affected systems from “demilitarized zone” (DMZ) networks or Internet Data Centers (IDCs), or to disable relevant UDP port-forwarding rules that allow specific UDP/10074 traffic sourced from the public Internet to reach these devices, thereby preventing them from being abused to launch reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.The amplified attack traffic is not fragmented, so there is no additional attack component consisting of non-initial fragments, as is the case with many other UDP reflection/amplification DDoS vectors.Implementation of ingress and egress source-address validation (SAV; also known as anti-spoofing) can prevent attackers from launching reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.
### Conclusion

Unfortunately, many abusable services that should not be exposed to the public Internet are nevertheless left open for attackers to exploit. This scenario is yet another example of real-world deployments not adhering to vendor guidance. Vendors can prevent this situation by adopting “safe by default” postures on devices before shipping.Reflection/amplification DDoS attacks would be impossible to launch if all network operators implemented ingress and egress source-address validation (SAV, also known as anti-spoofing).  The ability to spoof the IP address(es) of the intended attack target(s) is required to launch such attacks. Service providers must continue to implement SAV in their own networks, and require that their downstream customers do so.As is routinely the case with newer DDoS attack vectors, it appears that after an initial period of employment by advanced attackers with access to bespoke DDoS attack infrastructure, TP-240 reflection/amplification has been weaponized and added to the arsenals of so-called “booter/stresser” DDoS-for-hire services, placing it within the reach of the general attacker population.Collaboration across the operational, research, and vendor communities is central to the continued viability of the Internet. The quick response to and ongoing remediation of this high-impact DDoS attack vector has only been possible as a result of such collaboration. Organizations with a vested interest in the stability and resiliency of the Internet should embrace and support cross-industry cooperative efforts as a core principle.The combined efforts of the research and mitigation task force demonstrates that successful collaboration across industry peers to quickly remediate threats to availability and resiliency is not only possible, but is also increasingly critical for the continued viability of the global Internet.

Beginning in mid-February 2022, security researchers, network operators, and security vendors observed a spike in DDoS attacks sourced from [UDP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/) port 10074 targeting broadband access ISPs, financial institutions, logistics companies, and organizations in other vertical markets.

Upon further investigation, it was determined that the devices abused to launch these attacks are MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems produced by [Mitel](https://www.mitel.com), which incorporate TP-240 VoIP- processing interface cards and supporting software; their primary function is to provide Internet-based site-to-site voice connectivity for PBX systems.

Approximately 2600 of these systems have been incorrectly provisioned so that an unauthenticated system test facility has been inadvertently exposed to the public Internet, allowing attackers to leverage these PBX VoIP gateways as DDoS reflectors/amplifiers.

Mitel is aware that these systems are being abused to facilitate high-pps (packets-per-second) DDoS attacks, and have been actively working with customers to remediate abusable devices with patched software that disables public access to the system test facility.

In this blog, we will further explore the observed activity, explain how the driver has been abused, and share recommended mitigation steps. This research was created cooperatively among a team of researchers from Akamai SIRT, Cloudflare, Lumen Black Lotus Labs, NETSCOUT ASERT, TELUS, Team Cymru, and The Shadowserver Foundation.

### DDoS attacks in the wild

While spikes of network traffic associated with the vulnerable service were observed on January 8th and February 7,th 2022, we believe the first actual attacks leveraging the exploit began on February 18th.

Observed attacks were primarily predicated on packets-per-second, or throughput, and appeared to be UDP reflection/amplification attacks sourced from UDP/10074 that were mainly directed towards destination ports UDP/80 and UDP/443. The single largest observed attack of this type preceding this one was approximately 53 Mpps and 23 Gbps. The average packet size for that attack was approximately 60 bytes, with an attack duration of approximately 5 minutes. The amplified attack packets are not fragmented.

This particular attack vector differs from most UDP reflection/amplification attack methodologies in that the exposed system test facility can be abused to launch a sustained DDoS attack of up to 14 hours in duration by means of *a single spoofed attack initiation packet*, resulting in a record-setting packet amplification ratio of *4,294,967,296:1*. A controlled test of this DDoS attack vector yielded more than 400 Mmpps of sustained DDoS attack traffic.

It should be noted that this single-packet attack initiation capability has the effect of precluding network operator traceback of the spoofed attack initiator traffic. This helps mask the attack traffic generation infrastructure, making it less likely that the attack origin can be traced compared with other UDP reflection/amplification DDoS attack vectors.

### Abusing the tp240dvr driver

The abused service on affected Mitel systems is called tp240dvr (âTP-240 driverâ) and appears to run as a software bridge to facilitate interactions with TDM/VoIP PCI interface cards. The service listens for commands on UDP/10074 and is not meant to be exposed to the Internet, as confirmed by the manufacturer of these devices. It is this exposure to the Internet that ultimately allows it to be abused.

The tp240dvr service exposes an unusual command that is designed to stress-test its clients in order to facilitate debugging and performance testing. This command can be abused to cause the tp240dvr service to send this stress-test to attack victims. The traffic consists of a high rate of short informative status update packets that can potentially overwhelm victims and cause the DDoS scenario.

This command can also be abused by attackers to launch very high-throughput attacks. Attackers can use specially-crafted commands to cause the tp240dvr service to send larger informative status update packets, significantly increasing the amplification ratio.

By extensively testing isolated virtual TP-240-based systems in a lab setting, researchers were able to cause these devices to generate massive amounts of traffic in response to comparatively small request payloads. We will cover this attack scenario in greater technical depth in the following sections.

### Calculating the potential attack impact

As previously mentioned, amplification via this abusable test facility differs substantially from how it is accomplished with most other UDP reflection/amplification DDoS vectors. Typically, reflection/amplification attacks require the attacker to continuously transmit malicious payloads to abusable nodes for as long as they wish to attack the victim. In the case of TP-240 reflection/amplification, this continuous transmission is not necessary to launch high-impact DDoS attacks.

Instead, an attacker leveraging TP-240 reflection/amplification can launch a high-impact DDoS attack using a single packet. Examination of the tp240dvr binary reveals that, due to its design, an attacker can theoretically cause the service to emit 2,147,483,647 responses to a single malicious command. Each response generates two packets on the wire, leading to approximately 4,294,967,294 amplified attack packets being directed toward the attack victim.

For each response to a command, the first packet contains a counter that increments with each sent response. As the counter value increments, the size of this first packet will grow from 36 bytes to 45 bytes. The second packet contains diagnostic output from the function, which can be influenced by the attacker. By optimizing each initiator packet to maximize the size of the second packet, every command will result in amplified packets that are up to 1,184 bytes in length.

In theory, a single abusable node generating the upper limit of 4,294,967,294 packets at a rate of 80kpps would result in an attack duration of roughly 14 hours. Over the course of the attack, the âcounterâ packets alone would generate roughly 95.5GB of amplified attack traffic destined for the targeted network. The maximally-padded âdiagnostic outputâ packets would account for an additional 2.5TB of attack traffic directed towards the target.

This would yield a sustained flood of just under 393mb/sec of attack traffic from a single reflector/amplifier, all resulting from a single spoofed attack initiator packet of only 1,119 bytes in length. This results in a nearly unimaginable amplification ratio of 2,200,288,816:1 â a multiplier of *220 billion percent*, triggered by a single packet.

### Upper boundaries of attack volume and simultaneity

The tp240dvr service processes commands using a single thread. This means they can only process a single command at a time, and thus can only be used to launch one attack at a time. In the example scenario presented above, during the 14 hours that the abused device would be attacking the target, it cannot be leveraged to attack any other target. This is somewhat unique in the context of DDoS reflection/amplification vectors.

Although this characteristic also causes the tp240dvr service to be unavailable to legitimate users, it is much preferable to having these devices be leveraged in parallel by multiple attackers â and leaving legitimate operators of these systems to wonder why their outbound Internet data capacity is being consumed at much higher rates.

Additionally, it appears these devices are on relatively low-powered hardware, in terms of their traffic-generation capabilities. On an Internet where 100/Gbps links, dozens of CPU cores, and multi-threading capabilities have become commonplace, we can all be thankful this abusable service is not found on top-of-the-line hardware platforms capable of individually generating millions of packets per second, and running with thousands of parallelized threads.

Lastly, it is also good news that of the tens of thousands of these devices, which have been purchased and deployed historically by governments, commercial enterprises, and other organizations worldwide, a relatively small number of them have been configured in a manner that leaves them in this abusable state, and of those, many have been properly secured and taken offline from an attackerâs perspective.

### Collateral impact

The collateral impact of TP-240 reflection/amplification attacks is potentially significant for organizations with Internet-exposed Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems that are abused as DDoS reflectors/amplifiers.

This may include partial or full interruption of voice communications through these systems, as well as additional service disruption due to transit capacity consumption, state-table exhaustion of NATs, and stateful firewalls, etc.

Wholesale filtering of all UDP/10074-sourced traffic by network operators may potentially overblock legitimate Internet traffic, and is therefore contraindicated.

### Recommended actions

TP-240 reflection/amplification DDoS attacks are sourced from UDP/10074 and destined for the UDP port of the attackerâs choice. This amplified attack traffic can be detected, classified, traced back, and safely mitigated using standard DDoS defense tools and techniques.

Flow telemetry and packet capture via open-source and commercial analysis systems can alert network operators and end customers of TP-240 reflection/amplification attacks.

Network access control lists (ACLs), flowspec, destination-based remotely triggered blackhole (D/RTBH), source-based remotely triggered blackhole (S/RTBH), and intelligent DDoS mitigation systems can be used to mitigate these attacks.

Network operators should perform reconnaissance to identify and facilitate remediation of abusable TP-240 reflectors/amplifiers on their networks and/or the networks of their customers. Â Operators of Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems should proactively contact Mitel in order to receive specific remediation instructions from the vendor.

Organizations with business-critical public-facing Internet properties should ensure that all relevant network infrastructure, architectural, and operational Best Current Practices (BCPs) have been implemented, including situationally specific network access policies that only permit Internet traffic via required IP protocols and ports. Internet access network traffic to/from internal organizational personnel should be isolated from Internet traffic to/from public-facing Internet properties, and served via separate upstream Internet transit links.

[DDoS defenses](https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/) for all public-facing Internet properties and supporting infrastructure should be implemented in a situationally appropriate manner, including periodic testing to ensure that any changes to the organizationâs servers/services/applications are incorporated into its DDoS defense plan.

It is imperative that organizations operating mission-critical public-facing Internet properties and/or infrastructure ensure that all servers/services/application/datastores/infrastructure elements are protected against DDoS attack, and are included in periodic, realistic tests of the organizationâs DDoS mitigation plan. Critical ancillary supporting services such as authoritative and recursive DNS servers must be included in this plan.

Network operators should implement ingress and egress source address validation in order to prevent attackers from initiating reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.

All potential DDoS attack mitigation measures described in this document ***MUST*** be tested and customized in a situationally appropriate manner prior to deployment on production networks.

### Mitigating factors

Operators of Internet-exposed TP-240-based Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems can prevent abuse of their systems to launch DDoS attacks by blocking incoming Internet traffic destined for UDP/10074 via access control lists (ACLs), firewall rules, and other standard network access control policy enforcement mechanisms.

Mitel have provided patched software versions that prevent TP-240-equipped MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems from being abused as DDoS reflectors/amplifiers by preventing exposure of the service to the Internet. Mitel customers should contact the vendor for remediation instructions.

Collateral impact to abusable TP-240 reflectors/amplifiers can alert network operators and/or end-customers to remove affected systems from âdemilitarized zoneâ (DMZ) networks or Internet Data Centers (IDCs), or to disable relevant UDP port-forwarding rules that allow specific UDP/10074 traffic sourced from the public Internet to reach these devices, thereby preventing them from being abused to launch reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.

The amplified attack traffic is not fragmented, so there is no additional attack component consisting of non-initial fragments, as is the case with many other UDP reflection/amplification DDoS vectors.

Implementation of ingress and egress source-address validation (SAV; also known as anti-spoofing) can [prevent attackers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/how-to-prevent-ddos-attacks/) from launching reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.

### Conclusion

Unfortunately, many abusable services that should not be exposed to the public Internet are nevertheless left open for attackers to exploit. This scenario is yet another example of real-world deployments not adhering to vendor guidance. Vendors can prevent this situation by adopting âsafe by defaultâ postures on devices before shipping.

Reflection/amplification DDoS attacks would be impossible to launch if all network operators implemented ingress and egress source-address validation (SAV, also known as anti-spoofing). Â The ability to spoof the IP address(es) of the intended attack target(s) is required to launch such attacks. Service providers must continue to implement SAV in their own networks, and require that their downstream customers do so.

As is routinely the case with newer DDoS attack vectors, it appears that after an initial period of employment by advanced attackers with access to bespoke DDoS attack infrastructure, TP-240 reflection/amplification has been weaponized and added to the arsenals of so-called âbooter/stresserâ DDoS-for-hire services, placing it within the reach of the general attacker population.

Collaboration across the operational, research, and vendor communities is central to the continued viability of the Internet. The quick response to and ongoing remediation of this high-impact DDoS attack vector has only been possible as a result of such collaboration. Organizations with a vested interest in the stability and resiliency of the Internet should embrace and support cross-industry cooperative efforts as a core principle.

The combined efforts of the research and mitigation task force demonstrates that successful collaboration across industry peers to quickly remediate threats to availability and resiliency is not only possible, but is also increasingly critical for the continued viability of the global Internet.

Controversial pseudorandom number generator

**Dual\_EC\_DRBG** (**Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator**)[[1]](#cite_note-NIST-800-90-1) is an algorithm that was presented as a [cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator](/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator "Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator") (CSPRNG) using methods in [elliptic curve cryptography](/wiki/Elliptic_curve_cryptography "Elliptic curve cryptography"). Despite wide public criticism, including the public identification of the possibility that the [National Security Agency](/wiki/National_Security_Agency "National Security Agency") put a [backdoor](/wiki/Backdoor_%28cryptography%29 "Backdoor (cryptography)") into a recommended implementation, it was, for seven years, one of four CSPRNGs standardized in [NIST SP 800-90A](/wiki/NIST_SP_800-90A "NIST SP 800-90A") as originally published circa June 2006, until it was withdrawn in 2014.

## Weakness: a potential backdoor

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dual_EC_DRBG&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Weakness: a potential backdoor")]

Weaknesses in the cryptographic security of the algorithm were known and publicly criticised well before the algorithm became part of a formal standard endorsed by the [ANSI](/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute "American National Standards Institute"), [ISO](/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization "International Organization for Standardization"), and formerly by the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology "National Institute of Standards and Technology") (NIST). One of the weaknesses publicly identified was the potential of the algorithm to harbour a [cryptographic](/wiki/Cryptographic "Cryptographic") [backdoor](/wiki/Backdoor_%28computing%29 "Backdoor (computing)") advantageous to those who know about it—the United States government's [National Security Agency](/wiki/National_Security_Agency "National Security Agency") (NSA)—and [no one else](/wiki/NOBUS "NOBUS"). In 2013, *The New York Times* reported that documents in their possession but never released to the public "appear to confirm" that the backdoor was real, and had been deliberately inserted by the NSA as part of its [Bullrun](/wiki/Bullrun_%28decryption_program%29 "Bullrun (decryption program)") decryption program. In December 2013, a Reuters news article alleged that in 2004, before NIST standardized Dual\_EC\_DRBG, NSA paid [RSA Security](/wiki/RSA_Security "RSA Security") $10 million in a secret deal to use Dual\_EC\_DRBG as the default in the [RSA BSAFE](/wiki/RSA_BSAFE "RSA BSAFE") cryptography library, which resulted in RSA Security becoming the most important distributor of the insecure algorithm.[[2]](#cite_note-NSApaid-2) RSA responded that they "categorically deny" that they had ever knowingly colluded with the NSA to adopt an algorithm that was known to be flawed, but also stated "we have never kept [our] relationship [with the NSA] a secret".[[3]](#cite_note-RSA_Company_Statements-3)

Sometime before its first known publication in 2004, a possible [kleptographic](/wiki/Kleptography "Kleptography") [backdoor](/wiki/Backdoor_%28computing%29 "Backdoor (computing)") was discovered with the Dual\_EC\_DRBG's design, with the design of Dual\_EC\_DRBG having the unusual property that it was theoretically impossible for anyone but Dual\_EC\_DRBG's designers (NSA) to confirm the backdoor's existence. [Bruce Schneier](/wiki/Bruce_Schneier "Bruce Schneier") concluded shortly after standardization that the "rather obvious" backdoor (along with other deficiencies) would mean that nobody would use Dual\_EC\_DRBG.[[4]](#cite_note-wired-schneier-4) The backdoor would allow NSA to decrypt for example [SSL/TLS](/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security "Transport Layer Security") encryption which used Dual\_EC\_DRBG as a CSPRNG.[[5]](#cite_note-green_flaws-5)

Members of the ANSI standard group to which Dual\_EC\_DRBG was first submitted were aware of the exact mechanism of the potential backdoor and how to disable it,[[6]](#cite_note-green_other-6) but did not elect to disable or publicize the backdoor. The general cryptographic community was initially not aware of the potential backdoor, until [Dan Shumow](/wiki/Dan_Shumow "Dan Shumow") and [Niels Ferguson](/wiki/Niels_Ferguson "Niels Ferguson")'s publication, or of [Certicom](/wiki/Certicom "Certicom")'s Daniel R. L. Brown and Scott Vanstone's 2005 patent application describing the backdoor mechanism.

In September 2013, *[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")* reported that internal NSA memos leaked by [Edward Snowden](/wiki/Edward_Snowden "Edward Snowden") indicated that the NSA had worked during the standardization process to eventually become the sole editor of the Dual\_EC\_DRBG standard,[[7]](#cite_note-sole_author-7) and concluded that the Dual\_EC\_DRBG standard did indeed contain a backdoor for the NSA.[[8]](#cite_note-NYT9513-8) In response, NIST stated that "NIST would not deliberately weaken a cryptographic standard",[[9]](#cite_note-9) but according to the *New York Times* story, the NSA had been spending $250 million per year to insert backdoors in software and hardware as part of the [Bullrun program](/wiki/Bullrun_program "Bullrun program").[[10]](#cite_note-10) A Presidential advisory committee subsequently set up to examine NSA's conduct recommended among other things that the US government "fully support and not undermine efforts to create encryption standards".[[11]](#cite_note-advisory_panel-11)

On April 21, 2014, NIST withdrew Dual\_EC\_DRBG from its draft guidance on random number generators recommending "current users of Dual\_EC\_DRBG transition to one of the three remaining approved algorithms as quickly as possible."[[12]](#cite_note-nist_abandonment-12)

## Timeline of Dual\_EC\_DRBG

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dual_EC_DRBG&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Timeline of Dual_EC_DRBG")]

| Time | What happened |
| --- | --- |
| May 1997 | Adam L. Young and [Moti Yung](/wiki/Moti_Yung "Moti Yung") present their [cryptovirology](/wiki/Cryptovirology "Cryptovirology") paper "Kleptography: Using Cryptography Against Cryptography" at Eurocrypt 1997.[[13]](#cite_note-YoungYung199705-13) The paper shows how to build a covert key exchange into the Diffie–Hellman key exchange protocol. The EC-DRBG backdoor is, with only a trivial modification, equivalent to the Young–Yung backdoor in Diffie–Hellman from Eurocrypt 1997. |
| August 1997 | Adam L. Young and [Moti Yung](/wiki/Moti_Yung "Moti Yung") present their [cryptovirology](/wiki/Cryptovirology "Cryptovirology") paper "The Prevalence of Kleptographic Attacks on Discrete-Log Based Cryptosystems" at Crypto 1997.[[14]](#cite_note-YoungYung199708-14) The paper presents a recipe on how to build asymmetric backdoors into crypto algorithms based on discrete logs. The paper generalizes the paradigm used to attack Diffie–Hellman from Eurocrypt 1997. The paper introduces the 'discrete log kleptogram' that would later be designed into the EC-DRBG. |
| ANSI X9.82 standardization process kicks off in the early 2000s | NSA drives to include Dual\_EC\_DRBG in [ANSI X9.82](/w/index.php?title=ANSI_X9.82&action=edit&redlink=1 "ANSI X9.82 (page does not exist)"), when the standardization process kicks off in the early 2000s.[[6]](#cite_note-green_other-6) |
| After the ANSI X9.82 standardization process kicked off and before NIST publication | According to [John Kelsey](/wiki/John_Kelsey_%28cryptanalyst%29 "John Kelsey (cryptanalyst)") (who was listed as author of NIST SP 800-90A together with Elaine Barker), the possibility of the backdoor by carefully chosen *P* and *Q* values was brought up at an [ANSI X9.82](/w/index.php?title=ANSI_X9.82&action=edit&redlink=1 "ANSI X9.82 (page does not exist)") meeting. As a result, a way was specified for implementers to choose their own *P* and *Q* values.[[15]](#cite_note-kelsey-15) It turned out later that the specific subtle formulation that NIST put into the standard meant that users could only get the crucial FIPS 140-2 validation of their implementation if they used the original compromised *P* and *Q* values.[[16]](#cite_note-16) |
| October 2003 | Goh, Boneh, Pinkas and Golle publish a research paper on the problem of adding key recovery to the SSL/TLS and SSH protocols.[[17]](#cite_note-GBPG-17) They state "The government can convince major software vendors to distribute SSL/TLS or SSH2 implementations with hidden and unfilterable key recovery... Users will not notice the key recovery mechanism because the scheme is hidden." They then suggest that when the server needs a random nonce it can use instead an encryption of the session key computed under the escrow key. This does not leverage an elliptic curve discrete-log kleptogram and as a result requires a large-bandwidth subliminal channel to pull off. |
| June 2004 | [A draft](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=D96134C539F238DD741A65F49189E076?doi=10.1.1.6.1272&rep=rep1&type=pdf) of [ANSI X9.82, Part 3](/w/index.php?title=ANSI_X9.82,_Part_3&action=edit&redlink=1 "ANSI X9.82, Part 3 (page does not exist)") is published, which includes Dual\_EC\_DRBG.[[6]](#cite_note-green_other-6) It is unknown if earlier drafts were published. |
| Sometime in 2004 | RSA makes Dual\_EC\_DRBG the default CSPRNG in BSAFE. In 2013, Reuters reports this is a result of a secret $10 million deal with NSA.[[2]](#cite_note-NSApaid-2) |
| 21 January 2005 | Priority date of a patent application[[18]](#cite_note-patent-18) by the two [Certicom](/wiki/Certicom "Certicom") members of the ANSI X9.82 standardization committee. The patent describes the working of an elliptic curve CSPRNG backdoor identical to the potential backdoor in Dual\_EC\_DRBG, and ways to neutralize such a hidden backdoor by choosing alternative curve points and more bit truncation in the output function.[[6]](#cite_note-green_other-6) |
| Sometime in 2005[[19]](#cite_note-19) | [ISO/IEC 18031](/w/index.php?title=ISO/IEC_18031&action=edit&redlink=1 "ISO/IEC 18031 (page does not exist)"):2005 is published, and includes Dual\_EC\_DRBG.[[6]](#cite_note-green_other-6) |
| December 2005[[20]](#cite_note-kristian-20) | The first draft of NIST SP 800-90A is released to the public, includes Dual\_EC\_DRBG.[[5]](#cite_note-green_flaws-5) |
| 16 March 2006 | Kristian Gjøsteen publishes *Comments on Dual-EC-DRBG/NIST SP 800-90, Draft December 2005* showing that part of Dual\_EC\_DRBG is "not cryptographically sound", and constructing a bit-predictor with an [advantage](/wiki/Advantage_%28cryptography%29 "Advantage (cryptography)") of 0.0011, which is considered unacceptable for a CSPRNG.[[5]](#cite_note-green_flaws-5)[[20]](#cite_note-kristian-20) |
| 29 March 2006 | Daniel R. L. Brown publishes "[*Conjectured Security of the ANSI-NIST Elliptic Curve RNG*](http://eprint.iacr.org/2006/117)", concluding that "[Dual\_EC\_DRBG] should be a serious consideration", assuming less truncation of the curve points than is present in Dual\_EC\_DRBG, as shown necessary by Gjøsteen's 2006 paper. The paper also anticipates Shumow and Ferguson's 2007 announcement of a possible backdoor: "This proof makes essential use of *Q* being random. The reason for this is more than just to make the proof work. If *Q* is not random, then it may be the case the adversary knows a *d* such that *dQ = P*. Then *dRi* = *dS**i*+1, so that such a distinguisher could immediately recover the secret prestates from the output. Once the distinguisher gets the prestates, it can easily distinguish the output from random. Therefore, it is generally preferable for *Q* to be chosen randomly, relative to *P*."[[21]](#cite_note-Br06-21) |
| 29 May 2006 | Berry Schoenmakers and Andrey Sidorenko publish a *Cryptanalysis of the Dual Elliptic Curve Pseudorandom Generator*, showing that empirically the output from Dual\_EC\_DRBG can be distinguished from random bits, concluding that Dual\_EC\_DRBG is insecure as a CSPRNG. Note that this is a separate problem from the backdoor. The authors also point out that the [security claim](/wiki/Security_claim "Security claim") of the Dual\_EC\_DRBG is only supported by informal discussion. No proof of security (e.g., via a reduction argument) is given.[[22]](#cite_note-SchoenmakersSidorenko2006-22) It follows that NIST ignored the provably secure pseudorandom number generators that had long existed in the peer-reviewed academic literature. |

The attack is an attack on SSL random number generation. The act of generating a hello nonce using the EC-DRBG that NIST backdoored mimics exactly this attack on SSL by Young and Yung. |
| August 2007 | [Dan Shumow](/wiki/Dan_Shumow "Dan Shumow") and [Niels Ferguson](/wiki/Niels_Ferguson "Niels Ferguson") give an informal presentation demonstrating that an attacker with the backdoor and a small amount of output can completely recover the internal state of EC-DRBG, and therefore predict all future output.[[24]](#cite_note-rump-24) |

| 10 September 2013 | Gail Porter, director of the NIST Public Affairs Office, released a statement, saying that "NIST would not deliberately weaken a cryptographic standard."[[26]](#cite_note-26) The statement does not address the fact that NIST ultimately ignored the warning about a possible backdoor in the standard from NIST's own cryptographer, John Kelsey. |
| 19 September 2013 | RSA Security advises its customers to stop using Dual\_EC\_DRBG in RSA Security's *BSAFE* toolkit and *Data Protection Manager*, citing NIST guidance made Sept. 12, 2013 that indicated: "NIST strongly recommends that, pending the resolution of the security concerns and the re-issuance of SP 800-90A, the Dual\_EC\_DRBG, as specified in the January 2012 version of SP 800-90A, no longer be used."[[27]](#cite_note-NIST_Dual_EC_DRBG_Bulletin-27) Initial media reports cast suspicion over RSA's continued use of Dual\_EC\_DRBG as the default in its BSAFE and Data Protection Manager products, particularly after 2007 in light of previous published concerns over the potential for a backdoor in the algorithm. RSA Chief of Technology Sam Curry writes a short justification for RSA Security's choice to use Dual\_EC\_DRBG as default, which is widely criticized by cryptographers.

### Overview

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dual_EC_DRBG&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Overview")]

The algorithm uses a single integer s as state. Whenever a new random number is requested, this integer is updated. The k-th state is given by

The algorithm allows for different constants, variable output length and other customization. For simplicity, the one described here will use the constants from curve P-256 (one of the 3 sets of constants available) and have fixed output length.

## Security

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dual_EC_DRBG&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Security")]

The stated purpose of including the Dual\_EC\_DRBG in [NIST SP 800-90A](/wiki/NIST_SP_800-90A "NIST SP 800-90A") is that its security is based on [computational hardness assumptions](/wiki/Computational_hardness_assumption "Computational hardness assumption") from number theory. A mathematical [security reduction](/wiki/Provable_security "Provable security") proof can then prove that as long as the number theoretical problems are hard, the random number generator itself is secure. However, the makers of Dual\_EC\_DRBG did not publish a security reduction for Dual\_EC\_DRBG, and it was shown soon after the NIST draft was published that Dual\_EC\_DRBG was indeed not secure, because it output too many bits per round.[[22]](#cite_note-SchoenmakersSidorenko2006-22)[[35]](#cite_note-kg1-35)[[36]](#cite_note-gb-36) The output of too many bits (along with carefully chosen elliptic curve points *P* and *Q*) is what makes the NSA backdoor possible, because it enables the attacker to revert the truncation by brute force guessing. The output of too many bits was not corrected in the final published standard, leaving Dual\_EC\_DRBG both insecure and backdoored.[[5]](#cite_note-green_flaws-5)

In many other standards, constants that are meant to be arbitrary are chosen by the *[nothing up my sleeve number](/wiki/Nothing_up_my_sleeve_number "Nothing up my sleeve number")* principle, where they are derived from [pi](/wiki/Pi "Pi") or similar [mathematical constants](/wiki/Mathematical_constant "Mathematical constant") in a way that leaves little room for adjustment. However, Dual\_EC\_DRBG did not specify how the default *P* and *Q* constants were chosen, possibly because they were constructed by NSA to be backdoored. Because the standard committee were aware of the potential for a backdoor, a way for an implementer to choose their own secure *P* and *Q* was included.[[6]](#cite_note-green_other-6)[[15]](#cite_note-kelsey-15) But the exact formulation in the standard was written such that use of the alleged backdoored *P* and *Q* was required for [FIPS 140-2](/wiki/FIPS_140-2 "FIPS 140-2") validation, so the [OpenSSL](/wiki/OpenSSL "OpenSSL") project chose to implement the backdoored *P* and *Q*, even though they were aware of the potential backdoor and would have preferred generating their own secure *P* and *Q*.[[37]](#cite_note-openssl-37) New York Times would later write that NSA had worked during the standardization process to eventually become the sole editor of the standard.[[7]](#cite_note-sole_author-7)

A security proof was later published for Dual\_EC\_DRBG by Daniel R.L. Brown and Kristian Gjøsteen, showing that the generated elliptic curve points would be indistinguishable from uniformly random elliptic curve points, and that if fewer bits were output in the final output truncation, and if the two elliptic curve points *P* and *Q* were independent, then Dual\_EC\_DRBG is secure. The proof relied on the assumption that three problems were hard: the *[decisional Diffie–Hellman assumption](/wiki/Decisional_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_assumption "Decisional Diffie–Hellman assumption")* (which is generally accepted to be hard), and two newer less-known problems which are not generally accepted to be hard: the *truncated point problem*, and the *x-logarithm problem*.[[35]](#cite_note-kg1-35)[[36]](#cite_note-gb-36) Dual\_EC\_DRBG was quite slow compared to many alternative CSPRNGs (which don't have security reductions[[38]](#cite_note-dbrown_gnome-38)), but Daniel R.L. Brown argues that the security reduction makes the slow Dual\_EC\_DRBG a valid alternative (assuming implementors disable the obvious backdoor).[[38]](#cite_note-dbrown_gnome-38) Note that Daniel R.L. Brown works for Certicom, the main owner of elliptic curve cryptography patents, so there may be a conflict of interest in promoting an EC CSPRNG.

The alleged NSA backdoor would allow the attacker to determine the internal state of the random number generator from looking at the output from a single round (32 bytes); all future output of the random number generator can then easily be calculated, until the CSPRNG is reseeded with an external source of randomness. This makes for example SSL/TLS vulnerable, since the setup of a TLS connection includes the sending of a randomly generated [cryptographic nonce](/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce "Cryptographic nonce") in the clear.[[5]](#cite_note-green_flaws-5) NSA's alleged backdoor would depend on their knowing of the single *e* such that
e
Q
=
P

{\displaystyle eQ=P}

![{\displaystyle eQ=P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/865a9ce6cb820ab11a56fdb6ffff68f720ecdcf3). This is a hard problem if *P* and *Q* are set ahead of time, but it's easier if *P* and *Q* are chosen.[[24]](#cite_note-rump-24) *e* is a secret key presumably known only by NSA, and the alleged backdoor is a [kleptographic](/wiki/Kleptography "Kleptography") asymmetric hidden backdoor.[[39]](#cite_note-blog.0xbadc0de.be-39) Matthew Green's blog post *The Many Flaws of Dual\_EC\_DRBG*[[40]](#cite_note-40) has a simplified explanation of how the alleged NSA backdoor works by employing the discrete-log [kleptogram](/wiki/Kleptogram "Kleptogram") introduced in Crypto 1997.[[14]](#cite_note-YoungYung199708-14)

## Standardization and implementations

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dual_EC_DRBG&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Standardization and implementations")]

NSA first introduced Dual\_EC\_DRBG in the [ANSI X9.82 DRBG](/w/index.php?title=ANSI_X9.82_DRBG&action=edit&redlink=1 "ANSI X9.82 DRBG (page does not exist)") in the early 2000s, including the same parameters which created the alleged backdoor, and Dual\_EC\_DRBG was published in a draft ANSI standard. Dual\_EC\_DRBG also exists in the [ISO 18031](/w/index.php?title=ISO_18031&action=edit&redlink=1 "ISO 18031 (page does not exist)") standard.[[6]](#cite_note-green_other-6)

According to John Kelsey (who together with Elaine Barker was listed as author of NIST SP 800-90A), the possibility of the backdoor by carefully chosen *P* and *Q* was brought up at an ANSI X9F1 Tool Standards and Guidelines Group meeting.[[6]](#cite_note-green_other-6) When Kelsey asked Don Johnson of [Cygnacom](/w/index.php?title=Cygnacom&action=edit&redlink=1 "Cygnacom (page does not exist)") about the origin of *Q*, Johnson answered in a 27 October 2004 email to Kelsey that NSA had prohibited the public discussion of generation of an alternative *Q* to the NSA-supplied one.[[41]](#cite_note-lastpost-41)

At least two members of the Members of the ANSI X9F1 Tool Standards and Guidelines Group which wrote ANSI X9.82, Daniel R. L. Brown and Scott Vanstone from [Certicom](/wiki/Certicom "Certicom"),[[6]](#cite_note-green_other-6) were aware of the exact circumstances and mechanism in which a backdoor could occur, since they filed a patent application[[18]](#cite_note-patent-18) in January 2005 on exactly how to insert or prevent the backdoor in DUAL\_EC\_DRBG. The working of the "trap door" mentioned in the patent is identical to the one later confirmed in Dual\_EC\_DRBG. Writing about the patent in 2014, commentator Matthew Green describes the patent as a "[passive aggressive](/wiki/Passive_aggressive "Passive aggressive")" way of spiting NSA by publicizing the backdoor, while still criticizing everybody on the committee for not actually disabling the backdoor they obviously were aware of.[[41]](#cite_note-lastpost-41) Brown and Vanstone's patent list two necessary conditions for the backdoor to exist:

1) Chosen *Q*

> An elliptic curve random number generator avoids escrow keys by choosing a point *Q* on the elliptic curve as verifiably random. Intentional use of escrow keys can provide for back up functionality. The relationship between *P* and *Q* is used as an escrow key and stored by for a security domain. The administrator logs the output of the generator to reconstruct the random number with the escrow key.

2) Small output truncation

> [0041] Another alternative method for preventing a key escrow attack on the output of an ECRNG, shown in Figures 3 and 4 is to add a truncation function to ECRNG to truncate the ECRNG output to approximately half the length of a compressed elliptic curve point. Preferably, this operation is done in addition to the preferred method of Figure 1 and 2, however, it will be appreciated that it may be performed as a primary measure for preventing a key escrow attack. The benefit of truncation is that the list of R values associated with a single ECRNG output r is typically infeasible to search. For example, for a 160-bit elliptic curve group, the number of potential points R in the list is about 280, and searching the list would be about as hard as solving the discrete logarithm problem. The cost of this method is that the ECRNG is made half as efficient, because the output length is effectively halved.

According to John Kelsey, the option in the standard to choose a verifiably random *Q* was added as an option in response to the suspected backdoor,[[15]](#cite_note-kelsey-15) though in such a way that [FIPS 140-2](/wiki/FIPS_140-2 "FIPS 140-2") validation could only be attained by using the possibly backdoored *Q*.[[37]](#cite_note-openssl-37) Steve Marquess (who helped implement NIST SP 800-90A for OpenSSL) speculated that this requirement to use the potentially backdoored points could be evidence of NIST complicity.[[42]](#cite_note-pickone-42) It is not clear why the standard did not specify the default *Q* in the standard as a verifiably generated [nothing up my sleeve number](/wiki/Nothing_up_my_sleeve_number "Nothing up my sleeve number"), or why the standard did not use greater truncation, which Brown's patent said could be used as the "primary measure for preventing a key escrow attack". The small truncation was unusual compared to previous EC PRGs, which according to Matthew Green had only output 1/2 to 2/3 of the bits in the output function.[[5]](#cite_note-green_flaws-5) The low truncation was in 2006 shown by Gjøsteen to make the RNG predictable and therefore unusable as a CSPRNG, even if *Q* had not been chosen to contain a backdoor.[[20]](#cite_note-kristian-20) The standard says that implementations "should" use the small max\_outlen provided, but gives the option of outputting a multiple of 8 fewer bits. Appendix C of the standard gives a loose argument that outputting fewer bits will make the output less uniformly distributed. Brown's 2006 security proof relies on outlen being much smaller the default max\_outlen value in the standard.

The ANSI X9F1 Tool Standards and Guidelines Group which discussed the backdoor also included three employees from the prominent security company RSA Security.[[6]](#cite_note-green_other-6) In 2004, RSA Security made an implementation of Dual\_EC\_DRBG which contained the NSA backdoor the default CSPRNG in their [RSA BSAFE](/wiki/RSA_BSAFE "RSA BSAFE") as a result of a secret $10 million deal with NSA. In 2013, after the New York Times reported that Dual\_EC\_DRBG contained a backdoor by the NSA, RSA Security said they had not been aware of any backdoor when they made the deal with NSA, and told their customers to switch CSPRNG. In the 2014 RSA Conference keynote, RSA Security Executive Chairman Art Coviello explained that RSA had seen declining revenue from encryption, and had decided to stop being "drivers" of independent encryption research, but to instead to "put their trust behind" the standards and guidance from standards organizations such as NIST.[[32]](#cite_note-Coviello-32)

A draft of NIST SP 800-90A including the Dual\_EC\_DRBG was published in December 2005. The final NIST SP 800-90A including Dual\_EC\_DRBG was published in June 2006. Documents leaked by Snowden have been interpreted as suggesting that the NSA backdoored Dual\_EC\_DRBG, with those making the allegation citing the NSA's work during the standardization process to eventually become the sole editor of the standard.[[7]](#cite_note-sole_author-7) The early usage of Dual\_EC\_DRBG by RSA Security (for which NSA was later reported to have secretly paid $10 million) was cited by the NSA as an argument for Dual\_EC\_DRBG's acceptance into the [NIST SP 800-90A](/wiki/NIST_SP_800-90A "NIST SP 800-90A") standard.[[2]](#cite_note-NSApaid-2) RSA Security subsequently cited Dual\_EC\_DRBG's acceptance into the NIST standard as a reason they used Dual\_EC\_DRBG.[[43]](#cite_note-ars-43)

Daniel R. L. Brown's March 2006 paper on the security reduction of Dual\_EC\_DRBG mentions the need for more output truncation and a randomly chosen *Q*, but mostly in passing, and does not mention his conclusions from his patent that these two defects in Dual\_EC\_DRBG together can be used as a backdoor. Brown writes in the conclusion: "Therefore, the ECRNG should be a serious consideration, and its high efficiency makes it suitable even for constrained environments." Note that others have criticised Dual\_EC\_DRBG as being extremely slow, with Bruce Schneier concluding "It's too slow for anyone to willingly use it",[[4]](#cite_note-wired-schneier-4) and Matthew Green saying Dual\_EC\_DRBG is "Up to a thousand times slower" than the alternatives.[[5]](#cite_note-green_flaws-5) The potential for a backdoor in Dual\_EC\_DRBG was not widely publicised outside of internal standard group meetings. It was only after [Dan Shumow](/wiki/Dan_Shumow "Dan Shumow") and [Niels Ferguson](/wiki/Niels_Ferguson "Niels Ferguson")'s 2007 presentation that the potential for a backdoor became widely known. Shumow and Ferguson had been tasked with implementing Dual\_EC\_DRBG for Microsoft, and at least Furguson had discussed the possible backdoor in a 2005 X9 meeting.[[15]](#cite_note-kelsey-15) Bruce Schneier wrote in a 2007 Wired article that the Dual\_EC\_DRBG's flaws were so obvious that nobody would use Dual\_EC\_DRBG: "It makes no sense as a trap door: It's public, and rather obvious. It makes no sense from an engineering perspective: It's too slow for anyone to willingly use it."[[4]](#cite_note-wired-schneier-4) Schneier was apparently unaware that RSA Security had used Dual\_EC\_DRBG as the default in BSAFE since 2004.

OpenSSL implemented all of NIST SP 800-90A including Dual\_EC\_DRBG at the request of a client. The OpenSSL developers were aware of the potential backdoor because of Shumow and Ferguson's presentation, and wanted to use the method included in the standard to choose a guaranteed non-backdoored *P* and *Q*, but were told that to get FIPS 140-2 validation they would have to use the default *P* and *Q*. OpenSSL chose to implement Dual\_EC\_DRBG despite its dubious reputation for completeness, noting that OpenSSL tried to be complete and implements many other insecure algorithms. OpenSSL did not use Dual\_EC\_DRBG as the default CSPRNG, and it was discovered in 2013 that a bug made the OpenSSL implementation of Dual\_EC\_DRBG non-functioning, meaning that no one could have been using it.[[37]](#cite_note-openssl-37)

Bruce Schneier reported in December 2007 that Microsoft added Dual\_EC\_DRBG support to Windows Vista, though not enabled by default, and Schneier warned against the known potential backdoor.[[44]](#cite_note-44) Windows 10 and later will silently replace calls to Dual\_EC\_DRBG with calls to CTR\_DRBG based on AES.[[45]](#cite_note-45)

On September 9, 2013, following the Snowden leak, and the *New York Times* report on the backdoor in Dual\_EC\_DRBG, the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology "National Institute of Standards and Technology") (NIST) ITL announced that in light of community security concerns, it was reissuing SP 800-90A as draft standard, and re-opening SP800-90B/C for public comment. NIST now "strongly recommends" against the use of Dual\_EC\_DRBG, as specified in the January 2012 version of SP 800-90A.[[46]](#cite_note-46)[[47]](#cite_note-nyt1-47) The discovery of a backdoor in a NIST standard has been a major embarrassment for the [NIST](/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology "National Institute of Standards and Technology").[[48]](#cite_note-48)

RSA Security had kept Dual\_EC\_DRBG as the default CSPRNG in BSAFE even after the wider cryptographic community became aware of the potential backdoor in 2007, but there does not seem to have been a general awareness of BSAFE's usage of Dual\_EC\_DRBG as a user option in the community. Only after widespread concern about the backdoor was there an effort to find software which used Dual\_EC\_DRBG, of which BSAFE was by far the most prominent found. After the 2013 revelations, RSA security Chief of Technology Sam Curry provided [Ars Technica](/wiki/Ars_Technica "Ars Technica") with a rationale for originally choosing the flawed Dual EC DRBG standard as default over the alternative random number generators.[[49]](#cite_note-arswarn-49) The technical accuracy of the statement was widely criticized by cryptographers, including [Matthew Green](/wiki/Matthew_Green_%28cryptographer%29 "Matthew Green (cryptographer)") and [Matt Blaze](/wiki/Matt_Blaze "Matt Blaze").[[28]](#cite_note-green_warn-28) On December 20, 2013, it was reported by Reuters that RSA had accepted a secret payment of $10 million from the NSA to set the Dual\_EC\_DRBG random number generator as the default in two of its encryption products.[[2]](#cite_note-NSApaid-2)[[50]](#cite_note-50) On December 22, 2013, RSA posted a statement to its corporate blog "categorically" denying a secret deal with the NSA to insert a "known flawed random number generator" into its BSAFE toolkit [[3]](#cite_note-RSA_Company_Statements-3)

Following the New York Times story asserting that Dual\_EC\_DRBG contained a backdoor, Brown (who had applied for the backdoor patent and published the security reduction) wrote an email to an IETF mailing list defending the Dual\_EC\_DRBG standard process:[[38]](#cite_note-dbrown_gnome-38)

> 1. Dual\_EC\_DRBG, as specified in NIST SP 800-90A and ANSI X9.82-3, allows an alternative choice of constants *P* and *Q*. As far as I know, the alternatives do not admit a known feasible backdoor. In my view, it is incorrect to imply that Dual\_EC\_DRBG always has a backdoor, though I admit a wording to qualify the affected cases may be awkward.
>
> 2. Many things are obvious in hindsight. I'm not sure if this was obvious.
> [...]
>
> 8. All considered, I don't see how the ANSI and NIST standards for Dual\_EC\_DRBG can be viewed as a subverted standard, per se. But maybe that's just because I'm biased or naive.

## Software and hardware which contained the possible backdoor

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dual_EC_DRBG&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Software and hardware which contained the possible backdoor")]

Implementations which used Dual\_EC\_DRBG would usually have gotten it via a library. At least RSA Security (BSAFE library), [OpenSSL](/wiki/OpenSSL "OpenSSL"), Microsoft, and Cisco[[51]](#cite_note-wired2013-51) have libraries which included Dual\_EC\_DRBG, but only BSAFE used it by default. According to the Reuters article which revealed the secret $10 million deal between RSA Security and NSA, RSA Security's BSAFE was the most important distributor of the algorithm.[[2]](#cite_note-NSApaid-2) There was a flaw in OpenSSL's implementation of Dual\_EC\_DRBG that made it non-working outside test mode, from which OpenSSL's Steve Marquess concludes that nobody used OpenSSL's Dual\_EC\_DRBG implementation.[[37]](#cite_note-openssl-37)

A list of products which have had their CSPRNG-implementation FIPS 140-2 validated is available at the NIST.[[52]](#cite_note-52) The validated CSPRNGs are listed in the Description/Notes field. Note that even if Dual\_EC\_DRBG is listed as validated, it may not have been enabled by default. Many implementations come from a renamed copy of a library implementation.[[53]](#cite_note-53)

The [BlackBerry](/wiki/BlackBerry "BlackBerry") software is an example of non-default use. It includes support for Dual\_EC\_DRBG, but not as default. BlackBerry Ltd has however not issued an advisory to any of its customers who may have used it, because they do not consider the probable backdoor a vulnerability.[[54]](#cite_note-carr0114-54) [Jeffrey Carr](/wiki/Jeffrey_Carr "Jeffrey Carr") quotes a letter from Blackberry:[[54]](#cite_note-carr0114-54)

> The Dual EC DRBG algorithm is only available to third party developers via the Cryptographic APIs on the [Blackberry] platform. In the case of the Cryptographic API, it is available if a 3rd party developer wished to use the functionality and explicitly designed and developed a system that requested the use of the API.

Bruce Schneier has pointed out that even if not enabled by default, having a backdoored CSPRNG implemented as an option can make it easier for NSA to spy on targets which have a software-controlled command-line switch to select the encryption algorithm, or a "[registry](/wiki/Windows_Registry "Windows Registry")" system, like most [Microsoft](/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") products, such as [Windows Vista](/wiki/Windows_Vista "Windows Vista"):

> A Trojan is really, really big. You can’t say that was a mistake. It’s a massive piece of code collecting keystrokes. But changing a bit-one to a bit-two [in the registry to change the default random number generator on the machine] is probably going to be undetected. It is a low conspiracy, highly deniable way of getting a backdoor. So there’s a benefit to getting it into the library and into the product.
>
> — Bruce Schneier, [[51]](#cite_note-wired2013-51)

In December 2013, a proof of concept backdoor[[39]](#cite_note-blog.0xbadc0de.be-39) was published that uses the leaked internal state to predict subsequent random numbers, an attack viable until the next reseed.

In December 2015, [Juniper Networks](/wiki/Juniper_Networks "Juniper Networks") announced[[55]](#cite_note-55) that some revisions of their ScreenOS firmware used Dual\_EC\_DRBG with the suspect *P* and *Q* points, creating a backdoor in their firewall. Originally it was supposed to use a Q point chosen by Juniper which may or may not have been generated in provably safe way. Dual\_EC\_DRBG was then used to seed ANSI X9.17 PRNG. This would have obfuscated the Dual\_EC\_DRBG output thus killing the backdoor. However, a "bug" in the code exposed the raw output of the Dual\_EC\_DRBG, hence compromising the security of the system. This backdoor was then backdoored itself by an unknown party which changed the Q point and some test vectors.[[56]](#cite_note-greenjun-56)[[57]](#cite_note-rpw15-57)[[58]](#cite_note-58) Allegations that the [NSA](/wiki/NSA "NSA") had persistent backdoor access through Juniper firewalls had already been published in 2013 by *[Der Spiegel](/wiki/Der_Spiegel "Der Spiegel")*.[[59]](#cite_note-59) The [kleptographic](/wiki/Kleptographic "Kleptographic") backdoor is an example of NSA's [NOBUS](/wiki/NOBUS "NOBUS") policy, of having security holes that only they can exploit.

         Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) Framework

Abstract

   Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) methods were developed
   to prevent nodes attached to the same IP link from spoofing each
   other's IP addresses, so as to complement ingress filtering with
   finer-grained, standardized IP source address validation.  This
   document is a framework document that describes and motivates the
   design of the SAVI methods.  Particular SAVI methods are described in
   other documents.

[RFC 7039](/doc/html/rfc7039)                     SAVI Framework                 October 2013

[1](#section-1).  Introduction

   Since IP source addresses are used by hosts and network entities to
   determine the origin of a packet and as a destination for return
   data, spoofing of IP source addresses can enable impersonation,
   concealment, and malicious traffic redirection.  Unfortunately, the
   Internet architecture does not prevent IP source address spoofing
   [[RFC6959](/doc/html/rfc6959 "\"Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) Threat Scope\"")].  Since the IP source address of a packet generally takes
   no role in forwarding the packet, it can be selected arbitrarily by
   the sending host without jeopardizing packet delivery.  Extra methods
   are necessary for IP source address validation to augment packet
   forwarding with an explicit check of whether a given packet's IP
   source address is legitimate.

   IP source address validation can happen at different granularity.
   Ingress filtering [[BCP38](#ref-BCP38 "\"Network Ingress Filtering: Defeating Denial of Service Attacks which employ IP Source Address Spoofing\"")] [[BCP84](#ref-BCP84 "\"Ingress Filtering for Multihomed Networks\"")], a widely deployed standard for IP
   source address validation, functions at the coarse granularity of
   networks.  It verifies that the prefix of an IP source address routes
   to the network from which the packet was received.  An advantage of
   ingress filtering is simplicity: the decision of whether to accept or
   to reject an IP source address can be made solely based on the
   information available from routing protocols.  However, the
   simplicity comes at the cost of not being able to validate IP source
   addresses at a finer granularity, due to the aggregated nature of the
   information available from routing protocols.  Finer-grained IP
   source address validation would ensure that source address
   information is accurate, reduce the ability to launch denial-of-
   service attacks, and help with localizing hosts and identifying
   misbehaving hosts.  Partial solutions [[BA2007](#ref-BA2007 "\"Cisco IP Version 4 Source Guard\"")] exist for finer-
   grained IP source address validation but are proprietary and hence
   often unsuitable for corporate procurement.

   The Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) method was developed
   to complement ingress filtering with standardized IP source address
   validation at the maximally fine granularity of individual IP
   addresses.  It prevents hosts attached to the same link from spoofing
   each other's IP addresses.  To facilitate deployment in networks of
   various kinds, the SAVI method was designed to be modular and
   extensible.  This document describes and motivates the design of the
   SAVI method.

   Note that SAVI raises a number of important privacy considerations
   that are discussed more fully in [[RFC6959](/doc/html/rfc6959 "\"Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) Threat Scope\"")].  SAVI implementers must
   take those privacy considerations into account when designing
   solutions that match this framework and follow the recommendations
   given in [[RFC6959](/doc/html/rfc6959 "\"Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) Threat Scope\"")].

[RFC 7039](/doc/html/rfc7039)                     SAVI Framework                 October 2013

[2](#section-2).  Model

   To enable network operators to deploy fine-grained IP source address
   validation without a dependency on supportive functionality on hosts,
   the SAVI method was designed to be purely network based.  A SAVI
   instance enforces the hosts' use of legitimate IP source addresses
   according to the following three-step model:

   1.  Identify which IP source addresses are legitimate for a host,
       based on monitoring packets exchanged by the host.

   2.  Bind a legitimate IP address to a link-layer property of the
       host's network attachment.  This property, called a "binding
       anchor", must be verifiable in every packet that the host sends
       and harder to spoof than the host's IP source address itself.

   3.  Enforce that the IP source addresses in packets match the binding
       anchors to which they were bound.

   This model allows SAVI functionality (a SAVI instance) to be located
   anywhere on the link to which the hosts attach, hence enabling
   different locations for a SAVI instance.  One way to locate a SAVI
   instance is in the hosts' default router.  IP source addresses are
   then validated in packets traversing the default router, yet the IP
   source addresses in packets exchanged locally on the link may bypass
   validation.  Another way to locate a SAVI instance is in a switch
   between the hosts and their default router.  Thus, packets may
   undergo IP source address validation even if exchanged locally on the
   link.

   The closer a SAVI instance is located to the host, the more effective
   the SAVI method is.  This is because each of the three steps of the
   SAVI model can best be accomplished in a position close to the host:

   o  Identifying a host's legitimate IP source addresses is most
      efficient close to the host because the likelihood that the host's
      packets bypass a SAVI instance, and hence cannot be monitored,
      increases with the topological distance between the SAVI instance
      and the host.

   o  Selecting a binding anchor for a host's IP source address is
      easiest close to the host because many link-layer properties are
      unique for a given host only on a link segment directly attached
      to the host.

[RFC 7039](/doc/html/rfc7039)                     SAVI Framework                 October 2013

   o  Enforcing a host's use of a legitimate IP source address is most
      reliable when pursued close to the host because the likelihood
      that the host's packets bypass a SAVI instance, and hence do not
      undergo IP source address validation, increases with the
      topological distance between the SAVI instance and the host.

   The preferred location of SAVI instances is therefore close to hosts,
   such as in switches that directly attach to the hosts whose IP source
   addresses are being validated.

   Nevertheless, it is useful for SAVI mechanisms to be able to handle
   situations where hosts are not directly attached to the SAVI-capable
   device.  For instance, deployments with both SAVI-capable and legacy
   switches could be supported.  In general, a SAVI solution needs to
   specify how it deals with a number of deployment scenarios and
   exceptional situations, including interaction with legacy devices,
   hosts moving between wireless attachment points, network partitions,
   and so on.

   Besides, in the case of legacy switches, the security level is lower,
   as there is no full protection for the hosts connected to the legacy
   server.

[3](#section-3).  Deployment Options

   The model of the SAVI method, as explained in [Section 2](#section-2), is
   deployment specific in two ways:

   o  The identification of legitimate IP source addresses is dependent
      on the IP address assignment method in use on a link, since it is
      through assignment that a host becomes the legitimate user of an
      IP source address.

   o  Binding anchors are dependent on the technology used to build the
      link on which they are used, as binding anchors are link-layer
      properties of a host's network attachment.

   To facilitate the deployment of the SAVI method in networks of
   various kinds, the SAVI method is designed to support different IP
   address assignment methods and to function with different binding
   anchors.  Naturally, both the IP address assignment methods in use on
   a link and the available binding anchors have an impact on the
   functioning and the strength of IP source address validation.  The
   following two subsections explain this impact and describe how the
   SAVI method accommodates this.

[3.1](#section-3.1).  IP Address Assignment Methods

   Since the SAVI method traces IP address assignment packets, it
   necessarily needs to incorporate logic that is specific to particular
   IP address assignment methods.  However, developing SAVI method
   variants for each IP address assignment method is alone not
   sufficient since multiple IP address assignment methods may coexist
   on a given link.  The SAVI method hence comes in multiple variants,
   e.g., for links with DHCP [[RFC2131](/doc/html/rfc2131 "\"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\"")] [[RFC3315](/doc/html/rfc3315 "\"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)\"")], Stateless Address
   Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [[RFC4862](/doc/html/rfc4862 "\"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\"")] with or without Secure Neighbor
   Discovery (SEND) [[RFC3971](/doc/html/rfc3971 "\"SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)\"")], Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2
   (IKEv2) [[RFC5996](/doc/html/rfc5996 "\"Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)\"")] [[RFC5739](/doc/html/rfc5739 "\"IPv6 Configuration in Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)\"")] [[RFC5026](/doc/html/rfc5026 "\"Mobile IPv6 Bootstrapping in Split Scenario\"")], and combinations thereof.

   The reason to develop SAVI method variants for each single IP address
   configuration method, in addition to the variant that handles all IP
   address assignment methods, is to minimize the complexity of the
   common case.  Many link deployments today either are constrained to a
   single IP address assignment method or, equivalently from the
   perspective of the SAVI method, use different IP address assignment
   methods within different IP address prefixes.  The SAVI method for
   such links can be simpler than the SAVI method for links with
   multiple IP address assignment methods per IP address prefix.

[3.2](#section-3.2).  Binding Anchors

   The SAVI method supports a range of binding anchors:

   o  The IEEE extended unique identifier, EUI-48 or EUI-64, of a host's
      interface.

   o  The port on an Ethernet switch to which a host attaches.

   o  The security association between a host and the base station on
      wireless links.

   o  The combination of a host interface's link-layer address and a
      customer relationship in cable modem networks.

   o  An ATM virtual channel, a PPP session identifier, or a Layer 2
      Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) session identifier in a DSL network.

   o  A tunnel that connects to a single host, such as an IP-in-IP
      tunnel, a Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnel, or an MPLS
      label-switched path.

   The various binding anchors differ significantly in the security they
   provide.  IEEE extended unique identifiers, for example, fail to
   render a secure binding anchor because they can be spoofed with
   little effort.  Switch ports alone may be insufficient because they
   may connect to more than a single host, such as in the case of
   concatenated switches.

   Given this diversity in the security provided, one could define a set
   of possible binding anchors and leave it up to the administrator to
   choose one or more of them.  Such a selection of binding anchors
   would, of course, have to be accompanied by an explanation of the
   pros and cons of the different binding anchors.  In addition, SAVI
   devices may have a default binding anchor depending on the lower
   layers.  Such a default could be to use switch ports when available
   and MAC addresses otherwise or to use MAC addresses and switch ports
   in addition if available.

[4](#section-4).  Scalability Optimizations

   The preference to locate a SAVI instance close to hosts implies that
   multiple SAVI instances must be able to coexist in order to support
   large links.  Although the model of the SAVI method is independent of
   the number of SAVI instances per link, coexistence of multiple SAVI
   instances without further measures can lead to higher-than-necessary
   memory requirements.  Since a SAVI instance creates bindings for the
   IP source addresses of all hosts on a link, bindings are replicated
   if multiple SAVI instances coexist on the link.  High memory
   requirements, in turn, increase the cost of a SAVI instance.  This is
   problematic in particular for SAVI instances that are located on a
   switch since it may significantly increase the cost of such a switch.

   To reduce memory requirements for SAVI instances that are located on
   a switch, the SAVI method enables the suppression of binding
   replication on links with multiple SAVI instances.  This requires
   manual disabling of IP source address validation on switch ports that
   connect to other switches running a SAVI instance.  Each SAVI
   instance is then responsible for validating IP source addresses only
   on those ports to which hosts attach either directly or via switches
   without a SAVI instance.  On ports towards other switches running a
   SAVI instance, IP source addresses are not validated.  The switches
   running SAVI instances thus form a "protection perimeter".  The IP
   source addresses in packets passing the protection perimeter are
   validated by the ingress SAVI instance, but no further validation
   takes place as long as the packets remain within or leave the
   protection perimeter.

                  Figure 1: Protection Perimeter Concept

   Figure 1 illustrates the concept of the protection perimeter.  The
   figure shows a link with six switches, of which four, denoted "SAVI
   switch", run a SAVI instance.  The protection perimeter created by
   the four SAVI instances is shown as a dotted line in the figure.  IP
   source address validation is enabled on all switch ports on the
   protection perimeter, and it is disabled on all other switch ports.
   Four hosts, denoted A through D in the figure, attach to the
   protection perimeter.

   In the example in Figure 1, the protection perimeter encompasses one
   of the legacy switches, located in the middle of the depicted link
   topology.  This enables a single, unpartitioned protection perimeter.
   A single protection perimeter minimizes memory requirements for the
   SAVI instances because every binding is kept only once, namely, by
   the SAVI instance that attaches to the host being validated.
   Excluding the legacy switch from the protection perimeter would
   result in two smaller protection perimeters to the left and to the
   right of the depicted link topology.  The memory requirements for the
   SAVI instances would then be higher: since IP source address
   validation would be activated on the two ports connecting to the
   legacy switch, the SAVI instances adjacent to the legacy switch would
   replicate all bindings from the other protection perimeter,
   respectively.  The reason why it is possible to include the legacy
   switch in the protection perimeter is because the depicted link
   topology guarantees that packets cannot enter the protection
   perimeter via this legacy switch.  Without this guarantee, the legacy

   switch would have to be excluded from the protection perimeter in
   order to ensure that packets entering the protection perimeter
   undergo IP source address validation.

   Note that if such configuration is used, care must be taken as any
   hosts on subnets attached to non-enforcing ports will be able to use
   spoofed source addresses.

[5](#section-5).  Reliability Optimizations

   The explicit storage of legitimate IP addresses in the form of
   bindings implies that failure to create a binding, or the premature
   removal of bindings, can lead to loss of legitimate packets.  There
   are three situations in which this can happen:

   o  Legitimate IP address configuration packets, which should trigger
      the creation of a binding in a SAVI instance, are lost before
      reaching the SAVI instance.

   o  A SAVI instance loses a binding, for example, due to a restart.

   o  The link topology changes, resulting in hosts to communicate
      through SAVI instances that do not have a binding for those hosts'
      IP addresses.

   To limit the disruption that missing bindings for legitimate IP
   addresses can have, the SAVI method includes a mechanism for reactive
   binding creation based on regular packets.  This mechanism
   supplements the proactive binding creation based on IP address
   configuration packets.  Reactive binding creation occurs when a SAVI
   instance recognizes excessive drops of regular packets originating
   from the same IP address.  The SAVI instance then verifies whether
   said IP address is unique on the link.  How the verification is
   carried out depends on the IP address configuration method that the
   SAVI instance supports.  The SAVI method variant for Stateless
   Address Autoconfiguration and for Secure Neighbor Discovery verifies
   an IP address through the Duplicate Address Detection procedure.  The
   SAVI method variant for DHCP verifies an IP address through a DHCP
   Lease Query message exchange with the DHCP server.  If verification
   indicates that the IP address is unique on the link, the SAVI
   instance creates a binding for the IP address.  Otherwise, no binding
   is created, and packets sent from the IP address continue to be
   dropped.  These reliability issues should be addressed in all the
   SAVI protocols describing particular SAVI methods.

[6](#section-6).  Scenario with Multiple Assignment Methods

   While multiple assignment methods can be used on the same link, the
   SAVI device may have to deal with a mix of binding discovery methods.
   If the address prefix used for each assignment method is different,
   the "mix scenario" behaves the same as with the scenario with only
   one assignment method.  If different address assignment methods are
   used to assign addresses from the same prefix, additional
   considerations are needed because one binding mechanism may create a
   binding violating an existing binding from another binding mechanism,
   e.g., binding from First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) SAVI [[RFC6620](/doc/html/rfc6620 "\"FCFS SAVI: First-Come, First-Served Source Address Validation Improvement for Locally Assigned IPv6 Addresses\"")] may
   violate a binding from SAVI-DHCP [[SAVI-DHCP](#ref-SAVI-DHCP "\"SAVI Solution for DHCP\"")].  Thus, the collision
   between different SAVI mechanisms in the mix scenario must be handled
   in case more than one address assignment method is used to assign
   addresses from the same prefix.

   The prioritization of relationships between different address
   assignment methods is used as the basis to solve possible collisions.
   Current standard documents of address assignment methods (DHCP
   [[RFC2131](/doc/html/rfc2131 "\"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\"")], DHCPv6 [[RFC3315](/doc/html/rfc3315 "\"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)\"")], SLAAC [[RFC4862](/doc/html/rfc4862 "\"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\"")], and SEND [[RFC3971](/doc/html/rfc3971 "\"SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)\"")])
   have implied the prioritization relationship in general cases.
   However, in some scenarios, the default prioritization level may not
   be quite suitable.  A configurable prioritization level should be
   supported in the SAVI solution for the mix scenario [[SAVI-MIX](#ref-SAVI-MIX "\"SAVI for Mixed Address Assignment Methods Scenario\"")].

[7](#section-7).  Prefix Configuration

   Before setting up a host-level granularity binding, it is important
   to configure correct prefixes on the SAVI device.  This document
   suggests a set of 3 prefix configuration mechanisms at a SAVI device:

   o  Manual Prefix Configuration: The allowed prefix scope of IPv4
      addresses, IPv6 static addresses, IPv6 addresses assigned by
      Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), and IPv6 addresses
      assigned by DHCPv6 can be set manually at the SAVI device.
      FE80::/64 is always a feasible prefix in IPv6.

   o  Prefix Configuration by Router Advertisement (RA) Snooping: The
      allowed prefix scope of IPv6 static addresses and IPv6 addresses
      assigned by SLAAC can be set at the SAVI device through snooping
      an RA message at the SAVI device.

   o  Prefix Configuration by DHCP Prefix Delegation (DHCP-PD) Snooping:
      The allowed prefix scope of IPv6 static addresses, IPv6 addresses
      assigned by SLAAC, and IPv6 addresses assigned by DHCPv6 can be
      set through snooping a DHCP-PD message at the SAVI device.

   If some of the prefix scopes are set to have no prefix, the
   implication is that the corresponding address assignment method is
   not allowed in the network.

   There is no need to explicitly present these prefix scopes, but these
   restrictions should be used as the premier check in binding setup.

   When SAVI is partially deployed, binding may fail as RA messages and
   DHCP-PD can be spoofed.  So, it is recommended that Manual Prefix
   Configuration be used unless SAVI gets fully deployed.

[8](#section-8).  Acknowledgments

   The authors would like to thank the SAVI working group for a thorough
   technical discussion on the design and the framework of the SAVI
   method as captured in this document, in particular Erik Nordmark,
   Guang Yao, Eric Levy-Abegnoli, and Alberto Garcia.  Thanks also to
   Torben Melsen for reviewing this document.

[9](#section-9).  Security Considerations

   This document only discusses the possible methods to mitigate the
   usage of forged IP addresses.  Some such methods may rely on
   cryptographic methods, but not all do.  As a result, it is generally
   not possible to prove address ownership in any strong sense.  If a
   binding anchor is not exclusive for each IP address, or is without
   strong security, addresses can still be forged.  Besides, the binding
   may not accord with the address management requirement, which can be
   more specified for each client.  However, given no new protocol is
   introduced, the improvements are still acceptable.  If strong
   security is required when using IP addresses, then cryptographic-
   based authentication must be used as it is the only way to provide
   strong security.

   [Section 2](#section-2) explains how the preferred location of SAVI instances is
   close to hosts.  However, in some cases, this makes the SAVI
   instances themselves vulnerable and may defeat the purpose of
   deploying a SAVI solution.  For instance, deployments should not
   place SAVI functionality in devices that are physically exposed.
   Even if the device correctly monitors the source address usage of
   hosts, an attacker could replace the device with one that does not
   check or hook up to a trusted interface from the device to the rest
   of the network.  Similarly, deployments where SAVI instances are
   distributed across administrative boundaries are not recommended.
   For instance, in most cases, it would be undesirable to deploy a
   distributed SAVI solution on both sides of a customer-provider
   interface if the solution required trusting the correct operation of
   the SAVI devices on the other side of the interface.

# CVE-2022-26143: TP240PhoneHome Reflection/Amplification DDoS Attack Vector

March 8, 2022
## Executive summary

* A new reflection/amplification distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) vector with a **record-breaking potential amplification ratio of 4,294,967,296:1** has been abused by attackers in the wild to launch multiple high-impact DDoS attacks.
* Security researchers, network operators, and security vendors observed these attacks and formed a task force to investigate the new DDoS vector and provide mitigation guidance.
* Approximately 2,600 Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems acting as PBX-to-Internet gateways were incorrectly deployed with an abusable system test facility exposed to the public Internet.
* Attackers were actively leveraging these systems to launch reflection/amplification DDoS attacks of more than 53 million packets per second (mpps). With optimal attack tuning, the potential traffic yield for this DDoS vector is significantly higher.
* Attacks have been observed on broadband access ISPs, financial institutions, logistics companies, gaming companies, and organizations in other vertical markets.
* The attacks can be mitigated using standard DDoS-defense techniques.
* Mitel has released patched software that disables the abusable test facility, and is actively engaged in remediation efforts with their customers.
* Research and mitigation task force contributors include Akamai SIRT, Cloudflare, Lumen Black Lotus Labs, Mitel, NETSCOUT ASERT, Team Cymru, TELUS, and The Shadowserver Foundation.

## Introduction

Beginning in mid-February 2022, security researchers, network operators, and security vendors observed a spike in DDoS attacks sourced from UDP port 10074 targeting broadband access ISPs, financial institutions, logistics companies, and organizations in other vertical markets.

Upon further investigation, it was determined that the devices abused to launch these attacks are MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems produced by [Mitel](https://www.mitel.com), which incorporate TP-240 VoIP-processing interface cards and supporting software; their primary function is to provide Internet-based site-to-site voice connectivity for PBX systems.

Approximately 2600 of these systems have been incorrectly provisioned so that an unauthenticated system test facility has been inadvertently exposed to the public Internet, allowing attackers to leverage these PBX VoIP gateways as DDoS reflectors/amplifiers.

Mitel is aware that these systems are being abused to facilitate high-pps DDoS attacks, and have been actively working with customers to remediate abusable devices with patched software that disables public access to the system test facility.

In this blog, we will further explore the observed activity, explain how the driver has been abused, and share recommended mitigation steps. This research was created cooperatively among a team of researchers from Akamai SIRT, Cloudflare, Lumen Black Lotus Labs, NETSCOUT ASERT, Team Cymru, TELUS, and The Shadowserver Foundation.

## DDoS attacks in the wild

While spikes of network traffic associated with the vulnerable service were observed on January 8 and February 7, 2022, we believe the first actual attacks leveraging the exploit began on February 18.

Observed attacks were primarily predicated on pps, or throughput, and appeared to be UDP reflection/amplification attacks sourced from UDP/10074 that were mainly directed toward destination ports UDP/80 and UDP/443. The single largest observed attack of this type preceding this one was approximately 53 mpps and 23 gbps. The average packet size for that attack was approximately 60 bytes, with an attack duration of approximately 5 minutes. The amplified attack packets are not fragmented.

This particular attack vector differs from most UDP reflection/amplification attack methodologies in that the exposed system test facility can be abused to launch a sustained DDoS attack of up to 14 hours in duration by means of *a single spoofed attack initiation packet*, resulting in a record-setting packet amplification ratio of *4,294,967,296:1*. A controlled test of this DDoS attack vector yielded more than 400mpps of sustained DDoS attack traffic.

It should be noted that this single-packet attack initiation capability has the effect of precluding network operator traceback of the spoofed attack initiator traffic. This helps mask the attack traffic generation infrastructure, making it less likely that the attack origin can be traced compared with other UDP reflection/amplification DDoS attack vectors.

## Abusing the tp240dvr driver

The abused service on affected Mitel systems is called tp240dvr (“TP-240 driver”) and appears to run as a software bridge to facilitate interactions with TDM/VoIP PCI interface cards. The service listens for commands on UDP/10074 and is not meant to be exposed to the Internet, as confirmed by the manufacturer of these devices. It is this exposure to the internet that ultimately allows it to be abused.

The tp240dvr service exposes an unusual command that is designed to stress test its clients in order to facilitate debugging and performance testing. This command can be abused to cause the tp240dvr service to send this stress test to attack victims. The traffic consists of a high rate of short informative status update packets that can potentially overwhelm victims and cause the DDoS scenario.

This command can also be abused by attackers to launch very high-throughput attacks. Attackers can use specially crafted commands to cause the tp240dvr service to send larger informative status update packets, significantly increasing the amplification ratio.

By extensively testing isolated virtual TP-240–based systems in a lab setting, researchers were able to cause these devices to generate massive amounts of traffic in response to comparatively small request payloads. We will cover this attack scenario in greater technical depth in the following sections.

## Calculating the potential attack impact

As previously mentioned, amplification via this abusable test facility differs substantially from how it is accomplished with most other UDP reflection/amplification DDoS vectors. Typically, reflection/amplification attacks require the attacker to continuously transmit malicious payloads to abusable nodes for as long as they wish to attack the victim. In the case of TP-240 reflection/amplification, this continuous transmission is not necessary to launch high-impact DDoS attacks.

Instead, an attacker leveraging TP-240 reflection/amplification can launch a high-impact DDoS attack using a single packet. Examination of the tp240dvr binary reveals that, due to its design, an attacker can theoretically cause the service to emit 2,147,483,647 responses to a single malicious command. Each response generates two packets on the wire, leading to approximately 4,294,967,294 amplified attack packets being directed toward the attack victim.

For each response to a command, the first packet contains a counter that increments with each sent response. As the counter value increments, the size of this first packet will grow from 36 bytes to 45 bytes. The second packet contains diagnostic output from the function, which can be influenced by the attacker. By optimizing each initiator packet to maximize the size of the second packet, every command will result in amplified packets that are up to 1,184 bytes in length.

In theory, a single abusable node generating the upper limit of 4,294,967,294 packets at a rate of 80 thousand packets per second (kpps) would result in an attack duration of roughly 14 hours. Over the course of the attack, the “counter” packets alone would generate roughly 95.5 GB of amplified attack traffic destined for the targeted network. The maximally padded “diagnostic output” packets would account for an additional 2.5 TB of attack traffic directed toward the target.

This would yield a sustained flood of just under 393 mbps of attack traffic from a single reflector/amplifier, all resulting from a single spoofed attack initiator packet of only 1,119 bytes in length. This results in a nearly unimaginable amplification ratio of 2,200,288,816:1 — a multiplier of *220 billion percent*, triggered by a single packet.

## Upper boundaries of attack volume and simultaneity

The tp240dvr service processes commands using a single thread. This means they can only process a single command at a time, and thus can only be used to launch one attack at a time. In the example scenario presented above, during the 14 hours that the abused device would be attacking the target, it cannot be leveraged to attack any other target. This is somewhat unique in the context of DDoS reflection/amplification vectors.

Although this characteristic also causes the tp240dvr service to be unavailable to legitimate users, it is much preferable to having these devices be leveraged in parallel by multiple attackers — and leaving legitimate operators of these systems to wonder why their outbound Internet data capacity is being consumed at much higher rates.

Additionally, it appears these devices are on relatively low-powered hardware in terms of their traffic-generation capabilities. On an Internet where 100 gbps links, dozens of CPU cores, and multithreading capabilities have become commonplace, we can all be thankful this abusable service is not found on top-of-the-line hardware platforms capable of individually generating mpps, and running with thousands of parallelized threads.

Lastly, it is also good news that of the tens of thousands of these devices that have been purchased and deployed historically by governments, commercial enterprises, and other organizations worldwide, a relatively small number of them have been configured in a manner that leaves them in this abusable state, and of those, many have been properly secured and taken offline from an attacker’s perspective.

## Collateral impact

The collateral impact of TP-240 reflection/amplification attacks is potentially significant for organizations with Internet-exposed Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems that are abused as DDoS reflectors/amplifiers.

This may include partial or full interruption of voice communications through these systems, as well as additional service disruption due to transit capacity consumption, state-table exhaustion of network address translations, stateful firewalls, and so forth.

Wholesale filtering of all UDP/10074-sourced traffic by network operators may potentially over mitigate legitimate Internet traffic, and is therefore contraindicated.

## Recommended actions

TP-240 reflection/amplification DDoS attacks are sourced from UDP/10074 and destined for the UDP port of the attacker’s choice. This amplified attack traffic can be detected, classified, traced back, and safely mitigated using standard DDoS defense tools and techniques.

Flow telemetry and packet capture via open-source and commercial analysis systems can alert network operators and end customers of TP-240 reflection/amplification attacks.

Network access control lists (ACLs), flowspec, destination-based remotely triggered blackhole, source-based remotely triggered blackhole, and intelligent DDoS mitigation systems can be used to mitigate these attacks.

Network operators should perform reconnaissance to identify and facilitate remediation of abusable TP-240 reflectors/amplifiers on their networks and/or the networks of their customers.  Operators of Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems should proactively contact Mitel to receive specific remediation instructions from the vendor.

Organizations with business-critical public-facing Internet properties should ensure that all relevant network infrastructure, architectural, and operational best current practices (BCPs) have been implemented, including situationally specific network access policies that only permit Internet traffic via required IP protocols and ports. Internet access network traffic to/from internal organizational personnel should be isolated from Internet traffic to/from public-facing Internet properties, and served via separate upstream Internet transit links.

DDoS defenses for all public-facing Internet properties and supporting infrastructure should be implemented in a situationally appropriate manner, including periodic testing to ensure that any changes to the organization’s servers/services/applications are incorporated into its DDoS-defense plan.

It is imperative that organizations operating mission-critical public-facing Internet properties and/or infrastructure ensure that all servers/services/application/datastores/infrastructure elements are protected against DDoS attack, and are included in periodic, realistic tests of the organization’s DDoS mitigation plan. Critical ancillary supporting services such as authoritative and recursive DNS servers must be included in this plan.

Network operators should implement ingress and egress source address validation in order to prevent attackers from initiating reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.

All potential DDoS attack mitigation measures described in this document ***MUST*** be tested and customized in a situationally appropriate manner prior to deployment on production networks.

## Mitigating factors

Operators of Internet-exposed TP-240–based Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems can prevent abuse of their systems to launch DDoS attacks by blocking incoming Internet traffic destined for UDP/10074 via ACLs, firewall rules, and other standard network access control policy enforcement mechanisms.

Mitel has provided patched software versions that prevent TP-240–equipped MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems from being abused as DDoS reflectors/amplifiers by preventing exposure of the service to the internet. Mitel customers should contact the vendor for remediation instructions.

Collateral impact to abusable TP-240 reflectors/amplifiers can alert network operators and/or end customers to remove affected systems from “demilitarized zone” networks or Internet data centers or to disable relevant UDP port–forwarding rules that allow specific UDP/10074 traffic sourced from the public Internet to reach these devices, thereby preventing them from being abused to launch reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.

The amplified attack traffic is not fragmented, so there is no additional attack component consisting of noninitial fragments, as is the case with many other UDP reflection/amplification DDoS vectors.

Implementation of ingress and egress source-address validation (SAV; also known as anti-spoofing) can prevent attackers from launching reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.

## Conclusion

Unfortunately, many abusable services that should not be exposed to the public Internet are nevertheless left open for attackers to exploit. This scenario is yet another example of real-world deployments that do not adhere to vendor guidance. Vendors can prevent this situation by adopting “safe by default” postures on devices before shipping.

Reflection/amplification DDoS attacks would be impossible to launch if all network operators implemented ingress and egress SAV (or anti-spoofing). The ability to spoof the IP address(es) of the intended attack target(s) is required to launch such attacks. Service providers must continue to implement SAV in their own networks, and require that their downstream customers do so as well.

As is routinely the case with newer DDoS attack vectors, it appears that after an initial period of employment by advanced attackers with access to bespoke DDoS attack infrastructure, TP-240 reflection/amplification has been weaponized and added to the arsenals of so-called “booter/stresser” DDoS-for-hire services, placing it within the reach of the general attacker population.

Collaboration across the operational, research, and vendor communities is central to the continued viability of the Internet. The quick response to and ongoing remediation of this high-impact DDoS attack vector has only been possible as a result of such collaboration. Organizations with a vested interest in the stability and resiliency of the Internet should embrace and support cross-industry cooperative efforts as a core principle.

The combined efforts of the research and mitigation task force demonstrates that successful collaboration across industry peers to quickly remediate threats to availability and resiliency is not only possible, but is also increasingly critical for the continued viability of the global Internet.

Cybercriminals who use giant floods of data to knock sites offline are leveraging a never-before-seen method that has the potential to increase the damaging effects of those floods by an unprecedented 4 billion times, researchers warned on Tuesday.

Like many other types of distributed denial-of-service attacks, the attacks send a modest amount of junk data to a misconfigured third-party service in a way that causes the service to redirect a much larger response at the intended target. So-called DDoS amplification attacks are popular because they lower the requirements needed to overwhelm their targets. Rather than having to marshal huge amounts of bandwidth and computing power, the DDoSer locates servers on the Internet that will do it for them.

## It’s all about amplification

One of the oldest amplification vectors is misconfigured DNS servers, which increase DDoS volumes by about 54 times. New amplification routes have included the [Network Time Protocol servers](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/01/dos-attacks-that-took-down-big-game-sites-abused-webs-time-synch-protocol/) (about 556x), [Plex media servers](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/ddosers-are-abusing-the-plex-media-server-to-make-attacks-more-potent/) (about 5x), [Microsoft RDP](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/01/ddosers-are-abusing-microsoft-rdp-to-make-attacks-more-powerful/) (86x), and the [Connectionless Lightweight Directory Access Protocol](%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps%3A//arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/06/two-record-ddoses-disclosed-this-week-underscore-their-growing-menace/) (at least 50x). Just last week, researchers described a [new amplification vector](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/03/unending-data-floods-and-complete-resource-exhaustion-ddoses-get-meaner/) that achieves a factor of at least 65.

Previously, the biggest known amplifier was [memcached](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/02/in-the-wild-ddoses-use-new-way-to-achieve-unthinkable-sizes/), which has the potential to increase traffic by an astounding 51,000x.

The newest entrant is the Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems. Attackers have been using them for the past month to DDoS financial institutions, logistics companies, gaming companies, and organizations in other markets. A fleet of 2,600 servers is exposing an abusable system test facility in the software to the Internet through UDP port 10074, in a break with manufacturer recommendations that the tests be reachable only internally.

The current DDoS records stand at about [3.47 terabits per second](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/01/microsoft-fends-off-record-breaking-3-47-tbps-ddos-attack/) for volumetric attacks and roughly 809 million packets per second for exhaustion forms. Volumetric DDoSes work by consuming all available bandwidth either inside the targeted network or service or get between the target and the rest of the Internet. Exhaustion DDoSes, by contrast, over-exert a server.

The new amplification vector provided by the misconfigured Mitel servers has the potential to shatter those records. The vector can do this not only because of the unprecedented 4 billion-fold amplification potential, but also because the Mitel systems can stretch out the attacks for lengths of time not previously possible.

“This particular attack vector differs from most UDP reflection/amplification attack methodologies in that the exposed system test facility can be abused to launch a sustained DDoS attack of up to 14 hours in duration by means of a single spoofed attack initiation packet, resulting in a record-setting packet amplification ratio of 4,294,967,296:1,” researchers from eight organizations wrote in a [joint advisory](https://www.akamai.com/blog/security/phone-home-ddos-attack-vector). “A controlled test of this DDoS attack vector yielded more than 400mpps of sustained DDoS attack traffic.”

A single abusable node generating this much amplification at a rate of 80 thousand packets per second can theoretically deliver the 14-hour data flood. Over that time, “counter” packets—which track the number of responses the servers send—would generate roughly 95.5GB of amplified attack traffic destined for the targeted network. Separate “diagnostic output” packets could account for an additional 2.5TB of attack traffic directed toward the target.

## A single packet is all it takes

The Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express services act as a gateway for transferring PBX phone communications to the Internet and vice versa. The products include a driver for ​​TP-240 VoIP processing interface cards. Customers can use a driver feature to stress-test the capacity of their Internet networks. Mitel instructs customers to make the tests available only inside private networks rather than to the Internet as a whole, but about 2,600 servers have flouted that directive.

Mitel on Tuesday released [software updates](https://www.mitel.com/en-ca/support/security-advisories/mitel-product-security-advisory-22-0001) that will automatically ensure the test feature is available inside an internal network.

The DDoSers using this new method appear to still be experimenting with it, and so far the results are modest. The largest attack seen so far reached about 53Mpps and 23Gbps. The average packet size in that attack was about 60 bytes and lasted for roughly five minutes. The researchers said that, with refinements, these in-the-wild DDoSes could achieve the unprecedented amplification factors achieved in their lab experiments.

In the advisory, the researchers wrote:

> As previously mentioned, amplification via this abusable test facility differs substantially from how it is accomplished with most other UDP reflection/amplification DDoS vectors. Typically, reflection/amplification attacks require the attacker to continuously transmit malicious payloads to abusable nodes for as long as they wish to attack the victim. In the case of TP-240 reflection/amplification, this continuous transmission is not necessary to launch high-impact DDoS attacks.
>
> Instead, an attacker leveraging TP-240 reflection/amplification can launch a high-impact DDoS attack using a single packet. Examination of the tp240dvr binary reveals that, due to its design, an attacker can theoretically cause the service to emit 2,147,483,647 responses to a single malicious command. Each response generates two packets on the wire, leading to some 4,294,967,294 amplified attack packets being directed toward the attack victim.
>
> For each response to a command, the first packet contains a counter which increments with each response that is sent. As the counter value increments, the size of this first packet will grow from 36 bytes to 45 bytes. The second packet contains diagnostic output from the function, which can be influenced by the attacker. By optimizing each initiator packet to maximize the size of the second packet, every command will result in amplified packets that are up to 1,184 bytes in length.
>
> In theory, a single abusable node generating the upper limit of 4,294,967,294 packets at a rate of 80kpps would result in an attack duration of roughly 14 hours. Over the course of the attack, the “counter” packets alone would generate roughly 95.5GB of amplified attack traffic destined for the targeted network. The maximally padded “diagnostic output” packets would account for an additional 2.5TB of attack traffic directed towards the target.
>
> This would yield a sustained flood of just under 393mb/sec of attack traffic from a single reflector/amplifier, all resulting from a single spoofed attack initiator packet of only 1,119 bytes in length. This results in a nearly unimaginable amplification ratio of 2,200,288,816:1— a multiplier of 220 billion percent, triggered by a single packet.

There’s not much end users can do to protect themselves from this new form of DDoSes. Rather, it’s up to organizations deploying Mitel servers to configure them properly. The advisory—written by researchers from Akamai SIRT, Cloudflare, Lumen Black Lotus Labs, Mitel, Netscout Arbor ASERT, Telus, Team Cymru, and the Shadowserver Foundation—provides other measures organizations can follow.

# DDoS Attack Preparation Workbook

Internet DDoS Attacks are a force of nature on the Internet. They are like earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornados, tsunamis, and all other disasters. Organizations need to prepare for a DDoS Attack the same way they prepare for severe weather and natural disasters. These guides have been crafted based on my personal experience (+25 years of DDoS experience) and the experience of my peers who I’m constantly working with to mitigate, disrupt, push back on the DDoS threats. The DDoS Attack Preparation Workbook pulls all the work into one location. This would make it easier for teams to pull down materials, guidelines, tools, and techniques that have proven to mitigate the effects of DDoS Attacks.

## DDoS Preparation Guides, Playbooks, and References

The following are tools all organizations can use to get ready for the inevitable DDoS Attack. Focus on cost-effective essentials. They are key even if you need 3rd party cloud-based Anti-DDoS services.

#### [**DDoS Resiliency Workshops**](https://www.senki.org/ddos-attack-preparation-workbook/ddos-resiliency-workshop-2022/)

DDoS experts around the world are rethinking and recrafting the DDoS Training into a new workshop series. We cannot ignore the growing, expanding, and unrelenting DDoS threat. We now live in a world where any system connected to the global telecommunications system (the Internet), must be resilient to DDoS. The capacity to launch DDoS attacks expands. The means of access and launch attacks are getting simpler. The miscreants setting up these DDoS systems are not getting caught nor ‘incentivized’ to stop.

The revised DDoS Resiliency Workshop kicks off with APRICOT 2022. Check out the materials here.

#### [**DDoS Extortionist’s Behaviors**](https://www.senki.org/operators-security-toolkit/ddos-extortionist-behaviors/)

Smart and prepared organizations use DDoS Extortionist’s Behaviors as a Defensive Tool. We have a long history of DDoS Extortionists. Action can be taken if you understand the criminal behavior behind the DDoS Extortion.

#### [**7 Habits of Highly Effective Cybercriminals**](https://www.senki.org/7-habits-of-highly-effective-cyber-criminals/)

Yes, there are habits of success used by highly effective cyber-criminals use to be successful! We can leverage the knowledge of these habits to better prepare, defend, and attribute attacks. To understand where these habits were first observed, we must go back to the point where the Internet explosion was creating the opportunity for new criminal enterprises.

#### [**Preparing for DOS Attacks – the Essentials**](https://www.senki.org/operators-security-toolkit/preparing-dos-attacks-essentials/)

Created by several members of the DD4BC investigation. The DD4BC crew used a crafted DDoS Attack to gain the attention of the organization. They then extorted the organization to prevent further attacks. This document was pulled together after the DD4BC arrest (see EUROPOL’s statement – [INTERNATIONAL ACTION AGAINST DD4BC CYBERCRIMINAL GROUP](https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/international-action-against-dd4bc-cybercriminal-group)). The team knew the clock was ticking, it would be a matter of time before the next wave of DDoS Extortion was launched. This document was crafted to help organizations prepare. It is based on “what organizations were missing when DD4BC hit them with a DDoS Extortion Attack.”

#### [**Demanding Security from your Vendors**](https://www.senki.org/vendor-security/demand-security-from-your-vendors/)

How does any organization have a productive and meaningful security conversation? This guide offers a simple and meaningful security conversation guide. These conversations would help the organization determine the real security risk from their vendors.  This is an updated version of a set of questions Operators (and vendors) can use to have these meaningful conversations.

#### [**How do you really stop DOS Attacks?**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1viePUkwfLmJIDw7aL-qypKffwm9n5bXrwU9TlaT2xJ0/edit)

Are you prepared for the next DoS Extortion attack? DDoS Attacks will not go away. All the threat actors use DDoS as a tool to achieve their objectives (State Security, Cyber-criminals, Political Activities, and Corporate miscreants). DDoS Extortionist Groups will cyclicly appear every 12 to 18 months.  DDoS is not something to ignore. It is time to review those “DoS” preparation checklist. This white paper explores the data that would need to be collected to successfully push back on DoS attacks. It includes information your “DoS Defense Allies” will need to help you mitigate, remediate, and potentially whack down the DoS attack.

#### [**Reporting DoS Attacks & Fighting Back Against DOS Attacks**](https://www.senki.org/reporting-dos-attacks-fighting-back/)

Expect DDoS Attacks. Prepare for DDoS Attacks. Don’t wait until you have an active DDoS Threat to start your work. There is no perfect anti-DoS solution. But with forethought, planning, coordination, and practice any organization minimizes the impact of the DoS attacks. What follows ten essential steps that have proven to help organizations prepare for DoS attacks. The fundamental principles you will find in this article apply to all organizations – large and small. They focus on low-cost – low-impact anti-DDoS essentials that add DDoS Resiliency to the entire organization.

#### [**Are you ready for the next attack? (Part 1)**](https://www.senki.org/are-you-ready-for-the-next-attack-part-1/)

Are you ready for the next attack? As many of my colleagues know, I’m constantly on the lookout for tools that would help my peers in all networks find ways to mitigate the security risk in their operations.

#### [**The Practical Security Checklist – Part 2.1**](https://www.senki.org/the-practical-security-checklist-part-2-1/)

This is part “2.1” of a multipart post to help organizations take security action. Stay tuned for next week’s practical security checklist item. Board members, CxOs, and professionals are saturated with security advice. This security advice is often confusing, contradictory, and always biased toward “buying something.” “Good security advice saturation” results in paralysis of action.

#### [**Operator’s Security Toolkit**](https://www.senki.org/operators-security-toolkit/)

It is time for a refresh of the SP Security materials used by many over the years. Back in 2002, several people in the emerging “Service Provider Security” field pulled together a list of top practices every Operator should deploy. These “NSP-SEC Top 10” techniques became the foundation of our toolkit that is used daily to mitigate DDoS Attacks.

#### [**Filtering Exploitable Ports and Minimizing Risk from the Internet and from Your Customers**](https://www.senki.org/operators-security-toolkit/filtering-exploitable-ports-and-minimizing-risk-to-and-from-your-customers/) **– What are you doing to prepare for the next “scanning malware” and “Internet Worm?”**

Operators (CSPs, ISPs, Cloud Companies, and Hosting Companies) are strongly encouraged to deploy Port Filtering on the known Exploitable ports and Source Address Validation (SAV) on their customer edge of the network as a default configuration. Filtering Exploitable Ports will minimize risk to the Operator’s infrastructure, and the Operator’s Customers and Proactively minimize risk to the collective Internet & Telecommunications network. Customers who need access to their ports can request a bypass through the Operator’s customer support.

This document is a consultation and education tool for those Operators who have yet to deploy Exploitable Port Filtering. The document is maintained for the community.

#### [**UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) one-page checklist on Preparing for DoS Attacks**](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Preparing-for-DoS-attacks-infographic.pdf)**.**

This advice is written for technical and security IT professionals and summarises how to prepare for denial of service (DoS) attacks. It is not possible to fully mitigate the risk of a DoS attack affecting your service. However, the following five practical steps, if implemented, will lessen the impact of any incident. For more information, visit [www.ncsc.gov.uk/dos](http://www.ncsc.gov.uk/dos)

#### [**Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) – Preparing for and Responding to Denial-of-Service Attacks.**](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/preparing-and-responding-denial-service-attacks)

Although organizations cannot avoid being targeted by denial-of-service attacks, there are a number of measures that organizations can implement to prepare for and potentially reduce the impact if targeted. Preparing for denial-of-service attacks before they occur is by far the best strategy; it is very difficult to respond once they begin, and efforts at this stage are unlikely to be effective.

#### [**AKAMAI WHITE PAPER – 8 Best Practices for Building and Maintaining a DDoS Protection Plan**](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/white-paper/akamai-8-steps-to-a-ddos-mitigation-plan-white-paper.pdf)

Akamai’s Anti-DDoS services emphasize planning and preparation with the Tools to execute on those Anti-DDOS “playbooks.”  This guide can be used by anyone to start their own Anti-DDoS Playbook for their organization. The companion white paper, [**8 Steps to a DDoS Mitigation Plan**](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/brochure/8-steps-to-a-ddos-mitigation-plan.pdf) supplements the first guide. Finally, the new [**DDoS Extortion Battle Checklist**](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/email/akamai-ddos-extortion-battle-plan-checklist.pdf) covers many techniques that would “trigger” DDoS Extortionist behavior to go find easier targets.

### Additional DDoS Resiliency Guides

The following is a long list of guides to help you on your journey. Some may seem old but remember our [History of DDoS](https://www.senki.org/ddos-attack-preparation-workbook/history-of-denial-of-services-dos-attacks/). The attack vectors don’t go away. They might be forgotten and seem not to be a risk. Our defenses get neglected, systems evolve, we forget DDoS Resiliency, and then POW …. the old attack vector gets rediscovered.

# UDP-Based Amplification Attacks

Last RevisedDecember 18, 2019
Alert CodeTA14-017A

### Systems Affected

Certain application-layer protocols that rely on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) have been identified as potential attack vectors. These include

* Domain Name System (DNS),
* Network Time Protocol (NTP),
* Connection-less Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (CLDAP),
* Character Generator Protocol (CharGEN),
* Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP),
* BitTorrent,
* Simple Network Management Protocol version 2 (SNMPv2),
* Kad,
* Portmap/Remote Procedure Call (RPC),
* Quote of the Day (QOTD),
* Multicast Domain Name System (mDNS),
* Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS),
* Quake Network Protocol,
* Steam Protocol,
* Routing Information Protocol version 1 (RIPv1),
* Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP),
* Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), and
* Memcached,
* and Web Services Dynamic Discovery (WS-Discovery).

### Overview

A distributed reflective denial-of-service (DRDoS) is a form of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that relies on publicly accessible UDP servers and bandwidth amplification factors (BAFs) to overwhelm a victim’s system with UDP traffic.

By design, UDP is a connection-less protocol that does not validate source Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Unless the application-layer protocol uses countermeasures such as session initiation in Voice over Internet Protocol, an attacker can easily forge the IP packet datagram (a basic transfer unit associated with a packet-switched network) to include an arbitrary source IP address. [[1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261)] When many UDP packets have their source IP address forged to the victim IP address, the destination server (or amplifier) responds to the victim (instead of the attacker), creating a reflected denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

Certain commands to UDP protocols elicit responses that are much larger than the initial request. Previously, attackers were limited by the linear number of packets directly sent to the target to conduct a DoS attack; now a single packet can generate between 10 and 100 times the original bandwidth. This is called an amplification attack, and when combined with a reflective DoS attack on a large scale, using multiple amplifiers and targeting a single victim, DDoS attacks can be conducted with relative ease.

The potential effect of an amplification attack can be measured by BAF, which can be calculated as the number of UDP payload bytes that an amplifier sends to answer a request, compared to the number of UDP payload bytes of the request. [[2](http://www.christian-rossow.de/articles/Amplification_DDoS.php)] [[3](http://www.christian-rossow.de/publications/amplification-ndss2014.pdf)]

The following is a list of known protocols and their associated BAFs. CISA offers thanks to Christian Rossow for providing this information. For more information on BAFs, please see Christian's [blog](http://www.christian-rossow.de/articles/Amplification_DDoS.php) and associated [research paper](http://www.christian-rossow.de/publications/amplification-ndss2014.pdf).

In March 2015, the CERT Coordination Center of the Software Engineering Institute issued Vulnerability Note VU#550620 describing the use of mDNS in DRDoS attacks. Attackers can leverage mDNS by sending more information than can be handled by the device, thereby causing a DoS condition. [[8](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/550620)]

In July 2015, Akamai Technologies' Prolexic Security Engineering and Research Team (PLXsert) issued a threat advisory describing a surge in DRDoS attacks using RIPv1. Malicious actors are leveraging the behavior of RIPv1 for DDoS reflection through specially crafted request queries. [[9](http://www.stateoftheinternet.com/)]

In August 2015, Level 3 Threat Research Labs reported a new form of DRDoS attack that uses portmap. Attackers are leveraging the behavior of the portmap service through spoofed requests to flood a victim’s network with UDP traffic. [[10](http://blog.level3.com/security/a-new-ddos-reflection-attack-portmapper-an-early-warning-to-the-industry/)]

In October 2016, Corero Network Security reported a new DDoS amplification attack exploiting LDAP directory services servers against its customers. [[11](https://www.corero.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/corero-warns-of-powerful-new-ddos-attack-vector-with-potential-for-terabit-scale-ddos-events/%5D)]

In November 2017, Netlab 360 reported that CLDAP is now the third most common DRDoS attack, behind DNS and NTP attacks. [[12](http://blog.netlab.360.com/cldap-is-now-the-3rd-reflection-amplified-ddos-attack-vector-surpassing-ssdp-and-chargen-en)]

In February 2018, SENKI reported an increase in Memcached-based reflection DDoS attacks (via UDP/TCP port 11211) with an unprecedented amplification factor. [[24](http://www.senki.org/memcached-on-port-11211-udp-tcp-being-exploited/)]

In September 2019, Akamai reported DDoS attacks exploiting WS-Discovery protocol (via TCP/UDP port 3702. [[26](https://blogs.akamai.com/sitr/2019/09/new-ddos-vector-observed-in-the-wild-wsd-attacks-hitting-35gbps.html/)]

### Impact

Attackers can use the bandwidth and relative trust of large servers that provide the UDP protocols provided in this alert to flood victims with unwanted traffic and create a DDoS attack.

### Solution

#### Detection

Detection of DRDoS attacks is not easy because of their use of large, trusted servers that provide UDP services. Network operators of these exploitable services may apply traditional DoS mitigation techniques. To detect a DRDoS attack, watch out for abnormally large responses to a particular IP address, which may indicate that an attacker is using the service.

There are a few things victims of DRDoS attacks can do to detect such activity and respond:

1. Detect and alert large UDP packets to higher order ports.
2. Detect and alert on any non-stateful UDP packets. (A simple Snort example is below. The approach will need to be customized to each environment with a whitelist and known services.)
   Simple Snort rule example for stateless UDP check
   var HOME\_NET [10.10.10.20]

   preprocessor stream5\_global: track\_ip yes, track\_tcp yes,track\_udp yes,track\_icmp no,max\_tcp 262144, max\_udp 131072

   preprocessor stream5\_ip: timeout 180

   preprocessor stream5\_tcp: policy first, use\_static\_footprint\_sizes

   preprocessor stream5\_udp: timeout 180, ignore\_any\_rules

   alert udp HOME\_NET 1024: -> any any (msg:"UDP Session start"; flowbits:set,logged\_in; flowbits:noalert; sid: 1001;)

   alert udp any any -> HOME\_NET 1024: (msg:"UDP Stateless"; flowbits:isnotset,logged\_in; sid: 1002)
3. Upstream providers should maintain updated contacts and methods with downstream customers to send alerts by network.

In general, network and server administrators for internet service providers (ISPs) should use the following best practices to avoid becoming amplifier nodes:

1. Use network flow to detect spoofed packets. (See the Mitigation section below for information on verifying spoofed traffic before blocking that traffic.)
2. Use network flow or other summarized network data to monitor for an unusual number of requests to at-risk UDP services.
3. Use network flow to detect service anomalies (e.g., bytes-per-packet and packets-per-second anomalies).

#### Mitigation

The following steps can help mitigate a DRDoS attack:

1. Use stateful UDP inspections—such as reflexive access control lists—to reduce the impact to critical services on border firewalls or border routers. [[13](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/12_2/security/configuration/guide/fsecur_c/scfreflx.html)]
2. Use a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to create a Remotely Triggered Blackhole, preferably in coordination with upstream providers or ISPs. [[14](http://packetlife.net/blog/2009/jul/6/remotely-triggered-black-hole-rtbh-routing/)]
3. Maintain a list of primary upstream provider emergency contacts to coordinate responses to attacks. Upstream providers should conduct mitigation in coordination with downstream customers.

In general, ISP network and server administrators should use the following best practices to avoid becoming amplifier nodes:

1. Regularly update software and configurations to deny or limit abuse (e.g., DNS response rate limit). [[15](https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01000/0/A-Quick-Introduction-to-Response-Rate-Limiting.html)] [[16](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp38)] [[17](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp84)]
2. Disable and remove unwanted services, or deny access to local services over the internet.
3. Use UDP-based protocols—e.g., quality of service (QoS) on switching and routing devices—to enable network-based rate-limiting to legitimate services provided over the internet.
4. Work with Customer Provider Edge manufacturers for secure configuration and software. [[18](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/WhitePaper/2014_019_001_312679.pdf)]

As a service provider, to avoid any misuse of internet resources:

1. Use ingress filtering to block spoofed packets (See the Spoofer Project [[19](https://spoofer.caida.org/)], and IETF BCP 38 and BCP 84 guidelines). [[20](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/WhitePaper/2014_019_001_312679.pdf)]
2. Use traffic shaping on UDP service requests to ensure repeated access to over-the-Internet resources is not abusive. [[21](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2475)] [[22](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3260)]

Beginning in mid-February 2022, security researchers, network operators, and security vendors observed a spike in DDoS attacks sourced from [UDP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/) port 10074 targeting broadband access ISPs, financial institutions, logistics companies, and organizations in other vertical markets.

Upon further investigation, it was determined that the devices abused to launch these attacks are MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems produced by [Mitel](https://www.mitel.com), which incorporate TP-240 VoIP- processing interface cards and supporting software; their primary function is to provide Internet-based site-to-site voice connectivity for PBX systems.

Approximately 2600 of these systems have been incorrectly provisioned so that an unauthenticated system test facility has been inadvertently exposed to the public Internet, allowing attackers to leverage these PBX VoIP gateways as DDoS reflectors/amplifiers.

Mitel is aware that these systems are being abused to facilitate high-pps (packets-per-second) DDoS attacks, and have been actively working with customers to remediate abusable devices with patched software that disables public access to the system test facility.

In this blog, we will further explore the observed activity, explain how the driver has been abused, and share recommended mitigation steps. This research was created cooperatively among a team of researchers from Akamai SIRT, Cloudflare, Lumen Black Lotus Labs, NETSCOUT ASERT, TELUS, Team Cymru, and The Shadowserver Foundation.

### DDoS attacks in the wild

While spikes of network traffic associated with the vulnerable service were observed on January 8th and February 7,th 2022, we believe the first actual attacks leveraging the exploit began on February 18th.

Observed attacks were primarily predicated on packets-per-second, or throughput, and appeared to be UDP reflection/amplification attacks sourced from UDP/10074 that were mainly directed towards destination ports UDP/80 and UDP/443. The single largest observed attack of this type preceding this one was approximately 53 Mpps and 23 Gbps. The average packet size for that attack was approximately 60 bytes, with an attack duration of approximately 5 minutes. The amplified attack packets are not fragmented.

This particular attack vector differs from most UDP reflection/amplification attack methodologies in that the exposed system test facility can be abused to launch a sustained DDoS attack of up to 14 hours in duration by means of *a single spoofed attack initiation packet*, resulting in a record-setting packet amplification ratio of *4,294,967,296:1*. A controlled test of this DDoS attack vector yielded more than 400 Mmpps of sustained DDoS attack traffic.

It should be noted that this single-packet attack initiation capability has the effect of precluding network operator traceback of the spoofed attack initiator traffic. This helps mask the attack traffic generation infrastructure, making it less likely that the attack origin can be traced compared with other UDP reflection/amplification DDoS attack vectors.

### Abusing the tp240dvr driver

The abused service on affected Mitel systems is called tp240dvr (âTP-240 driverâ) and appears to run as a software bridge to facilitate interactions with TDM/VoIP PCI interface cards. The service listens for commands on UDP/10074 and is not meant to be exposed to the Internet, as confirmed by the manufacturer of these devices. It is this exposure to the Internet that ultimately allows it to be abused.

The tp240dvr service exposes an unusual command that is designed to stress-test its clients in order to facilitate debugging and performance testing. This command can be abused to cause the tp240dvr service to send this stress-test to attack victims. The traffic consists of a high rate of short informative status update packets that can potentially overwhelm victims and cause the DDoS scenario.

This command can also be abused by attackers to launch very high-throughput attacks. Attackers can use specially-crafted commands to cause the tp240dvr service to send larger informative status update packets, significantly increasing the amplification ratio.

By extensively testing isolated virtual TP-240-based systems in a lab setting, researchers were able to cause these devices to generate massive amounts of traffic in response to comparatively small request payloads. We will cover this attack scenario in greater technical depth in the following sections.

### Calculating the potential attack impact

As previously mentioned, amplification via this abusable test facility differs substantially from how it is accomplished with most other UDP reflection/amplification DDoS vectors. Typically, reflection/amplification attacks require the attacker to continuously transmit malicious payloads to abusable nodes for as long as they wish to attack the victim. In the case of TP-240 reflection/amplification, this continuous transmission is not necessary to launch high-impact DDoS attacks.

Instead, an attacker leveraging TP-240 reflection/amplification can launch a high-impact DDoS attack using a single packet. Examination of the tp240dvr binary reveals that, due to its design, an attacker can theoretically cause the service to emit 2,147,483,647 responses to a single malicious command. Each response generates two packets on the wire, leading to approximately 4,294,967,294 amplified attack packets being directed toward the attack victim.

For each response to a command, the first packet contains a counter that increments with each sent response. As the counter value increments, the size of this first packet will grow from 36 bytes to 45 bytes. The second packet contains diagnostic output from the function, which can be influenced by the attacker. By optimizing each initiator packet to maximize the size of the second packet, every command will result in amplified packets that are up to 1,184 bytes in length.

In theory, a single abusable node generating the upper limit of 4,294,967,294 packets at a rate of 80kpps would result in an attack duration of roughly 14 hours. Over the course of the attack, the âcounterâ packets alone would generate roughly 95.5GB of amplified attack traffic destined for the targeted network. The maximally-padded âdiagnostic outputâ packets would account for an additional 2.5TB of attack traffic directed towards the target.

This would yield a sustained flood of just under 393mb/sec of attack traffic from a single reflector/amplifier, all resulting from a single spoofed attack initiator packet of only 1,119 bytes in length. This results in a nearly unimaginable amplification ratio of 2,200,288,816:1 â a multiplier of *220 billion percent*, triggered by a single packet.

### Upper boundaries of attack volume and simultaneity

The tp240dvr service processes commands using a single thread. This means they can only process a single command at a time, and thus can only be used to launch one attack at a time. In the example scenario presented above, during the 14 hours that the abused device would be attacking the target, it cannot be leveraged to attack any other target. This is somewhat unique in the context of DDoS reflection/amplification vectors.

Although this characteristic also causes the tp240dvr service to be unavailable to legitimate users, it is much preferable to having these devices be leveraged in parallel by multiple attackers â and leaving legitimate operators of these systems to wonder why their outbound Internet data capacity is being consumed at much higher rates.

Additionally, it appears these devices are on relatively low-powered hardware, in terms of their traffic-generation capabilities. On an Internet where 100/Gbps links, dozens of CPU cores, and multi-threading capabilities have become commonplace, we can all be thankful this abusable service is not found on top-of-the-line hardware platforms capable of individually generating millions of packets per second, and running with thousands of parallelized threads.

Lastly, it is also good news that of the tens of thousands of these devices, which have been purchased and deployed historically by governments, commercial enterprises, and other organizations worldwide, a relatively small number of them have been configured in a manner that leaves them in this abusable state, and of those, many have been properly secured and taken offline from an attackerâs perspective.

### Collateral impact

The collateral impact of TP-240 reflection/amplification attacks is potentially significant for organizations with Internet-exposed Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems that are abused as DDoS reflectors/amplifiers.

This may include partial or full interruption of voice communications through these systems, as well as additional service disruption due to transit capacity consumption, state-table exhaustion of NATs, and stateful firewalls, etc.

Wholesale filtering of all UDP/10074-sourced traffic by network operators may potentially overblock legitimate Internet traffic, and is therefore contraindicated.

### Recommended actions

TP-240 reflection/amplification DDoS attacks are sourced from UDP/10074 and destined for the UDP port of the attackerâs choice. This amplified attack traffic can be detected, classified, traced back, and safely mitigated using standard DDoS defense tools and techniques.

Flow telemetry and packet capture via open-source and commercial analysis systems can alert network operators and end customers of TP-240 reflection/amplification attacks.

Network access control lists (ACLs), flowspec, destination-based remotely triggered blackhole (D/RTBH), source-based remotely triggered blackhole (S/RTBH), and intelligent DDoS mitigation systems can be used to mitigate these attacks.

Network operators should perform reconnaissance to identify and facilitate remediation of abusable TP-240 reflectors/amplifiers on their networks and/or the networks of their customers. Â Operators of Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems should proactively contact Mitel in order to receive specific remediation instructions from the vendor.

Organizations with business-critical public-facing Internet properties should ensure that all relevant network infrastructure, architectural, and operational Best Current Practices (BCPs) have been implemented, including situationally specific network access policies that only permit Internet traffic via required IP protocols and ports. Internet access network traffic to/from internal organizational personnel should be isolated from Internet traffic to/from public-facing Internet properties, and served via separate upstream Internet transit links.

[DDoS defenses](https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/) for all public-facing Internet properties and supporting infrastructure should be implemented in a situationally appropriate manner, including periodic testing to ensure that any changes to the organizationâs servers/services/applications are incorporated into its DDoS defense plan.

It is imperative that organizations operating mission-critical public-facing Internet properties and/or infrastructure ensure that all servers/services/application/datastores/infrastructure elements are protected against DDoS attack, and are included in periodic, realistic tests of the organizationâs DDoS mitigation plan. Critical ancillary supporting services such as authoritative and recursive DNS servers must be included in this plan.

Network operators should implement ingress and egress source address validation in order to prevent attackers from initiating reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.

All potential DDoS attack mitigation measures described in this document ***MUST*** be tested and customized in a situationally appropriate manner prior to deployment on production networks.

### Mitigating factors

Operators of Internet-exposed TP-240-based Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems can prevent abuse of their systems to launch DDoS attacks by blocking incoming Internet traffic destined for UDP/10074 via access control lists (ACLs), firewall rules, and other standard network access control policy enforcement mechanisms.

Mitel have provided patched software versions that prevent TP-240-equipped MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems from being abused as DDoS reflectors/amplifiers by preventing exposure of the service to the Internet. Mitel customers should contact the vendor for remediation instructions.

Collateral impact to abusable TP-240 reflectors/amplifiers can alert network operators and/or end-customers to remove affected systems from âdemilitarized zoneâ (DMZ) networks or Internet Data Centers (IDCs), or to disable relevant UDP port-forwarding rules that allow specific UDP/10074 traffic sourced from the public Internet to reach these devices, thereby preventing them from being abused to launch reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.

The amplified attack traffic is not fragmented, so there is no additional attack component consisting of non-initial fragments, as is the case with many other UDP reflection/amplification DDoS vectors.

Implementation of ingress and egress source-address validation (SAV; also known as anti-spoofing) can [prevent attackers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/how-to-prevent-ddos-attacks/) from launching reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.

### Conclusion

Unfortunately, many abusable services that should not be exposed to the public Internet are nevertheless left open for attackers to exploit. This scenario is yet another example of real-world deployments not adhering to vendor guidance. Vendors can prevent this situation by adopting âsafe by defaultâ postures on devices before shipping.

Reflection/amplification DDoS attacks would be impossible to launch if all network operators implemented ingress and egress source-address validation (SAV, also known as anti-spoofing). Â The ability to spoof the IP address(es) of the intended attack target(s) is required to launch such attacks. Service providers must continue to implement SAV in their own networks, and require that their downstream customers do so.

As is routinely the case with newer DDoS attack vectors, it appears that after an initial period of employment by advanced attackers with access to bespoke DDoS attack infrastructure, TP-240 reflection/amplification has been weaponized and added to the arsenals of so-called âbooter/stresserâ DDoS-for-hire services, placing it within the reach of the general attacker population.

Collaboration across the operational, research, and vendor communities is central to the continued viability of the Internet. The quick response to and ongoing remediation of this high-impact DDoS attack vector has only been possible as a result of such collaboration. Organizations with a vested interest in the stability and resiliency of the Internet should embrace and support cross-industry cooperative efforts as a core principle.

The combined efforts of the research and mitigation task force demonstrates that successful collaboration across industry peers to quickly remediate threats to availability and resiliency is not only possible, but is also increasingly critical for the continued viability of the global Internet.

### Executive summary

* A new reflection/amplification [distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)](/glossary/what-is-ddos) vector with a record-breaking potential amplification ratio of 4,294,967,296:1 has been abused by attackers in the wild to launch multiple high-impact DDoS attacks.

* Security researchers, network operators, and security vendors observed these attacks and formed a task force to investigate the new DDoS vector and provide mitigation guidance.

* Approximately 2,600 Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems acting as PBX-to-internet gateways were incorrectly deployed with an abusable system test facility exposed to the public internet.

* Attackers were actively leveraging these systems to launch reflection/amplification DDoS attacks of more than 53 million packets per second (Mpps). With optimal attack tuning, the potential traffic yield for this DDoS vector is significantly higher.

* Attacks have been observed on broadband access ISPs, financial institutions, logistics companies, gaming companies, and organizations in other vertical markets.

* The attacks can be mitigated using standard DDoS-defense techniques.

* Mitel has released patched software that disables the abusable test facility, and is actively engaged in remediation efforts with their customers.

* Research and mitigation task force contributors include Akamai SIRT, Cloudflare, Lumen Black Lotus Labs, Mitel, NETSCOUT ASERT, Team Cymru, TELUS, and The Shadowserver Foundation.

### Introduction

Beginning in mid-February 2022, security researchers, network operators, and security vendors observed a spike in DDoS attacks sourced from UDP port 10074 targeting broadband access ISPs, financial institutions, logistics companies, and organizations in other vertical markets.

Upon further investigation, it was determined that the devices abused to launch these attacks are MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems produced by [Mitel](https://www.mitel.com/), which incorporate TP-240 VoIP-processing interface cards and supporting software; their primary function is to provide internet-based site-to-site voice connectivity for PBX systems.

Approximately 2,600 of these systems have been incorrectly provisioned so that an unauthenticated system test facility has been inadvertently exposed to the public internet, allowing attackers to leverage these PBX VoIP gateways as DDoS reflectors/amplifiers.

Mitel is aware that these systems are being abused to facilitate high-pps DDoS attacks, and have been actively working with customers to remediate abusable devices with patched software that disables public access to the system test facility.

In this blog, we will further explore the observed activity, explain how the driver has been abused, and share recommended mitigation steps. This research was created cooperatively among a team of researchers from Akamai SIRT, Cloudflare, Lumen Black Lotus Labs, NETSCOUT ASERT, Team Cymru, TELUS, and The Shadowserver Foundation.

### DDoS attacks in the wild

While spikes of network traffic associated with the vulnerable service were observed on January 8 and February 7, 2022, we believe the first actual attacks leveraging the exploit began on February 18.

Observed attacks were primarily predicated on pps, or throughput, and appeared to be UDP reflection/amplification attacks sourced from UDP/10074 that were mainly directed toward destination ports UDP/80 and UDP/443. The single largest observed attack of this type preceding this one was approximately 53 Mpps and 23 Gbps. The average packet size for that attack was approximately 60 bytes, with an attack duration of approximately 5 minutes. The amplified attack packets are not fragmented.

This particular attack vector differs from most UDP reflection/amplification attack methodologies in that the exposed system test facility can be abused to launch a sustained DDoS attack of up to 14 hours in duration by means of a single spoofed attack initiation packet, resulting in a record-setting packet amplification ratio of 4,294,967,296:1. A controlled test of this DDoS attack vector yielded more than 400 Mpps of sustained DDoS attack traffic.

It should be noted that this single-packet attack initiation capability has the effect of precluding network operator traceback of the spoofed attack initiator traffic. This helps mask the attack traffic generation infrastructure, making it less likely that the attack origin can be traced compared with other UDP reflection/amplification DDoS attack vectors.

### Abusing the tp240dvr driver

The abused service on affected Mitel systems is called tp240dvr (“TP-240 driver”) and appears to run as a software bridge to facilitate interactions with TDM/VoIP PCI interface cards. The service listens for commands on UDP/10074 and is not meant to be exposed to the internet, as confirmed by the manufacturer of these devices. It is this exposure to the internet that ultimately allows it to be abused.

The tp240dvr service exposes an unusual command that is designed to stress test its clients in order to facilitate debugging and performance testing. This command can be abused to cause the tp240dvr service to send this stress test to attack victims. The traffic consists of a high rate of short informative status update packets that can potentially overwhelm victims and cause the DDoS scenario.

This command can also be abused by attackers to launch very high-throughput attacks. Attackers can use specially crafted commands to cause the tp240dvr service to send larger informative status update packets, significantly increasing the amplification ratio.

By extensively testing isolated virtual TP-240–based systems in a lab setting, researchers were able to cause these devices to generate massive amounts of traffic in response to comparatively small request payloads. We will cover this attack scenario in greater technical depth in the following sections.

### Calculating the potential attack impact

As previously mentioned, amplification via this abusable test facility differs substantially from how it is accomplished with most other UDP reflection/amplification DDoS vectors. Typically, reflection/amplification attacks require the attacker to continuously transmit malicious payloads to abusable nodes for as long as they wish to attack the victim. In the case of TP-240 reflection/amplification, this continuous transmission is not necessary to launch high-impact DDoS attacks.

Instead, an attacker leveraging TP-240 reflection/amplification can launch a high-impact DDoS attack using a single packet. Examination of the tp240dvr binary reveals that, due to its design, an attacker can theoretically cause the service to emit 2,147,483,647 responses to a single malicious command. Each response generates two packets on the wire, leading to approximately 4,294,967,294 amplified attack packets being directed toward the attack victim.

For each response to a command, the first packet contains a counter that increments with each sent response. As the counter value increments, the size of this first packet will grow from 36 bytes to 45 bytes. The second packet contains diagnostic output from the function, which can be influenced by the attacker. By optimizing each initiator packet to maximize the size of the second packet, every command will result in amplified packets that are up to 1,184 bytes in length.

In theory, a single abusable node generating the upper limit of 4,294,967,294 packets at a rate of 80 thousand packets per second (Kpps) would result in an attack duration of roughly 14 hours. Over the course of the attack, the “counter” packets alone would generate roughly 95.5 GB of amplified attack traffic destined for the targeted network. The maximally padded “diagnostic output” packets would account for an additional 2.5 TB of attack traffic directed toward the target.

This would yield a sustained flood of just under 393 Mmbps of attack traffic from a single reflector/amplifier, all resulting from a single spoofed attack initiator packet of only 1,119 bytes in length. This results in a nearly unimaginable amplification ratio of 2,200,288,816:1 — a multiplier of 220 billion percent, triggered by a single packet.

### Upper boundaries of attack volume and simultaneity

The tp240dvr service processes commands using a single thread. This means they can only process a single command at a time, and thus can only be used to launch one attack at a time. In the example scenario presented above, during the 14 hours that the abused device would be attacking the target, it cannot be leveraged to attack any other target. This is somewhat unique in the context of DDoS reflection/amplification vectors.

Although this characteristic also causes the tp240dvr service to be unavailable to legitimate users, it is much preferable to having these devices be leveraged in parallel by multiple attackers — and leaving legitimate operators of these systems to wonder why their outbound internet data capacity is being consumed at much higher rates.

Additionally, it appears these devices are on relatively low-powered hardware in terms of their traffic-generation capabilities. On an internet where 100 Ggbps links, dozens of CPU cores, and multithreading capabilities have become commonplace, we can all be thankful this abusable service is not found on top-of-the-line hardware platforms capable of individually generating Mpps, and running with thousands of parallelized threads.

Lastly, it is also good news that of the tens of thousands of these devices that have been purchased and deployed historically by governments, commercial enterprises, and other organizations worldwide, a relatively small number of them have been configured in a manner that leaves them in this abusable state, and of those, many have been properly secured and taken offline from an attacker’s perspective.

### Collateral impact

The collateral impact of TP-240 reflection/amplification attacks is potentially significant for organizations with internet-exposed Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems that are abused as DDoS reflectors/amplifiers.

This may include partial or full interruption of voice communications through these systems, as well as additional service disruption due to transit capacity consumption, state-table exhaustion of network address translations, stateful firewalls, and so forth.

Wholesale filtering of all UDP/10074-sourced traffic by network operators may potentially overmitigate legitimate internet traffic, and is therefore contraindicated.

### Recommended actions

TP-240 reflection/amplification DDoS attacks are sourced from UDP/10074 and destined for the UDP port of the attacker’s choice. This amplified attack traffic can be detected, classified, traced back, and safely mitigated using standard DDoS defense tools and techniques.

Flow telemetry and packet capture via open-source and commercial analysis systems can alert network operators and end customers of TP-240 reflection/amplification attacks.

Network access control lists (ACLs), flowspec, destination-based remotely triggered blackhole, source-based remotely triggered blackhole, and intelligent DDoS mitigation systems can be used to mitigate these attacks.

Network operators should perform reconnaissance to identify and facilitate remediation of abusable TP-240 reflectors/amplifiers on their networks and/or the networks of their customers.  Operators of Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems should proactively contact Mitel to receive specific remediation instructions from the vendor.

Organizations with business-critical public-facing internet properties should ensure that all relevant network infrastructure, architectural, and operational best current practices have been implemented, including situationally specific network access policies that only permit internet traffic via required IP protocols and ports. Internet access network traffic to/from internal organizational personnel should be isolated from internet traffic to/from public-facing internet properties, and served via separate upstream internet transit links.

DDoS defenses for all public-facing internet properties and supporting infrastructure should be implemented in a situationally appropriate manner, including periodic testing to ensure that any changes to the organization’s servers/services/applications are incorporated into its DDoS-defense plan.

It is imperative that organizations operating mission-critical public-facing internet properties and/or infrastructure ensure that all servers/services/application/datastores/infrastructure elements are protected against DDoS attack, and are included in periodic, realistic tests of the organization’s DDoS mitigation plan. Critical ancillary supporting services such as authoritative and recursive DNS servers must be included in this plan.

Network operators should implement ingress and egress source address validation in order to prevent attackers from initiating reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.

All potential DDoS attack mitigation measures described in this document MUST be tested and customized in a situationally appropriate manner prior to deployment on production networks.

### Mitigating factors

Operators of internet-exposed TP-240–based Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems can prevent abuse of their systems to launch DDoS attacks by blocking incoming internet traffic destined for UDP/10074 via ACLs, firewall rules, and other standard network access control policy enforcement mechanisms.

Mitel has provided patched software versions that prevent TP-240–equipped MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems from being abused as DDoS reflectors/amplifiers by preventing exposure of the service to the internet. Mitel customers should contact the vendor for remediation instructions.

Collateral impact to abusable TP-240 reflectors/amplifiers can alert network operators and/or end customers to remove affected systems from “demilitarized zone” networks or internet data centers or to disable relevant UDP port–forwarding rules that allow specific UDP/10074 traffic sourced from the public internet to reach these devices, thereby preventing them from being abused to launch reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.

The amplified attack traffic is not fragmented, so there is no additional attack component consisting of noninitial fragments, as is the case with many other UDP reflection/amplification DDoS vectors.

Implementation of ingress and egress source-address validation (SAV; also known as anti-spoofing) can prevent attackers from launching reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.

### Conclusion

Unfortunately, many abusable services that should not be exposed to the public internet are nevertheless left open for attackers to exploit. This scenario is yet another example of real-world deployments that do not adhere to vendor guidance. Vendors can prevent this situation by adopting “safe by default” postures on devices before shipping.

Reflection/amplification DDoS attacks would be impossible to launch if all network operators implemented ingress and egress SAV (or anti-spoofing). The ability to spoof the IP address(es) of the intended attack target(s) is required to launch such attacks. Service providers must continue to implement SAV in their own networks, and require that their downstream customers do so as well.

As is routinely the case with newer DDoS attack vectors, it appears that after an initial period of employment by advanced attackers with access to bespoke DDoS attack infrastructure, TP-240 reflection/amplification has been weaponized and added to the arsenals of so-called “booter/stresser” DDoS-for-hire services, placing it within the reach of the general attacker population.

Collaboration across the operational, research, and vendor communities is central to the continued viability of the internet. The quick response to and ongoing remediation of this high-impact DDoS attack vector has only been possible as a result of such collaboration. Organizations with a vested interest in the stability and resiliency of the internet should embrace and support cross-industry cooperative efforts as a core principle.

The combined efforts of the research and mitigation task force demonstrates that successful collaboration across industry peers to quickly remediate threats to availability and resiliency is not only possible, but is also increasingly critical for the continued viability of the global internet.

If you look at where Cloudflare and some of the big clouds are going with their private networks, private backplanes, and "secure your traffic by putting it all over our network" zero trust plans it seems to be going that way. If open peering and the open Internet are to survive I think serious work needs to be done to fight DDOS attacks. It needs to be an effort analogous to the "war on spam" in the late 1990s / early 2000s. Unfortunately that war was sort of lost; e-mail is in practice barely an open protocol anymore and almost all e-mail is handled by a few giant companies that can leverage big data to filter spam. If you try to DIY a mail server you'll be simultaneously hit by spam and have to constantly fight mistaken filtration by larger e-mail providers who tend to distrust small mail servers by default. If the open Internet succumbs to DDOS "spam," we will lose something really huge and important. It would be the ultimate casualty of what so far has been almost a law (with very few exceptions): all open systems are destroyed by abuse if they become sufficiently popular. We also can't just leave it to the free market because the only solution the market will likely come up with is walled gardens. It's the easiest to engineer solution and the easiest to monetize. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [throw0101a](user?id=throw0101a) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614525)   | [parent](#30614371) | [next](#30617236) [–]  > *If you look at where Cloudflare and some of the big clouds are going with their private networks, private backplanes, and "secure your traffic by putting it all over our network" zero trust plans it seems to be going that way.* All the networks of the Internet are already private, just like the networks of AOL and CompuServe were private back in the day: your ISP's network is private, YouTube's network is private, AWS' network is private. It's just that those private networks agree to talk to each other. Otherwise your ISP would have to re-create YouTube and Reddit/forums and eBay/marketplace and…, and YouTube would have to buildout (inter)national network to connect their video services to people's homes. Just like AOL and CompuServe had to build out information services *and* a connectivity infrastructure back in the day. Now each of the previously walled gardens (messaging, forums, marketplaces, connectivity, etc) is done by its own entity, each taking a slice of the monetary pie for the service(s) they provide. The Internet is a 'network of networks', but it is also an agreement: an agreement for everyone to talk to everyone else. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [api](user?id=api) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614546)   | [root](#30614371) | [parent](#30614525) | [next](#30617236) [–]  I think that's kind of semantic. The agreement is what I'm talking about. It makes the Internet open. I can just send you a packet. That's what's in danger here. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [adrian\_b](user?id=adrian_b) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30617236)   | [parent](#30614371) | [prev](#30614525) | [next](#30614707) [–]  > If you try to DIY a mail server you'll be simultaneously hit by spam and have to constantly fight mistaken filtration by larger e-mail providers who tend to distrust small mail servers by default. I have managed my own e-mail server for around 20 years. Filtering spam has never been a problem. On the other hand your second problem has indeed existed, i.e. with various large e-mail providers which either blocked completely my e-mail messages without signalling any error, or they delayed for 1 day or 2 my messages, or they required many resendings of a message until really passing it to the destination. Fortunately such cases seem to have become much more seldom during the last couple of years. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [wiredfool](user?id=wiredfool) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30617425)   | [root](#30614371) | [parent](#30617236) | [next](#30614707) [–]  I've seen hideously inconvenient email pauses between Office365 and a massive NGO, so it's not just little mail servers. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [smasher164](user?id=smasher164) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614707)   | [parent](#30614371) | [prev](#30617236) | [next](#30614197) [–]  It's interesting that you say that, because we've already sort of balkanized around ISPs. However, CDNs and DDOS protection popped up around services that ISPs couldn't provide. Maybe the dream is for ISPs to provide these services as well, making it more tenable for regular users to self-host. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jgrahamc](user?id=jgrahamc) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614197)   | [prev](#30614371) | [next](#30614180) [–]  220 billion percent!

This seems like it would exceed that in many cases, since 1 byte in => 4.2 gigabytes out. Which is roughly 33.6 gbps. Not sure many of these vulnerable boxes actually have that amount of outbound bandwidth to utilize. (Please feel free to correct my quick math if I messed it up) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jwilk](user?id=jwilk) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614372)   | [root](#30614132) | [parent](#30614187) | [next](#30614168) [–]  Why do you want to send everything in one second? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nathanyz](user?id=nathanyz) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614974)   | [root](#30614132) | [parent](#30614372) | [next](#30614168) [–]  This is a good point, but then you need more boxes to perform the DDOS as the reason they are effective is overwhelming the packets per second or bandwidth per second of the receiving networks. So it definitely does allow for a sustained attack by a single box with limited outbound bandwidth, but that blunts the usual reasoning for why the amplification is so dangerous. Another interesting impact of this is that the higher the amplification, the more likely it is noticeable by the server that is being abused. I mean if you clog the outbound network for a company they will notice and try to resolve immediately. Versus some milder amplification where it can go under the radar, or at least the business impact urgency radar of a company much longer. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pickledcods](user?id=pickledcods) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614168)   | [root](#30614132) | [parent](#30614147) | [prev](#30614187) | [next](#30618064) [–]  because that value is a physical limit | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [black\_puppydog](user?id=black_puppydog) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614199)   | [root](#30614132) | [parent](#30614168) | [next](#30618064) [–]  How so?

Once that hits, the device would then be sending the traffic harmlessly to /dev/null for the next 14 hours and be unavailable for attacks. Not sure about the legal and ethical implications of that. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [londons\_explore](user?id=londons_explore) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614174)   | [prev](#30624365) | [next](#30620812) [–]  Tracking down these systems is easy, so these issues can normally be solved pretty easily. Thats because typically any amplification vector doesn't allow the source IP of the amplifier to be spoofed. So as soon as a DDoS attack begins, a sample of the packets can be taken to get a list of the amplifiers used. Those can then be tracked down and patched to no longer act as amplifiers. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sp332](user?id=sp332) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614215)   | [parent](#30614174) | [next](#30615610) [–]  It could be easily solved by the operator, but that doesn't mean it's easy for the victims to get the operators to fix their stuff. These amplifiers are already run by people who ignored the software manufacturer's directions.

Sure, we can very easily get a list of DDoS source IP addresses. Any decent network operator can get a list of flows matching some DDoS criteria and generate a report of IP addresses. In the case of this TP240 attack, you're talking about ~2600 independent businesses across the world. Assuming you are able to determine the actual source of the traffic and work with a vendor to patch it, you're still tasked with somehow getting 2600 businesses to patch their systems or modify firewall rules. In the case of the memcached amplification attack, Cloudflare saw upwards of 5800 source IPs in the attacks, and Shodan reported nearly 88000 IPs responding on port 11211 [1]. Tracking down the owners of 88k installations across public clouds, businesses, probably some residential networks, is a monumental task. There's nothing easy about it.

You can be sure that by only null-routing their entire C-class, adjacent customers will loudly complain to the operator who will quickly identify the source and disconnect it. The best way to deploy fixes on the net has always been to first disconnect them. This way you don't have to convince anyone, it's done the other way around.

Unless you have coordination with the network operators on which those amplifiers are sitting, your null-routing of the amplifier in your own network isn't going to stop it from attacking other targets. If the amplifier is something like a DNS server, then your collateral damage isn't just "adjacent customers", it's potentially thousands of other users and resolvers on your own network. If those amplifiers are on a cloud service provider like AWS, you're going to potentially inflict even more pain onto your own paying customers who will no longer be able to communicate with AWS. You will essentially perform the DoS they were aiming for. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [LinuxBender](user?id=LinuxBender) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614307)   | [parent](#30614174) | [prev](#30615610) | [next](#30617532) [–]  Let's get started!

You are liable unless you can pass off that liability to someone else. So the ISP would be liable by default, and would have an incentive to filter their customers, or require them to abide by certain rules, pass some audits, provide proof of insurance or post a large deposit. You could have insurers who in exchange of automated security scans will insure you, solving the problem for end-users at a reasonable cost.

When DES was developed and standardized in 1976, the NSA had input in selecting some of the constants that were chosen for it [0]. It wasn't until the late 80s when independent development of differential cryptanalysis [1] came out, and people realized that the DES constants were deliberately chosen to be resistant to this attack. The NSA has since turned away from this responsibility, and has done the exact opposite. When Dual\_EC\_DRBG was developed [2], there was a similar choice of constants, with the final values having been chosen by the NSA.

We also have a tendency to conflate the requirements on software systems with respect to security threats as being somewhat similar to the requirements on other kinds of engineering with respect to safety and environmental threats, and I think that does a disservice to the vastly different scope of responsibility involved. When I see people arguing that software engineers need to treat security as seriously as, say civil engineers treat structural stability when designing a bridge, or mechanical engineers treat vehicle crash safety, I agree to an extent, but I also think it’s worth considering: Most bridges are not designed to actually survive being deliberately attacked with the kinds of weapons nation states can bring to bear on them. When militaries get involved, bridges tend to fail. Likewise, civilian car safety testing does not make cars that are able to survive attacks that nation state actors can carry out with things like tanks, mines, or drones. We need to be realistic in our expectations for what level of military threat civilian systems can reasonably be expected to deal with unaided. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kevincox](user?id=kevincox) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614246)   | [parent](#30614189) | [prev](#30614669) | [next](#30616709) [–]  While your logic is solid and I do think this would be ideal I struggle to see how this would work. Dropping bombs on a walmart store is clearly unwelcome, sending traffic to walmart's website? Much less clear. You can guess based on the traffic pattern but the only way to really know is to ask walmart if this is welcome traffic (not just a burst because some new product came out). Especially since many cases are DoS with encrypted TLS traffic that looks much like any other traffic to an outside observer. However much of the protection is threat of retaliation ("if you drop bombs on us we will flatten your country"). So maybe that is the solution here, the government should treat these attacks as real threats and punish those responsible. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [marcosdumay](user?id=marcosdumay) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614373)   | [root](#30614189) | [parent](#30614246) | [next](#30616709) [–]  Well, a government could start by mandating that internet peers authenticate their packages, and cutting the access of bad actors.

We definitely need laws to hold companies accountable for their IT-related activity. For one, we need to hold commercial vendors accountable - that means especially to refuse to provide security updates for the reasonably expected life time of a piece of software or hardware. But especially, we need the companies using IT systems to be held accountable. The magic word is "defense in depth" - the scenario of the post we're talking about is a piece of equipment that was not supposed to be reachable from the Internet and despite that knowledge it *was* made accessible to the Internet. Seriously, *anyone* caught exposing dangerous stuff to Shodan should be fined to hell and back. Or to continue using your military comparison: most governments have laws that call for harsh punishment for "aid to the enemy" or similar. Time to update the law to the new digital world. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dahfizz](user?id=dahfizz) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614434)   | [root](#30614189) | [parent](#30614336) | [next](#30614574) [–]  A failure to defend yourself is not aiding the enemy. That is insane. The government provides for the common security. That's one of it's most fundamental jobs. Imagine if your house was destroyed by a Russian drone and you were thrown in jail for not having enough "defense in depth" against drone strikes. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mschuster91](user?id=mschuster91) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614507)   | [root](#30614189) | [parent](#30614434) | [next](#30614574) [–]  > A failure to defend yourself is not aiding the enemy. That is insane. Let's say you are the leader of a border post, and you leave your post unmanned allowing the enemy in - of course you will be held accountable. Exposing stuff to the Internet *despite the manufacturer warning against it* is at least grossly negligent and should be punished. We are at war with Russia and China on a nation-state level and on top of that we also have cybercrime gangs. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dahfizz](user?id=dahfizz) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614876)   | [root](#30614189) | [parent](#30614507) | [next](#30614774) [–]  > Let's say you are the leader of a border post, and you leave your post unmanned allowing the enemy in - of course you will be held accountable. Yes! Because if you are a member of the state operated defense force, then defense is your responsibility. The state is responsible for defense. If on the other hand, you are a civilian who just happens to own property near a border, you have absolutely zero obligation to defend the border yourself. The same is true for businesses near a border. > We are at war with Russia and China on a nation-state level and on top of that we also have cybercrime gangs. Man, if only society had a way to form some sort of governance body which could provide defense against other nations and provide some sort of justice system to protect against and punish crimes. Oh well, I guess its every man for themselves ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯ | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [wyattpeak](user?id=wyattpeak) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614774)   | [root](#30614189) | [parent](#30614507) | [prev](#30614876) | [next](#30616559) [–]  > Let's say you are the leader of a border post Let's not say that.

Another example of a government agency that fails at their job: the FDA. The FDA is supposed to protect consumers from harmful foods and medications, but the fact that you can walk into any store and grab a can of food or bottle of vitamins/supplements contaminated with heavy metals is a huge red flag [0][1][2][3][4][5]. The FDA does 0 product screening whatsoever. If the FDA actually did their job, healthcare revenues would be at an all time low in America. It pays off big time to have a diseased population.

The **Data Encryption Standard** (**DES** [/ˌdiːˌiːˈɛs, dɛz/](/wiki/Help%3AIPA/English "Help:IPA/English")) is a [symmetric-key algorithm](/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm "Symmetric-key algorithm") for the [encryption](/wiki/Encryption "Encryption") of digital data. Although its short key length of 56 bits makes it too insecure for modern applications, it has been highly influential in the advancement of [cryptography](/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography").

Developed in the early 1970s at [IBM](/wiki/IBM "IBM") and based on an earlier design by [Horst Feistel](/wiki/Horst_Feistel "Horst Feistel"), the algorithm was submitted to the [National Bureau of Standards](/wiki/National_Bureau_of_Standards "National Bureau of Standards") (NBS) following the agency's invitation to propose a candidate for the protection of sensitive, unclassified electronic government data. In 1976, after consultation with the [National Security Agency](/wiki/National_Security_Agency "National Security Agency") (NSA), the NBS selected a slightly modified version (strengthened against [differential cryptanalysis](/wiki/Differential_cryptanalysis "Differential cryptanalysis"), but weakened against [brute-force attacks](/wiki/Brute-force_attack "Brute-force attack")), which was published as an official [Federal Information Processing Standard](/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard "Federal Information Processing Standard") (FIPS) for the United States in 1977.[[2]](#cite_note-:3-2)

The publication of an NSA-approved encryption standard led to its quick international adoption and widespread academic scrutiny. Controversies arose from [classified](/wiki/Classified_information "Classified information") design elements, a relatively short [key length](/wiki/Key_length "Key length") of the [symmetric-key](/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm "Symmetric-key algorithm") [block cipher](/wiki/Block_cipher "Block cipher") design, and the involvement of the NSA, raising suspicions about a [backdoor](/wiki/Backdoor_%28computing%29 "Backdoor (computing)"). The [S-boxes](/wiki/S-box "S-box") that had prompted those suspicions were designed by the NSA to address a vulnerability they secretly knew ([differential cryptanalysis](/wiki/Differential_cryptanalysis "Differential cryptanalysis")). However, the NSA also ensured that the key size was drastically reduced so that they could break the cipher by brute force attack.[[2]](#cite_note-:3-2)[*[failed verification](/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVerifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")*] The intense academic scrutiny the algorithm received over time led to the modern understanding of block ciphers and their [cryptanalysis](/wiki/Cryptanalysis "Cryptanalysis").

DES is insecure due to the relatively short [56-bit key size](/wiki/56-bit_encryption "56-bit encryption"). In January 1999, [distributed.net](/wiki/Distributed.net "Distributed.net") and the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation "Electronic Frontier Foundation") collaborated to publicly break a DES key in 22 hours and 15 minutes (see [§ Chronology](#Chronology)). There are also some analytical results which demonstrate theoretical weaknesses in the cipher, although they are infeasible in practice. The algorithm is believed to be practically secure in the form of [Triple DES](/wiki/Triple_DES "Triple DES"), although there are theoretical attacks. This cipher has been superseded by the [Advanced Encryption Standard](/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard "Advanced Encryption Standard") (AES). DES has been withdrawn as a standard by the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology "National Institute of Standards and Technology").[[3]](#cite_note-Lazo-3)

Some documents distinguish between the DES standard and its algorithm, referring to the algorithm as the **DEA** (**Data Encryption Algorithm**).

## History

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Data_Encryption_Standard&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

The origins of DES date to 1972, when a [National Bureau of Standards](/wiki/National_Bureau_of_Standards "National Bureau of Standards") study of US government [computer security](/wiki/Computer_security "Computer security") identified a need for a government-wide standard for encrypting unclassified, sensitive information.[[4]](#cite_note-4)

Around the same time, engineer [Mohamed Atalla](/wiki/Mohamed_Atalla "Mohamed Atalla") in 1972 founded [Atalla Corporation](/wiki/Atalla_Corporation "Atalla Corporation") and developed the first [hardware security module](/wiki/Hardware_security_module "Hardware security module") (HSM), the so-called "Atalla Box" which was commercialized in 1973. It protected offline devices with a secure [PIN](/wiki/Personal_identification_number "Personal identification number") generating key, and was a commercial success. Banks and credit card companies were fearful that Atalla would dominate the market, which spurred the development of an international encryption standard.[[3]](#cite_note-Lazo-3) Atalla was an early competitor to [IBM](/wiki/IBM "IBM") in the banking market, and was cited as an influence by IBM employees who worked on the DES standard.[[5]](#cite_note-nist-5) The [IBM 3624](/wiki/IBM_3624 "IBM 3624") later adopted a similar PIN verification system to the earlier Atalla system.[[6]](#cite_note-Konheim-6)

On 15 May 1973, after consulting with the NSA, NBS solicited proposals for a cipher that would meet rigorous design criteria. None of the submissions was suitable. A second request was issued on 27 August 1974. This time, [IBM](/wiki/IBM "IBM") submitted a candidate which was deemed acceptable—a cipher developed during the period 1973–1974 based on an earlier algorithm, [Horst Feistel](/wiki/Horst_Feistel "Horst Feistel")'s [Lucifer](/wiki/Lucifer_%28cipher%29 "Lucifer (cipher)") cipher. The team at IBM involved in cipher design and analysis included Feistel, [Walter Tuchman](/wiki/Walter_Tuchman "Walter Tuchman"), [Don Coppersmith](/wiki/Don_Coppersmith "Don Coppersmith"), Alan Konheim, Carl Meyer, Mike Matyas, [Roy Adler](/wiki/Roy_Adler "Roy Adler"), [Edna Grossman](/wiki/Edna_Grossman "Edna Grossman"), Bill Notz, Lynn Smith, and [Bryant Tuckerman](/wiki/Bryant_Tuckerman "Bryant Tuckerman").

### NSA's involvement in the design

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Data_Encryption_Standard&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: NSA's involvement in the design")]

On 17 March 1975, the proposed DES was published in the *[Federal Register](/wiki/Federal_Register "Federal Register")*. Public comments were requested, and in the following year two open workshops were held to discuss the proposed standard. There was criticism received from [public-key cryptography](/wiki/Public-key_cryptography "Public-key cryptography") pioneers [Martin Hellman](/wiki/Martin_Hellman "Martin Hellman") and [Whitfield Diffie](/wiki/Whitfield_Diffie "Whitfield Diffie"),[[1]](#cite_note-dh-exh-1) citing a shortened [key length](/wiki/Key_length "Key length") and the mysterious "[S-boxes](/wiki/Substitution_box "Substitution box")" as evidence of improper interference from the NSA. The suspicion was that the algorithm had been covertly weakened by the intelligence agency so that they—but no one else—could easily read encrypted messages.[[7]](#cite_note-7) Alan Konheim (one of the designers of DES) commented, "We sent the S-boxes off to Washington. They came back and were all different."[[8]](#cite_note-8) The [United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence](/wiki/United_States_Senate_Select_Committee_on_Intelligence "United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence") reviewed the NSA's actions to determine whether there had been any improper involvement. In the unclassified summary of their findings, published in 1978, the Committee wrote:

> In the development of DES, NSA convinced [IBM](/wiki/IBM "IBM") that a reduced key size was sufficient; indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.[[9]](#cite_note-9)

However, it also found that

> NSA did not tamper with the design of the algorithm in any way. IBM invented and designed the algorithm, made all pertinent decisions regarding it, and concurred that the agreed upon key size was more than adequate for all commercial applications for which the DES was intended.[[10]](#cite_note-10)

Another member of the DES team, Walter Tuchman, stated "We developed the DES algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not dictate a single wire!"[[11]](#cite_note-11)
In contrast, a declassified NSA book on cryptologic history states:

> In 1973 NBS solicited private industry for a data encryption standard (DES). The first offerings were disappointing, so NSA began working on its own algorithm. Then Howard Rosenblum, deputy director for research and engineering, discovered that Walter Tuchman of IBM was working on a modification to Lucifer for general use. NSA gave Tuchman a clearance and brought him in to work jointly with the Agency on his Lucifer modification."[[12]](#cite_note-johnson3-12)

and

> NSA worked closely with IBM to strengthen the algorithm against all except brute-force attacks and to strengthen substitution tables, called S-boxes. Conversely, NSA tried to convince IBM to reduce the length of the key from 64 to 48 bits. Ultimately they compromised on a 56-bit key.[[13]](#cite_note-13)[[14]](#cite_note-14)

Some of the suspicions about hidden weaknesses in the S-boxes were allayed in 1990, with the independent discovery and open publication by [Eli Biham](/wiki/Eli_Biham "Eli Biham") and [Adi Shamir](/wiki/Adi_Shamir "Adi Shamir") of [differential cryptanalysis](/wiki/Differential_cryptanalysis "Differential cryptanalysis"), a general method for breaking block ciphers. The S-boxes of DES were much more resistant to the attack than if they had been chosen at random, strongly suggesting that IBM knew about the technique in the 1970s. This was indeed the case; in 1994, Don Coppersmith published some of the original design criteria for the S-boxes.[[15]](#cite_note-15) According to [Steven Levy](/wiki/Steven_Levy "Steven Levy"), IBM Watson researchers discovered differential cryptanalytic attacks in 1974 and were asked by the NSA to keep the technique secret.[[16]](#cite_note-Levy-16) Coppersmith explains IBM's secrecy decision by saying, "that was because [differential cryptanalysis] can be a very powerful tool, used against many schemes, and there was concern that such information in the public domain could adversely affect national security." Levy quotes Walter Tuchman: "[t]hey asked us to stamp all our documents confidential... We actually put a number on each one and locked them up in safes, because they were considered U.S. government classified. They said do it. So I did it".[[16]](#cite_note-Levy-16) Bruce Schneier observed that "It took the academic community two decades to figure out that the NSA 'tweaks' actually improved the security of DES."[[17]](#cite_note-schneier20040927-17)

### The algorithm as a standard

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Data_Encryption_Standard&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: The algorithm as a standard")]

Despite the criticisms, DES was approved as a federal standard in November 1976, and published on 15 January 1977 as [FIPS](/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard "Federal Information Processing Standard") PUB 46, authorized for use on all unclassified data. It was subsequently reaffirmed as the standard in 1983, 1988 (revised as FIPS-46-1), 1993 (FIPS-46-2), and again in 1999 (FIPS-46-3), the latter prescribing "[Triple DES](/wiki/Triple_DES "Triple DES")" (see below). On 26 May 2002, DES was finally superseded by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), following [a public competition](/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard_process "Advanced Encryption Standard process"). On 19 May 2005, FIPS 46-3 was officially withdrawn, but [NIST](/wiki/NIST "NIST") has approved [Triple DES](/wiki/Triple_DES "Triple DES") through the year 2030 for sensitive government information.[[18]](#cite_note-SP800-67-18)

The algorithm is also specified in [ANSI](/wiki/ANSI "ANSI") X3.92 (Today X3 is known as [INCITS](/wiki/INCITS "INCITS") and ANSI X3.92 as ANSI [INCITS](/wiki/INCITS "INCITS") 92),[[19]](#cite_note-19) NIST SP 800-67[[18]](#cite_note-SP800-67-18) and ISO/IEC 18033-3[[20]](#cite_note-20) (as a component of [TDEA](/wiki/TDEA "TDEA")).

Another theoretical attack, linear cryptanalysis, was published in 1994, but it was the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation "Electronic Frontier Foundation")'s [DES cracker](/wiki/EFF_DES_cracker "EFF DES cracker") in 1998 that demonstrated that DES could be attacked very practically, and highlighted the need for a replacement algorithm. These and other methods of [cryptanalysis](/wiki/Cryptanalysis "Cryptanalysis") are discussed in more detail later in this article.

The introduction of DES is considered to have been a catalyst for the academic study of cryptography, particularly of methods to crack block ciphers. According to a NIST retrospective about DES,

The DES can be said to have "jump-started" the nonmilitary study and development of encryption algorithms. In the 1970s there were very few cryptographers, except for those in military or intelligence organizations, and little academic study of cryptography. There are now many active academic cryptologists, mathematics departments with strong programs in cryptography, and commercial [information security](/wiki/Information_security "Information security") companies and consultants. A generation of cryptanalysts has cut its teeth analyzing (that is, trying to "crack") the DES algorithm. In the words of cryptographer [Bruce Schneier](/wiki/Bruce_Schneier "Bruce Schneier"),[[21]](#cite_note-21) "DES did more to galvanize the field of cryptanalysis than anything else. Now there was an algorithm to study." An astonishing share of the open literature in cryptography in the 1970s and 1980s dealt with the DES, and the DES is the standard against which every [symmetric key algorithm](/wiki/Symmetric_key_algorithm "Symmetric key algorithm") since has been compared.[[22]](#cite_note-22)

## Description

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Data_Encryption_Standard&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Description")]
For brevity, the following description omits the exact transformations and permutations which specify the algorithm. For further details, see [DES supplementary material](/wiki/DES_supplementary_material "DES supplementary material").
![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/DES-main-network.png/250px-DES-main-network.png)

*[Figure 1](/wiki/File%3ADES-main-network.png "File:DES-main-network.png")*— The overall Feistel structure of DES

DES is the archetypal [block cipher](/wiki/Block_cipher "Block cipher")—an [algorithm](/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") that takes a fixed-length string of [plaintext](/wiki/Plaintext "Plaintext") bits and transforms it through a series of complicated operations into another [ciphertext](/wiki/Ciphertext "Ciphertext") bitstring of the same length. In the case of DES, the [block size](/wiki/Block_size_%28cryptography%29 "Block size (cryptography)") is 64 bits. DES also uses a [key](/wiki/Key_%28cryptography%29 "Key (cryptography)") to customize the transformation, so that decryption can supposedly only be performed by those who know the particular key used to encrypt. The key ostensibly consists of 64 bits; however, only 56 of these are actually used by the algorithm. Eight bits are used solely for checking [parity](/wiki/Parity_bit "Parity bit"), and are thereafter discarded. Hence the effective [key length](/wiki/Key_length "Key length") is 56 bits.

The key is nominally stored or transmitted as 8 [bytes](/wiki/Byte "Byte"), each with odd parity. According to ANSI X3.92-1981 (Now, known as ANSI [INCITS](/wiki/INCITS "INCITS") 92–1981), section 3.5:

> One bit in each 8-bit byte of the *KEY* may be utilized for error detection in key generation, distribution, and storage. Bits 8, 16,..., 64 are for use in ensuring that each byte is of odd parity.

Like other block ciphers, DES by itself is not a secure means of encryption, but must instead be used in a [mode of operation](/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation "Block cipher mode of operation"). FIPS-81 specifies several modes for use with DES.[[27]](#cite_note-27) Further comments on the usage of DES are contained in FIPS-74.[[28]](#cite_note-28)

Decryption uses the same structure as encryption, but with the keys used in reverse order. (This has the advantage that the same hardware or software can be used in both directions.)

### Overall structure

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Data_Encryption_Standard&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Overall structure")]

|  | This section **needs additional citations for [verification](/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVerifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")**. Please help [improve this article](/wiki/Special%3AEditPage/Data_Encryption_Standard "Special:EditPage/Data Encryption Standard") by [adding citations to reliable sources](/wiki/Help%3AReferencing_for_beginners "Help:Referencing for beginners") in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *(August 2009)* *([Learn how and when to remove this message](/wiki/Help%3AMaintenance_template_removal "Help:Maintenance template removal"))* |
| --- | --- |

The algorithm's overall structure is shown in Figure 1: there are 16 identical stages of processing, termed *rounds*. There is also an initial and final [permutation](/wiki/Permutation "Permutation"), termed *IP* and *FP*, which are [inverses](/wiki/Inverse_function "Inverse function") (IP "undoes" the action of FP, and vice versa). IP and FP have no cryptographic significance, but were included in order to facilitate loading blocks in and out of mid-1970s 8-bit based hardware.[[29]](#cite_note-29)

Before the main rounds, the block is divided into two 32-bit halves and processed alternately; this criss-crossing is known as the [Feistel scheme](/wiki/Feistel_scheme "Feistel scheme"). The Feistel structure ensures that decryption and encryption are very similar processes—the only difference is that the subkeys are applied in the reverse order when decrypting. The rest of the algorithm is identical. This greatly simplifies implementation, particularly in hardware, as there is no need for separate encryption and decryption algorithms.

The ⊕ symbol denotes the [exclusive-OR](/wiki/XOR "XOR") (XOR) operation. The *F-function* scrambles half a block together with some of the key. The output from the F-function is then combined with the other half of the block, and the halves are swapped before the next round. After the final round, the halves are swapped; this is a feature of the Feistel structure which makes encryption and decryption similar processes.

### The Feistel (F) function

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Data_Encryption_Standard&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: The Feistel (F) function")]

The F-function, depicted in Figure 2, operates on half a block (32 bits) at a time and consists of four stages:

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Data_Encription_Standard_Flow_Diagram.svg/250px-Data_Encription_Standard_Flow_Diagram.svg.png)

*[Figure 2](/wiki/File%3ADES-f-function.png "File:DES-f-function.png")*—The Feistel function (F-function) of DES

1. *Expansion*: the 32-bit half-block is expanded to 48 bits using the *expansion permutation*, denoted *E* in the diagram, by duplicating half of the bits. The output consists of eight 6-bit (8 × 6 = 48 bits) pieces, each containing a copy of 4 corresponding input bits, plus a copy of the immediately adjacent bit from each of the input pieces to either side.
2. *Key mixing*: the result is combined with a *subkey* using an XOR operation. Sixteen 48-bit subkeys—one for each round—are derived from the main key using the *[key schedule](/wiki/Key_schedule "Key schedule")* (described below).
3. *Substitution*: after mixing in the subkey, the block is divided into eight 6-bit pieces before processing by the *[S-boxes](/wiki/Substitution_box "Substitution box")*, or *substitution boxes*. Each of the eight S-boxes replaces its six input bits with four output bits according to a non-linear transformation, provided in the form of a [lookup table](/wiki/Lookup_table "Lookup table"). The S-boxes provide the core of the security of DES—without them, the cipher would be linear, and trivially breakable.
4. *Permutation*: finally, the 32 outputs from the S-boxes are rearranged according to a fixed [permutation](/wiki/Permutation "Permutation"), the *P-box*. This is designed so that, after permutation, the bits from the output of each S-box in this round are spread across four different S-boxes in the next round.

The alternation of substitution from the S-boxes, and permutation of bits from the P-box and E-expansion provides so-called "[confusion and diffusion](/wiki/Confusion_and_diffusion "Confusion and diffusion")" respectively, a concept identified by [Claude Shannon](/wiki/Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon") in the 1940s as a necessary condition for a secure yet practical cipher.

### Key schedule

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Data_Encryption_Standard&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Key schedule")]
![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/DES-key-schedule.png/250px-DES-key-schedule.png)

*[Figure 3](/wiki/File%3ADES-key-schedule.png "File:DES-key-schedule.png")*— The key-schedule of DES

Figure 3 illustrates the *key schedule* for encryption—the algorithm which generates the subkeys. Initially, 56 bits of the key are selected from the initial 64 by *Permuted Choice 1* (*PC-1*)—the remaining eight bits are either discarded or used as [parity](/wiki/Parity_bit "Parity bit") check bits. The 56 bits are then divided into two 28-bit halves; each half is thereafter treated separately. In successive rounds, both halves are rotated left by one or two bits (specified for each round), and then 48 subkey bits are selected by *Permuted Choice 2* (*PC-2*)—24 bits from the left half, and 24 from the right. The rotations (denoted by "<<<" in the diagram) mean that a different set of bits is used in each subkey; each bit is used in approximately 14 out of the 16 subkeys.

The key schedule for decryption is similar—the subkeys are in reverse order compared to encryption. Apart from that change, the process is the same as for encryption. The same 28 bits are passed to all rotation boxes.

### Pseudocode

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Data_Encryption_Standard&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Pseudocode")]

[Pseudocode](/wiki/Pseudocode "Pseudocode") for the DES algorithm follows.

```
// All variables are unsigned 64 bits

// Pre-processing: padding with the size difference in bytes
pad message to reach multiple of 64 bits in length

var key // The keys given by the user
var keys[16]
var left, right

// Generate Keys

// PC1 (64 bits to 56 bits)
key := permutation(key, PC1)
left := (key rightshift 28) and 0xFFFFFFF
right := key and 0xFFFFFFF

for i from 1 to 16 do
	right := right leftrotate KEY_shift[i]
	left := left leftrotate  KEY_shift[i]
	var concat := (left leftshift 28) or right
	// PC2 (56bits to 48bits)
	keys[i] := permutation(concat, PC2)
end for

// To decrypt a message reverse the order of the keys
if decrypt do
	reverse keys
end if

// Encrypt or Decrypt
for each 64-bit chunk of padded message do
	var tmp

	// IP
	chunk := permutation(chunk, IP)
	left := chunk rightshift 32
	right := chunk and 0xFFFFFFFF
	for i from 1 to 16 do

## Security and cryptanalysis

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Data_Encryption_Standard&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Security and cryptanalysis")]

Although more information has been published on the cryptanalysis of DES than any other block cipher, the most practical attack to date is still a brute-force approach. Various minor cryptanalytic properties are known, and three theoretical attacks are possible which, while having a theoretical complexity less than a brute-force attack, require an unrealistic number of [known](/wiki/Known_plaintext "Known plaintext") or [chosen plaintexts](/wiki/Chosen_plaintext "Chosen plaintext") to carry out, and are not a concern in practice.

### Brute-force attack

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Data_Encryption_Standard&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Brute-force attack")]

For any [cipher](/wiki/Cipher "Cipher"), the most basic method of attack is [brute force](/wiki/Brute-force_attack "Brute-force attack")—trying every possible key in turn. The [length of the key](/wiki/Key_length "Key length") determines the number of possible keys, and hence the feasibility of this approach. For DES, questions were raised about the adequacy of its key size early on, even before it was adopted as a standard, and it was the small key size, rather than theoretical cryptanalysis, which dictated a need for a replacement [algorithm](/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm"). As a result of discussions involving external consultants including the NSA, the key size was reduced from 256 bits to 56 bits to fit on a single chip.[[30]](#cite_note-stallings-2006-30)

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Board300.jpg/220px-Board300.jpg)](/wiki/File%3ABoard300.jpg)

The [EFF](/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation "Electronic Frontier Foundation")'s US$250,000 [DES cracking machine](/wiki/EFF_DES_cracker "EFF DES cracker") contained 1,856 custom chips and could brute-force a DES key in a matter of days—the photo shows a DES Cracker circuit board fitted with several Deep Crack chips.

In academia, various proposals for a DES-cracking machine were advanced. In 1977, Diffie and Hellman proposed a machine costing an estimated US$20 million which could find a DES key in a single day.[[1]](#cite_note-dh-exh-1)[[31]](#cite_note-31) By 1993, Wiener had proposed a key-search machine costing US$1 million which would find a key within 7 hours. However, none of these early proposals were ever implemented—or, at least, no implementations were publicly acknowledged. The vulnerability of DES was practically demonstrated in the late 1990s.[[32]](#cite_note-32) In 1997, [RSA Security](/wiki/RSA_Security "RSA Security") sponsored a series of contests, offering a $10,000 prize to the first team that broke a message encrypted with DES for the contest. That contest was won by the [DESCHALL Project](/wiki/DESCHALL_Project "DESCHALL Project"), led by Rocke Verser, [Matt Curtin](/wiki/Matt_Curtin "Matt Curtin"), and Justin Dolske, using idle cycles of thousands of computers across the Internet. The feasibility of cracking DES quickly was demonstrated in 1998 when a custom DES-cracker was built by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation "Electronic Frontier Foundation") (EFF), a cyberspace civil rights group, at the cost of approximately US$250,000 (see [EFF DES cracker](/wiki/EFF_DES_cracker "EFF DES cracker")). Their motivation was to show that DES was breakable in practice as well as in theory: "*There are many people who will not believe a truth until they can see it with their own eyes. Showing them a physical machine that can crack DES in a few days is the only way to convince some people that they really cannot trust their security to DES.*" The machine brute-forced a key in a little more than 2 days' worth of searching.

The next confirmed DES cracker was the COPACOBANA machine built in 2006 by teams of the [Universities of Bochum](/wiki/Ruhr_University "Ruhr University") and [Kiel](/wiki/University_of_Kiel "University of Kiel"), both in [Germany](/wiki/Germany "Germany"). Unlike the EFF machine, COPACOBANA consists of commercially available, reconfigurable integrated circuits. 120 of these [field-programmable gate arrays](/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array "Field-programmable gate array") (FPGAs) of type XILINX Spartan-3 1000 run in parallel. They are grouped in 20 DIMM modules, each containing 6 FPGAs. The use of reconfigurable hardware makes the machine applicable to other code breaking tasks as well.[[33]](#cite_note-33) One of the more interesting aspects of COPACOBANA is its cost factor. One machine can be built for approximately $10,000.[[34]](#cite_note-34) The cost decrease by roughly a factor of 25 over the EFF machine is an example of the continuous improvement of [digital hardware](/wiki/Digital_hardware "Digital hardware")—see [Moore's law](/wiki/Moore%27s_law "Moore's law"). Adjusting for inflation over 8 years yields an even higher improvement of about 30x. Since 2007, [SciEngines GmbH](/wiki/SciEngines_GmbH "SciEngines GmbH"), a spin-off company of the two project partners of COPACOBANA has enhanced and developed successors of COPACOBANA. In 2008 their COPACOBANA RIVYERA reduced the time to break DES to less than one day, using 128 Spartan-3 5000's. SciEngines RIVYERA held the record in brute-force breaking DES, having utilized 128 Spartan-3 5000 FPGAs.[[35]](#cite_note-35) Their 256 Spartan-6 LX150 model has further lowered this time.

In 2012, David Hulton and [Moxie Marlinspike](/wiki/Moxie_Marlinspike "Moxie Marlinspike") announced a system with 48 Xilinx Virtex-6 LX240T FPGAs, each FPGA containing 40 fully pipelined DES cores running at 400 MHz, for a total capacity of 768 gigakeys/sec. The system can exhaustively search the entire 56-bit DES key space in about 26 hours and this service is offered for a fee online.[[36]](#cite_note-36)[[37]](#cite_note-37)

### Attacks faster than brute force

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Data_Encryption_Standard&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Attacks faster than brute force")]

There are three attacks known that can break the full 16 rounds of DES with less complexity than a brute-force search: [differential cryptanalysis](/wiki/Differential_cryptanalysis "Differential cryptanalysis") (DC),[[38]](#cite_note-:0-38) [linear cryptanalysis](/wiki/Linear_cryptanalysis "Linear cryptanalysis") (LC),[[39]](#cite_note-:1-39) and [Davies' attack](/wiki/Davies%27_attack "Davies' attack").[[40]](#cite_note-:2-40) However, the attacks are theoretical and are generally considered infeasible to mount in practice;[[41]](#cite_note-41) these types of attack are sometimes termed certificational weaknesses.

* [Differential cryptanalysis](/wiki/Differential_cryptanalysis "Differential cryptanalysis") was rediscovered in the late 1980s by [Eli Biham](/wiki/Eli_Biham "Eli Biham") and [Adi Shamir](/wiki/Adi_Shamir "Adi Shamir"); it was known earlier to both IBM and the NSA and kept secret. To break the full 16 rounds, differential cryptanalysis requires 247 [chosen plaintexts](/wiki/Chosen_plaintext "Chosen plaintext").[[38]](#cite_note-:0-38) DES was designed to be resistant to DC.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia%3ACitation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]
* [Linear cryptanalysis](/wiki/Linear_cryptanalysis "Linear cryptanalysis") was discovered by [Mitsuru Matsui](/wiki/Mitsuru_Matsui "Mitsuru Matsui"), and needs 243 [known plaintexts](/wiki/Known_plaintext "Known plaintext") (Matsui, 1993);[[39]](#cite_note-:1-39) the method was implemented (Matsui, 1994), and was the first experimental cryptanalysis of DES to be reported. There is no evidence that DES was tailored to be resistant to this type of attack. A generalization of LC—*multiple linear cryptanalysis*—was suggested in 1994 (Kaliski and Robshaw), and was further refined by Biryukov and others. (2004); their analysis suggests that multiple linear approximations could be used to reduce the data requirements of the attack by at least a factor of 4 (that is, 241 instead of 243).[[42]](#cite_note-42) A similar reduction in data complexity can be obtained in a chosen-plaintext variant of linear cryptanalysis (Knudsen and Mathiassen, 2000).[[43]](#cite_note-43) Junod (2001) performed several experiments to determine the actual time complexity of linear cryptanalysis, and reported that it was somewhat faster than predicted, requiring time equivalent to 239–241 DES evaluations.[[44]](#cite_note-44)
* *Improved Davies' attack*: while linear and differential cryptanalysis are general techniques and can be applied to a number of schemes, Davies' attack is a specialized technique for DES, first suggested by [Donald Davies](/wiki/Donald_Davies "Donald Davies") in the eighties,[[40]](#cite_note-:2-40) and improved by Biham and [Biryukov](/wiki/Alex_Biryukov "Alex Biryukov") (1997).[[45]](#cite_note-45) The most powerful form of the attack requires 250 [known plaintexts](/wiki/Known_plaintext "Known plaintext"), has a computational complexity of 250, and has a 51% success rate.

There have also been attacks proposed against reduced-round versions of the cipher, that is, versions of DES with fewer than 16 rounds. Such analysis gives an insight into how many rounds are needed for safety, and how much of a "security margin" the full version retains.

[Differential-linear cryptanalysis](/wiki/Differential-linear_cryptanalysis "Differential-linear cryptanalysis") was proposed by Langford and Hellman in 1994, and combines differential and linear cryptanalysis into a single attack.[[46]](#cite_note-46) An enhanced version of the attack can break 9-round DES with 215.8 chosen plaintexts and has a 229.2 time complexity (Biham and others, 2002).[[47]](#cite_note-47)

### Minor cryptanalytic properties

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Data_Encryption_Standard&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Minor cryptanalytic properties")]

The complementation property means that the work for a [brute-force attack](/wiki/Brute-force_attack "Brute-force attack") could be reduced by a factor of 2 (or a single bit) under a [chosen-plaintext](/wiki/Chosen-plaintext_attack "Chosen-plaintext attack") assumption. By definition, this property also applies to TDES cipher.[[48]](#cite_note-48)

DES also has four so-called *[weak keys](/wiki/Weak_key#Weak_keys_in_DES "Weak key")*. Encryption (*E*) and decryption (*D*) under a weak key have the same effect (see [involution](/wiki/Involution_%28mathematics%29 "Involution (mathematics)")):

It is easy enough to avoid the weak and semiweak keys in an implementation, either by testing for them explicitly, or simply by choosing keys randomly; the odds of picking a weak or semiweak key by chance are negligible. The keys are not really any weaker than any other keys anyway, as they do not give an attack any advantage.

DES has also been proved not to be a [group](/wiki/Group_%28mathematics%29 "Group (mathematics)"), or more precisely, the set
{
E
K

}

{\displaystyle \{E\_{K}\}}

![{\displaystyle \{E_{K}\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/524ffda798d75ef8f26878e357652aa39e96e236) (for all possible keys

## Simplified DES

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Data_Encryption_Standard&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Simplified DES")]

Simplified DES (SDES) was designed for educational purposes only, to help students learn about modern cryptanalytic techniques.
SDES has similar structure and properties to DES, but has been simplified to make it much easier to perform encryption and decryption by hand with pencil and paper.
Some people feel that learning SDES gives insight into DES and other block ciphers, and insight into various cryptanalytic attacks against them.[[51]](#cite_note-51)[[52]](#cite_note-52)[[53]](#cite_note-53)[[54]](#cite_note-54)[[55]](#cite_note-55)[[56]](#cite_note-56)[[57]](#cite_note-57)[[58]](#cite_note-58)[[59]](#cite_note-59)

Concerns about security and the relatively slow operation of DES in [software](/wiki/Software "Software") motivated researchers to propose a variety of alternative [block cipher](/wiki/Block_cipher "Block cipher") designs, which started to appear in the late 1980s and early 1990s: examples include [RC5](/wiki/RC5 "RC5"), [Blowfish](/wiki/Blowfish_%28cipher%29 "Blowfish (cipher)"), [IDEA](/wiki/International_Data_Encryption_Algorithm "International Data Encryption Algorithm"), [NewDES](/wiki/NewDES "NewDES"), [SAFER](/wiki/Secure_and_Fast_Encryption_Routine "Secure and Fast Encryption Routine"), [CAST5](/wiki/CAST5 "CAST5") and [FEAL](/wiki/FEAL "FEAL"). Most of these designs kept the 64-bit [block size](/wiki/Block_size_%28cryptography%29 "Block size (cryptography)") of DES, and could act as a "drop-in" replacement, although they typically used a 64-bit or 128-bit key. In the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") the [GOST 28147-89](/wiki/GOST_28147-89 "GOST 28147-89") algorithm was introduced, with a 64-bit block size and a 256-bit key, which was also used in [Russia](/wiki/Russia "Russia") later.

DES itself can be adapted and reused in a more secure scheme. Many former DES users now use [Triple DES](/wiki/Triple_DES "Triple DES") (TDES) which was described and analysed by one of DES's patentees (see [FIPS](/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard "Federal Information Processing Standard") Pub 46–3); it involves applying DES three times with two (2TDES) or three (3TDES) different keys. TDES is regarded as adequately secure, although it is quite slow. A less computationally expensive alternative is [DES-X](/wiki/DES-X "DES-X"), which increases the key size by XORing extra key material before and after DES. [GDES](/wiki/GDES "GDES") was a DES variant proposed as a way to speed up encryption, but it was shown to be susceptible to differential cryptanalysis.

On January 2, 1997, NIST announced that they wished to choose a successor to DES.[[60]](#cite_note-60) In 2001, after an international competition, NIST selected a new cipher, the [Advanced Encryption Standard](/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard "Advanced Encryption Standard") (AES), as a replacement.[[61]](#cite_note-61) The algorithm which was selected as the AES was submitted by its designers under the name [Rijndael](/wiki/Rijndael "Rijndael"). Other finalists in the NIST [AES competition](/wiki/AES_competition "AES competition") included [RC6](/wiki/RC6 "RC6"), [Serpent](/wiki/Serpent_%28cipher%29 "Serpent (cipher)"), [MARS](/wiki/MARS_%28cryptography%29 "MARS (cryptography)"), and [Twofish](/wiki/Twofish "Twofish").

High quality counterfeit American dollar bills

A counterfeit Series 1974 [one-hundred-dollar bill](/wiki/United_States_one-hundred-dollar_bill "United States one-hundred-dollar bill") on display at the [British Museum](/wiki/British_Museum "British Museum"). After being detected, the bill was [overprinted](/wiki/Overprint "Overprint") with a [rubber stamp](/wiki/Rubber_stamp "Rubber stamp") to indicate that it is a fake.

A **superdollar** (also known as a **superbill** or **supernote**) is a very high quality [counterfeit](/wiki/Counterfeit "Counterfeit") [United States one hundred-dollar bill](/wiki/United_States_one_hundred-dollar_bill "United States one hundred-dollar bill"),[[1]](#cite_note-1) alleged by the [U.S. government](/wiki/United_States_Government "United States Government") to have been made by unknown organizations or governments.[[2]](#cite_note-Weinberg2008-2)[[3]](#cite_note-3) In 2011, government sources stated that these counterfeit bills were in "worldwide circulation" from the late 1980s until at least July 2000 in an extradition court case.[[4]](#cite_note-rte-20110718-4)

While there are many features on supernotes that can be detected with conventional methods, new, more sophisticated supernotes could be produced to circumvent some conventional detection methods. Thus it may be possible to see some supernotes in circulation until they are detected.

Various groups have been suspected of creating such notes, and international opinion on the origin of the notes varies. The U.S. government believes that North Korean officials have passed off supernotes in various countries and accuses [North Korea](/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea") of producing them.[[5]](#cite_note-CRS-5) Over $35 million worth of counterfeit $100 bills were produced by British criminals, who were arrested in 2002.

A new $100 bill design intended to thwart counterfeiting, incorporating a "3D security ribbon", color-shifting numerals and drawings, and microprinting, entered circulation in 2013.[[6]](#cite_note-cep2013-6)

## Production

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Superdollar&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Production")]

Supernotes are said to be made with the highest quality of ink printed on a cotton/linen blend, and are designed to recreate the various security features of United States currency, such as the red and blue security fibers, the [security thread](/wiki/Security_thread "Security thread"), and the [watermark](/wiki/Watermark "Watermark"). Moreover, they are printed using an [intaglio printing process](/wiki/Intaglio_%28printmaking%29 "Intaglio (printmaking)") or with engraved plates, the same process used by the [Bureau of Engraving and Printing](/wiki/Bureau_of_Engraving_and_Printing "Bureau of Engraving and Printing") (BEP) of the U.S. government for legitimate notes. In most counterfeiting, [offset printing](/wiki/Offset_printing "Offset printing") or color [inkjet](/wiki/Inkjet_printing "Inkjet printing") and [laser printing](/wiki/Laser_printing "Laser printing") are most common means of making counterfeit money.[[7]](#cite_note-bl-20140507-7)

Experts who have studied supernotes extensively and examined them alongside genuine bills point out that there are many different varieties of supernotes. In 2006 the "family" of fraudulent bills was thought to have 19 members.[[8]](#cite_note-mihm-8) However, producers of the supernotes have improved the product since 2006, and more varieties exist. Early versions of the fake notes, for example, lacked the bands of [magnetic ink](/wiki/Magnetic_ink "Magnetic ink") printed in distinctive patterns on different denominations of U.S. money; later counterfeits rectified this error. Several of the inconspicuous "mistakes" on the first supernotes were corrected, some several times.

On the genuine $100 bill, for example, the left base vertical line of the lamp post near the figure on the reverse of the $100 note is weak. The first supernotes printed this line too distinctly, rendering the counterfeit more authoritatively printed than the original. Later supernotes over-corrected this strong line by removing it altogether. Similarly, the hands of the clock on [Independence Hall](/wiki/Independence_Hall "Independence Hall") on the genuine bill extend slightly beyond the inner circle; on the supernotes they stop short of it.[[9]](#cite_note-9)

On the front of the supernote, in the "N" in "UNITED STATES", a slash can be seen to the right of the diagonal and the right ascender of the letter; there is none on the genuine note. Other differences in vignetting and in the defining lines of the top ornament in Independence Hall have been observed.[[10]](#cite_note-10) Journalist [Klaus Bender](/wiki/Klaus_Bender "Klaus Bender") and others have speculated that the counterfeiters introduced these differences to be able to distinguish their product from the original, but there is no obvious way to confirm this.

## Arrests of United States distributors

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Superdollar&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Arrests of United States distributors")]

In two sting operations running from 2002 to 2005, dubbed "Operation Smoking Dragon" and "Operation Royal Charm", United States agents arrested at least 87 people on charges that included smuggling superdollars. About $4.5 million in counterfeit currency was seized, much in $100 bills. No definitive origin for the counterfeit $100 bills was determined.[[11]](#cite_note-11)[[12]](#cite_note-12)

## Confirmed sources

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Superdollar&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Confirmed sources")]
### British criminals

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Superdollar&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: British criminals")]

In 2005, British criminals, [Anatasios Arnaouti](/wiki/Anatasios_Arnaouti "Anatasios Arnaouti") and four others, were convicted of conspiracy to make counterfeit currency in [Manchester](/wiki/Manchester "Manchester"), [England](/wiki/England "England"). They were arrested in 2002 after an operation that involved the [U.S. Secret Service](/wiki/U.S._Secret_Service "U.S. Secret Service"). The counterfeit currency recovered included $3.5 million worth of $100 bills and £2.5 million of £10 notes, which [Bank of England](/wiki/Bank_of_England "Bank of England") experts said were of excellent quality. The police stated that "The potential to undermine the economy of the UK and US was very significant."[[13]](#cite_note-13)[[14]](#cite_note-14)

The printer admitted to making 350,000 $100 bills, $35 million, over 18 months.[[15]](#cite_note-15) The gang was using equipment capable of printing £1 million per day, and claimed to produce $500,000 in fake dollars a day.[[16]](#cite_note-16)[[17]](#cite_note-17) The counterfeiting operation was running for over two years.[[18]](#cite_note-guardian-20050614-18)

## Possible sources

### North Korea

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Superdollar&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: North Korea")]
See also: [Illicit activities of North Korea](/wiki/Illicit_activities_of_North_Korea "Illicit activities of North Korea")

It has been said that [North Korea](/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea") has passed off superdollars ([Korean](/wiki/Korean_language "Korean language"): 카탈리오 [kʰa.tʰa.ɾi.o])[[19]](#cite_note-Cha2012-19) in various countries. The counterfeit bills also circulate both within North Korea and around [its border with China](/wiki/China%E2%80%93North_Korea_border "China–North Korea border"). There is, however, some doubt about the reliability of [North Korean defectors](/wiki/North_Korean_defectors "North Korean defectors")' claims,[[5]](#cite_note-CRS-5) on which the United States partially bases its accusations, along with [South Korean](/wiki/South_Korea "South Korea") intelligence sources.[[5]](#cite_note-CRS-5)

The testimony of the North Korean defectors is considered by some to be suspect, and one witness has since gone into hiding after charges were filed accusing them of fabricating the story for money.[[20]](#cite_note-mcclatchy-20)[[21]](#cite_note-mcclatchy2-21) These witnesses claimed that the factory where the notes are printed is located in the city of [Pyongsong](/wiki/Pyongsong "Pyongsong") and is part of [Room 39](/wiki/Room_39 "Room 39").[[8]](#cite_note-mihm-8)

One defector had taken the notes to experts in the South Korean intelligence agency,[*[which?](/wiki/Wikipedia%3AAvoid_weasel_words "Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words")*] who did not believe that they were fakes.[[22]](#cite_note-22) The *[San Francisco Chronicle](/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle "San Francisco Chronicle")* interviewed a North Korean chemist who described the operation; insisting on anonymity, he spoke about the technical details of the process as well as the distribution method, which he said was through North Korean [diplomats](/wiki/Diplomats "Diplomats") and international crime syndicates.[[23]](#cite_note-23)

The U.S. government has theorized that the bills were spread in two ways:

* North Korean diplomats almost always travel through [Moscow](/wiki/Moscow "Moscow") on their way to other destinations. At the [Embassy of North Korea in Moscow](/wiki/Embassy_of_North_Korea_in_Moscow "Embassy of North Korea in Moscow"), they receive dollars for their expenses. According to the claims of one defector, forgeries are intermingled with real dollars in about a 1 to 1 ratio. He said that most of the diplomats themselves do not know that they are being given counterfeits, and claimed that it is possible to purchase a $100 bill for US$50–70 directly from North Korean agents, and sometimes as low as $10–20 in bulk purchases.[[24]](#cite_note-24)
* The alleged [chief of staff](/wiki/Chief_of_Staff_of_the_Irish_Republican_Army "Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army") of the [Official Irish Republican Army](/wiki/Official_Irish_Republican_Army "Official Irish Republican Army"), [Seán Garland](/wiki/Se%C3%A1n_Garland "Seán Garland"), was followed and seen traveling to Moscow and visiting the North Korean embassy along with some ex-[KGB](/wiki/KGB "KGB") officers. Allegedly, Garland would then, with the help of some associate couriers, move this money to the Irish capital of [Dublin](/wiki/Dublin "Dublin") and to [Birmingham](/wiki/Birmingham "Birmingham"), England, where the notes would be exchanged for [pounds](/wiki/Pound_sterling "Pound sterling") or authentic dollars.[[25]](#cite_note-25)[[26]](#cite_note-doj-20051008-26) His alleged scheme, involving several international crime syndicates and transactions worth millions of dollars, was uncovered after a tip-off.[[27]](#cite_note-27) Garland was arrested in [Belfast](/wiki/Belfast "Belfast"), [Northern Ireland](/wiki/Northern_Ireland "Northern Ireland"), but fled south to the [Republic of Ireland](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland "Republic of Ireland") after being released for medical leave. On 21 December 2011, the Irish [High Court](/wiki/High_Court_%28Ireland%29 "High Court (Ireland)") dismissed the US application for Garland's extradition,[[4]](#cite_note-rte-20110718-4)[[28]](#cite_note-28) as the alleged offence took place in Ireland and was therefore not subject to extradition. The case was referred to the [Director of Public Prosecutions](/wiki/Director_of_Public_Prosecutions "Director of Public Prosecutions") to consider prosecution in Ireland.[[29]](#cite_note-29)

Since 2004, the United States has frequently called for pressure against North Korea in an attempt to end the alleged distribution of supernotes. It has investigated the [Bank of China](/wiki/Bank_of_China "Bank of China"), [Banco Delta Asia](/wiki/Banco_Delta_Asia "Banco Delta Asia"), and [Seng Heng Bank](/wiki/Seng_Heng_Bank "Seng Heng Bank").[[30]](#cite_note-Chosunilbo-30)[[31]](#cite_note-31) The U.S. eventually prohibited Americans from banking with Banco Delta Asia.[[32]](#cite_note-32)[[33]](#cite_note-33) However, an audit of the bank disputed U.S. allegations and indicated that the only time Banco Delta Asia had knowingly handled counterfeit money was in 1994 when it discovered and turned over $10,000 in counterfeit $100 bills to local authorities.[[34]](#cite_note-34) The United States has threatened North Korea with sanctions over its alleged involvement with the supernotes, though it said those sanctions would be a separate issue from the [nuclear sanctions](/wiki/Sanctions_against_North_Korea "Sanctions against North Korea").

South Korea has attempted to play a middle role, encouraging all parties to reach an acceptable conclusion without animosity.[[30]](#cite_note-Chosunilbo-30) In a meeting on January 22, 2006, the U.S. laid out its evidence and tried to persuade the Seoul government to take a harder line on the issue and impose similar financial sanctions, but was rebuffed.[[30]](#cite_note-Chosunilbo-30)[[35]](#cite_note-35) South Korea prefers to place blame on North Korean organizations rather than the government, believing that this change in rhetoric can mollify North Korea and be conducive to a resumption of the [six-party talks](/wiki/Six-party_talks "Six-party talks").[[30]](#cite_note-Chosunilbo-30)

Several North Korean diplomats have been arrested on suspicion of passing the counterfeit bills, but have used [diplomatic immunity](/wiki/Diplomatic_immunity "Diplomatic immunity") to evade charges.[[36]](#cite_note-36)

On February 2, 2006, banks in [Japan](/wiki/Japan "Japan") voluntarily enforced sanctions on Banco Delta Asia identical to those imposed by the United States.[[30]](#cite_note-Chosunilbo-30) Later in August 2006, the *[Sankei Shimbun](/wiki/Sankei_Shimbun "Sankei Shimbun")* reported that North Korea had opened 23 bank accounts in 10 countries, with the likely intent of laundering more superbills.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia%3ACitation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]

The U.S. Secret Service estimates that North Korea has produced $45 million in superdollars since 1989. They allege that the bills are produced at the Pyongsong Trademark Printing Factory, which is under the supervision of General [O Kuk-ryol](/wiki/O_Kuk-ryol "O Kuk-ryol").[[37]](#cite_note-WashTimes-37)

In 2008, a [McClatchy Newspapers](/wiki/McClatchy_Newspapers "McClatchy Newspapers") article reported that the United States no longer explicitly accused the North Korean government of producing supernotes, and that the [Swiss Bundeskriminalpolizei](/wiki/Federal_Office_of_Police "Federal Office of Police"), which regularly searches for counterfeit currency, doubted that North Korea produced supernotes.[[20]](#cite_note-mcclatchy-20) However, in 2009, a report by the [Congressional Research Service](/wiki/Congressional_Research_Service "Congressional Research Service") renewed the accusation.[[5]](#cite_note-CRS-5)

### Iran

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Superdollar&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Iran")]

Before the [1979 Iranian Revolution](/wiki/1979_Iranian_Revolution "1979 Iranian Revolution"), Iran used [intaglio](/wiki/Intaglio_%28printmaking%29 "Intaglio (printmaking)") machines to print its currency, as did the United States and other governments. There has been some speculation that Iran has used these to print superdollars.[[20]](#cite_note-mcclatchy-20)[[38]](#cite_note-nyt-19960227-38)

### CIA

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Superdollar&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: CIA")]

The [CIA](/wiki/CIA "CIA") has been accused of printing and using counterfeit notes to fund off-the-books foreign operations.[[39]](#cite_note-39) Klaus Bender, an author of works on counterfeiting, states that the notes are of such high quality that they could only be produced by a government agency such as the CIA.[[20]](#cite_note-mcclatchy-20)

### Other

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Superdollar&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Other")]

Other theories of the bills' origin have become increasingly popular; Iran remains a suspect to many, while others blame independent criminal gangs operating out of Russia or China.[[20]](#cite_note-mcclatchy-20) In 2000, the [Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies](/wiki/Institute_for_Advanced_Strategic_and_Political_Studies "Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies"), an Israel-based think tank, laid the blame on [Syria](/wiki/Syria "Syria"): "The [Bekaa Valley](/wiki/Bekaa_Valley "Bekaa Valley") has become one of the main distribution sources, if not production points, of the 'supernote' – counterfeit U.S. currency so well done that it is impossible to detect."[[40]](#cite_note-40)

## Abstract of RFC 3704

BCP 38, RFC 2827, is designed to limit the impact of distributed denial of service attacks, by denying traffic with spoofed addresses access to the network, and to help ensure that traffic is traceable to its correct source network. As a side effect of protecting the Internet against such attacks, the network implementing the solution also protects itself from this and other attacks, such as spoofed management access to networking equipment. There are cases when this may create problems, e.g., with multihoming. This document describes the current ingress filtering operational mechanisms, examines generic issues related to ingress filtering, and delves into the effects on multihoming in particular. This memo updates RFC 2827. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.

## Abstract of RFC 8704

This document identifies a need for and proposes improvement of the
unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) techniques (see RFC 3704) for
detection and mitigation of source address spoofing (see BCP 38).
Strict uRPF is inflexible about directionality, the loose uRPF is
oblivious to directionality, and the current feasible-path uRPF
attempts to strike a balance between the two (see RFC 3704). However,
as shown in this document, the existing feasible-path uRPF still has
shortcomings. This document describes enhanced feasible-path uRPF
(EFP-uRPF) techniques that are more flexible (in a meaningful way)
about directionality than the feasible-path uRPF (RFC 3704). The
proposed EFP-uRPF methods aim to significantly reduce false positives
regarding invalid detection in source address validation (SAV).
Hence, they can potentially alleviate ISPs' concerns about the
possibility of disrupting service for their customers and encourage
greater deployment of uRPF techniques. This document updates RFC
3704.

General form of cryptanalysis applicable primarily to block ciphers

**[Differential](/wiki/Differential "Differential") cryptanalysis** is a general form of [cryptanalysis](/wiki/Cryptanalysis "Cryptanalysis") applicable primarily to block ciphers, but also to stream ciphers and cryptographic hash functions. In the broadest sense, it is the study of how differences in information input can affect the resultant difference at the output. In the case of a [block cipher](/wiki/Block_cipher "Block cipher"), it refers to a set of techniques for tracing differences through the network of transformation, discovering where the cipher exhibits [non-random behavior](/wiki/Non-randomness "Non-randomness"), and exploiting such properties to recover the secret key (cryptography key).

## History

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Differential_cryptanalysis&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

The discovery of differential cryptanalysis is generally attributed to [Eli Biham](/wiki/Eli_Biham "Eli Biham") and [Adi Shamir](/wiki/Adi_Shamir "Adi Shamir") in the late 1980s, who published a number of attacks against various block ciphers and hash functions, including a theoretical weakness in the [Data Encryption Standard](/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard "Data Encryption Standard") (DES). It was noted by Biham and Shamir that DES was surprisingly resistant to differential cryptanalysis, but small modifications to the algorithm would make it much more susceptible.[[1]](#cite_note-Biham_1993-1): 8–9

In 1994, a member of the original IBM DES team, [Don Coppersmith](/wiki/Don_Coppersmith "Don Coppersmith"), published a paper stating that differential cryptanalysis was known to IBM as early as 1974, and that defending against differential cryptanalysis had been a design goal.[[2]](#cite_note-coppersmith-2) According to author [Steven Levy](/wiki/Steven_Levy "Steven Levy"), IBM had discovered differential cryptanalysis on its own, and the [NSA](/wiki/NSA "NSA") was apparently well aware of the technique.[[3]](#cite_note-3) IBM kept some secrets, as Coppersmith explains: "After discussions with NSA, it was decided that disclosure of the design considerations would reveal the technique of differential cryptanalysis, a powerful technique that could be used against many ciphers. This in turn would weaken the competitive advantage the United States enjoyed over other countries in the field of cryptography."[[2]](#cite_note-coppersmith-2) Within IBM, differential cryptanalysis was known as the "T-attack"[[2]](#cite_note-coppersmith-2) or "Tickle attack".[[4]](#cite_note-4)

While DES was designed with resistance to differential cryptanalysis in mind, other contemporary ciphers proved to be vulnerable. An early target for the attack was the [FEAL](/wiki/FEAL "FEAL") block cipher. The original proposed version with four rounds (FEAL-4) can be broken using only eight [chosen plaintexts](/wiki/Chosen-plaintext_attack "Chosen-plaintext attack"), and even a 31-round version of FEAL is susceptible to the attack. In contrast, the scheme can successfully cryptanalyze DES with an effort on the order of 247 chosen plaintexts.

Differential cryptanalysis is usually a [chosen plaintext attack](/wiki/Chosen_plaintext_attack "Chosen plaintext attack"), meaning that the attacker must be able to obtain [ciphertexts](/wiki/Encryption "Encryption") for some set of [plaintexts](/wiki/Plaintext "Plaintext") of their choosing. There are, however, extensions that would allow a [known plaintext](/wiki/Known_plaintext_attack "Known plaintext attack") or even a [ciphertext-only attack](/wiki/Ciphertext-only_attack "Ciphertext-only attack"). The basic method uses pairs of plaintexts related by a constant *difference*. [Difference](/wiki/Subtraction "Subtraction") can be defined in several ways, but the [eXclusive OR (XOR)](/wiki/Exclusive_or "Exclusive or") operation is usual. The attacker then computes the differences of the corresponding ciphertexts, hoping to detect statistical patterns in their distribution. The resulting pair of differences is called a **differential**. Their statistical properties depend upon the nature of the [S-boxes](/wiki/S-box "S-box") used for encryption, so the attacker analyses differentials

(and ⊕ denotes exclusive or) for each such S-box *S*. In the basic attack, one particular ciphertext difference is expected to be especially frequent. In this way, the [cipher](/wiki/Cipher "Cipher") can be distinguished from [random](/wiki/Randomness "Randomness"). More sophisticated variations allow the key to be recovered faster than [an exhaustive search](/wiki/Brute_force_attack "Brute force attack").

In the most basic form of key recovery through differential cryptanalysis, an attacker requests the ciphertexts for a large number of plaintext pairs, then assumes that the differential holds for at least *r* − 1 rounds, where *r* is the total number of rounds.[[5]](#cite_note-5) The attacker then deduces which round keys (for the final round) are possible, assuming the difference between the blocks before the final round is fixed. When round keys are short, this can be achieved by simply exhaustively decrypting the ciphertext pairs one round with each possible round key. When one round key has been deemed a potential round key considerably more often than any other key, it is assumed to be the correct round key.

For any particular cipher, the input difference must be carefully selected for the attack to be successful. An analysis of the algorithm's internals is undertaken; the standard method is to trace a path of highly probable differences through the various stages of encryption, termed a *differential characteristic*.

Since differential cryptanalysis became public knowledge, it has become a basic concern of cipher designers. New designs are expected to be accompanied by evidence that the algorithm is resistant to this attack and many including the [Advanced Encryption Standard](/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard "Advanced Encryption Standard"), have been [proven](/wiki/Mathematical_proof "Mathematical proof") secure against the attack.[[6]](#cite_note-6)

## Attack in detail

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Differential_cryptanalysis&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Attack in detail")]

Please help [improve this section](/wiki/Special%3AEditPage/Differential_cryptanalysis "Special:EditPage/Differential cryptanalysis") by [adding citations to reliable sources](/wiki/Help%3AReferencing_for_beginners "Help:Referencing for beginners").

The attack relies primarily on the fact that a given input/output difference pattern only occurs for certain values of inputs. Usually the attack is applied in essence to the non-linear components as if they were a solid component (usually they are in fact look-up tables or *S-boxes*). Observing the desired output difference (between two chosen or known plaintext inputs) *suggests* possible key values.

For example, if a differential of 1 => 1 (implying a difference in the [least significant bit](/wiki/Least_significant_bit "Least significant bit") (LSB) of the input leads to an output difference in the LSB) occurs with probability of 4/256 (possible with the non-linear function in the [AES cipher](/wiki/AES_cipher "AES cipher") for instance) then for only 4 values (or 2 pairs) of inputs is that differential possible. Suppose we have a non-linear function where the key is XOR'ed before evaluation and the values that allow the differential are {2,3} and {4,5}. If the attacker sends in the values of {6, 7} and observes the correct output difference it means the key is either 6 ⊕ K = 2, or 6 ⊕ K = 4, meaning the key K is either 2 or 4.

In essence, to protect a cipher from the attack, for an n-bit non-linear function one would ideally seek as close to 2−(*n* − 1) as possible to achieve *differential uniformity*. When this happens, the differential attack requires as much work to determine the key as simply brute forcing the key.[[7]](#cite_note-7)

The AES non-linear function has a maximum differential probability of 4/256 (most entries however are either 0 or 2). Meaning that in theory one could determine the key with half as much work as brute force, however, the high branch of AES prevents any high probability trails from existing over multiple rounds. In fact, the AES cipher would be just as immune to differential and linear attacks with a much *weaker* non-linear function. The incredibly high branch (active S-box count) of 25 over 4R means that over 8 rounds, no attack involves fewer than 50 non-linear transforms, meaning that the probability of success does not exceed Pr[attack] ≤ Pr[best attack on S-box]50. For example, with the current S-box AES emits no fixed differential with a probability higher than (4/256)50 or 2−300 which is far lower than the required threshold of 2−128 for a 128-bit block cipher. This would have allowed room for a more efficient S-box, even if it is 16-uniform the probability of attack would have still been 2−200.

There exist no bijections for even sized inputs/outputs with 2-uniformity. They exist in odd fields (such as GF(27)) using either cubing or inversion (there are other exponents that can be used as well). For instance, S(x) = x3 in any odd binary field is immune to differential and linear cryptanalysis. This is in part why the [MISTY](/wiki/MISTY "MISTY") designs use 7- and 9-bit functions in the 16-bit non-linear function. What these functions gain in immunity to differential and linear attacks, they lose to algebraic attacks.[*[why?](/wiki/Wikipedia%3APlease_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")*] That is, they are possible to describe and solve via a [SAT solver](/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem "Boolean satisfiability problem"). This is in part why AES (for instance) has an [affine mapping](/wiki/Affine_mapping "Affine mapping") after the inversion.

# #StopRansomware Guide

Ransomware is a form of malware designed to encrypt files on a device, rendering them and the systems that rely on them unusable. Malicious actors then demand ransom in exchange for decryption. Over time, malicious actors have adjusted their ransomware tactics to be more destructive and impactful and have also exfiltrated victim data and pressured victims to pay by threatening to release the stolen data. The application of both tactics is known as “double extortion.” In some cases, malicious actors may exfiltrate data and threaten to release it as their sole form of extortion without employing ransomware.

These ransomware and associated data breach incidents can severely impact business processes by leaving organizations unable to access necessary data to operate and deliver mission-critical services. The economic and reputational impacts of ransomware and data extortion have proven challenging and costly for organizations of all sizes throughout the initial disruption and, at times, extended recovery.

This guide is an update to the Joint Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Ransomware Guide released in September 2020 (see "What’s New") and was developed through the [Joint Ransomware Task Force](/joint-ransomware-task-force "Joint Ransomware Task Force"). This guide includes two primary resources:

* **Part 1: Ransomware and Data Extortion Prevention Best Practices**
* **Part 2: Ransomware and Data Extortion Response Checklist**

Part 1 provides guidance for all organizations to reduce the impact and likelihood of ransomware incidents and data extortion, including best practices to prepare for, prevent, and mitigate these incidents. Prevention best practices are grouped by common initial access vectors. Part 2 includes a checklist of best practices for responding to these incidents.

These ransomware and data extortion prevention and response best practices and recommendations are based on operational insight from CISA, MS-ISAC, the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), hereafter referred to as the authoring organizations. The audience for this guide includes information technology (IT) professionals as well as others within an organization involved in developing cyber incident response policies and procedures or coordinating cyber incident response.

The authoring organizations recommend that organizations take the following initial steps to prepare and protect their facilities, personnel, and customers from cyber and physical security threats and other hazards:

* Join a sector-based information sharing and analysis center (ISAC), where eligible, such as:
  + MS-ISAC for U.S. State, Local, Tribal, & Territorial (SLTT) Government Entities - [learn.cisecurity.org/ms-isac-registration](https://learn.cisecurity.org/ms-isac-registration "Join MS-ISAC – Free for U.S. State, Local, Tribal & Territorial Government Entities"). MS-ISAC membership is open to representatives from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. Territories, local and tribal governments, public K-12 education entities, public institutions of higher education, authorities, and any other non-federal public entity in the United States.
  + Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing & Analysis Center (EI-ISAC) for U.S. Elections Organizations - [learn.cisecurity.org/ei-isac-registration](https://learn.cisecurity.org/ei-isac-registration "Join MS-ISAC – Free for U.S. State, Local, Tribal & Territorial Government Entities").
  + See the [National Council of ISACs](https://www.nationalisacs.org/member-isacs-3 "National Council of ISACs") for more information.
* Contact CISA at CISA.JCDC@cisa.dhs.gov to collaborate on information sharing, best practices, assessments, exercises, and more.
* Contact your local [FBI field office](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices "Contact your FBI field office") for a list of points of contact (POCs) in the event of a cyber incident.

Engaging with peer organizations and CISA enables your organization to receive critical and timely information and access to services for managing ransomware and other cyber threats.

### What’s New

Since the initial release of the Ransomware Guide in September 2020, ransomware actors have accelerated their tactics and techniques.

To maintain relevancy, add perspective, and maximize the effectiveness of this guide, the following changes have been made:

* Added FBI and NSA as co-authors based on their contributions and operational insight.
* Incorporated the [#StopRansomware](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware "#StopRansomware") effort into the title.
* Added recommendations for preventing common initial infection vectors, including compromised credentials and advanced forms of social engineering.
* Updated recommendations to address cloud backups and zero trust architecture (ZTA).
* Expanded the ransomware response checklist with threat hunting tips for detection and analysis.
* Mapped recommendations to CISA’s [Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs)](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals "Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs)").

These recommended best practices align with the CPGs developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. For more information on the CPGs and recommended baseline protections, visit CISA’s [Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals "Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals").

### Preparing for Ransomware and Data Extortion Incidents

Refer to the best practices and references listed in this section to help manage the risks posed by ransomware and to drive a coordinated and efficient response for your organization in the event of an incident. Apply these practices to the greatest extent possible pending the availability of organizational resources.

* **Maintain offline, encrypted backups of critical data**, and regularly test the availability and integrity of backups in a disaster recovery scenario [[CPG 2.R](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf "CPG 2.R")]. Test backup procedures on a regular basis. It is important that backups are maintained offline, as many ransomware variants attempt to find and subsequently delete or encrypt accessible backups to make restoration impossible unless the ransom is paid.
  + Maintain and regularly update “golden images” of critical systems. This includes maintaining image “templates” that have a preconfigured operating system (OS) and associated software applications that can be quickly deployed to rebuild a system, such as a virtual machine or server [[CPG 2.O](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf "CPG 2.O")].
    - Use infrastructure as code (IaC) to deploy and update cloud resources and keep backups of template files offline to quickly redeploy resources. IaC code should be version controlled and changes to the templates should be audited.
    - Store applicable source code or executables with offline backups (as well as escrowed and license agreements). Rebuilding from system images is more efficient, but some images will not install on different hardware or platforms correctly; having separate access to software helps in these cases.
  + Retain backup hardware to rebuild systems if rebuilding the primary system is not preferred.
    - Consider replacing out-of-date hardware that inhibits restoration with up-to-date hardware, as older hardware can present installation or compatibility hurdles when rebuilding from images.
  + Consider using a multi-cloud solution to avoid vendor lock-in for cloud-to-cloud backups in case all accounts under the same vendor are impacted.
    - Some cloud vendors offer immutable storage solutions that can protect stored data without the need for a separate environment. Use immutable storage with caution as it does not meet compliance criteria for certain regulations and misconfiguration can impose significant cost.
* **Create, maintain, and regularly exercise a basic cyber incident response plan (IRP) and associated communications plan that includes response and notification procedures** for ransomware and data extortion/breach incidents [[CPG 2.S](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf "CPG 2.S")]. Ensure a hard copy of the plan and an offline version is available.
  + Ensure that data breach notification procedures adhere to applicable state laws. Refer to the [National Conference of State Legislatures: Security Breach Notification Laws](https://www.ncsl.org/technology-and-communication/security-breach-notification-laws "National Conference of State Legislatures: Security Breach Notification Laws") for information on each state’s data breach notification laws and consult legal counsel when necessary.
  + For breaches involving electronic health information, you may need to notify the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and—in some cases—the media. Refer to the FTC’s [Health Breach Notification Rule](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/health-breach-notification-rule "Health Breach Notification Rule") and the HHS [Breach Notification Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/breach-notification/index.html "Breach Notification Rule") for more information.
  + For breaches involving personally identifiable information (PII), notify affected individuals so they can take steps to reduce the chance that their information will be misused. Provide the type of information exposed, recommend remediation actions, and relevant contact information.
  + Notify businesses of a breach if PII stored on behalf of other businesses is stolen.
  + Ensure the IRP and communications plan are reviewed and approved by the CEO, or equivalent, in writing and that both are reviewed and understood across the chain of command.
  + Review available incident response guidance, such as the Ransomware Response Checklist in this guide and [Public Power Cyber Incident Response Playbook](https://www.publicpower.org/system/files/documents/Public-Power-Cyber-Incident-Response-Playbook.pdf "Public Power Cyber Incident Response Playbook") to:
    - Help your organization better organize around cyber incident response.
    - Draft cyber incident holding statements.
    - Develop a cyber IRP.
  + Include organizational communications procedures as well as templates for cyber incident holding statements in the communications plan. Reach a consensus on what level of detail is appropriate to share within the organization and with the public and how information will flow.
* **Implement a** [**zero trust architecture**](https://www.cisa.gov/zero-trust-maturity-model "zero trust architecture") to prevent unauthorized access to data and services. Make access control enforcement as granular as possible. ZTA assumes a network is compromised and provides a collection of concepts and ideas designed to minimize uncertainty in enforcing accurate, least privilege per request access decisions in information systems and services.

### Preventing and Mitigating Ransomware and Data Extortion Incidents

Refer to the best practices and references listed in this section to help prevent and mitigate ransomware and data extortion incidents. Prevention best practices are grouped by common initial access vectors of ransomware and data extortion actors.

#### ***Initial Access Vector: Internet-Facing Vulnerabilities and Misconfigurations***

* **Do not expose services, such as remote desktop protocol, on the web.** If these services must be exposed, apply appropriate compensating controls to prevent common forms of abuse and exploitation. All unnecessary OS applications and network protocols are disabled on internet-facing assets. [[CPG 2.W](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf "CISA CPG Report")]
* **Conduct regular vulnerability scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities,** especially those on internet-facing devices, to limit the attack surface [[CPG 1.E](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf "CPG 1.E")].
  + CISA offers a no-cost Vulnerability Scanning service and other no-cost assessments: [cisa.gov/cyber-resource-hub](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-resource-hub "CISA Cyber Resources Hub") [[CPG 1.F](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf "CPG 1.F")].
* **Regularly patch and update software and operating systems to the latest available versions**.
  + Prioritize timely patching of internet-facing servers—that operate software for processing internet data, such as web browsers, browser plugins, and document readers—especially for [known exploited vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog "known exploited vulnerabilities catalog").
  + The authoring organizations—aware of difficulties small and medium business have keeping internet-facing servers updated—urge migrating systems to reputable “managed” cloud providers to reduce, not eliminate, system maintenance roles for identity and email systems. For more information, visit NSA’s Cybersecurity Information page [Mitigating Cloud Vulnerabilities](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Jan/22/2002237484/-1/-1/0/CSI-MITIGATING-CLOUD-VULNERABILITIES_20200121.PDF "Mitigating Cloud Vulnerabilities").
* **Ensure all on-premises, cloud services, mobile, and personal (i.e., bring your own device [BYOD]) devices are properly configured and security features are enabled.** For example, disable ports and protocols that are not being used for business purposes (e.g., Remote Desktop Protocol [RDP]—Transmission Control Protocol [TCP] Port 3389) [[CPG 2.X](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf "CPG 2.X")].
  + Reduce or eliminate manual deployments and codify cloud resource configuration through IaC. Test IaC templates before deployment with static security scanning tools to identify misconfigurations and security gaps.
  + Check for configuration drift routinely to identify resources that were changed or introduced outside of template deployment, reducing the likelihood of new security gaps and misconfigurations being introduced. Leverage cloud providers’ services to automate or facilitate auditing resources to ensure a consistent baseline.
* **Limit the use of RDP and other remote desktop services.** If RDP is necessary, apply best practices. Threat actors often gain initial access to a network through exposed and poorly secured remote services, and later traverse the network using the native Windows RDP client. Threat actors also often gain access by exploiting virtual private networks (VPNs) or using compromised credentials. Refer to CISA Advisory: [Enterprise VPN Security](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa20-073a "Enterprise VPN Security").
  + Audit the network for systems using RDP, close unused RDP ports, enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts, apply multifactor authentication (MFA), and log RDP login attempts.
  + Update VPNs, network infrastructure devices, and devices being used to remote in to work environments with the latest software patches and security configurations. Implement MFA on all VPN connections to increase security. If MFA is not implemented, require teleworkers to use passwords of 15 or more characters.
* Disable Server Message Block (SMB) protocol version 1 and upgrade to version 3 (SMBv3) after mitigating existing dependencies (on existing systems or applications), as they may break when disabled. SMBv3 was first released as part of updates to Microsoft Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, Apple OS X 10.10, and Linux kernel 3.12.
* Harden SMBv3 by implementing the following guidance as malicious actors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations.
  + Require the use of SMBv 3.1.1. This version contains enhanced security protections, including pre-authentication integrity, enhanced AES encryption, and signing cryptography. SMBv 3.1.1 protocol is supported natively in Windows, Apple, and Linux kernel, as well as many other third-party storage systems. In Microsoft Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019, Windows 11 Preview Build 25951, and later, you can mandate SMBv 3.1.1 protections such as dialect client negotiation. For more information, see [Microsoft’s Protect SMB traffic from interception | Use SMB 3.1.1](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-interception-defense?tabs=group-policy#use-smb-311 "SMB Intercept Defense Microsoft") and [SMB dialect management now supported in Windows Insider](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/storage-at-microsoft/smb-dialect-management-now-supported-in-windows-insider/ba-p/3916368 "SMB Dialect Management").
  + Block unnecessary SMB communications:
    - Block external access of SMB to and from organization networks by blocking TCP port 445 inbound and outbound at internet perimeter firewalls. Block TCP ports 137, 138, 139. **Note:** SMBv2 and later does not use NetBIOS datagrams. Continuing to us SMBv2 does not have significant risks and can be used where needed. It is recommended to update it to SMBv3 where feasible.
    - Block or limit internal SMB traffic so that communications only occur between systems requiring it. For instance, Windows devices need SMB communications with domain controllers to get group policy, but most Windows workstations do not need to access other Windows workstations.
    - Configure Microsoft Windows and Windows Server systems to require Kerberos-based IP Security (IPsec) for lateral SMB communications to prevent malicious actors from accessing communications over SMB by detecting systems that are not members of an organization’s Microsoft Active Directory domains.
    - Disable the SMB Server service (“Server”) on Microsoft Windows and Windows Server devices in instances where there is no need to remotely access files or to name pipe application programming interfaces (APIs).
    - For more information guidance, see Microsoft’s [Secure SMB Traffic in Windows Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-secure-traffic "SMB Secure Traffic").
  + Consider requiring SMB encryption. For systems running SMB 3.1 or later, SMB encryption will offer better performance than SMB signing (see bullet below) as well as increased security benefits (To guarantee that SMB 3.1.1 clients always use SMB Encryption, you must disable the SMB 1.0 server). For more information, refer to Microsoft’s [SMB security enhancements | Enable SMB Encryption](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-security#enable-smb-encryption "SMB Encryption") and [Reduced performance after SMB Encryption or SMB Signing is enabled](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/reduced-performance-after-smb-encryption-signing "Reduced Performance after SMB Encryption")
  + If SMB encryption is not enabled, require SMB signing for both SMB client and server on all systems. This will prevent certain adversary-in-the-middle and pass-the-hash attacks.  For more information on SMB signing, refer to Microsoft’s [Overview of Server Message Block Signing](https://learn.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/overview-server-message-block-signing "Overview Server Message Block Signing").
  + Require Kerberos authentication by hardening Universal Naming Convention (UNC). OSs such as Microsoft Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, and later automatically harden UNC for connections to the Microsoft Active Directory domain via SYSVOL and NETLOGON shares. Additionally, network administrators can manually configure UNC hardening for servers and shares in any supported Microsoft Windows operating system. For more information, refer to Microsoft’s  [Vulnerability in Group Policy could allow remote code execution](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/ms15-011-vulnerability-in-group-policy-could-allow-remote-code-execution-february-10-2015-91b4bda2-945d-455b-ebbb-01d1ec191328 "Vulnerability could allow remote code execution"). Using IP addresses to connect to SMB servers will result in the use of NTLM authentication unless you also configure the use of Kerberos SPNs with IP addresses, refer to Microsoft’s [Configuring Kerberos for IP Address](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/configuring-kerberos-over-ip "Configuring Kerberos IP").
  + Use SMB over QUIC. Microsoft Windows 11, Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition, and Android clients with a third-party SMB client support use of SMB over QUIC, an alternative for SMB over TCP. The QUIC protocol is always Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 encrypted and uses certificate authentication to encapsulate all SMB traffic—including SMB’s own authentication—inside a VPN-like transport. SMB over QUIC allows mobile users to safely connect over the public internet to edge SMB resources, such as servers at the edge of organizational networks not completely behind a firewall, but also works on internal networks that require the highest SMB transport security. For more information, refer to Microsoft’s [SMB over QUIC](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-over-quic "SMB over QUIC").
  + Log and monitor SMB traffic [[CPG 2.T](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals "Cross Sector Cybersecurity Performance goal 2.T")] to help flag potentially abnormal, harmful behaviors.

#### ***Initial Access Vector: Compromised Credentials***

* **Implement** [**phishing-resistant MFA**](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf "Fact Sheet Implementing phishing-resistant MFA") **for all services**, particularly for email, VPNs, and accounts that access critical systems [[CPG 2.H](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf "CPG 2.H")]. Escalate to senior management upon discovery of systems that do not allow MFA, systems that do not enforce MFA, and any users who are not enrolled with MFA.
  + Consider employing password-less MFA that replace passwords with two or more verification factors (e.g., a fingerprint, facial recognition, device pin, or a cryptographic key).
* **Consider subscribing to credential monitoring services** that monitor the dark web for compromised credentials.
* **Implement identity and access management (IAM) systems** to provide administrators with the tools and technologies to monitor and manage roles and access privileges of individual network entities for on-premises and cloud applications.
* **Implement zero trust access control** by creating strong access policies to restrict user to resource access and resource-to-resource access. This is important for key management resources in the cloud.
* **Change default admin usernames and passwords.** [[CPG 2.A](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf "CPG 2.A")].
* **Do not use root access accounts for day-to-day operations.** Create users, groups, and roles to carry out tasks.
* **Implement password policies that require unique passwords of at least 15 characters.** [[CPG 2.B](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf "CPG 2.B")] [[CPG 2.C](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf "CPG 2.C")].
  + Password managers can help you develop and manage secure passwords. Secure and limit access to any password managers in use and enable all security features available on the product in use, such as MFA.
* **Enforce account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts.** Log and monitor login attempts for brute force password cracking and password spraying [[CPG 2.G](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf "CPG 2.G")].
* **Store passwords in a secured database and use strong hashing algorithms.**
* **Disable saving passwords to the browser in the Group Policy Management console.**
* **Implement Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)** where possible if your OS is older than Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 as these versions do not have LAPS built in. **Note:** The authoring organizations recommend organizations upgrade to Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 or greater.
* Protect against Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) dumping:
  + **Implement the Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rule for LSASS.**
  + **Implement Credential Guard for Windows 10 and Server 2016.** Refer to Microsoft [Manage Windows Defender Credential Guard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-manage "Manage Windows Defender Credential Guard") for more information. For Windows Server 2012R2, enable Protected Process Light (PPL) for Local Security Authority (LSA).
* **Educate all employees on proper password security in your annual security training** to include emphasizing not reusing passwords and not saving passwords in local files.
* **Use Windows PowerShell Remoting, Remote Credential Guard, or RDP** with restricted Admin Mode as feasible when establishing a remote connection to avoid direct exposure of credentials.
* **Separate administrator accounts from user accounts** [[CPG 2.E](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf "CPG 2.E")]. Only allow designated admin accounts to be used for admin purposes. If an individual user needs administrative rights over their workstation, use a separate account that does not have administrative access to other hosts, such as servers. For some cloud environments, separate duties when the account used to provision/manage keys does not have permission to use the keys and vice versa. As this strategy introduces additional management overhead, it is not appropriate in all environments.

#### ***Initial Access Vector: Phishing***

* **Implement a cybersecurity user awareness and training program** that includes guidance on how to identify and report suspicious activity (e.g., phishing) or incidents [[CPG 2.I](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf "CPG 2.I")].
* **Implement flagging external emails in email clients.**
* **Implement filters at the email gateway to filter out emails** with known malicious indicators, such as known malicious subject lines, and block suspicious Internet Protocol (IP) addresses at the firewall [[CPG 2.M](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf "CPG 2.M")].
* **Enable common attachment filters to restrict file types that commonly contain malware** and should not be sent by email. For more information, refer to Microsoft’s post [Anti-malware protection in EOP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-protection-service-description/exchange-online-protection-feature-details?tabs=Anti-spam-and-anti-malware-protection "Anti-malware protection in EOP").
  + Review file types in your filter list at least semi-annually and add additional file types that have become attack vectors. For example, OneNote attachments with embedded malware have recently been used in phishing campaigns.
  + Malware is often compressed in password protected archives that evade antivirus scanning and email filters.
* **Implement Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) policy and verification** to lower the chance of spoofed or modified emails from valid domains. DMARC protects your domain from being spoofed but does not protect from incoming emails that have been spoofed unless the sending domain also implements DMARC. DMARC builds on the widely deployed Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) protocols, adding a reporting function that allows senders and receivers to improve and monitor protection of the domain from fraudulent email. For more information on DMARC, refer to CISA Insights [Enhance Email & Web Security](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISAInsights-Cyber-EnhanceEmailandWebSecurity_S508C-a.pdf "Enhance Email & Web Security") and the Center for Internet Security’s blog [How DMARC Advances Email Security](https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/blog/how-dmarc-advances-email-security "How DMARC Advances Email Security").
* **Ensure macro scripts are disabled for Microsoft Office files transmitted via email.** These macros can be used to deliver ransomware [[CPG 2.N](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf "CPG 2.N")]. **Note:** Recent versions of Office are configured by default to block files that contain Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros and display a Trust Bar with a warning that macros are present and have been disabled. For more information, refer to Microsoft’s [Macros from the internet will be blocked by default in Office](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/internet-macros-blocked "Macros from the internet will be blocked by default in Office"). See Microsoft’s [Block macros from running in Office files from the Internet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/internet-macros-blocked#block-macros-from-running-in-office-files-from-the-internet "Block macros from running in Office files from the Internet") for configuration instructions to disable macros in external files for earlier versions of Office.
* **Disable Windows Script Host (WSH).** Windows script hosting provides an environment in which users can execute scripts or perform tasks.

#### ***Initial Access Vector: Precursor Malware Infection***

* **Use automatic updates for your antivirus and anti-malware software and signatures.** Ensure tools are properly configured to escalate warnings and indicators to notify security personnel. The authoring organizations recommend using a centrally managed antivirus solution. This enables detection of both “precursor” malware and ransomware.
  + A ransomware infection may be evidence of a previous, unresolved network compromise. For example, many ransomware infections are the result of existing malware infections, such as QakBot, Bumblebee, and Emotet.
  + In some cases, ransomware deployment is the last step in a network compromise and is dropped to obscure previous post-compromise activities, such as business email compromise (BEC).
* **Use application allowlisting and/or endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions** on all assets to ensure that only authorized software is executable and all unauthorized software is blocked.
  + For Windows, enable Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC), AppLocker, or both on all systems that support these features.
    - WDAC is under continuous development while AppLocker will only receive security fixes. AppLocker can be used as a complement to WDAC, when WDAC is set to the most restrictive level possible, and AppLocker is used to fine-tune restrictions for your organization.
  + Use allowlisting rather than attempting to list and deny every possible permutation of applications in a network environment.
  + Consider implementing EDR for cloud-based resources.
* **Consider implementing an intrusion detection system (IDS)** to detect command and control activity and other potentially malicious network activity that occurs prior to ransomware deployment.
  + Ensure that the IDS is centrally monitored and managed. Properly configure the tools and route warnings and indicators to the appropriate personnel for action.
* **Monitor indicators of activity and block malware file creation with the Windows Sysmon utility.** As of Sysmon 14, the FileBlockExecutable option can be used to block the creation of malicious executables, Dynamic Link Library (DLL) files, and system files that match specific hash values.

#### ***Initial Access Vector: Advanced Forms of Social Engineering***

* **Create policies to include cybersecurity awareness training** about advanced forms of social engineering for personnel that have access to your network. Training should include tips on being able to recognize illegitimate websites and search results. It is also important to repeat security awareness training regularly to keep your staff informed and vigilant.
* **Implement Protective Domain Name System (DNS)**. By blocking malicious internet activity at the source, Protective DNS services can provide high network security for remote workers. These security services analyze DNS queries and take action to mitigate threats—such as malware, ransomware, phishing attacks, viruses, malicious sites, and spyware—leveraging the existing DNS protocol and architecture. SLTT’s can implement the no-cost MDBR service. See NSA’s and CISA’s [Selecting a Protective DNS Service](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Mar/03/2002593055/-1/-1/1/CSI_Selecting%20a%20Protective%20DNS%20Service_U00117652-21.PDF "Selecting a Protective DNS Service").
* **Consider implementing sandboxed browsers** to protect systems from malware originating from web browsing. Sandboxed browsers isolate the host machine from malicious code.

#### ***Initial Access Vector: Third Parties and Managed Service Providers***

* **Consider the risk management and cyber hygiene practices of third parties or managed service providers (MSPs)** your organization relies on to meet its mission. MSPs have been an infection vector for ransomware impacting numerous client organizations [[CPG 1.I](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf "CPG 1.I")].
  + If a third party or MSP is responsible for maintaining and securing your organization’s backups, ensure they are following the applicable best practices outlined above. Use contract language to formalize your security requirements as a best practice.
* **Ensure the use of least privilege and separation of duties when setting up the access of third parties**. Third parties and MSPs should only have access to devices and servers that are within their role or responsibilities.
* **Consider creating service control policies (SCP) for cloud-based resources to prevent users or roles, organization wide, from being able to access specific services or take specific actions within services.** For example, the SCP can be used to restrict users from being able to delete logs, update virtual private cloud (VPC) configurations, and change log configurations.

## General Best Practices and Hardening Guidance

* **Ensure your organization has a comprehensive asset management** approach [[CPG 1.A](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)].
  + Understand and take inventory of your organization’s IT assets, logical (e.g., data, software) and physical (e.g., hardware).
  + Know which data or systems are most critical for health and safety, revenue generation, or other critical services, and understand any associated interdependencies (e.g., “system list ‘A’ used to perform ‘X’ is stored in critical asset ‘B’”). This will aid your organization in determining restoration priorities should an incident occur. Apply more comprehensive security controls or safeguards to critical assets. This requires organization-wide coordination.
  + Ensure you store your IT asset documentation securely and keep offline backups and physical hard copies on site.
* **Apply the principle of least privilege to all systems and services** so that users only have the access they need to perform their jobs [[CPG 2.E](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)]. Malicious actors often leverage privileged accounts for network-wide ransomware attacks.
  + Restrict user permissions to install and run software applications.
  + Restrict user/role permissions to access or modify cloud-based resources.
  + Limit actions that can be taken on customer-managed keys by certain users/roles.
  + Block local accounts from remote access by using group policy to restrict network sign-in by local accounts. For guidance, refer to Microsoft’s [Blocking Remote Use of Local Accounts](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-baselines/blocking-remote-use-of-local-accounts/ba-p/701042) and [Security identifiers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-identifiers).
  + Use Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard and restricted admin mode for RDP sessions.
  + Remove unnecessary accounts and groups and restrict root access.
  + Control and limit local administration.
  + Audit Active Directory (AD) for excessive privileges on accounts and group memberships.
  + Make use of the Protected Users AD group in Windows domains to further secure privileged user accounts against [pass-the-hash attacks](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002/).
  + Audit user and admin accounts for inactive or unauthorized accounts quarterly. Prioritize review of remote monitoring and management accounts that are publicly accessible—this includes audits of third-party access given to MSPs.
* **Ensure that all hypervisors and associated IT infrastructure, including network and storage components, are updated and hardened**. Emerging ransomware strategies have begun targeting [VMware ESXi servers](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-039a "VMware EXSi servers"), hypervisors, and other centralized tools and systems, which enables fast encryption of the infrastructure at scale. For more information about ransomware resilience and hardening of VMware and other virtualization infrastructure, see:
  + [NIST Special Publication (SP 800-125A Rev.1): Security Recommendations for Server-based Hypervisor Platforms](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-125a/rev-1/final "NIST Special Publication (SP 800-125A Rev.1): Security Recommendations for Server-based Hypervisor Platforms")
  + VMware: [Cloud Infrastructure Security Configuration & Hardening](https://core.vmware.com/security-configuration-guide "o	VMware: Cloud Infrastructure Security Configuration & Hardening")
* **Leverage best practices and enable security settings in association with cloud environments**, such as Microsoft Office 365.
  + Review the shared responsibility model for cloud and ensure you understand what makes up customer responsibility when it comes to asset protection.
  + Backup data often; offline or leverage cloud-to-cloud backups.
  + Enable logging on all resources and set alerts for abnormal usages.
  + Enable delete protection or object lock on storage resources often targeted in ransomware attacks (e.g., object storage, database storage, file storage, and block storage) to prevent data from being deleted or overwritten, respectively.
  + Consider enabling version control to keep multiple variants of objects in storage. This allows for easier recovery from unintended or malicious actions.
  + Where supported, when using custom programmatic access to the cloud, use signed application programming interface (API) requests to verify the identity of the requester, protect data in transit, and protect against other attacks such as replay attacks.
  + For more information, refer to CISA Cybersecurity Advisory [Microsoft Office 365 Security Recommendations](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa20-120a).
* **Mitigate the malicious use of remote access and remote monitoring and management (RMM)** software:
  + Audit remote access tools on your network to identify current or authorized RMM software.
  + Review logs for execution of RMM software to detect abnormal use, or RMM software running as a portable executable.
  + Use security software to detect instances of RMM software only being loaded in memory.
  + Require authorized RMM solutions only be used from within your network over approved remote access solutions, such as VPNs or virtual desktop interfaces (VDIs).
  + Block both inbound and outbound connections on common RMM ports and protocols at the network perimeter.
* **Employ logical or physical means of network segmentation by implementing** ZTA and separating various business units or departmental IT resources within your organization and maintain separation between IT and operational technology [[CPG 2.F](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)]. Network segmentation can help contain the impact of any intrusion affecting your organization and prevent or limit lateral movement on the part of malicious actors. Network segmentation can be rendered ineffective if it is breached through user error or non-adherence to organizational policies (e.g., connecting removable storage media or other devices to multiple segments).
* **Develop and regularly update comprehensive network diagram(s) that describes systems and data flows within your organization’s network(s)** (see Figure 1) [[CPG 2.P](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)]. This is useful in steady state and can help incident responders understand where to focus their efforts. See Figure 2 and Figure 3 for depictions of a flat (unsegmented) network and of a best practice segmented network.
  + The diagram should include depictions of major networks, any specific IP addressing schemes, and the general network topology including network connections, interdependencies, and access granted to third parties, MSPs, and cloud connections from external and internal endpoints.
  + Ensure you securely store network documentation and keep offline backups and hard copies on site.

* **Restrict usage of PowerShell to specific users on a case-by-case basis by** **using Group Policy**. Typically, only users or administrators who manage a network or Windows OS are permitted to use PowerShell. PowerShell is a cross-platform, command-line, shell, and scripting language that is a component of Microsoft Windows. Threat actors use PowerShell to deploy ransomware and hide their malicious activities. For more information, refer to the joint Cybersecurity Information Sheet [Keeping PowerShell: Security Measure to Use and Embrace](https://media.defense.gov/2022/jun/22/2003021689/-1/-1/1/csi_keeping_powershell_security_measures_to_use_and_embrace_20220622.pdf).
  + Update Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core to the latest version and uninstall all earlier PowerShell versions.
  + Ensure PowerShell instances, using the most current version, have module, script block, and transcription logging enabled (enhanced logging).
    - Logs from Windows PowerShell prior to version 5.0 are either non-existent or do not record enough detail to aid in enterprise monitoring and incident response activities.
    - PowerShell logs contain valuable data, including historical OS and registry interaction and possible tactics, techniques, and procedures of a threat actor’s PowerShell use.
    - Two logs that record PowerShell activity are the “PowerShell Windows Event” log and the “PowerShell Operational” log. The authoring organizations recommend turning on these two Windows Event Logs with a retention period of at least 180 days.
    - These logs should be checked on a regular basis to confirm whether the log data has been deleted or logging has been turned off. Set the storage size permitted for both logs to as large as possible.
* **Secure domain controllers (DCs)**. Malicious actors often target and use DCs as a staging point to spread ransomware network wide. To secure DCs:
  + Use the latest version of Windows Server supported by your organization on DCs. Newer versions of Windows Server OS have more security features, including for Active Directory, integrated. For guidance on configuring available security features refer to Microsoft’s [Best Practices for Securing Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/best-practices-for-securing-active-directory).
    - The authoring organizations recommend using Windows Server 2019 or greater and Windows 10 or greater as they have security features, such as LSASS protections with Windows Credential Guard, Windows Defender, and Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI), not included in older operating system
  + Ensure that DCs are regularly patched. Apply patches for critical vulnerabilities as soon as possible.
  + Use open-source penetration testing tools, such as [BloodHound](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/software/S0521/), to verify domain controller security.
  + Ensure that minimal software or agents are installed on DCs because these can be leveraged to run arbitrary code on the system.
  + Restrict access to DCs to the Administrators group. Users within this group should be limited and have separate accounts used for day-to-day operations with non-administrative permissions. For more information, refer to Microsoft’s [Securing Active Directory Administrative Groups and Accounts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/tn-archive/cc700835%28v%3Dtechnet.10%29?redirectedfrom=MSDN).
    - The designated admin accounts should only be used for admin purposes. Ensure that checking emails, web browsing, or other high-risk activities are not performed on DCs.
  + Configure DC host firewalls to prevent internet access. Usually, DCs do not need direct internet access. Servers with internet connectivity can be used to pull necessary updates in lieu of allowing internet access for DCs.
  + Implement a privileged access management (PAM) solution on DCs to assist in managing and monitoring privileged access. PAM solutions can also log and alert usage to detect unusual activity.
  + Consider disabling or limiting NTLM and WDigest Authentication, if possible. Include their use as criteria for prioritizing upgrading legacy systems or for segmenting the network. Instead use modern federation protocols (e.g., SAML, OIDC or Kerberos) for authentication with AES-256 bit encryption. If NTLM must be enabled:
    - Enable Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA) to prevent some NTLM-relay attacks. For more information, refer to Microsoft [Mitigating NTLM Relay Attacks on Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5005413-mitigating-ntlm-relay-attacks-on-active-directory-certificate-services-ad-cs-3612b773-4043-4aa9-b23d-b87910cd3429).
    - Enable NTLM auditing to ensure that only NTLMv2 responses are sent across the network. Measures should be taken to ensure that LM and NTLM responses are refused, if possible.
  + Enable additional protections for LSA Authentication to prevent code injection capable of acquiring credentials from the system. Prior to enabling these protections, run audits against lsass.exe to ensure an understanding of the programs that will be affected by the enabling of this protection.
* **Retain and adequately secure logs from network devices, local hosts, and cloud services**. This supports triage and remediation of cybersecurity events. Logs can be analyzed to determine the impact of events and ascertain if an incident has occurred [[CPG 2.T](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)].
  + Set up centralized log management using a security information and event management tool [[CPG 2.U](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)]. This enables an organization to correlate logs from both network and host security devices. By reviewing logs from multiple sources, an organization can triage an individual event and determine its impact to the organization.
  + Maintain and back up logs for critical systems for a minimum of one year, if possible.
* **Establish a security baseline of normal network traffic and tune network appliances to detect anomalous behavior**. Tune host-based products to detect anomalous binaries, lateral movement, and persistence techniques.
  + Consider using business transaction logging—such as logging activity related to specific or critical applications—for behavioral analytics
* **Conduct regular assessments** to ensure processes and procedures are up to date and can be followed by security staff and end users.

## **Part 2: Ransomware and Data Extortion Response Checklist**

Should your organization be a victim of ransomware, follow your approved IRP. The authoring organizations strongly recommend responding by using the following checklist. Be sure to move through the **first three steps in sequence**.

### Detection and Analysis

Refer to the best practices and references below to help manage the risk posed by ransomware and support your organization’s coordinated and efficient response to a ransomware incident. Apply these practices to the greatest extent possible based on availability of organizational resources.

* **Determine which systems were impacted, and immediately isolate them.**
  + If several systems or subnets appear impacted, take the network offline at the switch level. It may not be feasible to disconnect individual systems during an incident.
  + Prioritize isolating critical systems that are essential to daily operations.
  + If taking the network temporarily offline is not immediately possible, locate the network cable (e.g., ethernet) and unplug affected devices from the network or remove them from Wi-Fi to contain the infection.
  + For cloud resources, take a snapshot of volumes to get a point in time copy for reviewing later for forensic investigation.
  + After an initial compromise, malicious actors may monitor your organization’s activity or communications to understand if their actions have been detected. Isolate systems in a coordinated manner and use out-of-band communication methods such as phone calls to avoid tipping off actors that they have been discovered and that mitigation actions are being undertaken. Not doing so could cause actors to move laterally to preserve their access or deploy ransomware widely prior to networks being taken offline.
* **Power down devices if you are unable to disconnect them from the network to avoid further spread of the ransomware infection.**
  + **Note:** This step will prevent your organization from maintaining ransomware infection artifacts and potential evidence stored in volatile memory. **It should be carried out only if it is not possible to temporarily shut down the network or disconnect affected hosts from the network** using other means.
* **Triage impacted systems for restoration and recovery.**
  + Identify and prioritize critical systems for restoration on a clean network and confirm the nature of data housed on impacted systems.
    - Prioritize restoration and recovery based on a predefined critical asset list that includes information systems critical for health and safety, revenue generation, or other critical services, as well as systems they depend on.
  + Keep track of systems and devices that are not perceived to be impacted so they can be deprioritized for restoration and recovery. This enables your organization to get back to business in a more efficient manner.
* **Examine existing organizational detection or prevention systems (e.g., antivirus, EDR, IDS, Intrusion Prevention System) and logs.** Doing so can highlight evidence of additional systems or malware involved in earlier stages of the attack.
  + Look for evidence of precursor “dropper” malware, such as Bumblebee, Dridex, Emotet, QakBot, or Anchor. A ransomware event may be evidence of a previous, unresolved network compromise.
    - Operators of these advanced malware variants will often sell access to a network. Malicious actors will sometimes use this access to exfiltrate data and then threaten to release the data publicly before ransoming the network to further extort the victim and pressure them into paying.
    - Malicious actors often drop ransomware variants to obscure post-compromise activity. Care must be taken to identify such dropper malware before rebuilding from backups to prevent continuing compromises.
* **Confer with your team to develop and document an initial understanding of what has occurred based on initial analysis.**
* **Initiate threat hunting activities.**
  + For enterprise environments, check for:
    - Newly created AD accounts or accounts with escalated privileges and recent activity related to privileged accounts such as Domain Admins.
    - Anomalous VPN device logins or other suspicious logins.
    - Endpoint modifications that may impair backups, shadow copy, disk journaling, or boot configurations. Look for anomalous usage of built-in Windows tools such as bcdedit.exe, fsutil.exe (deletejournal), vssadmin.exe, wbadmin.exe, and wmic.exe (shadowcopy or shadowstorage). Misuse of these tools is a common ransomware technique to inhibit system recovery.
    - Signs of the presence of Cobalt Strike beacon/client. [Cobalt Strike](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/software/S0154/ "Cobalt Strike") is a commercial penetration testing software suite. Malicious actors often name Cobalt Strike Windows processes with the same names as legitimate Windows processes to obfuscate their presence and complicate investigations.
    - Signs of any unexpected usage of remote monitoring and management (RMM) software (including portable executables that are not installed). RMM software is commonly used by malicious actors to maintain persistence.
    - Any unexpected PowerShell execution or use of PsTools suite.
    - Signs of enumeration of AD and/or LSASS credentials being dumped (e.g., [Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/software/S0002/ "Mimikatz") or NTDSutil.exe).
    - Signs of unexpected endpoint-to-endpoint (including servers) communications.
    - Potential signs of data being exfiltrated from the network, which may include:
    - Abnormal amount of data outgoing over any port. Open source software can tunnel data over various ports and protocols. For example, ransomware actors have used [Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/tree/master "Chisel") to tunnel Secure Shell (SSH) over HTTPS port 443. Ransomware actors have also used [Cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared "Cloudflared") to abuse Cloudflare tunnels to tunnel communications over HTTPS.
    - Common tools for data exfiltration include [Rclone](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/software/S1040/ "Rclone"), Rsync, various web-based file storage services (also used by threat actors to implant malware/tools on the affected network), and FTP/SFTP.
    - Newly created services, unexpected scheduled tasks, unexpected software installed, etc.
  + For cloud environments:
    - Enable tools to detect and prevent modifications to IAM, network security, and data protection resources.
    - Use automation to detect common issues (e.g., disabling features, introduction of new firewall rules) and take automated actions as soon as they occur. For example, if a new firewall rule is created that allows open traffic (0.0.0.0/0), an automated action can be taken to disable or delete this rule and send notifications to the user that created it as well as the security team for awareness. This will help avoid alert fatigue and allow security personnel to focus on critical issues.

### Reporting and Notification

**Note:** Refer to the Contact Information section at the end of this guide for details on how to report and notify about ransomware incidents.

* Follow notification requirements as outlined in your cyber incident response and communications plan to **engage internal and external teams and stakeholders** with an understanding of what they can provide to help you mitigate, respond to, and recover from the incident.
  + Share the information you have at your disposal to receive timely and relevant assistance. Keep management and senior leaders informed via regular updates as the situation develops. Relevant stakeholders may include your IT department, managed security service providers, cyber insurance company, and departmental or elected leaders [[CPG 4.A](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf "CPG 4.A")].
  + Report the incident to—and consider requesting assistance from—CISA, your local FBI field office, the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), or your local U.S. Secret Service field office.
  + As appropriate, coordinate with communications and public information personnel to ensure accurate information is shared internally with your organization and externally with the public.
* If the incident resulted in a data breach, **follow notification requirements as outlined in your cyber incident response and communications plans**.

### Containment and Eradication

**If no initial mitigation actions appear possible:**

* **Take a system image and memory capture of a sample of affected devices (e.g., workstations, servers, virtual servers, and cloud servers)**. Collect any relevant logs as well as samples of any “precursor” malware binaries and associated observables or indicators of compromise (e.g., suspected command and control IP addresses, suspicious registry entries, or other relevant files detected). The contacts below may be able to assist you in performing these tasks.
  + Preserve evidence that is highly volatile in nature—or limited in retention—to prevent loss or tampering (e.g., system memory, Windows Security logs, data in firewall log buffers).
* **Consult federal law enforcement, even if mitigation actions are possible, regarding possible decryptors available**, as security researchers may have discovered encryption flaws for some ransomware variants and released decryption or other types of tools.

**To continue steps to contain and mitigate the incident:**

* **Research trusted guidance** (e.g., published by sources such as the U.S. Government, MS-ISAC, or a reputable security vendor) for the particular ransomware variant and follow any additional recommended steps to identify and contain systems or networks that are confirmed to be impacted.
  + Kill or disable the execution of known ransomware binaries; this will minimize damage and impact to your systems. Delete other known associated registry values and files.
* **Identify the systems and accounts involved in the initial breach.** This can include email accounts.
* Based on the breach or compromise details determined above, **contain associated systems that may be used for further or continued unauthorized access.** Breaches often involve mass credential exfiltration. Securing networks and other information sources from continued credential-based unauthorized access may include:
  + Disable virtual private networks, remote access servers, single sign-on resources, and cloud-based or other public-facing assets.
* If server-side data is being encrypted by an infected workstation, **follow server-side data encryption quick identification steps.**
  + Review Computer Management > Sessions and Open Files lists on associated servers to determine the user or system accessing those files.
  + Review file properties of encrypted files or ransom notes to identify specific users that may be associated with file ownership.
  + Review the TerminalServices-RemoteConnectionManager event log to check for successful RDP network connections.
  + Review the Windows Security log, SMB event logs, and related logs that may identify significant authentication or access events.
  + Run packet capture software, such as Wireshark, on the impacted server with a filter to identify IP addresses involved in actively writing or renaming files (e.g., smb2.filename contains cryptxxx).
* **Conduct extended analysis to identify outside-in and inside-out persistence mechanisms.**
  + Outside-in persistence may include authenticated access to external systems via rogue accounts, backdoors on perimeter systems, exploitation of external vulnerabilities, etc.
  + Inside-out persistence may include malware implants on the internal network or a variety of living-off-the-land style modifications (e.g., use of commercial penetration testing tools like Cobalt Strike; use of PsTools suite, including PsExec, to remotely install and control malware and gather information regarding—or perform remote management of—Windows systems; use of PowerShell scripts).
  + Identification may involve deployment of EDR solutions, audits of local and domain accounts, examination of data found in centralized logging systems, or deeper forensic analysis of specific systems once movement within the environment has been mapped out.
* **Rebuild systems based on prioritization of critical services** (e.g., health and safety or revenue-generating services), using pre-configured standard images, if possible. Use infrastructure as code templates to rebuild cloud resources.
* **Issue password resets for all affected systems and address any associated vulnerabilities and gaps in security or visibility** once the environment has been fully cleaned and rebuilt, including any associated impacted accounts and the removal or remediation of malicious persistence mechanisms. This can include applying patches, upgrading software, and taking other security precautions not previously taken. Update customer-managed encryption keys as needed.
* **The designated IT or IT security authority declares the ransomware incident over** based on established criteria, which may include taking the steps above or seeking outside assistance.

### Recovery and Post Incident Activity

* **Reconnect systems and restore data from offline, encrypted backups based on a prioritization of critical services.**
  + Take care not to re-infect clean systems during recovery. For example, if a new Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) has been created for recovery purposes, ensure only clean systems are added.
* **Document lessons learned from the incident and associated response activities** to inform updates to—and refine—organizational policies, plans, and procedures and guide future exercises of the same.
* **Consider sharing lessons learned and relevant indicators of compromise with CISA or your sector ISAC** to benefit others within the community.
