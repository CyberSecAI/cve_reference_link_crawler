              <p>Ransomware is a form of malware designed to encrypt files on a device, rendering them and the systems that rely on them unusable. Malicious actors then demand ransom in exchange for decryption. Over time, malicious actors have adjusted their ransomware tactics to be more destructive and impactful and have also exfiltrated victim data and pressured victims to pay by threatening to release the stolen data. The application of both tactics is known as “double extortion.” In some cases, malicious actors may exfiltrate data and threaten to release it as their sole form of extortion without employing ransomware.&nbsp;</p><p>These ransomware and associated data breach incidents can severely impact business processes by leaving organizations unable to access necessary data to operate and deliver mission-critical services. The economic and reputational impacts of ransomware and data extortion have proven challenging and costly for organizations of all sizes throughout the initial disruption and, at times, extended recovery.&nbsp;</p><p>This guide is an update to the Joint Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Multi-State Information Sharing &amp; Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Ransomware Guide released in September 2020 (see "What’s New") and was developed through the <a href="/joint-ransomware-task-force" title="Joint Ransomware Task Force">Joint Ransomware Task Force</a>. This guide includes two primary resources:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Part 1: Ransomware and Data Extortion Prevention Best Practices&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Part 2: Ransomware and Data Extortion Response Checklist</strong>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Part 1 provides guidance for all organizations to reduce the impact and likelihood of ransomware incidents and data extortion, including best practices to prepare for, prevent, and mitigate these incidents. Prevention best practices are grouped by common initial access vectors.

Apply these practices to the greatest extent possible pending the availability of organizational resources.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Maintain offline, encrypted backups of critical data</strong>, and regularly test the availability and integrity of backups in a disaster recovery scenario [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" title="CPG 2.R" rel="noreferrer noopener">CPG 2.R</a>]. Test backup procedures on a regular basis. It is important that backups are maintained offline, as many ransomware variants attempt to find and subsequently delete or encrypt accessible backups to make restoration impossible unless the ransom is paid.&nbsp;<ul><li>Maintain and regularly update “golden images” of critical systems. This includes maintaining image “templates” that have a preconfigured operating system (OS) and associated software applications that can be quickly deployed to rebuild a system, such as a virtual machine or server [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" title="CPG 2.O" rel="noreferrer noopener">CPG 2.O</a>].&nbsp;<ul><li>Use infrastructure as code (IaC) to deploy and update cloud resources and keep backups of template files offline to quickly redeploy resources. IaC code should be version controlled and changes to the templates should be audited.&nbsp;</li><li>Store applicable source code or executables with offline backups (as well as escrowed and license agreements). Rebuilding from system images is more efficient, but some images will not install on different hardware or platforms correctly; having separate access to software helps in these cases.</li></ul></li><li>Retain backup hardware to rebuild systems if rebuilding the primary system is not preferred.&nbsp;<ul><li><span>Consider replacing out-of-date hardware that inhibits restoration with up-to-date hardware, as older hardware can present installation or compatibility hurdles when rebuilding from images.&nbsp;</span></li></ul></li><li>Consider using a multi-cloud solution to avoid vendor lock-in for cloud-to-cloud backups in case all accounts under the same vendor are impacted.&nbsp;<ul><li>Some cloud vendors offer immutable storage solutions that can protect stored data without the need for a separate environment. Use immutable storage with caution as it does not meet compliance criteria for certain regulations and misconfiguration can impose significant cost.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Create, maintain, and regularly exercise a basic cyber incident response plan (IRP) and associated communications plan that includes response and notification procedures</strong> for ransomware and data extortion/breach incidents [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" title="CPG 2.S" rel="noreferrer noopener">CPG 2.S</a>]. Ensure a hard copy of the plan and an offline version is available.&nbsp;<ul><li>Ensure that data breach notification procedures adhere to applicable state laws. Refer to the <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/technology-and-communication/security-breach-notification-laws" target="_blank" title="National Conference of State Legislatures: Security Breach Notification Laws" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Conference of State Legislatures: Security Breach Notification Laws</a> for information on each state’s data breach notification laws and consult legal counsel when necessary.&nbsp;</li><li>For breaches involving electronic health information, you may need to notify the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and—in some cases—the media. Refer to the FTC’s <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/health-breach-notification-rule" target="_blank" title="Health Breach Notification Rule" rel="noreferrer noopener">Health Breach Notification Rule</a> and the HHS <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/breach-notification/index.html" target="_blank" title="Breach Notification Rule" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breach Notification Rule</a> for more information.&nbsp;</li><li>For breaches involving personally identifiable information (PII), notify affected individuals so they can take steps to reduce the chance that their information will be misused. Provide the type of information exposed, recommend remediation actions, and relevant contact information.&nbsp;</li><li>Notify businesses of a breach if PII stored on behalf of other businesses is stolen.&nbsp;</li><li>Ensure the IRP and communications plan are reviewed and approved by the CEO, or equivalent, in writing and that both are reviewed and understood across the chain of command.&nbsp;</li><li>Review available incident response guidance, such as the Ransomware Response Checklist in this guide and <a href="https://www.publicpower.org/system/files/documents/Public-Power-Cyber-Incident-Response-Playbook.pdf" target="_blank" title="Public Power Cyber Incident Response Playbook" rel="noreferrer noopener">Public Power Cyber Incident Response Playbook</a> to:&nbsp;<ul><li>Help your organization better organize around cyber incident response.&nbsp;</li><li>Draft cyber incident holding statements.&nbsp;</li><li>Develop a cyber IRP.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Include organizational communications procedures as well as templates for cyber incident holding statements in the communications plan. Reach a consensus on what level of detail is appropriate to share within the organization and with the public and how information will flow.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Implement a </strong><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/zero-trust-maturity-model" target="_blank" title="zero trust architecture" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>zero trust architecture</strong></a> to prevent unauthorized access to data and services. Make access control enforcement as granular as possible.

Prevention best practices are grouped by common initial access vectors of ransomware and data extortion actors.&nbsp;</p><h4><em><strong>Initial Access Vector: Internet-Facing Vulnerabilities and Misconfigurations&nbsp;</strong></em></h4><ul><li><strong>Do not expose services, such as remote desktop protocol, on the web.</strong> If these services must be exposed, apply appropriate compensating controls to prevent common forms of abuse and exploitation. All unnecessary OS applications and network protocols are disabled on internet-facing assets.

For more information, visit NSA’s Cybersecurity Information page <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2020/Jan/22/2002237484/-1/-1/0/CSI-MITIGATING-CLOUD-VULNERABILITIES_20200121.PDF" target="_blank" title="Mitigating Cloud Vulnerabilities" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mitigating Cloud Vulnerabilities</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Ensure all on-premises, cloud services, mobile, and personal (i.e., bring your own device [BYOD]) devices are properly configured and security features are enabled.</strong> For example, disable ports and protocols that are not being used for business purposes (e.g., Remote Desktop Protocol [RDP]—Transmission Control Protocol [TCP] Port 3389) [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" title="CPG 2.X" rel="noreferrer noopener">CPG 2.X</a>].&nbsp;<ul><li>Reduce or eliminate manual deployments and codify cloud resource configuration through IaC. Test IaC templates before deployment with static security scanning tools to identify misconfigurations and security gaps.&nbsp;</li><li>Check for configuration drift routinely to identify resources that were changed or introduced outside of template deployment, reducing the likelihood of new security gaps and misconfigurations being introduced. Leverage cloud providers’ services to automate or facilitate auditing resources to ensure a consistent baseline.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Limit the use of RDP and other remote desktop services.</strong> If RDP is necessary, apply best practices. Threat actors often gain initial access to a network through exposed and poorly secured remote services, and later traverse the network using the native Windows RDP client. Threat actors also often gain access by exploiting virtual private networks (VPNs) or using compromised credentials. Refer to CISA Advisory: <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa20-073a" target="_blank" title="Enterprise VPN Security" rel="noreferrer noopener">Enterprise VPN Security</a>.&nbsp;<ul><li>Audit the network for systems using RDP, close unused RDP ports, enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts, apply multifactor authentication (MFA), and log RDP login attempts.&nbsp;</li><li>Update VPNs, network infrastructure devices, and devices being used to remote in to work environments with the latest software patches and security configurations. Implement MFA on all VPN connections to increase security. If MFA is not implemented, require teleworkers to use passwords of 15 or more characters.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><span>Disable Server Message Block (SMB) protocol version 1 and upgrade to version 3 (SMBv3) after mitigating existing dependencies (on existing systems or applications), as they may break when disabled. SMBv3 was first released as part of updates to Microsoft Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, Apple OS X 10.10, and Linux kernel 3.12.</span></li><li><span>Harden SMBv3 by implementing the following guidance as malicious actors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations.</span><ul><li><span>Require the use of SMBv 3.1.1. This version contains enhanced security protections, including pre-authentication integrity, enhanced AES encryption, and signing cryptography. SMBv 3.1.1 protocol is supported natively in Windows, Apple, and Linux kernel, as well as many other third-party storage systems. In Microsoft Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019, Windows 11 Preview Build 25951, and later, you can mandate SMBv 3.1.1 protections such as dialect client negotiation.

Continuing to us SMBv2 does not have significant risks and can be used where needed. It is recommended to update it to SMBv3 where feasible.</span></li><li><span>Block or limit internal SMB traffic so that communications only occur between systems requiring it. For instance, Windows devices need SMB communications with domain controllers to get group policy, but most Windows workstations do not need to access other Windows workstations.</span></li><li><span>Configure Microsoft Windows and Windows Server systems to require Kerberos-based IP Security (IPsec) for lateral SMB communications to prevent malicious actors from accessing communications over SMB by detecting systems that are not members of an organization’s Microsoft Active Directory domains.</span></li><li><span>Disable the SMB Server service (“Server”) on Microsoft Windows and Windows Server devices in instances where there is no need to remotely access files or to name pipe application programming interfaces (APIs).</span></li><li><span>For more information guidance, see Microsoft’s </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-secure-traffic" title="SMB Secure Traffic"><span>Secure SMB Traffic in Windows Server</span></a><span>.</span></li></ul></li><li><span>Consider requiring SMB encryption. For systems running SMB 3.1 or later, SMB encryption will offer better performance than SMB signing (see bullet below) as well as increased security benefits (To guarantee that SMB 3.1.1 clients always use SMB Encryption, you must disable the SMB 1.0 server). For more information, refer to Microsoft’s </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-security#enable-smb-encryption" title="SMB Encryption"><span>SMB security enhancements | Enable SMB Encryption</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/reduced-performance-after-smb-encryption-signing" title="Reduced Performance after SMB Encryption"><span>Reduced performance after SMB Encryption or SMB Signing is enabled</span></a></li><li><span>If SMB encryption is not enabled, require SMB signing for both SMB client and server on all systems. This will prevent certain adversary-in-the-middle and pass-the-hash attacks. &nbsp;For more information on SMB signing, refer to Microsoft’s </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/overview-server-message-block-signing" title="Overview Server Message Block Signing"><span>Overview of Server Message Block Signing</span></a><span>.</span></li><li><span>Require Kerberos authentication by hardening Universal Naming Convention (UNC). OSs such as Microsoft Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, and later automatically harden UNC for connections to the Microsoft Active Directory domain via SYSVOL and NETLOGON shares. Additionally, network administrators can manually configure UNC hardening for servers and shares in any supported Microsoft Windows operating system. For more information, refer to Microsoft’s &nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/topic/ms15-011-vulnerability-in-group-policy-could-allow-remote-code-execution-february-10-2015-91b4bda2-945d-455b-ebbb-01d1ec191328" title="Vulnerability could allow remote code execution"><span>Vulnerability in Group Policy could allow remote code execution</span></a><span>.

Microsoft Windows 11, Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition, and Android clients with a third-party SMB client support use of SMB over QUIC, an alternative for SMB over TCP. The QUIC protocol is always Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 encrypted and uses certificate authentication to encapsulate all SMB traffic—including SMB’s own authentication—inside a VPN-like transport. SMB over QUIC allows mobile users to safely connect over the public internet to edge SMB resources, such as servers at the edge of organizational networks not completely behind a firewall, but also works on internal networks that require the highest SMB transport security.

The authoring organizations recommend using a centrally managed antivirus solution. This enables detection of both “precursor” malware and ransomware.&nbsp;<ul><li>A ransomware infection may be evidence of a previous, unresolved network compromise. For example, many ransomware infections are the result of existing malware infections, such as QakBot, Bumblebee, and Emotet.&nbsp;</li><li>In some cases, ransomware deployment is the last step in a network compromise and is dropped to obscure previous post-compromise activities, such as business email compromise (BEC).&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Use application allowlisting and/or endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions</strong> on all assets to ensure that only authorized software is executable and all unauthorized software is blocked.&nbsp;<ul><li>For Windows, enable Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC), AppLocker, or both on all systems that support these features.&nbsp;<ul><li>WDAC is under continuous development while AppLocker will only receive security fixes. AppLocker can be used as a complement to WDAC, when WDAC is set to the most restrictive level possible, and AppLocker is used to fine-tune restrictions for your organization.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Use allowlisting rather than attempting to list and deny every possible permutation of applications in a network environment.&nbsp;</li><li>Consider implementing EDR for cloud-based resources.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Consider implementing an intrusion detection system (IDS)</strong> to detect command and control activity and other potentially malicious network activity that occurs prior to ransomware deployment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>Ensure that the IDS is centrally monitored and managed. Properly configure the tools and route warnings and indicators to the appropriate personnel for action.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Monitor indicators of activity and block malware file creation with the Windows Sysmon utility.</strong> As of Sysmon 14, the FileBlockExecutable option can be used to block the creation of malicious executables, Dynamic Link Library (DLL) files, and system files that match specific hash values.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4><em><strong>Initial Access Vector: Advanced Forms of Social Engineering&nbsp;</strong></em></h4><ul><li><strong>Create policies to include cybersecurity awareness training</strong> about advanced forms of social engineering for personnel that have access to your network. Training should include tips on being able to recognize illegitimate websites and search results. It is also important to repeat security awareness training regularly to keep your staff informed and vigilant.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Implement Protective Domain Name System (DNS)</strong>. By blocking malicious internet activity at the source, Protective DNS services can provide high network security for remote workers. These security services analyze DNS queries and take action to mitigate threats—such as malware, ransomware, phishing attacks, viruses, malicious sites, and spyware—leveraging the existing DNS protocol and architecture. SLTT’s can implement the no-cost MDBR service.

MSPs have been an infection vector for ransomware impacting numerous client organizations [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" title="CPG 1.I" rel="noreferrer noopener">CPG 1.I</a>].&nbsp;<ul><li>If a third party or MSP is responsible for maintaining and securing your organization’s backups, ensure they are following the applicable best practices outlined above. Use contract language to formalize your security requirements as a best practice.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Ensure the use of least privilege and separation of duties when setting up the access of third parties</strong>. Third parties and MSPs should only have access to devices and servers that are within their role or responsibilities.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Consider creating service control policies (SCP) for cloud-based resources to prevent users or roles, organization wide, from being able to access specific services or take specific actions within services.</strong> For example, the SCP can be used to restrict users from being able to delete logs, update virtual private cloud (VPC) configurations, and change log configurations.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2><span>General Best Practices and Hardening Guidance</span></h2><ul><li><span><strong>Ensure your organization has a comprehensive asset management</strong> approach [</span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf"><span>CPG 1.A</span></a><span>].</span><ul><li><span>Understand and take inventory of your organization’s IT assets, logical (e.g., data, software) and physical (e.g., hardware).</span></li><li><span>Know which data or systems are most critical for health and safety, revenue generation, or other critical services, and understand any associated interdependencies (e.g., “system list ‘A’ used to perform ‘X’ is stored in critical asset ‘B’”).

The authoring organizations strongly recommend responding by using the following checklist. Be sure to move through the <strong>first three steps in sequence</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Detection and Analysis&nbsp;</h3><p>Refer to the best practices and references below to help manage the risk posed by ransomware and support your organization’s coordinated and efficient response to a ransomware incident. Apply these practices to the greatest extent possible based on availability of organizational resources.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Determine which systems were impacted, and immediately isolate them.</strong>&nbsp;<ul><li>If several systems or subnets appear impacted, take the network offline at the switch level. It may not be feasible to disconnect individual systems during an incident.&nbsp;</li><li>Prioritize isolating critical systems that are essential to daily operations.&nbsp;</li><li>If taking the network temporarily offline is not immediately possible, locate the network cable (e.g., ethernet) and unplug affected devices from the network or remove them from Wi-Fi to contain the infection.&nbsp;</li><li>For cloud resources, take a snapshot of volumes to get a point in time copy for reviewing later for forensic investigation.&nbsp;</li><li>After an initial compromise, malicious actors may monitor your organization’s activity or communications to understand if their actions have been detected. Isolate systems in a coordinated manner and use out-of-band communication methods such as phone calls to avoid tipping off actors that they have been discovered and that mitigation actions are being undertaken. Not doing so could cause actors to move laterally to preserve their access or deploy ransomware widely prior to networks being taken offline.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Power down devices if you are unable to disconnect them from the network to avoid further spread of the ransomware infection.</strong>&nbsp;<ul><li><strong>Note:</strong> This step will prevent your organization from maintaining ransomware infection artifacts and potential evidence stored in volatile memory. <strong>It should be carried out only if it is not possible to temporarily shut down the network or disconnect affected hosts from the network</strong> using other means.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Triage impacted systems for restoration and recovery.</strong>&nbsp;<ul><li>Identify and prioritize critical systems for restoration on a clean network and confirm the nature of data housed on impacted systems.&nbsp;<ul><li>Prioritize restoration and recovery based on a predefined critical asset list that includes information systems critical for health and safety, revenue generation, or other critical services, as well as systems they depend on.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Keep track of systems and devices that are not perceived to be impacted so they can be deprioritized for restoration and recovery. This enables your organization to get back to business in a more efficient manner.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Examine existing organizational detection or prevention systems (e.g., antivirus, EDR, IDS, Intrusion Prevention System) and logs.</strong> Doing so can highlight evidence of additional systems or malware involved in earlier stages of the attack.&nbsp;<ul><li>Look for evidence of precursor “dropper” malware, such as Bumblebee, Dridex, Emotet, QakBot, or Anchor. A ransomware event may be evidence of a previous, unresolved network compromise.&nbsp;<ul><li>Operators of these advanced malware variants will often sell access to a network. Malicious actors will sometimes use this access to exfiltrate data and then threaten to release the data publicly before ransoming the network to further extort the victim and pressure them into paying.&nbsp;</li><li><span>Malicious actors often drop ransomware variants to obscure post-compromise activity. Care must be taken to identify such dropper malware before rebuilding from backups to prevent continuing compromises.&nbsp;</span></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Confer with your team to develop and document an initial understanding of what has occurred based on initial analysis.</strong>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Initiate threat hunting activities.</strong>&nbsp;<ul><li>For enterprise environments, check for:&nbsp;<ul><li>Newly created AD accounts or accounts with escalated privileges and recent activity related to privileged accounts such as Domain Admins.&nbsp;</li><li>Anomalous VPN device logins or other suspicious logins.&nbsp;</li><li>Endpoint modifications that may impair backups, shadow copy, disk journaling, or boot configurations. Look for anomalous usage of built-in Windows tools such as bcdedit.exe, fsutil.exe (deletejournal), vssadmin.exe, wbadmin.exe, and wmic.exe (shadowcopy or shadowstorage). Misuse of these tools is a common ransomware technique to inhibit system recovery.&nbsp;</li><li>Signs of the presence of Cobalt Strike beacon/client. <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/software/S0154/" target="_blank" title="Cobalt Strike" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cobalt Strike</a> is a commercial penetration testing software suite. Malicious actors often name Cobalt Strike Windows processes with the same names as legitimate Windows processes to obfuscate their presence and complicate investigations.&nbsp;</li><li>Signs of any unexpected usage of remote monitoring and management (RMM) software (including portable executables that are not installed). RMM software is commonly used by malicious actors to maintain persistence.&nbsp;</li><li>Any unexpected PowerShell execution or use of PsTools suite.&nbsp;</li><li>Signs of enumeration of AD and/or LSASS credentials being dumped (e.g., <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/software/S0002/" target="_blank" title="Mimikatz" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mimikatz</a> or NTDSutil.exe).&nbsp;</li><li>Signs of unexpected endpoint-to-endpoint (including servers) communications.&nbsp;</li><li>Potential signs of data being exfiltrated from the network, which may include:&nbsp;</li><li><span>Abnormal amount of data outgoing over any port. Open source software can tunnel data over various ports and protocols. For example, ransomware actors have used </span><a href="https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/tree/master" title="Chisel"><span>Chisel</span></a><span> to tunnel Secure Shell (SSH) over HTTPS port </span><span class="TechTextChar">443</span><span>. Ransomware actors have also used </span><a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared" title="Cloudflared"><span>Cloudflared</span></a><span> to abuse Cloudflare tunnels to tunnel communications over HTTPS.</span></li><li>Common tools for data exfiltration include <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/software/S1040/" target="_blank" title="Rclone" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rclone</a>, Rsync, various web-based file storage services (also used by threat actors to implant malware/tools on the affected network), and FTP/SFTP.&nbsp;</li><li>Newly created services, unexpected scheduled tasks, unexpected software installed, etc.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>For cloud environments:&nbsp;<ul><li>Enable tools to detect and prevent modifications to IAM, network security, and data protection resources.&nbsp;</li><li>Use automation to detect common issues (e.g., disabling features, introduction of new firewall rules) and take automated actions as soon as they occur. For example, if a new firewall rule is created that allows open traffic (0.0.0.0/0), an automated action can be taken to disable or delete this rule and send notifications to the user that created it as well as the security team for awareness. This will help avoid alert fatigue and allow security personnel to focus on critical issues.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Reporting and Notification&nbsp;</h3><p><strong>Note:</strong> Refer to the Contact Information section at the end of this guide for details on how to report and notify about ransomware incidents.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Follow notification requirements as outlined in your cyber incident response and communications plan to <strong>engage internal and external teams and stakeholders</strong> with an understanding of what they can provide to help you mitigate, respond to, and recover from the incident.&nbsp;<ul><li>Share the information you have at your disposal to receive timely and relevant assistance. Keep management and senior leaders informed via regular updates as the situation develops. Relevant stakeholders may include your IT department, managed security service providers, cyber insurance company, and departmental or elected leaders [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" title="CPG 4.A" rel="noreferrer noopener">CPG 4.A</a>].&nbsp;</li><li>Report the incident to—and consider requesting assistance from—CISA, your local FBI field office, the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), or your local U.S. Secret Service field office.&nbsp;</li><li>As appropriate, coordinate with communications and public information personnel to ensure accurate information is shared internally with your organization and externally with the public.</li></ul></li><li>If the incident resulted in a data breach, <strong>follow notification requirements as outlined in your cyber incident response and communications plans</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Containment and Eradication&nbsp;</h3><p><strong>If no initial mitigation actions appear possible:</strong>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Take a system image and memory capture of a sample of affected devices (e.g., workstations, servers, virtual servers, and cloud servers)</strong>. Collect any relevant logs as well as samples of any “precursor” malware binaries and associated observables or indicators of compromise (e.g., suspected command and control IP addresses, suspicious registry entries, or other relevant files detected). The contacts below may be able to assist you in performing these tasks.&nbsp;<ul><li>Preserve evidence that is highly volatile in nature—or limited in retention—to prevent loss or tampering (e.g., system memory, Windows Security logs, data in firewall log buffers).&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Consult federal law enforcement, even if mitigation actions are possible, regarding possible decryptors available</strong>, as security researchers may have discovered encryption flaws for some ransomware variants and released decryption or other types of tools.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>To continue steps to contain and mitigate the incident:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Research trusted guidance</strong> (e.g., published by sources such as the U.S. Government, MS-ISAC, or a reputable security vendor) for the particular ransomware variant and follow any additional recommended steps to identify and contain systems or networks that are confirmed to be impacted.&nbsp;<ul><li>Kill or disable the execution of known ransomware binaries; this will minimize damage and impact to your systems. Delete other known associated registry values and files.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Identify the systems and accounts involved in the initial breach.</strong> This can include email accounts.&nbsp;</li><li>Based on the breach or compromise details determined above, <strong>contain associated systems that may be used for further or continued unauthorized access.</strong> Breaches often involve mass credential exfiltration. Securing networks and other information sources from continued credential-based unauthorized access may include:&nbsp;<ul><li>Disable virtual private networks, remote access servers, single sign-on resources, and cloud-based or other public-facing assets.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>If server-side data is being encrypted by an infected workstation, <strong>follow server-side data encryption quick identification steps.</strong>&nbsp;<ul><li>Review Computer Management &gt; Sessions and Open Files lists on associated servers to determine the user or system accessing those files.&nbsp;</li><li>Review file properties of encrypted files or ransom notes to identify specific users that may be associated with file ownership.&nbsp;</li><li>Review the TerminalServices-RemoteConnectionManager event log to check for successful RDP network connections.&nbsp;</li><li>Review the Windows Security log, SMB event logs, and related logs that may identify significant authentication or access events.&nbsp;</li><li>Run packet capture software, such as Wireshark, on the impacted server with a filter to identify IP addresses involved in actively writing or renaming files (e.g., smb2.filename contains cryptxxx).&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Conduct extended analysis to identify outside-in and inside-out persistence mechanisms.&nbsp;</strong><ul><li>Outside-in persistence may include authenticated access to external systems via rogue accounts, backdoors on perimeter systems, exploitation of external vulnerabilities, etc.&nbsp;</li><li>Inside-out persistence may include malware implants on the internal network or a variety of living-off-the-land style modifications (e.g., use of commercial penetration testing tools like Cobalt Strike; use of PsTools suite, including PsExec, to remotely install and control malware and gather information regarding—or perform remote management of—Windows systems; use of PowerShell scripts).&nbsp;</li><li>Identification may involve deployment of EDR solutions, audits of local and domain accounts, examination of data found in centralized logging systems, or deeper forensic analysis of specific systems once movement within the environment has been mapped out.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Rebuild systems based on prioritization of critical services</strong> (e.g., health and safety or revenue-generating services), using pre-configured standard images, if possible. Use infrastructure as code templates to rebuild cloud resources.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Issue password resets for all affected systems and address any associated vulnerabilities and gaps in security or visibility</strong> once the environment has been fully cleaned and rebuilt, including any associated impacted accounts and the removal or remediation of malicious persistence mechanisms. This can include applying patches, upgrading software, and taking other security precautions not previously taken. Update customer-managed encryption keys as needed.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The designated IT or IT security authority declares the ransomware incident over</strong> based on established criteria, which may include taking the steps above or seeking outside assistance.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Recovery and Post Incident Activity</h3><ul><li><strong>Reconnect systems and restore data from offline, encrypted backups based on a prioritization of critical services.</strong><ul><li>Take care not to re-infect clean systems during recovery. For example, if a new Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) has been created for recovery purposes, ensure only clean systems are added.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Document lessons learned from the incident and associated response activities</strong> to inform updates to—and refine—organizational policies, plans, and procedures and guide future exercises of the same.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Consider sharing lessons learned and relevant indicators of compromise with CISA or your sector ISAC</strong> to benefit others within the community.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Contact Information&nbsp;</h2><p>In responding to any cyber incident, Federal agencies will undertake threat response; asset response; and intelligence support and related activities.&nbsp;</p><h4>What You Can Expect:&nbsp;</h4><ul><li>Specific guidance to help evaluate and remediate ransomware incidents.&nbsp;</li><li>Remote assistance to identify the extent of the compromise and recommendations for appropriate containment and mitigation strategies (dependent on specific ransomware variant).&nbsp;</li><li>Phishing email, storage media, log, and malware analysis based on voluntary submission. Full-disk forensics can be performed on an as-needed basis.&nbsp;</li><li>Assistance in conducting a criminal investigation, which may involve collecting incident artifacts, including system images and malware samples.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Federal Asset Response Contacts&nbsp;</h3><p>Upon voluntary request, federal asset response includes furnishing technical assistance to affected entities to protect their assets, mitigate vulnerabilities, and reduce impacts of cyber incidents; identifying other entities that may be at risk and assessing their risk to the same or similar vulnerabilities; assessing potential risks to the sector or region, including potential cascading effects, and developing courses of action to mitigate these risks; facilitating information sharing and operational coordination with threat response; and providing guidance on how best to utilize Federal resources and capabilities in a timely, effective manner to speed recovery.&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td><span><strong>CISA:</strong></span></td><td><p><a href="https://cisa.gov/report"><span>cisa.gov/report</span></a></p><p><a href="mailto:Central@cisa.gov"><span>Central@cisa.gov</span></a><span> or call </span><span class="ui-provider ed axx axy axz aya ayb ayc ayd aye ayf ayg ayh ayi ayj ayk ayl aym ayn ayo ayp ayq ayr ays ayt ayu ayv ayw ayx ayy ayz aza azb azc azd aze" dir="ltr">1-844-Say-CISA (1-844-729-2472)</span></p><p><span>Cybersecurity Advisor (</span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cisa-regions"><span>cisa.gov/cisa-regions</span></a><span>): [Enter your local CISA CSA’s phone number and email address.]</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><span><strong>MS-ISAC:</strong></span></td><td><span>For SLTTs, email </span><a href="mailto:soc@msisac.org"><span>soc@msisac.org</span></a><span> or call (866) 787-4722</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Federal Threat Response Contacts&nbsp;</h3><p>Upon voluntary request, or upon notification of partners, federal threat response includes conducting appropriate law enforcement and national security investigative activity at the affected entity’s site; collecting evidence and gathering intelligence; providing attribution; linking related incidents; identifying additional affected entities; identifying threat pursuit and disruption opportunities; developing and executing courses of action to mitigate the immediate threat; and facilitating information sharing and operational coordination with asset response.&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>FBI:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</td><td><p><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices" target="_blank" title="FBI Field Offices" rel="noreferrer noopener">fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices</a> [Enter your local FBI field office POC phone number and email address.]&nbsp;</p><p><span>FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at ic3.gov</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>USSS:&nbsp;</strong></td><td><a href="https://www.secretservice.gov/contact/field-offices/" target="_blank" title="Secret Service Field Offices" rel="noreferrer noopener">secretservice.gov/contact/field-offices/</a> [Enter your USSS field office POC phone number and email address.]&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Other Federal Response Contacts&nbsp;</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>NSA:</strong>&nbsp;</td><td><a href="https://www.nsa.gov/About/Cybersecurity-Collaboration-Center/" title="NSA: Cybersecurity Collaboration Center Services and Contact Information">Cybersecurity Collaboration Center Services and Contact Information</a>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Other Response Contacts&nbsp;</h3><p>Consider filling out Table 1 for use should your organization become affected by ransomware.
