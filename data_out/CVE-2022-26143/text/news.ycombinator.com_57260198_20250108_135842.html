If you look at where Cloudflare and some of the big clouds are going with their private networks, private backplanes, and "secure your traffic by putting it all over our network" zero trust plans it seems to be going that way. If open peering and the open Internet are to survive I think serious work needs to be done to fight DDOS attacks. It needs to be an effort analogous to the "war on spam" in the late 1990s / early 2000s. Unfortunately that war was sort of lost; e-mail is in practice barely an open protocol anymore and almost all e-mail is handled by a few giant companies that can leverage big data to filter spam. If you try to DIY a mail server you'll be simultaneously hit by spam and have to constantly fight mistaken filtration by larger e-mail providers who tend to distrust small mail servers by default. If the open Internet succumbs to DDOS "spam," we will lose something really huge and important. It would be the ultimate casualty of what so far has been almost a law (with very few exceptions): all open systems are destroyed by abuse if they become sufficiently popular. We also can't just leave it to the free market because the only solution the market will likely come up with is walled gardens. It's the easiest to engineer solution and the easiest to monetize. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [throw0101a](user?id=throw0101a) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614525)   | [parent](#30614371) | [next](#30617236) [–]  > *If you look at where Cloudflare and some of the big clouds are going with their private networks, private backplanes, and "secure your traffic by putting it all over our network" zero trust plans it seems to be going that way.* All the networks of the Internet are already private, just like the networks of AOL and CompuServe were private back in the day: your ISP's network is private, YouTube's network is private, AWS' network is private. It's just that those private networks agree to talk to each other. Otherwise your ISP would have to re-create YouTube and Reddit/forums and eBay/marketplace and…, and YouTube would have to buildout (inter)national network to connect their video services to people's homes. Just like AOL and CompuServe had to build out information services *and* a connectivity infrastructure back in the day. Now each of the previously walled gardens (messaging, forums, marketplaces, connectivity, etc) is done by its own entity, each taking a slice of the monetary pie for the service(s) they provide. The Internet is a 'network of networks', but it is also an agreement: an agreement for everyone to talk to everyone else. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [api](user?id=api) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614546)   | [root](#30614371) | [parent](#30614525) | [next](#30617236) [–]  I think that's kind of semantic.

I have managed my own e-mail server for around 20 years. Filtering spam has never been a problem. On the other hand your second problem has indeed existed, i.e. with various large e-mail providers which either blocked completely my e-mail messages without signalling any error, or they delayed for 1 day or 2 my messages, or they required many resendings of a message until really passing it to the destination. Fortunately such cases seem to have become much more seldom during the last couple of years. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [wiredfool](user?id=wiredfool) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30617425)   | [root](#30614371) | [parent](#30617236) | [next](#30614707) [–]  I've seen hideously inconvenient email pauses between Office365 and a massive NGO, so it's not just little mail servers. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [smasher164](user?id=smasher164) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614707)   | [parent](#30614371) | [prev](#30617236) | [next](#30614197) [–]  It's interesting that you say that, because we've already sort of balkanized around ISPs. However, CDNs and DDOS protection popped up around services that ISPs couldn't provide.

This seems like it would exceed that in many cases, since 1 byte in => 4.2 gigabytes out. Which is roughly 33.6 gbps. Not sure many of these vulnerable boxes actually have that amount of outbound bandwidth to utilize. (Please feel free to correct my quick math if I messed it up) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jwilk](user?id=jwilk) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614372)   | [root](#30614132) | [parent](#30614187) | [next](#30614168) [–]  Why do you want to send everything in one second? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nathanyz](user?id=nathanyz) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614974)   | [root](#30614132) | [parent](#30614372) | [next](#30614168) [–]  This is a good point, but then you need more boxes to perform the DDOS as the reason they are effective is overwhelming the packets per second or bandwidth per second of the receiving networks. So it definitely does allow for a sustained attack by a single box with limited outbound bandwidth, but that blunts the usual reasoning for why the amplification is so dangerous. Another interesting impact of this is that the higher the amplification, the more likely it is noticeable by the server that is being abused. I mean if you clog the outbound network for a company they will notice and try to resolve immediately. Versus some milder amplification where it can go under the radar, or at least the business impact urgency radar of a company much longer. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pickledcods](user?id=pickledcods) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614168)   | [root](#30614132) | [parent](#30614147) | [prev](#30614187) | [next](#30618064) [–]  because that value is a physical limit | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [black\_puppydog](user?id=black_puppydog) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614199)   | [root](#30614132) | [parent](#30614168) | [next](#30618064) [–]  How so?

Once that hits, the device would then be sending the traffic harmlessly to /dev/null for the next 14 hours and be unavailable for attacks. Not sure about the legal and ethical implications of that. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [londons\_explore](user?id=londons_explore) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614174)   | [prev](#30624365) | [next](#30620812) [–]  Tracking down these systems is easy, so these issues can normally be solved pretty easily. Thats because typically any amplification vector doesn't allow the source IP of the amplifier to be spoofed. So as soon as a DDoS attack begins, a sample of the packets can be taken to get a list of the amplifiers used. Those can then be tracked down and patched to no longer act as amplifiers. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sp332](user?id=sp332) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614215)   | [parent](#30614174) | [next](#30615610) [–]  It could be easily solved by the operator, but that doesn't mean it's easy for the victims to get the operators to fix their stuff. These amplifiers are already run by people who ignored the software manufacturer's directions. What are the odds they will actually install the new version that's harder to abuse? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [amalcon](user?id=amalcon) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614644)   | [root](#30614174) | [parent](#30614215) | [next](#30615610) [–]  Usually[0] contacting the operator's ISP and informing them of the situation will get said ISP to contact said operator. All that outbound traffic does represent a cost to the ISP, after all. A call from your ISP usually gets a bit more respect than a call from some random person.

Surprisingly enough, the ISP often has no real way of contacting anyone; the easiest is to cut the connection and wait for a complaint. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [autoexec](user?id=autoexec) [on March 10, 2022](item?id=30625120)   | [root](#30614174) | [parent](#30614998) | [next](#30616129) [–]  Yep. Sad but true. Nobody bothers to keep their contact info up to date with their ISP it seems.

After spending some time trying to get phishing sources taken down and not getting anywhere, I wouldn't be hopeful about DDoS (reflection) sources being taken down either. When I was running servers that were getting DDoSed frequently (but thankfully for short intervals and not with tons of bandwidth), trying to get chargen servers or wordpress servers fixed didn't even seem like an option. Just make sure *my* servers wouldn't fall over, or at least would fall over gracefully. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [treesknees](user?id=treesknees) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30615610)   | [parent](#30614174) | [prev](#30614215) | [next](#30614307) [–]  Your comment underestimates the task of remediation. Sure, we can very easily get a list of DDoS source IP addresses. Any decent network operator can get a list of flows matching some DDoS criteria and generate a report of IP addresses. In the case of this TP240 attack, you're talking about ~2600 independent businesses across the world. Assuming you are able to determine the actual source of the traffic and work with a vendor to patch it, you're still tasked with somehow getting 2600 businesses to patch their systems or modify firewall rules. In the case of the memcached amplification attack, Cloudflare saw upwards of 5800 source IPs in the attacks, and Shodan reported nearly 88000 IPs responding on port 11211 [1]. Tracking down the owners of 88k installations across public clouds, businesses, probably some residential networks, is a monumental task. There's nothing easy about it.

Assuming you are able to determine the actual source of the traffic and work with a vendor to patch it, you're still tasked with somehow getting 2600 businesses to patch their systems or modify firewall rules. You can be sure that by only null-routing their entire C-class, adjacent customers will loudly complain to the operator who will quickly identify the source and disconnect it. The best way to deploy fixes on the net has always been to first disconnect them. This way you don't have to convince anyone, it's done the other way around. Typically the CEO will instantly throw all the phones to the trash to get the net opened again. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [treesknees](user?id=treesknees) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30617634)   | [root](#30614174) | [parent](#30617154) | [next](#30614307) [–]  In general that's not really an option. Unless you have coordination with the network operators on which those amplifiers are sitting, your null-routing of the amplifier in your own network isn't going to stop it from attacking other targets. If the amplifier is something like a DNS server, then your collateral damage isn't just "adjacent customers", it's potentially thousands of other users and resolvers on your own network. If those amplifiers are on a cloud service provider like AWS, you're going to potentially inflict even more pain onto your own paying customers who will no longer be able to communicate with AWS. You will essentially perform the DoS they were aiming for. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [LinuxBender](user?id=LinuxBender) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614307)   | [parent](#30614174) | [prev](#30615610) | [next](#30617532) [–]  Let's get started!

You are liable unless you can pass off that liability to someone else. So the ISP would be liable by default, and would have an incentive to filter their customers, or require them to abide by certain rules, pass some audits, provide proof of insurance or post a large deposit. You could have insurers who in exchange of automated security scans will insure you, solving the problem for end-users at a reasonable cost. This will actually encourage internet users (both consumers and businesses) to take security more seriously. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hombre\_fatal](user?id=hombre_fatal) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30619800)   | [root](#30614174) | [parent](#30617532) | [next](#30614201) [–]  Litigation seems too heavy handed for these kinds of attacks. A major issue here is how your smart toaster or MiVoice box can be spamming the internet and there's no real way to realize it for most people. Since you pitched a controversial solution, let me make one that's probably even more controversial: maybe bandwidth is too cheap.

When DES was developed and standardized in 1976, the NSA had input in selecting some of the constants that were chosen for it [0]. It wasn't until the late 80s when independent development of differential cryptanalysis [1] came out, and people realized that the DES constants were deliberately chosen to be resistant to this attack. The NSA has since turned away from this responsibility, and has done the exact opposite. When Dual\_EC\_DRBG was developed [2], there was a similar choice of constants, with the final values having been chosen by the NSA. In this case, rather than protecting against a attack method known only by the NSA, the constants were chosen to allow an attack method known only by the NSA.

But should they be expected to defend against counterfeit currency made with state-level resources, such as supernotes with the same paper, ink, printing process and security features, where there's no guarantee that *any* reasonable detection method will work?

There's a difference between "foreign citizen action" and "foreign government action". If another government comes to your territory, to break your laws and deprive one of your businesses of their property or rights, that's a big deal.

The equivalent would be if Walmart was expected to protect itself while a foreign governments special forces raided their stores. Of course I'm not sure that's how it's playing out anyway, as I'm certain that the relevant three letter agencies are interested in foreign state actors digital incursions, it's just a very delicate situation and not as simple or clear cut as the Walmart example. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jameshart](user?id=jameshart) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30615259)   | [root](#30614189) | [parent](#30614255) | [prev](#30614602) | [next](#30614693) [–]  Honestly, ignoring the state actor part of this, even if a bunch of local kids run up and graffiti the outside of a Walmart, I don't think we tend to regard it as a fundamental failure of Walmart's duty to secure their business, or a failure of their architects and security staff to do basic diligence or follow best practices to allow it to happen. It's just a criminal act, of which Walmart are the victim, and it's the state's job to find and prosecute and deter that kind of thing from happening again. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [theamk](user?id=theamk) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614693)   | [root](#30614189) | [parent](#30614255) | [prev](#30615259) | [next](#30614299) [–]  I am pretty sure that it does not matter who stole the soda - North Koreans or locals.

There is no \_must\_ here. The police \_must\_ deter and punish crime. A private entity \_may\_ hire security if they find the police to be ineffective at stopping certain crimes.

There are organizations like CISA and NIST that do a lot of work to help prevent attacks, and the FBI and DOJ do a lot of investigate and enforcement work after the fact.

We also have a tendency to conflate the requirements on software systems with respect to security threats as being somewhat similar to the requirements on other kinds of engineering with respect to safety and environmental threats, and I think that does a disservice to the vastly different scope of responsibility involved. When I see people arguing that software engineers need to treat security as seriously as, say civil engineers treat structural stability when designing a bridge, or mechanical engineers treat vehicle crash safety, I agree to an extent, but I also think it’s worth considering: Most bridges are not designed to actually survive being deliberately attacked with the kinds of weapons nation states can bring to bear on them. When militaries get involved, bridges tend to fail. Likewise, civilian car safety testing does not make cars that are able to survive attacks that nation state actors can carry out with things like tanks, mines, or drones. We need to be realistic in our expectations for what level of military threat civilian systems can reasonably be expected to deal with unaided. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kevincox](user?id=kevincox) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614246)   | [parent](#30614189) | [prev](#30614669) | [next](#30616709) [–]  While your logic is solid and I do think this would be ideal I struggle to see how this would work. Dropping bombs on a walmart store is clearly unwelcome, sending traffic to walmart's website? Much less clear. You can guess based on the traffic pattern but the only way to really know is to ask walmart if this is welcome traffic (not just a burst because some new product came out). Especially since many cases are DoS with encrypted TLS traffic that looks much like any other traffic to an outside observer. However much of the protection is threat of retaliation ("if you drop bombs on us we will flatten your country"). So maybe that is the solution here, the government should treat these attacks as real threats and punish those responsible. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [marcosdumay](user?id=marcosdumay) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30614373)   | [root](#30614189) | [parent](#30614246) | [next](#30616709) [–]  Well, a government could start by mandating that internet peers authenticate their packages, and cutting the access of bad actors.

It provides the first part of my post, authenticating the packages. The second part is cutting out misbehaving connections.

In that context instantly jumping to "state-sponsored!" strikes me not only as a needless, but particularly *dangerous* escalation. It's like people forget that "cyber" is most of all asymmetrical and attribution is usually more of a guessing game than an exact science.

In the physical world a military can observe an attack, can announce that it is not cool, and can drive a tank through most intruders. Now ask yourself this question, would you like to give your military the full access to your infrastructure together with command and control capabilities to do with your devices and the software on them as it pleases according to the situation? If you actually think that in fact you are not okay with 24/7 monitoring and management from a centralized government institution, you should own up to your desires and get your defense together. Of course, this is a simplistic and extreme scenario. Much of the missed part is about availability and basic institutional capability for military cyber operations, but the fundamental question is: when one demands something from the government, what exactly they wish to give up as a consequence of the proposed solution. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [YetAnotherNick](user?id=YetAnotherNick) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30615051)   | [parent](#30614189) | [prev](#30614405) | [next](#30614910) [–]  Yes, it's walmart responsibility to protect their customers. It's their responsibility that their supply chain is not hacked to say distribute poison, it's their responsibility that the cameras they use in store are theirs and only they have access, it's their responsibility that the card I use in their terminal is safe.

We definitely need laws to hold companies accountable for their IT-related activity. For one, we need to hold commercial vendors accountable - that means especially to refuse to provide security updates for the reasonably expected life time of a piece of software or hardware. But especially, we need the companies using IT systems to be held accountable. The magic word is "defense in depth" - the scenario of the post we're talking about is a piece of equipment that was not supposed to be reachable from the Internet and despite that knowledge it *was* made accessible to the Internet. Seriously, *anyone* caught exposing dangerous stuff to Shodan should be fined to hell and back.
