Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the patches:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing NULL check on the `set_output_gamma` function pointer within the `dcn20_set_output_transfer_func` function in the AMD display driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The `set_output_gamma` function pointer was being dereferenced without a proper NULL check at line 1048 of `dcn20_hwseq.c`. Although there was a check at line 1030 it did not prevent the dereference later if the pointer was null. If `set_output_gamma` happened to be NULL, this would lead to a null pointer dereference, resulting in a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System Crash:** A null pointer dereference would lead to a system crash or other undefined behavior, potentially leading to a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability exists within the AMD display driver. Therefore, an attacker would need to trigger the execution of the vulnerable code path within `dcn20_set_output_transfer_func` where `set_output_gamma` is NULL. This would likely involve manipulating display-related settings or configurations, but specific steps to achieve this are not detailed in the provided content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access/Control:** The attacker would need some level of local access or control to manipulate the display settings. The attacker does not need to be a privileged user to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Trigger:** The attacker needs some knowledge of how to manipulate the display subsystem to trigger the code path where the `set_output_gamma` function pointer is NULL.

**Additional Notes:**
- The patch adds a null check before the call to `set_output_gamma` at line 1048, ensuring the function pointer is valid before dereferencing it. This prevents the potential null pointer dereference.
- The patch is applied across multiple stable branches of the Linux kernel.
