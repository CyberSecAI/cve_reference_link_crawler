Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2023-24496**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization when handling the `device_name` parameter in the `/Device_Auth` API of MilesightVPN. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via the `device_name` field.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The injected JavaScript code is stored in the `device` database table and is executed in the context of a user's browser when they access the device details page.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the `device_name` before storing it in the database.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the context of the MilesightVPN web interface, meaning that an attacker can hijack admin sessions, access sensitive data, perform actions on behalf of admin user, or further compromise the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/Device_Auth` API containing malicious Javascript code within the `device_name` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to know or retrieve (via CVE-2023-24497) the Authorization Code of the MilesightVPN server to successfully register a device using the vulnerable API.
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the /Device_Auth API

**CVE-2023-24497**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization when handling the `subnet` parameter in the `/Device_Auth` API of MilesightVPN. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via the `subnet` field.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Similar to CVE-2023-24496, the injected JavaScript code is stored in the database (`remote_subnet` field) and executed when a user views the device details page.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the `subnet` parameter before storing it in the database.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Arbitrary JavaScript code execution, leading to potential session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions within the web interface.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/Device_Auth` API containing malicious Javascript code within the `subnet` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker needs to know or retrieve (via CVE-2023-24497) the Authorization Code of the MilesightVPN server to successfully register a device using the vulnerable API.
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the /Device_Auth API

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is in the `requestHandlers.js` file within the `detail_device` function
* The device table displays the injected code, resulting in the XSS when the table is rendered by the web interface.
*   The report also references a related vulnerability, TALOS-2023-1702, which can be used to retrieve the Authorization Code required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The vendor did not release a patch within the 90-day disclosure window.
