- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unauthenticated user can trigger a fatal assertion in the MongoDB server while generating ftdc diagnostic metrics. This occurs because the server attempts to build a BSON object that exceeds certain memory sizes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reachable Assertion (CWE-617) due to uncontrolled resource consumption when creating BSON objects, which leads to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The server crashes, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely by causing the server to generate ftdc diagnostic metrics that consume too much memory when building BSON objects.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is required, and the attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely.

The provided content gives more details than the original CVE description, specifying the root cause as excessive memory usage when creating BSON objects during ftdc metrics generation, and specifying the affected versions.
