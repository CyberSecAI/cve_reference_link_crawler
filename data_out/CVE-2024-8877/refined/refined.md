{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization or validation when processing user-supplied parameters in HTTP requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can modify collected log data in an arbitrary way. This could lead to manipulation of energy measurement entries, possibly masking malicious activities or creating false readings.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP requests to specific endpoints (/cgi-bin/db_datalog_w.cgi, /cgi-bin/db_eventlog_w.cgi, and /cgi-bin/db_multimetr_w.cgi) with maliciously crafted SQL injection payloads in the query parameters."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, implying that the attack can originate from any network location that has access to the vulnerable device."
