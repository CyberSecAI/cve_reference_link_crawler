- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A memory corruption vulnerability exists while parsing specially crafted HTTP packets to the `/txtrace` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can crash the affected application, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted HTTP packets to the `/txtrace` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the affected device and the ability to send HTTP requests. No authentication is required (PR:N).
