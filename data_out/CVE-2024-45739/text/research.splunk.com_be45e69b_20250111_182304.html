# Detection: Splunk Sensitive Information Disclosure in DEBUG Logging Channels

Updated Date: 2024-10-17
ID: 93dc7182-c5da-4085-82ec-401abf33d623
Author: Rod Soto, Eric McGinnis, Splunk
[Type: Hunting](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

In Splunk versions 9.3, 9.2, 9.1, 9.1.5 Applications which have been enabled with logging level DEBUG may write sensitive information such as keys, tokens, or other sensitive strings into the internal index.

### Search

```
1`splunkd` log_level="DEBUG" AND component IN ("REST_Calls", "AdminManager", "JSONWebToken")
2
3| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by host splunk_server log_level component event_message
4
5| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
6
7| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
8
9| `splunk_sensitive_information_disclosure_in_debug_logging_channels_filter`

```
### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [security\_content\_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml) | `convert timeformat="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" ctime($field$)` |
| splunk\_sensitive\_information\_disclosure\_in\_debug\_logging\_channels\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_sensitive_information_disclosure_in_debug_logging_channels_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

Requires access to \_internal index. It is recommended to inventory and modify the search for specific apps that may have DEBUG logging enabled.

### Known False Positives

There will be false positives as not every message to the DEBUG log will expose sensitive information, such as keys or other secrets.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Possible sensitive credential information found via DEBUG logging in component $component$ at $host$ \_internal index | 45 | 50 | 90 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
