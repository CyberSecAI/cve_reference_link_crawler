Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Splunk Enterprise `AdminManager` logging channel potentially exposing plaintext passwords for local native authentication Splunk users when the logging level is set to DEBUG.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Plaintext passwords are written to log files when the `AdminManager` log channel is set to DEBUG, exposing the credentials of Splunk users. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege, as debug logs should not contain sensitive information.
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** While debug logging is intended for troubleshooting, if it's not properly managed or disabled after use, it can lead to a security vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Compromised User Accounts:** An attacker who gains access to the log files containing the plaintext passwords can use these credentials to access Splunk Enterprise with the compromised user's privileges.
- **Potential Lateral Movement:** Depending on the compromised user's role, an attacker may be able to further compromise the Splunk instance, other systems, or sensitive data.
- **Data Breach:** Access to Splunk could enable unauthorized access to the data it indexes and analyzes.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local File Access:** An attacker with local file system access to the Splunk server can read the log files and obtain the exposed passwords.
- **Administrative Index Access:** An attacker with administrative access to the Splunk `_internal` index can search through the log events stored there and obtain the exposed passwords.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local File System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to read files on the Splunk server's file system (where logs are stored).
- **Splunk Administrative Access:** The attacker needs administrative access (or equivalent privileges) to the Splunk instance, specifically the ability to search the `_internal` index which stores the log events.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.3.1, 9.2.3, and 9.1.6.
- The advisory provides remediation steps:
    1. Upgrade Splunk Enterprise to a patched version.
    2. Change the logging level for the `AdminManager` channel to a less verbose setting.
    3. Delete the affected log file: `$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log`
    4. Delete log entries from the `_internal` index using the command `index=_internal component=AdminManager | delete`
- A Splunk detection is also provided to find instances of sensitive information disclosure in debug log channels.
- The Splunk Security Content team has provided a detection which can be used to identify potentially sensitive data being written into the \_internal index. The detection looks for components such as REST\_Calls, AdminManager, and JSONWebToken.
