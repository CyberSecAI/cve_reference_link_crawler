This key is different for each new session, which protects it from brute force attacks. However, the ticket it contains is encrypted using the target principal key directly. For user principals, this key is a hash of a public per-principal randomly-generated salt and the user’s password. If a principal is compromised it means the attacker would be able to retrieve tickets encrypted to any principal, all of them being encrypted by their own key directly. By taking these tickets and salts offline, the attacker could run brute force attacks to find character strings able to decrypt tickets when combined to a principal salt (i.e. find the principal’s password). | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2270685#c0)  Rohit Keshri    2024-03-21 12:39:28 UTC  ``` A low-privileged user can obtain a hash of the passwords of all domain users and perform offline brute force (kerberoasting).  It was found that all users who have TGT Kerberos tickets can request TGS for another user's principal. And since the “krbPrincipalKey” value for users is created based on their password, kerberoasting attacks on TGS tickets are possible. A potential attacker can brute force the password by requesting TGS for other users.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2270685#c9)  Sandipan Roy    2024-06-10 13:16:33 UTC  ``` Created freeipa tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2291164](show_bug.cgi?id=2291164 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2024-3183 freeipa: user can obtain a hash of the passwords of all domain users and perform offline brute force [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2270685#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-06-10 13:53:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Advanced Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:3758 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3758](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3758)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2270685#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-06-10 13:59:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Advanced Mission Critical Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Update Services for SAP Solutions   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Telecommunications Update Service  Via RHSA-2024:3756 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3756](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3756)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2270685#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-06-10 14:06:40 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:3754 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3754](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3754)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2270685#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-06-10 14:17:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:3755 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3755](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3755)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=2270685#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-06-10 14:21:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:3759 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3759](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3759)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=2270685#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-06-10 14:44:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:3761 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3761](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3761)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=2270685#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-06-10 14:44:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:3757 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3757](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3757)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=2270685#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-06-10 15:03:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Advanced Mission Critical Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Update Services for SAP Solutions   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Telecommunications Update Service  Via RHSA-2024:3775 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3775](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3775)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=2270685#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-06-10 15:30:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2024:3760 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3760](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3760)   ``` |  |
