{
  "CVE-2024-3183": {
    "Root cause": "The ticket contained in a Kerberos TGS-REQ is encrypted with the target principal key, which for user principals, is a hash of a per-principal salt and the user's password. If a principal is compromised, tickets encrypted to any principal using the target principal key could be retrieved.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The Kerberos TGS-REQ ticket is encrypted using the target principal key which is derived from the user's password and a salt.",
      "User principal keys are derived from user passwords making them vulnerable to brute force attacks."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker, by gaining access to a principal could retrieve tickets encrypted to any principal, all encrypted by their own key. Taking these tickets and salts offline, the attacker could brute force the password by attempting to decrypt the tickets with a password candidate combined with a user's specific salt.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Compromise of a principal to retrieve tickets",
      "Offline brute force attack on retrieved tickets using known salt values."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must gain access to a principal to retrieve the encrypted tickets and corresponding salt. User password must be weak to facilitate successful brute-force attack."
