Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8479

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's use of `add_filter('comment_text', 'do_shortcode')`, which executes all shortcodes present within comments. This function is called for every comment that is displayed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthenticated Arbitrary Shortcode Execution:** The primary vulnerability is that the plugin allows unauthenticated users to inject and execute arbitrary shortcodes by including them in a comment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can exploit this by injecting malicious shortcodes within comments, leading to a variety of impacts, including:
    - Unauthorized actions
    - Data exfiltration
    - Website compromise, depending on which shortcodes are present on the target website
    - Further attacks on the server and/or users

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is triggered when a comment containing a shortcode is submitted and displayed by the vulnerable plugin.
-  The attacker does not need any privileges or account on the target website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit a comment on the vulnerable website.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was present in versions 1.2 and 1.3 of the Simple Spoiler plugin.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.4 by changing `add_filter( 'comment_text', 'do_shortcode' );` to `add_filter( 'comment_text', 'do_shortcodes_in_comment', 11, 2 );`, which includes a check for comment type and limits which shortcodes are processed within comments.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Francesco Carlucci.
