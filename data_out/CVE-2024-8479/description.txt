The The Simple Spoiler plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in versions 1.2 to 1.3. This is due to the plugin adding the filter add_filter('comment_text', 'do_shortcode'); which will run all shortcodes in comments. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.
