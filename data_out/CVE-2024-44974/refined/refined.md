{
  "CVE-2024-44974": [
    {
      "Root cause": "The `select_local_address()` and `select_signal_address()` functions in the MPTCP module select an endpoint entry from a list within an RCU-protected section but return a reference to it. This reference might be dereferenced after the RCU unlock, leading to a Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Use-After-Free"
      ],
      "Impact": "A Use-After-Free vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service if exploited by an attacker.",
       "Attack vectors": "An attacker could trigger the vulnerability by creating a scenario that causes the endpoint entry to be freed while a reference to it is still being used after the RCU unlock.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker would need the ability to trigger the vulnerable code paths in the MPTCP module. This might require some control over the network configuration or the ability to manipulate the creation of subflows."
    },
    {
      "Root cause": "The functions `select_local_address` and `select_signal_address` return a reference to an endpoint entry after reading it within an RCU protected section. If this reference is used after the RCU unlock and the entry has been freed, it results in a use-after-free vulnerability.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Use-After-Free"
      ],
      "Impact": "Exploiting this UaF vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
        "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the conditions that cause a freed entry to be dereferenced after RCU unlock.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to trigger MPTCP path management functionality, which may require some network configuration or packet manipulation."
