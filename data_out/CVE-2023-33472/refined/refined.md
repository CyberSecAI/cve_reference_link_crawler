- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect access control in the "Event Handlers" feature of Scada-LTS allows low-privileged users to access and execute commands that should be restricted to administrative users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Privilege escalation: A low-privilege user can gain administrative-level control.
    - Command injection: User-supplied input is not properly sanitized, allowing execution of arbitrary commands on the server.
    - Improper access control: The application does not properly restrict access to the "Event Handlers" functionality based on user privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Remote code execution (RCE)
    - Arbitrary file read and write
    - Information leakage
    - Denial of service (DoS)
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Remote, requires network access to the affected Scada-LTS instance
    - Exploitation through the "Event Handlers" feature using a low-privilege user's session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be authenticated as a low-privileged user in the Scada-LTS application.
    - The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the server with a valid session cookie
