Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26729:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `Login_handler_func` function of the `spx_restservice`. This function handles user login requests to the web interface of the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC).
*   The function is susceptible to command injection and multiple stack-based buffer overflows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The function allows an attacker to inject arbitrary operating system commands.
*   **Multiple Stack-Based Buffer Overflows:**  The function is vulnerable to multiple stack-based buffer overflows due to lack of proper bounds checking when handling input, potentially overwriting stack memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An unauthenticated attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) with root privileges on the BMC.
*   Successful exploitation allows the attacker to completely compromise the BMC and gain control of the managed host.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network via HTTP requests to the web interface.
*   The attack targets the `Login_handler_func` function of `spx_restservice`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable BMC web interface.
*   No prior authentication is needed for exploitation (unauthenticated attacker).

**Technical Details:**

*   The `Login_handler_func` is part of the `spx_restservice` which handles API requests to the web interface. The web interface is part of the AMI MegaRAC SP-X firmware.
*   The specific way the command injection and stack buffer overflows occur in Login_handler_func is not fully described, but it is indicated to be caused by improper handling of input during the login process.

**Additional Notes:**

* The content provides more detail than the official CVE description, by pinpointing the vulnerable function, its location, and the nature of the vulnerabilities (command injection and stack-based buffer overflows), as well as showing the impact of a successful exploitation (RCE with root privileges on the BMC).
* The vulnerability is present in version 1.10.0 of the Lanner IAC-AST2500 BMC firmware.
* The document mentions a combination of CVE-2021-44467 and CVE-2021-26728 as an example of how an attacker can achieve RCE on a similar BMC interface, although this CVE focuses on a different function.
