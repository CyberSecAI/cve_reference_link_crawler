- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of DHCPv6 messages in the IPv6 DHCP (DHCPv6) client module.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation. Specifically, the software does not properly validate crafted DHCPv6 messages. This is identified as CWE-122, which refers to heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by causing the affected device to reload.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted DHCPv6 messages to a vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to either control the DHCPv6 server or be in a man-in-the-middle position to send the malicious DHCPv6 messages to the targeted device.
