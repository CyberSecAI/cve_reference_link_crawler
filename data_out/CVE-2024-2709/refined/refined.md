Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a stack buffer overflow in the `fromSetRouteStatic` function of Tenda AC10U router firmware. This occurs due to the insecure use of `sscanf` in the `save_staticroute_data` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `sscanf` function, using the format string `%[^,],%[^,],%[^,],%s`, reads input into fixed-size stack buffers (`dst_net`, `net_mask`, `net_gw`, `net_ifname`) without checking the length of the input data.
- **Greedy Matching:** The `%[^,]` format specifier reads characters until a comma is encountered.  If the provided data is longer than the destination buffers, it overflows, overwriting adjacent stack memory.
- **Unvalidated User Input:** The `list` parameter from a POST request is directly used as input to the vulnerable `sscanf` function, allowing an attacker to control the data being parsed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Stack Overflow:** Overwriting stack memory can lead to various issues, including:
    - **Crashing the Router:** A simple overflow may crash the device.
    - **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  A more carefully crafted overflow can allow an attacker to overwrite the return address and execute arbitrary code on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/SetStaticRouteCfg` endpoint.
- **`list` Parameter:**  The malicious input is provided within the `list` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint**: The attacker must know the vulnerable `/goform/SetStaticRouteCfg` endpoint.
- **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft POST requests with specific data to trigger the overflow.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

- The content provides a Proof of Concept (POC) exploit written in Python using the `requests` and `pwn` libraries. This POC sends an oversized string as the `list` parameter, demonstrating how easily the stack overflow can be triggered.
- The provided screenshots and code snippets show the vulnerable function, how the data is parsed, and confirm the overflow condition.
- The affected firmware version is clearly stated: AC10U v1.0 Firmware V15.03.06.49.
