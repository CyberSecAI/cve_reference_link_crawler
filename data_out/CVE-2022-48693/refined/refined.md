Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-48693 (based on the commit message indicating this resolves the same issue as upstream commit `1085f5080647f0c9f357c270a537869191f7f2a1`)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from resource leaks in the `brcmstb_pm_probe()` function within the `drivers/soc/bcm/brcmstb/pm/pm-arm.c` file of the Linux kernel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - **Refcount Leak:** When `for_each_matching_node()` breaks prematurely (e.g., due to reaching the maximum number of memory controllers), the associated device node's reference count is not decremented by calling `of_node_put()`, leading to a resource leak.
  - **`__iomem` Leak:** In the error paths of the `brcmstb_pm_probe()` function, the memory mapped using `of_io_request_and_map` or `of_iomap` is not unmapped using `iounmap()` , causing a memory leak. This also occurs with `brcmstb_ioremap_match`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **Resource Exhaustion:** Repeatedly probing the `brcmstb_pm` driver can lead to the exhaustion of available device nodes and/or memory mappings.
  - **System Instability:** Continued resource leaks can eventually lead to system instability, including potential crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
   - The vulnerability can be triggered by probing the `brcmstb_pm` platform device, causing the `brcmstb_pm_probe` function to be executed.
   - The specific conditions that trigger the vulnerability are related to failures during device node lookup/mapping or reaching the maximum number of memory controllers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - The attacker must be able to load or probe platform devices, usually requiring root privileges or the ability to inject a crafted device tree.
  - The attacker needs to have control over the device tree or the ability to cause probe failures.

**Technical Details**

The fix adds `of_node_put(dn)` calls in the following scenarios to handle refcount leaks:
    - When the loop breaks due to exceeding `MAX_NUM_MEMC`
    - When `of_io_request_and_map` returns an error
    - When `of_iomap` returns null
    - When `of_match_node` returns null
   
Additionally, the fix adds `iounmap()` calls to handle `__iomem` leaks in the following error paths:
    - AON ctrl mapping errors (`aon_err`)
    - DDR PHY mapping errors (`ddr_phy_err`)
    - DDR SHIMPHY mapping errors (`ddr_shimphy_err`)
    - brcmstb memc mapping errors (`brcmstb_memc_err`)
    - SRAM setup errors (`brcmstb_memc_err`)
    - s3 params allocation errors (`s3_params_err`)

The fix introduces a variable `s` to track which iomap is valid and needs to be unmapped in the case of the AON controller

The commit message also indicates that this issue was fixed upstream with commit `1085f5080647f0c9f357c270a537869191f7f2a1`
