| \*\*Uglify version \*\* At least all versions from our current (3.13.2) to latest  \*\*Issue \*\* As of 25/10/22, running an `auditjs ossi` scan on our codebase throws this issue as a critical error: `Vulnerability Title: [CVE-2022-37598] Prototype pollution vulnerability in function DEFNODE in ast.js in mishoo UglifyJS 3.13.2 via the name variable in ast.js.`  `Reference: https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2022-37598?component-type=npm&component-name=uglify-js&utm_source=auditjs&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=4.0.38` According to Sonatype this affects all published versions of UglifyJS so upgrading wont help.  The same issue was reported here: [#5699](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/issues/5699) but has been closed, marked as invalid?  Would you be able to look into this, or point me at the area and I can take a look at getting a PR raised? Thanks! |

| [@alexlamsl](https://github.com/alexlamsl) , I highly suggest you to update the CVE record by filing this form: <https://cveform.mitre.org/>  Otherwise, all tools that monitor CVE issues will raise a critical issue on UglifyJS package. This is a link on CVE description: <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37598> |

| [@CarlG12](https://github.com/CarlG12) I did not opt for or file any CVEs in the first place, so I failed to see how it is my responsibility to "Report Spam".  You have my full blessing to tell whoever's in charge to remove any records with regards to UglifyJS ‚àí and perhaps ask them to obtain a maintainer's opinion/concensus in the future before causing inconvenience to the user community. |

| [@alexlamsl](https://github.com/alexlamsl) I am in the same boat as [@ciarancolgan](https://github.com/ciarancolgan) and many many others. Cooperate vulnerability scanners will force us to remove UglifyJS and find other solutions and never look back. I believe this tool's user community will drop drastically if the CVE isn't resolved. If you disagree with the verdict that this is a true vulnerability, please reach out to NIST.gov and make your case. <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37598>  [@ciarancolgan](https://github.com/ciarancolgan) here seems to be the area:   [UglifyJS/lib/ast.js](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/blob/352a944868b09c9ce3121a49d4a0bf0afe370a35/lib/ast.js#L46)  Line 46 in [352a944](/mishoo/UglifyJS/commit/352a944868b09c9ce3121a49d4a0bf0afe370a35)   |  | function DEFNODE(type, props, methods, base) { | | --- | --- |      [UglifyJS/lib/ast.js](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/blob/352a944868b09c9ce3121a49d4a0bf0afe370a35/lib/ast.js#L79)  Line 79 in [352a944](/mishoo/UglifyJS/commit/352a944868b09c9ce3121a49d4a0bf0afe370a35)   |  | ctor.prototype[name] = methods[name]; | | --- | --- | |

| Synopsys BlackDuck scan also reports this as a critical vulnerability. As others have commented, [@alexlamsl](https://github.com/alexlamsl) , you should make your case and get this vulnerability removed from the list. Closing the issue as Invalid in not a solution and not beneficial for anyone. |

| [@ciarancolgan](https://github.com/ciarancolgan) [@CarlG12](https://github.com/CarlG12) [@jimmyjames177414](https://github.com/jimmyjames177414) [@jeensingh](https://github.com/jeensingh) - the responsibility for clarifying this belongs to @Supraja9726 who was responsible for filing the issue [#5699](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/issues/5699) that appears to have set this whole chain of events into motion.  I've added a comment to that issue clarifying that I agree with the assessment that this issue is invalid, and I've asked for @Supraja9726 to defend the claim that such a vulnerability exists. |
