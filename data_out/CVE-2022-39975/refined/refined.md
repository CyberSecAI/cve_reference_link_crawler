Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Layout module in Liferay Portal fails to check user permissions before displaying previews of "Content Page" type pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks. The system doesn't verify if a user has the necessary permissions to view a page before rendering a preview. This allows unauthorized access to content that should be restricted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can view unpublished "Content Page" type pages that are not meant to be publicly accessible. This exposes sensitive or pre-release content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** Attackers exploit this vulnerability by manipulating URLs to access previews of unpublished content pages. This suggests the preview functionality is accessible through predictable or easily guessable URLs, and the system doesn't properly protect this access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker does not require prior authentication or special access. They can remotely exploit this vulnerability by simply crafting the appropriate URL.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability affects Liferay Portal versions 7.3.3 through 7.4.3.34.
* A fix is available in Liferay Portal 7.4.3.35.
* There is no fix for Liferay Portal 7.3, and users are advised to upgrade to 7.4.
