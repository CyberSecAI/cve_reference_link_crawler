{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient checks when reading data from a buffer in multiple file parsers (PE/QNX/DYLDCACHE/PSX) of radare2.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The code attempts to read a specific number of bytes from a buffer using `r_buf_fread_at` or `r_buf_read_at`. However, it only checks if the number of bytes read is greater than or less than 0/1 instead of verifying if the exact expected number of bytes was read.",
      "The size of the read buffer is hardcoded, and not checked against the size of input data which could lead to out-of-bounds read.",
       "The code uses `sizeof` operator to determine buffer size in some cases and then attempts to read using a hardcoded length or format string, which could lead to out-of-bounds access if the buffer size is smaller than expected read size."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by providing a crafted input file that triggers an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input file that will be parsed by radare2. This can happen either directly or via other programs that use radare2 as a library.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to supply input to radare2 to trigger parsing of a crafted file."
