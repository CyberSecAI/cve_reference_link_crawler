- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `idiag_expires` field within the `inet_diag_msg` structure is not initialized when the `inet_sctp_diag_fill()` function calls `inet_diag_msg_common_fill()`, leading to an information leak.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Kernel information leak. Specifically, uninitialized kernel memory is being copied to user space.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially read uninitialized kernel memory, which may contain sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the netlink interface when using SCTP sockets with the diagnostic message functionality. A user-space process can trigger the vulnerable code path via the `recvfrom` system call.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to interact with the netlink interface and have knowledge of how to trigger the SCTP diagnostic messages. A local unprivileged user is sufficient.

The provided patches address the vulnerability by explicitly setting `r->idiag_timer`, `r->idiag_retrans`, and `r->idiag_expires` to 0 before filling the structure, ensuring that these fields are initialized even when `inet_diag_msg_sctpasoc_fill()` is not called.
