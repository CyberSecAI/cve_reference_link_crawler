- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper protection and validation of information contained in the 'MeSetup' UEFI variable. This allows the variable to be overwritten through operating system APIs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper protection of the 'MeSetup' UEFI variable and a lack of input validation, leading to an overwrite vulnerability.
-  **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) for the affected platform.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves exploiting operating system APIs to overwrite the vulnerable 'MeSetup' UEFI variable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs high privileges (PR:H) to use operating system APIs to overwrite the variable, and the attack is local (AV:L).  No user interaction is required (UI:N)
