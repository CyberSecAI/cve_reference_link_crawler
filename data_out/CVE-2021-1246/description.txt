Cisco Finesse, Cisco Virtualized Voice Browser, and Cisco Unified CVP OpenSocial Gadget Editor Unauthenticated Access Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco Finesse, Cisco Virtualized Voice Browser, and Cisco Unified CVP could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the OpenSocial Gadget Editor without providing valid user credentials.
The vulnerability is due to missing authentication for a specific section of the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a crafted URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain access to a section of the interface, which they could use to obtain potentially confidential information and create arbitrary XML files.
Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
