# Package Repositories

From Proxmox VE

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Proxmox VE uses [APT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool) as its
package management tool like any other Debian-based system.

Proxmox VE automatically checks for package updates on a daily basis. The root@pam
user is notified via email about available updates. From the GUI, the
*Changelog* button can be used to see more details about an selected update.

## Repositories in Proxmox VE

Repositories are a collection of software packages, they can be used to install
new software, but are also important to get new updates.

| Note | You need valid Debian and Proxmox repositories to get the latest security updates, bug fixes and new features. |
| --- | --- |

APT Repositories are defined in the file /etc/apt/sources.list and in .list
files placed in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/.

### Repository Management

[![screenshot/gui-node-repositories.png](/pve-docs/images/screenshot/gui-node-repositories.png)](/pve-docs/images/screenshot/gui-node-repositories.png)

Since Proxmox VE 7, you can check the repository state in the web interface.
The node summary panel shows a high level status overview, while the separate
*Repository* panel shows in-depth status and list of all configured
repositories.

Basic repository management, for example, activating or deactivating a
repository, is also supported.

### Sources.list

In a sources.list file, each line defines a package repository. The preferred
source must come first. Empty lines are ignored. A # character anywhere on a
line marks the remainder of that line as a comment. The available packages from
a repository are acquired by running apt-get update. Updates can be installed
directly using apt-get, or via the GUI (Node → Updates).

File /etc/apt/sources.list
```
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm main contrib
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates main contrib

# security updates
deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security bookworm-security main contrib
```

Proxmox VE provides three different package repositories.

## Proxmox VE Enterprise Repository

This is the recommended repository and available for all Proxmox VE subscription
users. It contains the most stable packages and is suitable for production use.
The pve-enterprise repository is enabled by default:

File /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.list
```
deb https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/pve bookworm pve-enterprise
```

Please note that you need a valid subscription key to access the
pve-enterprise repository. We offer different support levels, which you can
find further details about at <https://proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/pricing>.

| Note | You can disable this repository by commenting out the above line using a # (at the start of the line). This prevents error messages if your host does not have a subscription key. Please configure the pve-no-subscription repository in that case. |
| --- | --- |

## Proxmox VE No-Subscription Repository

As the name suggests, you do not need a subscription key to access
this repository. It can be used for testing and non-production
use. It’s not recommended to use this on production servers, as these
packages are not always as heavily tested and validated.

We recommend to configure this repository in /etc/apt/sources.list.

File /etc/apt/sources.list
```
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian bookworm main contrib
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates main contrib

# Proxmox VE pve-no-subscription repository provided by proxmox.com,
# NOT recommended for production use
deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve bookworm pve-no-subscription

# security updates
deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security bookworm-security main contrib
```

## Proxmox VE Test Repository

This repository contains the latest packages and is primarily used by developers
to test new features. To configure it, add the following line to
/etc/apt/sources.list:

sources.list entry for pvetest
```
deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve bookworm pvetest
```

| Warning | The pvetest repository should (as the name implies) only be used for testing new features or bug fixes. |
| --- | --- |

## Ceph Squid Enterprise Repository

This repository holds the enterprise Proxmox VE Ceph 19.2 Squid packages. They are
suitable for production. Use this repository if you run the Ceph client or a

```

## Ceph Squid No-Subscription Repository

```

## Older Ceph Repositories

Proxmox VE 8 doesn’t support Ceph Pacific, Ceph Octopus, or even older releases for
hyper-converged setups. For those releases, you need to first upgrade Ceph to a
newer release before upgrading to Proxmox VE 8.

See the respective
[upgrade guide](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Category%3ACeph_Upgrade) for details.

## Debian Firmware Repository

Starting with Debian Bookworm (Proxmox VE 8) non-free firmware (as defined by
[DFSG](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines)) has been moved to the
newly created Debian repository component non-free-firmware.

Enable this repository if you want to set up
[Early OS Microcode Updates](/wiki/Firmware_Updates#sysadmin_firmware_cpu) or need additional
[Runtime Firmware Files](/wiki/Firmware_Updates#sysadmin_firmware_runtime_files) not already
included in the pre-installed package pve-firmware.

To be able to install packages from this component, run
editor /etc/apt/sources.list, append non-free-firmware to the end of each
.debian.org repository line and run apt update.

## SecureApt

The *Release* files in the repositories are signed with GnuPG. APT is using
these signatures to verify that all packages are from a trusted source.

If you install Proxmox VE from an official ISO image, the key for verification is
already installed.

If you install Proxmox VE on top of Debian, download and install
the key with the following commands:

```
 # wget https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/proxmox-release-bookworm.gpg -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/proxmox-release-bookworm.gpg
```

Verify the checksum afterwards with the sha512sum CLI tool:

```
# sha512sum /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/proxmox-release-bookworm.gpg
7da6fe34168adc6e479327ba517796d4702fa2f8b4f0a9833f5ea6e6b48f6507a6da403a274fe201595edc86a84463d50383d07f64bdde2e3658108db7d6dc87 /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/proxmox-release-bookworm.gpg
```

or the md5sum CLI tool:

```
# md5sum /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/proxmox-release-bookworm.gpg
41558dc019ef90bd0f6067644a51cf5b /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/proxmox-release-bookworm.gpg
```

## Outdated: stable Repository pve

This repository is a leftover to ease the update to 3.1. It will not get any
updates after the release of 3.1. Therefore the repository needs to be removed
after the upgrade to 3.1.

File /etc/apt/sources.list
```
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian wheezy main contrib

# PVE packages provided by proxmox.com - NO UPDATES after the initial release of 3.1
# deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian wheezy pve

# security updates
deb http://security.debian.org/ wheezy/updates main contrib
```

## Outdated: Proxmox VE 2.x Repositories

Proxmox VE 2.x is based on Debian 6.0 (“squeeze”) and outdated. Please upgrade to
the latest version as soon as possible. In order to use the stable pve 2.x
repository, check your sources.list:

File /etc/apt/sources.list
```
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian squeeze main contrib

# PVE packages provided by proxmox.com
deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian squeeze pve

# security updates
deb http://security.debian.org/ squeeze/updates main contrib
```

## Outdated: Proxmox VE VE 1.x Repositories

Proxmox VE 1.x is based on Debian 5.0 (“lenny”) and very outdated. Please upgrade
to latest version as soon as possible.
