### Summary:
The provided content details a missing authorization vulnerability in the Paytium: Mollie payment forms & donations WordPress plugin. The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-7293, allows authenticated users with subscriber-level access to verify the existence of a Mollie account. The vulnerability stems from missing capability checks in the `check_mollie_account_details` function, as well as other functions.

### Root Cause:
The root cause of the vulnerability is the absence of proper authorization checks in several functions, specifically the `check_mollie_account_details` function within the `class-pt-ajax.php` file. This allows users with lower privileges (subscriber-level) to access sensitive information and perform actions that should be restricted to administrators. The code changes in `class-pt-ajax.php` show that `current_user_can('administrator')` was added to multiple conditional statements.

### Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to verify if the user has the necessary privileges to access certain functions. This allows users with subscriber-level access to call the `check_mollie_account_details` function, potentially revealing sensitive information.
- **Insecure Data Handling:** Some data is not properly sanitized, validated, and escaped before being used.

### Impact of Exploitation:
An attacker with subscriber-level access could exploit this vulnerability to verify the existence of a Mollie account connected to the WordPress site, which provides some information about the site's configuration. This could be used for reconnaissance to aid further attacks.

### Attack Vectors:
The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted AJAX requests to the WordPress site. The attacker needs to be authenticated to the WordPress site (subscriber-level or higher).

### Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:
- The attacker must have an account on the target WordPress site with at least subscriber-level access.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site, typically through a web browser or a script.

### Additional Information:
The provided content also includes details about the fixes implemented in version 4.4 of the plugin. These fixes include:
- Adding authorization checks using `current_user_can('administrator')` in `class-pt-ajax.php`.
- Sanitizing, validating, and escaping user input and output.
- Adding nonce verification to AJAX requests, preventing CSRF.
- Adding authorization checks to other functions such as `pt_cancel_subscription()` and `paytium_notice_dismiss()`.
- Code improvements in several files such as  `includes/shortcodes.php`, `includes/register-settings.php`, `includes/payment-functions.php`, and `includes/notification-functions.php`.
