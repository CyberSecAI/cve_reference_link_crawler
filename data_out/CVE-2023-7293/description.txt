The Paytium: Mollie payment forms & donations plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the check_mollie_account_details function in versions up to, and including, 4.3.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access to verify the existence of a mollie account.
