- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application contains a stack corruption vulnerability while parsing PCB files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119), leading to stack corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could leak information in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when parsing specially crafted PCB files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious PCB file. The attacker needs local access (AV:L) and user interaction (UI:R).
