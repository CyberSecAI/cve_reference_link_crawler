- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The software does not sufficiently sanitize user-controlled input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can store a malicious JavaScript payload in the application that will be executed when the page is loaded, leading to a potential integrity impact.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted POST request to `/registresult.htm` with a malicious payload in the `Resume` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
