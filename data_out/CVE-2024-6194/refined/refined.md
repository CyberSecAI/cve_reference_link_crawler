Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input, specifically the 'id' parameter, before it is used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `editmeasurement.php` file of the Tailoring Management System.
- The application directly uses the 'id' parameter in SQL queries without proper escaping or parameterized queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- Sensitive data leakage, data tampering and deletion are possible.
- Potential for complete system control.
- Service interruption can occur.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the `editmeasurement.php` file, via HTTP GET request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is explicitly stated to be required.
- Knowledge of SQL is required to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional details:**
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) uses a `UNION` query to demonstrate the SQL injection.
- The SQL injection vulnerability can be exploited using tools like `sqlmap`.
- The vulnerable software is identified as "Itsourcecode Tailoring Management System Project In PHP With Source Code v1.0".
- The vulnerable file is `editmeasurement.php`.
- A payload example is provided: `id=1' UNION ALL SELECT CONCAT(0x71767a7871,0x4f6b7974556a4c4b677942734f45784f426d4a7a65625474516159496c56477768467557627a5579,0x716a6a7171),NULL-- -`
- The vulnerability type is identified as a "UNION query" SQL injection.
- The content includes screenshots of `sqlmap` being used to extract databases.
- The suggested repairs are to use prepared statements, input validation/filtering, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.
