  Takes work to get going, but definitely worth it: the flexibility is amazing. I never expected to find a packaged backup solution that could achieve exactly what I wanted with only a very small custom plugin thrown in.

  While perhaps not overly polished, the gem is the amanda scheduler which allows vastly more data to be backed up on a regular basis than is possible with traditional methods.

Description :
AMANDA, the Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver, is a

multiple versions of Unix. Newer versions of AMANDA (including this
version) can use SAMBA to back up Microsoft(TM) Windows95/NT hosts.
The amanda package contains the core AMANDA programs and will need to
be installed on both AMANDA clients and AMANDA servers. Note that you
will have to install the amanda-client and/or amanda-server packages as
well.

Calculate my score!Clear checkboxes**Your score:****15**

You’re so evil!

A score below 09 indicates that you really love to live wild. Well, it seems like you’re ... so evil that no one else around you could have lower scores than you.

Test againShare

So, you’ve just completed the Rice Purity Test and received your score. Whether you're beaming with innocence or treading on the wild side, your score reveals a lot about your life experiences and adventures. Let's break down what each score range says about you:

**98 to 100: Pure as a Unicorn**

If your score falls in this range, congratulations! You're possibly the purest person in the world. You might have held hands or shared a romantic kiss, but you’re still incredibly innocent and rare. Only a few can boast of achieving this score.

**91 to 97: The Virtuous Voyager**

Scoring in this range suggests you steer clear of anything naughty. Not much of a romantic experience, huh? But hey, being fairly pure doesn't mean you should dive into wickedness. Keep being your awesome self!

**77 to 90: The Average Pure Joe/Jane**

An average pure person will likely get this band of scores. You’ve perhaps had a couple of relationships, some sexual experiences, maybe tried alcohol, and even more. You're right in the middle, not too wild but not too tame either.

**45 to 76: The Slightly Tainted Adventurer**

This range indicates your purity is somewhat tainted. You’ve had more extensive experiences, such as sexual encounters, getting drunk, using drugs, or even getting in trouble with the law. You're the adventurous type, not afraid to try new things.

**9 to 44: The Bold Boundary Pusher**

Falling in this range means your purity is very much on the decline. You're into adult stuff and might have even broken a law or two. You're not afraid to push the boundaries and explore the world around you.

**0 to 8: The Ultimate Daredevil**

## What is the Rice Purity Test?

This test is a self-graded survey originating from Rice University in Houston, Texas. The Rice Purity Test comprises 100 questions that assess an individual's perceived level of innocence based on their experiences and behaviors related to various aspects of personal life, including lovemaking, medications, relationships, and more**.** The scores range from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating the least pure and 100 the most pure. It assesses an individual's perceived level of innocence based on their experiences and behaviors related to various aspects of personal life, including lovemaking, medications, relationships, and more. It is commonly used by universities in the United States to gauge students' life experiences and innocence.

These straightforward questions generate a "purity score" based on the number of affirmative responses “yes”. If you get a high score, meaning that your innocence level is high and you lack adventurous experiences. On the other hand, if your score is low, it may indicate you encountered law enforcement, unconventional activities, and the like in the past.

## Origins and Evolution of the Rice Purity

The Rice Purity Test, originally known as the "Rice University Purity Test," is a self-graded survey that was first administered by students at Rice University in the 1980s. The test was created as a funny way for students to measure their experiences and innocence in various aspects of life. It has gained popularity beyond the campus of Rice University, spreading to universities and colleges across the United States and around the world.

Through many stages of social ethics standards since its inception, the original Rice test still retains its core value and provides an interesting experience for everyone. Users often take the test to compare their scores with others, using it as a lighthearted conversation starter. So in this test, the set of questions has remained unchanged, with all 100 questions in their original form of Rice University.

The development of the test can be seen in its adaptation to modern technology. Originally, the test was administered in person, with students filling out paper questionnaires and then tallying their scores manually. However, with the rise of the internet and digital communication, the test migrated online, making it more accessible to a wider audience. The test has several minor updates to enhance its user interface and user-friendliness, especially in the mobile version.

Today, the test has become popular on various social media platforms.

### TikTok Trend and Purity Test’s Popularity on Social Media Platforms

The test, originally designed for college orientations, has gained popularity on social media platforms, where users often share their scores or encourage others to take the test. It has become a sort of internet trend, with people using it as a form of entertainment or to compare their experiences with others.

In April 2020, a TikTok trend emerged where users had their parents take the test and record their reactions alongside their scores. This trend catapulted the test into a global phenomenon, garnering millions of views on TikTok.

The test's popularity has transcended social media, making appearances on TV shows. In 2022, the acclaimed Netflix series Big Mouth dedicated an entire episode to the test, aptly titled "The Rice Purity Test."

In 2024, the undeniable impact of social media on cultural phenomena will extend to the innocence test. Platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok witness widespread sharing of test scores, fostering a sense of community among users.

### Other Variants of the Rice Purity Test

There are several variants of the original test for innocence that cater to specific interests or demographics. These variants offer unique perspectives and cater to specific audiences, providing a fun and engaging way for people to reflect on their experiences and compare them with others in their community.

Here are 5 examples:

* **Lesbian Rice Purity Test (RPT)**: This variant of the innocence test is tailored for lesbians only and includes questions related to experiences and behaviors that are specific to this community. It is meant to provide a fun and unique way for lesbians to reflect on their experiences and compare them with others.
* **Mental Health RPT**: This variant focuses on mental health-related experiences and behaviors. It may include questions about therapy, medication, self-care practices, and coping mechanisms. The goal is to raise awareness about mental health issues and promote open discussions about mental health.
* **RPT on TikTok**: This version is adapted for TikTok, a popular social media platform known for its short videos. Users create videos showcasing their scores or reactions to taking the test, often using creative editing and music to enhance the entertainment value.
* **RPT for Teens**: This variant is designed for teenagers and may include questions that are more relevant to their age group, such as experiences related to high school, peer pressure, and social media. It aims to provide teenagers with a relatable and engaging way to reflect on their experiences and behaviors.
* **RPT for Virgins**: This version mainly focuses on experiences related to virginity, including questions about sexual activity and intimate relationships. It is meant to provide a lighthearted and non-judgmental way for virgins to explore their feelings and experiences surrounding virginity.

### Criticisms and Controversies Surrounding the Rice Test

This innocence test, simply a list of quizzes about someone’s past behaviors and experiences. However, it has been a subject of debate and criticism, especially on the online forums.

While the test is often taken as a funny activity, it has sparked discussions about its validity, social implications, and impact on individuals' perceptions of morality and behavior:

**Lack of validity and reliability**

One of the main criticisms of the test is its lack of scientific validity and reliability. The questions are subjective and open to interpretation, leading to varying scores based on individual perspectives. This raises questions about the test's accuracy in measuring purity or moral behavior.

Critics also argue that the test creates social pressure and reinforces stereotypes. By categorizing certain behaviors as more "pure" or socially acceptable than others, the test may contribute to judgment, especially among young people who are still vague about their real identities and values.

**Inclusion of risky behaviors**

Another point of contention is the inclusion of questions about risky behaviors such as drug use and sexual activity. Some argue that by including these questions, the test may normalize or trivialize these behaviors, potentially influencing individuals' attitudes and behaviors.

**Impact on mental health**

Critics also raise concerns about the potential impact of the test on individuals' mental health. Feeling judged or pressured to conform to certain behaviors or standards could have negative effects on individuals' self-esteem and well-being.

**Privacy concerns**

Privacy concerns regarding the test have been considered. Participants are required to disclose personal information about their past behaviors, which could raise privacy concerns, especially if the results are shared publicly on social media platforms or used inappropriately.

Furthermore, the cultural and generational context in the US may limit its relevance and applicability to other cultures, especially Asian cultures. The questions may not be meaningful or relevant to everyone, leading to questions about the test's universality.

### Average Rice Purity Score Report by Age, Gender

|  | I attempted to get MaherAzzouzi to report their apparent information |
| --- | --- |
|  | disclosure vulnerability to Amanda upstream via an issue in their |
|  | CVE-2022-37703 repository. They apparently seemed to think that MITRE |
|  | automatically reports issues to upstreams, which is not the |
|  | case. Eventually, they deleted the issue after threatening to |
|  | irresponsibly disclose two local privilege escalations in Amanda, all |
|  | without any apparent attempt to notify upstream. As far as I can tell, |
|  | that hasn't happened yet. |
|  |  |
|  | I've asked Github to make the content of the issue public for |
|  | history's sake, but I've not gotten any response to the support ticket |
|  | so far. I have their responses to my comments in the issue from the |
|  | email notifications, and I've included them here for history's |
|  | sake. Some of my responses are included inline in their responses. |

|  | Sometimes it's hard to get the security team e-mail, the vulnerability gets patched after a CVE is released. |
|  | I will try to get their official e-mail and report it. |
|  | Still there are two LPEs to root for Amanda that should be patched (not yet disclosed). |

Fedora Update Notification

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : amanda
Product : Fedora 36
Version : 3.5.3
Release : 1.fc36
URL : <http://www.amanda.org>
Summary : A network-capable tape backup solution
Description :
AMANDA, the Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver, is a
backup system that allows the administrator of a LAN to set up a
single master backup server to back up multiple hosts to one or more
tape drives or disk files. AMANDA uses native dump and/or GNU tar
facilities and can back up a large number of workstations running
multiple versions of Unix. Newer versions of AMANDA (including this
version) can use SAMBA to back up Microsoft(TM) Windows95/NT hosts.
The amanda package contains the core AMANDA programs and will need to
be installed on both AMANDA clients and AMANDA servers. Note that you
will have to install the amanda-client and/or amanda-server packages as
well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Update to version 3.5.3, which contains fixes for three minor security issues as
well as other minor bugfixes.

# Totally Accurate Battle Simulator

Delve into [Totally Accurate Battle Simulator (T.A.B.S.)](/), a strikingly unpredictable strategy game, where you are in charge of extremely diverse armies that you need to assemble on your own. TABS game offers numerous missions, where your amusing ragdolls will clash, kick, win and lose.
## *Gather a Wobbly Army*

TABS is one of the most well-known creations of Landfall studio, also known for such projects as Totally Accurate Battlegrounds, Stick Fight: The Game and Content Warning. At the basis of Totally Accurate Battle Simulator game lies quite a simple task – to form a party, put it in the appropriate place and take pleasure in the upcoming show.
In this game you will gain access to all sorts of soldiers, from ancient people with clubs to surreal magical creatures that can turn the battlefield into a complete chaos. Generate your strategy wisely to defeat your enemy.
This peculiar blend of planning and unpredictability is what makes Totally Accurate Battle Simulator so absorbing. Stick to a clarified strategy or rely on complete randomness, TABS lets you experiment with the approaches and just enjoy the instability of the game.
## *How to Play Totally Accurate Battle Simulator*

Taking the role of a commander in Totally Accurate Battle Simulator game, you need to manage all available resources thoroughly. The game consists of several eras, which allow you to manipulate both medieval peasants and modern tanks, inventing crazy scenarios.

* *Select a Mode*: Your first task in the game is to pick up the regime. TABS suggests Campaign and Sandbox, where the first one presents a set of complex tasks and the second one allows you to release your ingenuity.
* *Travel Through Time*: In the Campaign game mode you will be exploring diverse stages, featuring different units and maps. Obtain all fighters gradually, learning their powerful sides and weaknesses.
* *Prepare the Placement*: In Totally Accurate Battle Simulator game, among the crucial elements is soldier arrangement. Each TABS class does best on a certain range, so take this into account when constructing a tactic.
* *Keep Count of Credits*: Every game mission gives you a limited amount of money to spend. At the same time, soldiers don’t cost the same, so decide which class will be more profitable in your situation.
* *Take Everything in Your Hands*: TABS game also allows you to command your army during the struggle. Select one warrior and guide them through battle, or pick several ones and order them to hold the positions or actively attack.

## *Acquire Diverse Soldiers*

What is highly notable in the game is its ample array of militants, each with rare talents and peculiarities. Mercenaries in Totally Accurate Battle Simulator are divided into diverse factions that can be combined, resulting in curious effects.

* *Tribal*: Includes basic TABS fighters like Clubbers, Spearthrowers, and Bone Mages. They can be really effective in the early stages of the project.
* *Farmer*: This class suggests such soldiers as Hay Balers, Farmers, and Wheelbarrows. They may not be powerful, but can easily outnumber the foes.
* *Medieval*: Contains squires, archers, and the King. This TABS faction can be extremely effective both in attacks and protection.
* *Viking*: Warriors like Berserkers and Longships are perfect when you choose a more aggressive fighting style.
* *Dynasty*: This TABS faction offers unique units like Samurai, Monks, and Firework Archers. Their talents contain very flammable ones, which adds spectacle to the game.
* *Ancient*: Shield Bearers, Zeus, and Ballista were inspired by Ancient Greece and their powers in TABS are truly godlike.
* *Renaissance*: The game welcomes you in the take-off era, where Fencers, Musketeers and even DaVinci Tanks open surprising possibilities in the combat zone.
* *Pirate*: This TABS faction consists mostly from long-range fighters, which simplifies eliminating competitors right at the beginning.
* *Spooky*: Adds eerie vibe to the game, displaying such militants like Vampires and Pumpkin Catapults. These fighters possess supernatural powers that disrupt foes.
* *Wild West*: Step into the tough world of wild west and lead Dynamite Throwers, Gunslingers Miners into chaotic brawls of this game.

## *Reveal Hidden Secrets*

In addition to the abundance of fighters, TABS game also suggests the most dedicated enthusiasts to unlock some rare ones! Secret units are buried in the environment. Usually, they are situated near notable buildings or objects, so look at every nook and cranny! Once unraveled, they can be used in any missions.
As you complete all levels, an access to three additional chapters: Legacy, Good and Evil, will also be given to you by Totally Accurate Battle Simulator. They not only present new characters, but also display stunning locations that also conceal lots of enigmas.
## *Final Outcomes*

This game is a wonderful combination of comedy and strategy, which makes it so special among the projects of this genre. Every game session in Totally Accurate Battle Simulator is unpredictable due to the wavering ragdolls, dangerous layouts and various trials.
Check out this fantastically absurd game on Steam or venture for the unblocked versions for pc or mobile devices on our site. TABS reveals hundreds of options to create the most epic battles you can think of, so hurry up and try them all! This game is an endless source of amazing scenarios, which will leave no one indifferent!

| The researcher that requested this CVE hasn't seemed to actually report to Amanda upstream, so I'm reproducing the report here to hopefully get it fixed. The [CVE's](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37703) description:  "In Amanda 3.5.1, an information leak vulnerability was found in the calcsize SUID binary. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to know if a directory exists or not anywhere in the fs. The binary will use `opendir()` as root directly without checking the path, letting the attacker provide an arbitrary path."  There's also a tiny bit more information in: <https://github.com/MaherAzzouzi/CVE-2022-37703> Probably most notably, `[Affected Component] Component: calcsize SUID binary. C file: calcsize.c Line: 435 if((d = opendir(dirname)) == NULL) {`.  I tried to convince the researcher to be a bit more responsible and report to upstream, but they eventually deleted the issue where I requested this and told me they'd release 2 local privilege escalation vulnerabilities, but that fortunately doesn't seem to have happened yet. More information on that in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/ajakk/f5aece4564079513f09f6066238ed6aa). |

We will prioritize these fixes. Meanwhile if any of you can share the possible solutions from your end that would be great. Will there be a new release of amanda with the fixes then?

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3681-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                         Tobias Frost

Package        : amanda
Version        : 1:3.5.1-2+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-37703 CVE-2022-37705 CVE-2023-30577
Debian Bug     : 1021017 1029829 1055253

Multiple vulnerabilties have been found in Amanda,a backup system
designed to archive many computers on a network to a single
large-capacity tape drive. The vulnerabilties potentially allows local
privilege escalation from the backup user to root or leak information
whether a directory exists in the filesystem.

CVE-2022-37703

    In Amanda 3.5.1, an information leak vulnerability was found in the
    calcsize SUID binary. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to
    know if a directory exists or not anywhere in the fs. The binary
    will use `opendir()` as root directly without checking the path,
    letting the attacker provide an arbitrary path.

CVE-2022-37705

    A privilege escalation flaw was found in Amanda 3.5.1 in which the
    backup user can acquire root privileges. The vulnerable component is
    the runtar SUID program, which is a wrapper to run /usr/bin/tar with
    specific arguments that are controllable by the attacker. This
    program mishandles the arguments passed to tar binary.

CVE-2023-30577

    The SUID binary "runtar" can accept the possibly malicious GNU tar
    options if fed with some non-argument option starting with
    "--exclude" (say --exclude-vcs). The following option will be
    accepted as "good" and it could be an option passing some
    script/binary that would be executed with root permissions.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:3.5.1-2+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your amanda packages.

For the detailed security status of amanda please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/amanda>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

2023-04-02 02:00:15.070719
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : amanda
Product : Fedora 37
Version : 3.5.3
Release : 1.fc37
URL : <http://www.amanda.org>
Summary : A network-capable tape backup solution
Description :
AMANDA, the Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver, is a
backup system that allows the administrator of a LAN to set up a
single master backup server to back up multiple hosts to one or more
tape drives or disk files. AMANDA uses native dump and/or GNU tar
facilities and can back up a large number of workstations running
multiple versions of Unix. Newer versions of AMANDA (including this
version) can use SAMBA to back up Microsoft(TM) Windows95/NT hosts.
The amanda package contains the core AMANDA programs and will need to
be installed on both AMANDA clients and AMANDA servers. Note that you
will have to install the amanda-client and/or amanda-server packages as
well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Update to version 3.5.3, which contains fixes for three minor security issues as
well as other minor bugfixes.

## Description

In Amanda 3.5.1, an information leak vulnerability was found in the calcsize SUID binary. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to know if a directory exists or not anywhere in the fs. The binary will use `opendir()` as root directly without checking the path, letting the attacker provide an arbitrary path.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

**Begin your culinary adventure in Slice Master, the thrilling one-button game that's irresistibly addictive! Cut everything and rise to become a master slicer!**

## **Slice Master: The Chopping World with Diversity of Objects!**

Start your journey of cutting through gorgeous landscapes and show off your divine slashing skills with [Slice Master](https://slice-master.io)! This engaging casual game will open up an endless world with top-notch unique experiences. Not only are you exploring wonderful places, but this one-button amusement also tests your excellent skills. A sharp blade will accompany you on this appealing adventure. The primary mission is to cut all possible items, from fruit to furniture and so on. At the same time, players need to find ways to avoid or overcome tricky obstacles.

However, don't think that everything is easy and just cut things, dodge, and reach the finish line. The real thrill comes from being able to precisely align your knife release moment. Each jump and rotation in the air is a new challenge, with arduous movements and tension. Aerobatics and spins in the air will be more impressive if you can hit items and score points. On the contrary, it can also become a bitter mistake when a knife blow is not timed properly and falls to the ground. You will even have to do it multiple times to pass a random level.

## **Jumping and Slicing with Your Knife**

### **Understand the Detailed Gameplay**

In **Slice Master** game, each of your cuts requires meticulous calculation. You will start with an almighty knife that can jump and flip unlimitedly. The goal is to aim for the position of items in front, such as delicious dishes, fresh fruits, or even other utensils and cubic structures. Occasionally, on their journey, players may encounter giant piles of money. Don't hesitate to cut them in half to collect these valuable assets!

Additionally, avoiding obstacles is extremely important. Hurdles in this game are pink spiked mats and walls from above. Unlike the main path where your knife can be planted, the tall pillars that appear with thorn mats will not be affected by any impact. The only thing you can do to overcome them is to find a space in between these two types of obstacles and jump through them. Besides, if the main entity falls to the ground, the round also restarts.

When reaching the final point, gamers should not be impatient. The wall at the finish line has different numbers to help you increase your score for the round. It can keep, add, or take away your money, so align it correctly to optimize your performance.

### **How to Control the Knife**

**Slice Master**'s challenging gameplay has extremely simple controls. Anyone can quickly get used to this key after just a few tries. To make your knife jump and flip, you just need to press the mouse-click button. The number of keystrokes you make will be equivalent to the number of times the main entity rotates, gains momentum, and moves away. Once the timing is right, you just need to release your hand to let the knife land.

## **Discover the Delicate Art of Cutting with Slice Master Online**

To become a true expert in **Slice Master**, let's learn some of the following tips right away. Don't forget to apply them in your own way for the most complete experience!

* **Observe carefully the terrain and items ahead.**The levels in the game have no time limit, so you should not rush any turns. Pay attention to the items in front, especially gaps and obstructions, to be able to align key presses properly. Unless your knife touches the thorn mat or falls to the ground, every other situation can be redone at that moment.
* **Don't focus too much on trying to cut things off.** The items on the way will help you increase your bonus, but if you're having trouble with other barriers, look for a safe landing spot first. Especially in situations where your object is near a large open space.
* **Replays and rewards.**Doing it again and again not only helps players gain more experience, but the bonuses are still accumulated from these turns. As long as you can pass and progress, don't worry about having to replay a level multiple times!

## **The Creative Features and Upgrades**

### **The Variety of Backgrounds and Designs**

**Slice Master** will make you never bored with diverse experiences with backgrounds and things on the track. You will take part in a journey to lush green grass hills, the desert with beautiful pyramids, cool beaches, icy islands, and so on. Along with that, the appearance of new item creations also appears with each level with higher difficulty. Are you ready for a unique adventure with epic routes?

### **Focus on Progress in New Rounds**

In this game, once a new level has been unlocked, players will not be able to rejoin the previous round. However, you can replay a round multiple times. If you're not quite ready to move on to a more awkward challenge, let your knife break the rules and start the level again. It's quite funny but if you want, everything is okay!

### **Unlock Nine Appearances**

Are you wondering what your bonus accumulation will be used for? That is to buy other skins for your main entity. In the Slice Master's shop, there are nine different types of objects, from powerful maces or superb blades to incredible swords and others. For the first $5000, you will get a random skin. Subsequent purchases will require a higher in-game exchange fee.

### **Watch Ads to Get more Rewards**

An interesting feature in this game is that you can make your in-game money increase without performing tasks. Just click on the icon to watch a short ad and you can accumulate an additional $1200. But there is also a limit to how many times you can use it, so please consider it! Furthermore, you can also revive once per round thanks to this special feature!

## **Explore some Skill Games Like Slice Master**

In the [skill](https://slice-master.io/tag/skill) game universe, challenges that only require a joystick provide more difficulty for players to overcome. Like **Slice Master**, because you can only use the mouse button, your turns need to combine both tactical elements and the ability to press keys accurately. If you want to engage in games with similar elements, you can participate in the following outstanding entertainment:

* [Slice It All](https://slice-master.io/slice-it-all)**:** This is the game with the closest challenge to Slice Master. The player's goal is also to cut objects on the road to score points and reach the end. Shapes in this game include a lot of blocks, like puzzle pieces and icons.
* [Fruit Ninja](https://slice-master.io/fruit-ninja): This classic game has attracted countless interest around the world. Your mission is to cut in half all the fruits that appear on the screen and avoid bombs. This game also challenges your key-pressing speed because if you let more than the allowed number of fruits fall, you will lose.
* [Perfect Slices](https://slice-master.io/perfect-slices): A little easier. This game will challenge your ability to adjust your key holding time. All players need to do is choose a reasonable release point to avoid hitting obstacles on the track.

| The researcher that requested this CVE hasn't seemed to actually report to Amanda upstream, so I'm reproducing the report here to hopefully get it fixed. The [CVE's](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37703) description:  "In Amanda 3.5.1, an information leak vulnerability was found in the calcsize SUID binary. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to know if a directory exists or not anywhere in the fs. The binary will use `opendir()` as root directly without checking the path, letting the attacker provide an arbitrary path."  There's also a tiny bit more information in: <https://github.com/MaherAzzouzi/CVE-2022-37703> Probably most notably, `[Affected Component] Component: calcsize SUID binary. C file: calcsize.c Line: 435 if((d = opendir(dirname)) == NULL) {`.  I tried to convince the researcher to be a bit more responsible and report to upstream, but they eventually deleted the issue where I requested this and told me they'd release 2 local privilege escalation vulnerabilities, but that fortunately doesn't seem to have happened yet. More information on that in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/ajakk/f5aece4564079513f09f6066238ed6aa). |

|  |  |  |
|  |  | The amanda-announce mailing list is for important announcements |
|  |  | related to the Amanda Network Backup Manager package, including new |
|  |  | versions, contributions, and fixes. NOTE: the amanda-users list is |
|  |  | itself on the amanda-announce distribution, so you only need to |
|  |  | subscribe to one of the two lists, not both. |
|  |  | To subscribe, send a message to amanda-announce-request@amanda.org. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* amanda-users |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The amanda-users mailing list is for questions and general discussion |

|  |  | The amanda-hackers mailing list is for discussion of the |
|  |  | technical details of the Amanda package, including extensions, |
|  |  | ports, bugs, fixes, and alpha testing of new versions. |
|  |  | To subscribe, send a message to amanda-hackers-request@amanda.org. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | You will receive an email acknowledging your subscription. Keep it. Should you ever wish to depart our company, it has unsubscribe and other useful information. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | NOTE: You must be subscribed to a mailing list to send mail to it. Also, the address you send from must match the address you subscribed with. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Additionally, there are size limits on messages to the lists ranging from 40k-60k, (amanda-hackers is larger). If you are sending something larger, your message will silently fail. Please trim logs down to the relevant bits or put them up on the web and include a link in your request. This is primarily as a courtesy to the thousands of people who receive the emails. |

> [Suggested description]
> In Amanda 3.5.1, an information leak vulnerability was found in
> calcsize SUID binary. The attacker can abuse the vulnerability to know
> if a directory exist or not anywhere in the fs. The binary will use
> `opendir()` as root directly without checking the path, letting the
> attacker provide an arbitrary path. The attacker needs to be the
> `backup` user to be able to run calcsize binary.
>
> ---
>
> [Additional Information]
> The PoC is very simple you just have to run the binary like this:
> ./calcsize MAHER dir1 -X [directory]
> if the binary did not generate any output then the directory is available.
> If it's not available it will say that it is not available like this:
>
> backup@maher:/home/maher/pwn/ubuntu/userland/suid/amanda/sec$ ./calcsize MAHER dir1 -X /etcc
> /etcc/.: No such file or directory

| [Description](#c0)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-09-14 00:40:23 UTC  ``` CVE-2022-37703:  In Amanda 3.5.1, an information leak vulnerability was found in the calcsize SUID binary. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to know if a directory exists or not anywhere in the fs. The binary will use `opendir()` as root directly without checking the path, letting the attacker provide an arbitrary path.  Asked the researcher about an upstream report: <https://github.com/MaherAzzouzi/CVE-2022-37703/issues/1> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-09-19 20:52:06 UTC  ``` And after trying to help them report this upstream, they eventually just deleted my issue after saying they'll drop 2 Amanda LPEs today. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-09-26 15:41:12 UTC  ``` Reproduced their side of the conversation in:  <https://gist.github.com/ajakk/f5aece4564079513f09f6066238ed6aa> ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-09-26 15:47:47 UTC  ``` Reported upstream: <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/issues/192> ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2023-01-01 20:39:44 UTC  ``` Pointed out these two CVEs in the upstream issue as well. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2023-01-23 00:11:06 UTC  ``` Apparently, that might not be the real upstream, but fortunately someone from that repo reported to the mailing lists:  <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/issues/192#issuecomment-1399650313>  <https://marc.info/?l=amanda-hackers&m=167437716918603&w=2> <https://marc.info/?l=amanda-users&m=167437611218333&w=2> ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2023-05-07 04:11:25 UTC  ``` Looks like some fixes made it into Git upstream.  CVE-2022-37703 was fixed with: <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/cf01041d34b830fc8bfe87346a9a1aa092d76820>  CVE-2022-37704 was partially fixed with: <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/ee766efdd77acd2e08f646bf2f9028944cdb9d06>  Then had further fixes:  <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/e06005c01c4e008705083d053adefab0be5b2c4f> <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/f069e2c190146c5ed4d5ef8df390ee5024d4a3c8> ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Thomas Hayden    2024-07-23 03:57:25 UTC  ``` (In reply to John Helmert III from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=870037#c6)) > Looks like some fixes made it into Git upstream. >  > CVE-2022-37703 was fixed with: > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > cf01041d34b830fc8bfe87346a9a1aa092d76820 <https://slice-master.io> >  > CVE-2022-37704 was partially fixed with: > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > ee766efdd77acd2e08f646bf2f9028944cdb9d06 >  > Then had further fixes: >  > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > e06005c01c4e008705083d053adefab0be5b2c4f > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > f069e2c190146c5ed4d5ef8df390ee5024d4a3c8  all done! This is the simple fix to ensure automake is run for stable users. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Felix Andrea    2024-09-23 01:31:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to John Helmert III from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=870037#c6)) > Looks like some fixes made it into Git upstream. >  > CVE-2022-37703 was fixed with: > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > cf01041d34b830fc8bfe87346a9a1aa092d76820 >  > CVE-2022-37704 was partially fixed with: > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > ee766efdd77acd2e08f646bf2f9028944cdb9d06 >  > Then had further fixes: >  > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > e06005c01c4e008705083d053adefab0be5b2c4f > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > f069e2c190146c5ed4d5ef8df390ee5024d4a3c8 <https://ricepurity-test.io/>  Thank you for the update regarding the fixes for CVE-2022-37703 and CVE-2022-37704. Hopefully these fixes will help improve security for Amanda users. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Paul    2024-10-03 08:07:44 UTC  ``` (In reply to John Helmert III from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=870037#c6)) > Looks like some fixes made it into Git upstream. >  > CVE-2022-37703 was fixed with: > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > cf01041d34b830fc8bfe87346a9a1aa092d76820 >  > CVE-2022-37704 was partially fixed with: > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > ee766efdd77acd2e08f646bf2f9028944cdb9d06 >  > Then had further fixes: >  > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> <https://retrobowl-college.io/> > e06005c01c4e008705083d053adefab0be5b2c4f > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > f069e2c190146c5ed4d5ef8df390ee5024d4a3c8  A vulnerability for information leakage in the calcsize SUID binary was discovered in Amanda 3.5.1. This vulnerability can be used by an attacker to determine if a directory exists in the file system or not. Without verifying the path, the binary will call `opendir()` as root immediately, allowing the attacker to supply any path. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Leonell Pitts    2024-11-21 02:22:58 UTC  ``` This issue involves a command injection vulnerability. Improper neutralization of input in commands allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands, which could potentially lead to privilege escalation or system compromise. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  BrendaElliot    2024-12-26 15:15:16 UTC  ``` (In reply to John Helmert III from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=870037#c6)) > Looks like some fixes made it into Git upstream. >  > CVE-2022-37703 was fixed with: > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > cf01041d34b830fc8bfe87346a9a1aa092d76820 >  > CVE-2022-37704 was partially fixed with: > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > ee766efdd77acd2e08f646bf2f9028944cdb9d06 >  > Then had further fixes: > <https://tabattlesimulator.com> > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > e06005c01c4e008705083d053adefab0be5b2c4f > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > f069e2c190146c5ed4d5ef8df390ee5024d4a3c8  Thanks a lot ``` |  |
