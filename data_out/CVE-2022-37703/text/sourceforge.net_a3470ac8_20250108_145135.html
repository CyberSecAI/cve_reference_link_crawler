  Takes work to get going, but definitely worth it: the flexibility is amazing. I never expected to find a packaged backup solution that could achieve exactly what I wanted with only a very small custom plugin thrown in.

  While perhaps not overly polished, the gem is the amanda scheduler which allows vastly more data to be backed up on a regular basis than is possible with traditional methods.
