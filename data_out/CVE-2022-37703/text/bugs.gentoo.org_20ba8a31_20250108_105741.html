| [Description](#c0)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-09-14 00:40:23 UTC  ``` CVE-2022-37703:  In Amanda 3.5.1, an information leak vulnerability was found in the calcsize SUID binary. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to know if a directory exists or not anywhere in the fs. The binary will use `opendir()` as root directly without checking the path, letting the attacker provide an arbitrary path.  Asked the researcher about an upstream report: <https://github.com/MaherAzzouzi/CVE-2022-37703/issues/1> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-09-19 20:52:06 UTC  ``` And after trying to help them report this upstream, they eventually just deleted my issue after saying they'll drop 2 Amanda LPEs today. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-09-26 15:41:12 UTC  ``` Reproduced their side of the conversation in:  <https://gist.github.com/ajakk/f5aece4564079513f09f6066238ed6aa> ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2022-09-26 15:47:47 UTC  ``` Reported upstream: <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/issues/192> ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2023-01-01 20:39:44 UTC  ``` Pointed out these two CVEs in the upstream issue as well. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2023-01-23 00:11:06 UTC  ``` Apparently, that might not be the real upstream, but fortunately someone from that repo reported to the mailing lists:  <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/issues/192#issuecomment-1399650313>  <https://marc.info/?l=amanda-hackers&m=167437716918603&w=2> <https://marc.info/?l=amanda-users&m=167437611218333&w=2> ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2023-05-07 04:11:25 UTC  ``` Looks like some fixes made it into Git upstream.  CVE-2022-37703 was fixed with: <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/cf01041d34b830fc8bfe87346a9a1aa092d76820>  CVE-2022-37704 was partially fixed with: <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/ee766efdd77acd2e08f646bf2f9028944cdb9d06>  Then had further fixes:  <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/e06005c01c4e008705083d053adefab0be5b2c4f> <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/f069e2c190146c5ed4d5ef8df390ee5024d4a3c8> ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Thomas Hayden    2024-07-23 03:57:25 UTC  ``` (In reply to John Helmert III from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=870037#c6)) > Looks like some fixes made it into Git upstream. >  > CVE-2022-37703 was fixed with: > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > cf01041d34b830fc8bfe87346a9a1aa092d76820 <https://slice-master.io> >  > CVE-2022-37704 was partially fixed with: > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > ee766efdd77acd2e08f646bf2f9028944cdb9d06 >  > Then had further fixes: >  > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > e06005c01c4e008705083d053adefab0be5b2c4f > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > f069e2c190146c5ed4d5ef8df390ee5024d4a3c8  all done! This is the simple fix to ensure automake is run for stable users. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Felix Andrea    2024-09-23 01:31:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to John Helmert III from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=870037#c6)) > Looks like some fixes made it into Git upstream. >  > CVE-2022-37703 was fixed with: > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > cf01041d34b830fc8bfe87346a9a1aa092d76820 >  > CVE-2022-37704 was partially fixed with: > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > ee766efdd77acd2e08f646bf2f9028944cdb9d06 >  > Then had further fixes: >  > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > e06005c01c4e008705083d053adefab0be5b2c4f > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > f069e2c190146c5ed4d5ef8df390ee5024d4a3c8 <https://ricepurity-test.io/>  Thank you for the update regarding the fixes for CVE-2022-37703 and CVE-2022-37704. Hopefully these fixes will help improve security for Amanda users. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Paul    2024-10-03 08:07:44 UTC  ``` (In reply to John Helmert III from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=870037#c6)) > Looks like some fixes made it into Git upstream. >  > CVE-2022-37703 was fixed with: > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > cf01041d34b830fc8bfe87346a9a1aa092d76820 >  > CVE-2022-37704 was partially fixed with: > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > ee766efdd77acd2e08f646bf2f9028944cdb9d06 >  > Then had further fixes: >  > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> <https://retrobowl-college.io/> > e06005c01c4e008705083d053adefab0be5b2c4f > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > f069e2c190146c5ed4d5ef8df390ee5024d4a3c8  A vulnerability for information leakage in the calcsize SUID binary was discovered in Amanda 3.5.1. This vulnerability can be used by an attacker to determine if a directory exists in the file system or not. Without verifying the path, the binary will call `opendir()` as root immediately, allowing the attacker to supply any path. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Leonell Pitts    2024-11-21 02:22:58 UTC  ``` This issue involves a command injection vulnerability. Improper neutralization of input in commands allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands, which could potentially lead to privilege escalation or system compromise. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  BrendaElliot    2024-12-26 15:15:16 UTC  ``` (In reply to John Helmert III from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=870037#c6)) > Looks like some fixes made it into Git upstream. >  > CVE-2022-37703 was fixed with: > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > cf01041d34b830fc8bfe87346a9a1aa092d76820 >  > CVE-2022-37704 was partially fixed with: > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > ee766efdd77acd2e08f646bf2f9028944cdb9d06 >  > Then had further fixes: > <https://tabattlesimulator.com> > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > e06005c01c4e008705083d053adefab0be5b2c4f > <https://github.com/zmanda/amanda/commit/> > f069e2c190146c5ed4d5ef8df390ee5024d4a3c8  Thanks a lot ``` |  |
