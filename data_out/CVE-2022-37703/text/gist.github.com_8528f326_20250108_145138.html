|  | I attempted to get MaherAzzouzi to report their apparent information |
| --- | --- |
|  | disclosure vulnerability to Amanda upstream via an issue in their |
|  | CVE-2022-37703 repository. They apparently seemed to think that MITRE |
|  | automatically reports issues to upstreams, which is not the |
|  | case. Eventually, they deleted the issue after threatening to |
|  | irresponsibly disclose two local privilege escalations in Amanda, all |
|  | without any apparent attempt to notify upstream. As far as I can tell, |
|  | that hasn't happened yet. |
|  |  |
|  | I've asked Github to make the content of the issue public for |
|  | history's sake, but I've not gotten any response to the support ticket |
|  | so far. I have their responses to my comments in the issue from the |
|  | email notifications, and I've included them here for history's |
|  | sake. Some of my responses are included inline in their responses. |

|  | Hey, |
|  |  |
|  | Yes it was reported to CVE mitre, and I guess they reported it to Amanda. |

|  | Sometimes it's hard to get the security team e-mail, the vulnerability gets patched after a CVE is released. |
|  | I will try to get their official e-mail and report it. |
|  | Still there are two LPEs to root for Amanda that should be patched (not yet disclosed). |
|  | Thank you! |

|  | No exploit is released until now, and I just sent an e-mail to amanda-hackers-request@amanda.org. |
|  | Thanks for your involvement. |

|  | I take security seriously, but I did look for the e-mail to report those the time I found the bugs, but didn't found any. |
|  | Again, please if you know the e-mail just send it here instead of just opening random issues. |
|  | I will be thankful if you send the e-mail where I should report :) |

It seems that he's blocked me on GitHub, so I can't help him make upstream reports anymore.

Sorry, something went wrong.
