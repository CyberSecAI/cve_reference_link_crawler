Package        : amanda
Version        : 1:3.5.1-2+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-37703 CVE-2022-37705 CVE-2023-30577
Debian Bug     : 1021017 1029829 1055253

Multiple vulnerabilties have been found in Amanda,a backup system
designed to archive many computers on a network to a single
large-capacity tape drive. The vulnerabilties potentially allows local
privilege escalation from the backup user to root or leak information
whether a directory exists in the filesystem.

CVE-2022-37703

    In Amanda 3.5.1, an information leak vulnerability was found in the
    calcsize SUID binary. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to
    know if a directory exists or not anywhere in the fs. The binary
    will use `opendir()` as root directly without checking the path,
    letting the attacker provide an arbitrary path.

CVE-2022-37705

    A privilege escalation flaw was found in Amanda 3.5.1 in which the
    backup user can acquire root privileges. The vulnerable component is
    the runtar SUID program, which is a wrapper to run /usr/bin/tar with
    specific arguments that are controllable by the attacker. This
    program mishandles the arguments passed to tar binary.

CVE-2023-30577

    The SUID binary "runtar" can accept the possibly malicious GNU tar
    options if fed with some non-argument option starting with
    "--exclude" (say --exclude-vcs). The following option will be
    accepted as "good" and it could be an option passing some
    script/binary that would be executed with root permissions.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:3.5.1-2+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your amanda packages.
