The development of the test can be seen in its adaptation to modern technology. Originally, the test was administered in person, with students filling out paper questionnaires and then tallying their scores manually. However, with the rise of the internet and digital communication, the test migrated online, making it more accessible to a wider audience. The test has several minor updates to enhance its user interface and user-friendliness, especially in the mobile version.

Today, the test has become popular on various social media platforms.

### TikTok Trend and Purity Test’s Popularity on Social Media Platforms

The test, originally designed for college orientations, has gained popularity on social media platforms, where users often share their scores or encourage others to take the test. It has become a sort of internet trend, with people using it as a form of entertainment or to compare their experiences with others.

In April 2020, a TikTok trend emerged where users had their parents take the test and record their reactions alongside their scores. This trend catapulted the test into a global phenomenon, garnering millions of views on TikTok.

The test's popularity has transcended social media, making appearances on TV shows. In 2022, the acclaimed Netflix series Big Mouth dedicated an entire episode to the test, aptly titled "The Rice Purity Test."

### Criticisms and Controversies Surrounding the Rice Test

This innocence test, simply a list of quizzes about someone’s past behaviors and experiences. However, it has been a subject of debate and criticism, especially on the online forums.

While the test is often taken as a funny activity, it has sparked discussions about its validity, social implications, and impact on individuals' perceptions of morality and behavior:

**Lack of validity and reliability**

One of the main criticisms of the test is its lack of scientific validity and reliability. The questions are subjective and open to interpretation, leading to varying scores based on individual perspectives. This raises questions about the test's accuracy in measuring purity or moral behavior.

Critics also argue that the test creates social pressure and reinforces stereotypes. By categorizing certain behaviors as more "pure" or socially acceptable than others, the test may contribute to judgment, especially among young people who are still vague about their real identities and values.

**Inclusion of risky behaviors**

Another point of contention is the inclusion of questions about risky behaviors such as drug use and sexual activity. Some argue that by including these questions, the test may normalize or trivialize these behaviors, potentially influencing individuals' attitudes and behaviors.

**Impact on mental health**

Critics also raise concerns about the potential impact of the test on individuals' mental health. Feeling judged or pressured to conform to certain behaviors or standards could have negative effects on individuals' self-esteem and well-being.

**Privacy concerns**

Privacy concerns regarding the test have been considered. Participants are required to disclose personal information about their past behaviors, which could raise privacy concerns, especially if the results are shared publicly on social media platforms or used inappropriately.

Furthermore, the cultural and generational context in the US may limit its relevance and applicability to other cultures, especially Asian cultures. The questions may not be meaningful or relevant to everyone, leading to questions about the test's universality.
