Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Remote Code Execution (RCE)

**Affected Software:** ForU CMS (dev version)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `install.php` file of ForU CMS. The application writes data to `data.php` before performing database checks. This allows an attacker to inject malicious PHP code into the `data.php` file.

**Weakness:**
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the database name (`db_name`) parameter. This allows injection of arbitrary PHP code.
*   **Premature File Write:**  The application writes to the `data.php` file before verifying database configuration parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to:
*   Full system compromise
*   Data theft or modification
*   Denial of service

**Attack Vector:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/install/index.php` endpoint.
*   **Malicious Payload:** The POST request includes a malicious PHP code injection within the `db_name` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable ForU CMS instance.
*   No prior authentication is needed, as the vulnerability occurs during the installation phase.

**Technical Details:**
*   The provided PoC demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting `phpinfo()` into `db_name` parameter.
*   The server executes the injected `phpinfo()` code.

**Additional Notes**
* The provided exploit targets the `install/index.php` which is used in the installation process of the CMS. This implies that the vulnerability is exploitable during the installation phase if a user does not properly secure their installation.
* The exploit injects PHP code by terminating the existing string and beginning execution with `);phpinfo(); //`.
* The included images seem to show the steps of the exploit: 1) sending the malicious request, 2) the execution of the phpinfo() function and 3) the resulting information being displayed in the browser.
