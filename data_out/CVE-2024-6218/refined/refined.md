The provided content relates to CVE-2024-6218.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the `busid` parameter in the `busprofile.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries. The injected `busid` parameter is used directly in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Specifically, the application is susceptible to boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind, and UNION query SQL injection techniques.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
*   Unauthorized database access.
*   Sensitive data leakage.
*   Data tampering.
*   Comprehensive system control.
*   Service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is the `busid` parameter in the `busprofile.php` file, which is vulnerable to manipulation by injecting malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need login or authorization to exploit this vulnerability. They need to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint with the malicious `busid` parameter.
