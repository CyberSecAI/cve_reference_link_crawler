Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-20192:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Formidable Forms plugin had insufficient input sanitization and output escaping for multiple parameters, primarily within the form preview functionality. Specifically, the `after_html` and `before_html` parameters were vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious code could be injected via the vulnerable parameters and stored, leading to XSS when an administrator views a form entry.
*  **Unauthenticated Shortcode Execution:** The plugin's preview function allowed unauthenticated users to execute WordPress shortcodes by injecting them into the `after_html` and `before_html` parameters.
*   **SQL Injection:** The `[display-frm-data]` shortcode had a SQL injection vulnerability in the `order` attribute, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Unauthenticated Form Entry Retrieval:** The `[formresults]` shortcode could be used by unauthenticated users to view form responses, potentially exposing sensitive data.
*   **Reflected XSS:**  Dangerous HTML could be injected in `after_html` and `before_html` parameters leading to a POST-based XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers could inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.
*   **Data Breach:**  Sensitive data from form entries could be exposed.
*   **Database Compromise:** Through the SQL injection vulnerability, attackers could potentially access and exfiltrate sensitive data from the database, including user credentials and other WordPress data.
*   **Remote Code Execution (with iThemes Sync):** In combination with the iThemes Sync plugin, the SQL injection could be leveraged to gain an authentication key and achieve remote code execution, allowing attackers to take full control of the affected website.
*   **Full control of wordpress site:** The vulnerability could lead to adding new administrator accounts, installing arbitrary plugins, and making changes to the website and database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:**  Attackers could send crafted HTTP requests with malicious payloads via the vulnerable parameters, primarily via the  `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   **Form Submissions:** Malicious HTML could be injected into form fields and stored to trigger XSS when viewed by an admin.
*   **Shortcode Injection:**  Malicious shortcodes can be injected via `after_html` and `before_html` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The primary attack vector does not require any authentication to exploit the XSS, SQL injection, and form results exposure.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to send HTTP requests to the targeted WordPress site.
*   **For RCE via iThemes Sync:** Attackers would need to know the site was running the iThemes Sync plugin and then exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Jouko Pynn√∂nen.
*   The vulnerabilities were fixed in Formidable Forms versions 2.05.02 and 2.05.03.
*   The SQL injection was a blind SQL injection.
*   The stored XSS was a result of improper sanitization of HTML.
*   A PoC exploit for RCE via iThemes Sync has been made public
*   The vulnerable parameters are `after_html` and `before_html`.

This detailed breakdown provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-20192, which is more comprehensive than the original CVE description.
