## FAQ

### How do I get started with the best forms for WordPress?

The fastest way to build a form is to use the example we built for you. After you activate Formidable, insert [formidable id=contact-form] on the WordPress page of your choice.

Go to the Formidable page and click “add new”. Choose the Contact Us form template or another free template and click “Create”.

Next, edit or create a WordPress contact page. Click the “Formidable” button to open the shortcode generator. Choose your new web form and insert it into the WordPress page. Save the page for a beautiful WP contact form, ready to collect and store your leads. The contact form template will get you up and running fast.

### Why isn’t WordPress sending emails?

When you do not receive emails, try the following steps:

1. Double check the email address in your Email action on the settings page. The [admin\_email] shortcode uses the email address from your WordPress Settings -> General page.
2. Are you receiving other emails from your site (ie comment notifications, forgot password…)? If not, notifications will not work either.
3. Check your SPAM box.
4. Try a different address in your settings.
5. Install WP Mail SMTP or another similar emailing alternative and configure the SMTP settings.
6. If these steps do not fix the problem and other WP signup emails are not going out, please reach out to your web host.

I’ve been using the formidable plugin [paid option] for about 5 months now and it’s enabled me to add so many options to my website. As somebody who does a lot of web design I always judge a plugin by the quality of the support provided, otherwise what do you do when you run into issues? Formidable support has been brilliant on every occasion I’ve needed them. Quick replies, often within a couple of hours or at the latest 24 hours. Polite, helpful and as much detail as you need in the reply.

We use Formidable Forms in the O Gauge Railroading magazine 3D Catalog model train site. I was easily able to tweak the design of the form to fit nicely with the theme of the site.
Recently a small technical issue came up, so I opened a support ticket with Formidable Tech Support. I had an answer and a fix in less than 30 minutes! Rob responded with a setting to change, and that fixed our problem.
Love this form handler!

I tried all the big form builder plugins, and this was the only one that had all the features I wanted, without buying add-ons — in the Elite version, which (at full price) is rather expensive, unfortunately. So far it worked very well for me, easy to use. And very good support.

The Formidable Forms suite of plugins are like a Swiss Army knife for all types of interactive form entry. There’s almost nothing you can’t do with it. In our case, it’s become the cornerstone for our community website…allowing data interactions & workflows between our members and administrators.
Further, besides the great functionality of the tool, their support team are amazing. They are very responsive (within 24 hours), and their strong knowledge of the product gives them the ability to respond with valuable solutions to your issues…very much the first time.

I believe this plugin offers more than similar ones, and the support has been very responsive and quick whenever I’ve had any questions.

Can’t say enough about this product and its support team. Product has a very impressive feature set .. so imho is more of an App Builder and not just a form builder. Have worked with this product on a couple projects over the last 1+y, each of which had special requirements that required custom code bits. In both cases, Formidable’s support team where very efficient and effective – and provided the extra code snippets I needed. On my most recent need for support, Formidable can thru in < 4h with a code snippet to meet my unique need. As well they quickly did a website visit to diagnose an implementation issue caused by someone else’s wayward plugin.
Top notch product and team. They are definetly my GoTo guys for all future form-based projects.

## Changelog

#### 6.16.3

* New: Additional duplicate entry check validation has been added. Now, when a form is resubmitted when loading the browser on iOS devices, these requests will trigger a duplicate entry error for a month instead of the default 60 seconds.
* New: When viewing an entry, the timestamp in the sidebar will now use the WordPress format settings.
* New: A new database index has been added to the form entries table. This significantly improves performance for entry count queries.
* Fix: Invalid name field inputs did not always load with a proper aria-invalid value, and error auto-focusing wouldn’t work as expected for name fields.
* Fix: An unsupported operand types: array + string fatal error has been fixed.
* Fix: The hook used to load translations has been updated to improve compatibility with WordPress 6.7+.
* Fix: A strpos(): Passing null to parameter PHP Deprecated message has been fixed.
* Fix: Some additional validation has been added when attempting to view a payment or subscription that does not exist.
* Fix: Form titles and descriptions would sometimes still appear when the show title and description toggles for Gutenberg Form blocks were disabled.
* Fix: A cannot access offset of type string on string PHP fatal error has been fixed.
* The section for form button settings has been removed as all of the settings had been moved.
* Some old deprecated CSS has been removed, helping to reduce the file size of styles used on the front end.
* The global JS functions frmFrontForm.invisible and frmFrontForm.visible are now officially deprecated.
* The s11-fp.svg asset file has been removed, helping to reduce the file size of this plugin.

#### 6.16.2

* Security: Additional context checks and filtering have been added to prevent posted script data from appearing inside of fields.
* Fix: JSON default values are no longer decoded for field types that expect string values only.

#### 6.16.1

* New: Database queries for entry ID data have been optimized, removing a JOIN in cases where it is not required. This should significantly improve performance when searching for entries in a View.
* Fix: Collapsible sections in the styler settings would no longer open after the recent WordPress 6.7 update.
* Fix: The label position setting and CSS layout classes for summary fields were not working. Since None is also the default value for Summary field label positions, this means that Summary field labels that previously were visible likely are no longer visible.
* Fix: The slider to set field margin for section fields wouldn’t properly save.
* Fix: Checkbox selection would not work on iPhones when using frm\_grid classes.
* Fix: An automatic conversion of false to array deprecated message that would occur when loading the visual styler with the Authorize.Net add-on active has been fixed.
* Fix: A str\_replace(): Passing null to parameter #3 deprecated message has been fixed.
* Fix: Stripe payments using the action included in this plugin would fail to initialize when using shortcode amount values for many currency types including Mexican Pesos.
* Fix: An array to string conversion PHP warning has been fixed.
* Fix: The center form styling toggle would not properly save.
* Fix: Form fields would appear broken when the Payment forms by Paystack plugin was active due to a shortcode conflict.
* Several deprecated functions have been removed including FrmAppController::page\_route, FrmFieldType::default\_invalid\_msg, FrmFieldType::default\_unique\_msg, FrmStylesHelper::maybe\_include\_font\_icon\_css, FrmFormsHelper::ignore\_template\_categories, FrmFormActionsHelper::default\_action\_opts, and FrmAppHelper::maybe\_full\_screen\_link.
* The unused FrmEDD\_SL\_Plugin\_Updater class has been deprecated and is no longer functional.
