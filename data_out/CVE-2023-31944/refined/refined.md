```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly incorporates the `emp_id` GET parameter into an SQL query without any sanitization or validation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper input sanitization for the `emp_id` parameter in `employee_edit.php`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This can potentially lead to data breaches, modification or deletion of data, and complete compromise of the application and underlying database server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the `emp_id` GET parameter in the URL. By crafting malicious SQL injection payloads within the `emp_id` parameter, an attacker can inject malicious SQL queries.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have knowledge of SQL injection techniques."
