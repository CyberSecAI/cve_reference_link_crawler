Joshua Mason discovered that a logic error in the validation of the
secret key used in the "local" authorisation mode of the CUPS printing
system may result in privilege escalation.

in version 2.2.10-6+deb10u6.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.3op2-3+deb11u2.

# MNDT-2022-0026

## Description

Apple CUPS 2 (pervasive printer software used by Mac OS, most distributions of Linux) contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability prior to version 499.4.

## Impact

High - Exploiting the vulnerability will give a local unprivileged attacker root level privileges.

## Exploitability

Medium - Any authenticated local user can exploit the vulnerability and an exploit is trivial to produce.

## CVE Reference

CVE-2022-26691

## Common Weakness Enumeration

CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System

Base Score: 8.4 - Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:F/RC:C/CR:H/IR:H/MAV:L/MAC:L/MPR:L/MUI:N/MS:C/MC:H/MI:H/MA:H

## Technical Details

In addition to basic web authentication, CUPS allows authentication via a 32 byte randomly generated hex string created at runtime. This alternative form of authentication ("Local" Authentication) employs a buggy string compare function (ctcompare()) which allows an attacker to authenticate as root using an empty string, alleviating any need for the 32 byte random secret. Once authenticated to CUPS as root, arbitrary code execution with root privileges is trivially easy to accomplish.

## Resolution

The issue was fixed in Apple CUPS2 499.4. Update to this version to address the vulnerability.
