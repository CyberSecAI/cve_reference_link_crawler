- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape user-supplied input in its settings, specifically within the stylesheet field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website, which will be executed in the browsers of users who visit the affected pages. This can lead to various consequences, including session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must have admin-level access to the WordPress dashboard. The malicious script is injected through a settings page of the vulnerable plugin (specifically the stylesheet input).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a high-privilege user (e.g., administrator). The attacker needs to navigate to the specific settings page of the plugin and insert the malicious payload.
