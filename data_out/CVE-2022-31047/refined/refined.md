Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-31047:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the logging of complete exception stack traces by TYPO3's exception handlers. This process inadvertently included sensitive information like system-internal credentials or keys (e.g., database credentials) in plaintext within log files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The core weakness is the exposure of sensitive data in log files.
- **CWE-532:**  This CWE (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) is specifically cited. Additionally, CWE-209 is also mentioned.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker gaining access to the log files would be able to read plaintext credentials and keys. This could lead to further unauthorized access and system compromise.
- **No Integrity or Availability Impact:** According to the provided CVSS vector, the vulnerability does not directly affect the integrity or availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network (AV:N).
- **Log File Access:** An attacker needs to be able to access the log files where the sensitive information is written. The attacker would need to have at least low privileges (PR:L) on the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have low privileges to potentially access the log files.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction (UI:N).
- **Access to Log Files:** The attacker needs to gain access to the log files where the sensitive data is being written.

**Mitigation:**

- The vulnerability is mitigated by preventing the logging of the full stack trace by default in exception handlers, which was accomplished in the referenced commit.  The commit modifies the AbstractExceptionHandler class to not include the exception object, and thus the full stack trace, by default. This was implemented by adding a `$logExceptionStackTrace` property and setting it to `false` by default and making an exception for `DebugExceptionHandler` where it's set to `true`.

**Patched Versions:**
   - 7.6.57 ELTS, 8.7.47 ELTS, 9.5.35 ELTS, 10.4.29, 11.5.11

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Marco Huber and fixed by Torben Hansen, a member of the TYPO3 security team.
