  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2024-36496",
      "root_cause": "The application encrypts its configuration file using a static key derived from a hardcoded five-character password.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Hardcoded credentials",
        "Use of a weak hashing algorithm (MD5 without salt)",
		"Use of a weak encryption algorithm (RC4)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can decrypt the configuration file and extract sensitive information, including the administrator password, leading to a complete bypass of the security restrictions imposed by the software.",
      "attack_vectors": "Local access to the system where Faronics WINSelect is installed.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs local access to the system in order to read the configuration file, and knowledge on how to decrypt it using the hardcoded key."
