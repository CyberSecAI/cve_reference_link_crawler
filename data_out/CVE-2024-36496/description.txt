The configuration file is encrypted with a static key derived from a 
static five-character password which allows an attacker to decrypt this 
file. The application hashes this five-character password with 
the outdated and broken MD5 algorithm (no salt) and uses the first five 
bytes as the key for RC4. The configuration file is then encrypted with 
these parameters.
