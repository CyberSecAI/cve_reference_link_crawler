```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in VirtualBox.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The advisory lists multiple CVEs related to different vulnerabilities. Specifically for CVE-2019-2874, the provided data does not give specific vulnerability details.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker could take control of VirtualBox resulting in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the process, a Denial of Service condition, or other unspecified impacts.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerabilities can be exploited by a local attacker. In some instances, network exploitation may be possible, but this content doesn't directly say that for CVE-2019-2874, so we can assume local access is needed.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs local access to the system running VirtualBox.
