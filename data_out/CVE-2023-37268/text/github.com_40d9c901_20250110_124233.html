## Package

warpgate
(Binary)

## Affected versions

v0.7.2

## Patched versions

v0.7.3

## Description

### Summary

*Short summary of the problem. Make the impact and severity as clear as possible. For example: An unsafe deserialization vulnerability allows any unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on the server.*

When SSO(i only check custom sso with on-premiss gitlab), I can login another user with sso user or password user.

### Details

*Give all details on the vulnerability. Pointing to the incriminated source code is very helpful for the maintainer.*

* 2 user with Sngle sign-on enabled(victim / my-real-user)
* In login interface, Username=(victim), and push `Enter` button(not `sso` nor `Login` button)
* SSO interface(for me, on-premiss gitlab), login my-real-user
* login success with victim user

### PoC

*Complete instructions, including specific configuration details, to reproduce the vulnerability.*

I write details.

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

any users with only sso(without totp) or only password(without totp)

### detail my config

environment: docker-compose + ghcr.io/warp-tech/warpgate:latest(ea9291a75109, v0.7.2? web interface says v0.7.1)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
