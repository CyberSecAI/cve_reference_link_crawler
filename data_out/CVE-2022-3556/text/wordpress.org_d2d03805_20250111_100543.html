## Description

Taxi Booking for WordPress is a feature-rich plugin designed for transportation services like taxis, limousines, and airport shuttles. It allows businesses to easily integrate booking functionality into their WordPress websites, offering dynamic pricing, vehicle management, and route customization.

Benefits for your business:

Flexibility: Adapts to a range of transport needs with support for dynamic or fixed pricing.

Customization: Pro features like multi-language support, multiple payment gateways, and editable email templates ensure it fits various business models.

User-Friendly Management: A clean back-end interface simplifies vehicle and route configuration.

To overcome the learning curve, the plugin provides comprehensive documentation, including step-by-step guides for setting up points of interest (POIs), fixed fare routes, and email notifications.

For additional support, you can access a ticket system at [kanev.com](https://kanev.com/support/taxi-booking-for-wordpress) available for both Free and Pro users.
