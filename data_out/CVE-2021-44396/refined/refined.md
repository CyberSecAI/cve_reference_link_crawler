The provided content is related to CVE-2021-44396.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `Preview` API's JSON parameter parser within the `cgiserver.cgi` application incorrectly assumes that the `param` JSON element is always an object. If the `param` is not an object (e.g., an empty string), the code will attempt to access it as an object using the subscription operator which leads to an assertion failure. This assertion failure causes the `cgiserver.cgi` process to terminate and the device to reboot.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Input Validation (CWE-20): The `cgiserver.cgi` application does not properly validate the structure of the JSON input for the `param` field in the `Preview` API call. It expects a JSON object but does not verify it, leading to a crash if it's not.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A remote attacker can cause the device to reboot by sending a specially crafted HTTP request. This disrupts the functionality of the camera, making it temporarily unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP request with a crafted JSON body sent to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint.
- The JSON body needs to include the `Preview` command with a `param` that is not an object (e.g., an empty string).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the camera's web interface.
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint.
- While most of the reported vulnerabilities require a logged-in user, it is noted that they can be combined with another vulnerability (TALOS-2021-1420) to perform unauthenticated attacks.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability occurs within the `cgi_param_parse` function when parsing the JSON body of an API request. Specifically, when handling the `Preview` command, the code retrieves the value of the `param` key from the JSON object. It then passes this value to the `Preview` API-specific parameter parser. This parser incorrectly assumes that the `param` value is a JSON object. If the attacker provides a non-object value (e.g., an empty string ""), the code attempts to access it with the subscription operator (`[]`), causing an assertion failure, process termination, and subsequent device reboot.
