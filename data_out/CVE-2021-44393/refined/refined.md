This document provides a detailed analysis of CVE-2021-44393 and related CVEs.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the improper input validation within the `cgiserver.cgi` JSON command parser of the Reolink RLC-410W camera. Specifically, the code assumes that the `param` JSON element within a command is always a JSON object. However, by providing a different data type such as a string, the code attempts to access it using the subscription operator as if it was an object, leading to an assertion failure and subsequent process termination.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Improper Input Validation:** The `cgiserver.cgi` does not properly validate the data type of the `param` JSON element before parsing it.
- **Type Confusion:** The code makes assumptions about the structure of the JSON data which is not guaranteed, and doesn't handle the case when those assumptions are incorrect, leading to type confusion.
- **Denial of Service:** When the assertion fails, the `cgiserver.cgi` process terminates causing a reboot of the device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial of service condition. An attacker can trigger a device reboot by sending a specially crafted HTTP request, rendering the camera temporarily unavailable. This can cause disruption to surveillance operations and could be used to bypass security measures.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is an HTTP request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint of the camera. The request includes a JSON array in the body, containing the command with a `param` value that is not a JSON object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Reolink camera.
- For most of the listed CVEs, a valid session token is required, but it can be bypassed by exploiting TALOS-2021-1420.
- For CVE-2021-44354, a logged-in user is not required to exploit the vulnerability.

**CVE-2021-44393 Specifics:**

CVE-2021-44393 specifically refers to the vulnerability where the `GetIsp` command's `param` is not validated properly. When the `param` is not a JSON object, accessing it as one will cause a crash and subsequent reboot of the device. The following request is an example of how to trigger this:

```
[
    {
        "cmd": "GetIsp",
        "action": 0,
        "param":  ""
    }
]
```
