The content relates to CVE-2021-45907.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Two stack-based buffer overflows exist in the `DecodeLZW` function of the gif2apng application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `DecodeLZW` function has insufficient bounds checking when writing to the `suffix` and `str` buffers. Specifically, the for loop iterates based on a `clearcode` which can exceed the buffer size, and the while loop can infinitely write to the `str` buffer if `prefix[code]` results in the same `code` again.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The stack buffer overflows lead to a segmentation fault, crashing the application. While direct code execution is not stated, the report notes that no control over the data being written is possible, making direct code execution difficult.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious GIF file with a large `mincodesize` or with repeating code values during the LZW decompression process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted GIF file as input to the vulnerable `gif2apng` application.
