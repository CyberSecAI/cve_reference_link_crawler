- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Calendarista Basic Edition plugin for WordPress versions 3.0.2 and earlier is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users without their consent.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can craft a malicious request and trick an authenticated user into executing it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user to trigger a crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves.
