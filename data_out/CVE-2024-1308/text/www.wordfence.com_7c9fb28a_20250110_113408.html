### Description

The WooCommerce Cloak Affiliate Links plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'permalink\_settings\_save' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.33. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the affiliate permalink base, driving traffic to malicious sites via the plugin's affiliate links.
