- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The injected script is permanently stored on the server (likely in a database or configuration file). This makes the attack persistent, affecting any user who accesses the vulnerable page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser, impersonating them in the application.
- Credential Theft: The malicious JavaScript can be used to steal sensitive information like cookies and session tokens, potentially leading to account hijacking.
- Other malicious actions: The attacker can perform other malicious activities on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attacker injects the malicious script via a network request to the vulnerable web application.
- Specific Page: The attack targets the router page within the Peering Manager application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- High Privileges: The attacker needs high privileges within the Peering Manager application to inject and save the malicious payload.
- User Interaction: Victim user needs to visit the vulnerable page to trigger the execution of the malicious script.
