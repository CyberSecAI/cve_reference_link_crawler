- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of symbolic links by the FTP server on the AX7501-B0 CPE.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The FTP server processes symbolic links on external storage media, without proper validation or restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local, authenticated attacker with administrative privileges can create a symbolic link on external storage (like a USB drive) that points to the root filesystem. By logging into the FTP server, the attacker can then access files outside of the intended FTP directory, potentially gaining access to the entire root file system of the device.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attacker needs local access to the device and must be authenticated with administrator privileges. The attacker also needs to create a malicious symbolic link on external storage media. The attacker then logs in to the FTP server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a local user with administrative access to the device. They also need the ability to connect external storage to the device.
