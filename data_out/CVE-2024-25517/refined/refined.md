  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2024-25517",
      "vulnerability_type": "SQL Injection",
      "root_cause": "The application directly uses user-supplied input from HTTP GET/POST requests to construct SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection vulnerability due to direct use of `Request.QueryString` parameters in SQL queries."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. In some cases, this can also allow an attacker to execute system commands on the database server.",
      "attack_vectors": "HTTP GET/POST requests with malicious parameters injected into the URL or request body.",
        "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET/POST requests to the vulnerable application and know the vulnerable endpoints."
    },
     {
      "cve": "CVE-2024-25517",
      "vulnerability_type": "Information Leakage and Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data",
       "root_cause": "The application provides error messages containing sensitive information, such as physical paths, which can be used by an attacker for further attacks.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Exposing the physical path of the application on error messages.", "Lack of access control that allows unauthorized users to download arbitrary files."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can use the exposed path information to craft more targeted attacks and potentially gain unauthorized system access by combining this vulnerability with other flaws like SQL Injection.",
      "attack_vectors": "Manipulating requests to cause errors that reveal the application's physical path, and accessing files through guessable paths.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET/POST requests to the vulnerable application. For file download, knowledge or guess of valid IDs is required."
    },
    {
        "cve":"CVE-2024-25517",
        "vulnerability_type":"Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "root_cause":"The application directly embeds unsanitized user-supplied input into HTML responses, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.",
        "weaknesses":["Lack of input sanitization or output encoding allows for XSS attacks."],
        "impact":"An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser, leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions.",
        "attack_vectors":"HTTP GET requests with malicious script embedded in parameters.",
        "required_attacker_capabilities":"The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application."

    {
        "cve": "CVE-2024-25517",
      "vulnerability_type": "System Design Flaw",
      "root_cause":"The application has a page that allows for generating data backups.",
      "weaknesses":[
          "Lack of proper access control and insufficient input validation allows for an attacker to access a page with backup generation functionality."
      ],
      "impact":"The design allows an attacker to backup the database and view sensitive information contained within the backed up file.",
      "attack_vectors": "Accessing the exposed `dSql.aspx` page.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities":"The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET/POST requests to the vulnerable application."
