{
  "related_cve": "CVE-2023-0689",
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper authorization checks within the `mf_first_name` shortcode. This allows authenticated users with subscriber-level or higher capabilities to access form submission data, specifically the submitter's first name, without adequate permission verification.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Authorization Bypass",
    "Information Disclosure"
  ],
  "impact": "An authenticated attacker with subscriber level access or higher can obtain sensitive information, like the first name of form submitters. This can lead to privacy violations and could be used in further malicious activities.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Network",
    "Shortcode Usage"
  ],
  "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least 'subscriber' level access or higher. They need to be able to insert or execute the vulnerable shortcode."
