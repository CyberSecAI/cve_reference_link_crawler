{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Dropbox iOS app (version 100.2) uses the LAContext class for biometric authentication (TouchID) but fails to implement the kSecAccessControlUserPresence protection mechanism. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication by manipulating the return value of the LAContext class to always return 'true'.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Authentication",
       "Improper Platform Usage"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass TouchID authentication, gaining unauthorized access to the Dropbox application and user data.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker with access to a jailbroken iOS device can perform runtime manipulation of the biometric authentication process by overriding the LAContext return value. A malicious app can also hook into the biometric mechanism to bypass authentication.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires access to a jailbroken iOS device and the ability to perform runtime manipulation or to inject code via a malicious application. "
