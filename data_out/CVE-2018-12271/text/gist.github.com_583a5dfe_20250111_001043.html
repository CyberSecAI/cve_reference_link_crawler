|  | > [Description] |
| --- | --- |
|  | > \*\* DISPUTED \*\* An issue was discovered in the com.getdropbox.Dropbox |
|  | > app 100.2 for iOS. The LAContext class for Biometric (TouchID) |
|  | > validation allows authentication bypass by overriding the LAContext |
|  | > return Boolean value to be "true" because the |
|  | > kSecAccessControlUserPresence protection mechanism is not used. In |
|  | > other words, an attacker could authenticate with an arbitrary |
|  | > fingerprint. NOTE: the vendor indicates that this is not an attack of |
|  | > interest within the context of their threat model, which excludes |
|  | > iOS devices on which a jailbreak has occurred. |
|  | > |
|  | > ------------------------------------------ |
|  | > |
|  | > [Additional Information] |
|  | > The application implemented LAContext class on Biometric (TouchID) |
|  | > validation mechanism in Dropbox com.getdropbox.Dropbox (iOS: App Store |
|  | > Version 100.2) allows attacker to conduct runtime manipulation to |
|  | > bypass TouchID validation mechanism (Local authentication) by |
|  | > overriding the LAContext return Boolean value to be "true".Therefore |
|  | > invalid fingerprint on Dropbox authentication could be used to bypass |
|  | > the authentication checking in order to gain access into the app. |
|  | > |
|  | > Recommendation Implementing User Presence validation by using |
|  | > "kSecAccessControlUserPresence" attributes (Use the current TouchID of |
|  | > fingerprints when data saved to keychain. If current set changes, the |
|  | > TouchID evaluation fails) instead of using LAContext Class. |
