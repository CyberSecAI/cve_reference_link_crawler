The provided content describes a command injection vulnerability in the TOTOlink A7100RU router.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of user-supplied input within the `dayvalid` parameter. This parameter's value is passed to the `Uci_Set_Str` function, which then uses `snprintf` to format the input into a string that's passed to `cstesystem`, which then executes a command using `execv`. This chain of events allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands via the `dayvalid` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing execution of arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.
- Improper use of system calls: The use of `execv` with unsanitized user input is a direct cause of the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system.
- Full system compromise: Successful exploitation can lead to full compromise of the device, potentially allowing for data exfiltration, malware installation, or denial of service attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the router's web interface: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the router, implying they are either on the same local network or have remote access via exposed services.
- No authentication is specified, implying that the vulnerability may be reachable without prior authentication.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerable firmware version is TOTOlink A7100RU(V7.4cu.2313_B20191024).
- The attacker injects the command within the `dayvalid` parameter using the following payload `1$(ls>/tmp/123;)`.
- The successful execution of the injected command can be verified by checking the `/tmp/123` file.
- The content suggests that with further exploitation, a stable root shell can be obtained on the router.
