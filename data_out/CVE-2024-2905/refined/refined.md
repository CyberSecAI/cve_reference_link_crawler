    "ID": "CVE-2024-2905",
    "content": "The /etc/shadow, /etc/shadow-, /etc/gshadow and /etc/gshadow- files in a default build have the world-readable bit set.\n\nThis only impacts commits built with rpm-ostree starting with v2023.6.\n\nThis only impacts new installation and not updated systems thus systems installed from artifacts generated before this release are not impacted.\n\nOn systems with SELinux enabled and in enforcing mode, access to those files is limited to unconfined (usually interactive) users, unconfined systemd services and privileged containers. Confined daemons, users and containers are not able to access them.",
    "vulnerability": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability was introduced due to incorrect file permissions being set during the build process of rpm-ostree starting with version v2023.6.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect default file permissions",
        "World-readable access to sensitive files"
      ],
      "Impact": "Exposure of sensitive authentication data by allowing any user to read /etc/shadow, /etc/shadow-, /etc/gshadow, and /etc/gshadow- files, potentially leading to unauthorized access.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Local access to the system"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to the system where the vulnerable rpm-ostree version is installed. No special privileges are needed to read the files."
