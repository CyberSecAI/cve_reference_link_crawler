- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The StopBadBots plugin lacks proper authorization and CSRF protection in an AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect authorization, CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker, even with a low-privileged account like a subscriber, can install and activate arbitrary plugins from the WordPress plugin repository.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action=stopbadbots_install_plugin` parameter and the `slug` of the plugin to be installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site, even with a low-privileged role such as a subscriber. They can exploit this vulnerability by crafting an AJAX request using the browser's developer console, or by making a similar request through a crafted HTML page.
