The provided content relates to CVE-2022-48883.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of validation when creating IPoIB (IP over InfiniBand) child PKEY (Partition Key) interfaces. Specifically, a user could configure an arbitrary number of receive (rx) queues for a child interface via netlink. Child PKEY interfaces utilize the parent interface's receive channels. The number of rx queues is crucial because the parent's rx channel index is used to access the child's `channel_stats` array. If the child interface has fewer rx queues than its parent, out-of-bounds access could occur when trying to access `channel_stats` leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds access:** When a child interface has fewer rx queues than its parent, accessing `channel_stats` using the parent's rx channel index could result in accessing memory beyond the bounds of the child's allocated `channel_stats` array.
- **Lack of input validation:** The system failed to validate the number of receive queues during the creation of the child interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An out-of-bounds access can lead to a crash of the kernel.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a child PKEY interface with a number of rx queues less than its parent interface via netlink.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the capability to create network interfaces via netlink, meaning they would need to have some level of privilege on the system.
