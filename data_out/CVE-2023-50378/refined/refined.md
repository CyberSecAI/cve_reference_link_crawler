**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Lack of proper input validation and constraint enforcement in Apache Ambari.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized actions, ranging from data access to session hijacking.
- Delivery of malicious payloads.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is saved within the application (Ambari in this case).
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts that are executed when other users interact with the affected part of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to find a way to inject malicious code into a field/parameter that is then stored in the application's database or storage.
- Once injected, the attacker would likely need a user to access the malicious script (which is now part of the application).

**Affected Versions:**
- Apache Ambari versions 2.7.0 through 2.7.7 are affected.

**Resolution:**
- Upgrade to Apache Ambari version 2.7.8, which contains the fix for this issue.
