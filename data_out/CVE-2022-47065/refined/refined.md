Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `boa` binary of the TRENDNet TEW-820AP device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `send_redirect_perm` function within the `boa` binary, which handles HTTP requests.
- The `sprintf` function is used to copy the value of the "submit-url" parameter from a POST request to the `/boafrm/formNewSchedule` endpoint onto a stack buffer without proper bounds checking.
- This allows an attacker to provide an arbitrarily long string as the value of the "submit-url" parameter, causing a buffer overflow on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the stack overflow vulnerability can lead to:
  - Remote code execution (RCE): An attacker can overwrite return addresses on the stack to execute arbitrary code on the device.
  - Denial of service (DoS): The overflow can cause the `boa` process to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/boafrm/formNewSchedule` endpoint.
- The attacker must include an overly long string as the value of the "submit-url" parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the TRENDNet TEW-820AP device.
- They must be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web interface.
- No authentication is mentioned as a pre-requisite, suggesting that the vulnerability might be exploitable without authentication.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable firmware version is explicitly identified as 1.01.B01.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) Python script (`POC_for_formNewSchedule.py`) is mentioned for reproducing the vulnerability.
- The vendor, TRENDNet, has acknowledged the issue on their support page.
