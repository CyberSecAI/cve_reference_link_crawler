- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure default configuration of Liferay Portal and DXP where blog entries are not sanitized for JavaScript, allowing for XSS injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML into blog entries which will be executed when other users view the content, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, authenticated users can inject malicious code via a crafted payload into a blog entry's content text field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create or modify blog entries. The UI interaction occurs when another user views the malicious blog post.
