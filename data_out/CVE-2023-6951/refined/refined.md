Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-6951:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from the use of weak credentials for the Wi-Fi network generated by certain DJI drones. This means the WPA2 PSK (Pre-Shared Key) used to secure the Wi-Fi network is susceptible to being derived by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Use of Weak Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the employment of an easily guessable or derivable WPA2 PSK for the drone's Wi-Fi network.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can derive the WPA2 PSK and connect to the drone's Wi-Fi network without permission.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely, implying the attacker doesn't need physical access to the drone.
*   **Wi-Fi Network:** The vulnerability exists within the drone's Wi-Fi access point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within the range of the drone's Wi-Fi network.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs the ability to derive the weak WPA2 PSK, likely through known methods/tools.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not require prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability, they can derive the key without any existing credentials.

**Affected Products:**
*   Mavic 3 Pro below version 01.01.0300
*   Mavic 3 below version 01.00.1200
*   Mavic 3 Classic below version 01.00.0500
*   Mavic 3 Enterprise below version 7.01.10.03
*   Matrice 300 below version 57.00.01.00
*   Matrice M30 below version 07.01.0022
*  Mini 3 Pro below version 01.00.0620

**CVSS Details:**
*   CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N
*   CVSS Score: 6.6

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade the firmware of impacted models to the latest available version.
