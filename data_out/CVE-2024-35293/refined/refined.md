- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of authentication on two communication ports used by SCHNEIDER Elektronik's 700 series controllers. This allows an attacker to send malformed or unintended packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-862), leading to the ability to manipulate the system via unauthenticated network communication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS). The controller reboots and deletes its file system, which contains the program logic, resulting in significant disruption of operation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. The attacker needs access to the network segment where the affected SCHNEIDER Elektronik components are located.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be on the same network as the affected devices, and can send packets without needing prior authentication or credentials.
