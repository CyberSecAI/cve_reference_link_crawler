Security Advisory Report
SAR-202405-1

Vulnerability title
Unauthenticated filesystem wipe

Vulnerability description
An attacker who has access to the network where SCHNEIDER Elektronik components are located can cause a denial of service
while enumerating the network segment.
SCHNEIDER Elektronik's 700 series uses two ports for communication between controllers and for communication with the
programming software. Communication with these ports can occur without any form of authentication. This leads to the fact
that malformed or unintended packets can be sent to and be processed by the controller. This results in unintended behavior of
the controller that causes a reboot and deletes the file system which contains the program logic.
