{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure permissions in contour v1.14.4 and earlier versions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Incorrect Access Control allows attackers to access sensitive data and escalate privileges by obtaining the service account's token.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Compromise all Secrets components in Kubernetes, further compromise other components in the cluster, and potentially take over the entire Kubernetes cluster.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Stealing the service account's token from a pod running on a compromised worker node.",
    "Using the stolen token to authenticate with the API server.",
    "Accessing all secrets in the cluster using the acquired service account privileges.",
    "Using the sensitive information in the secrets to elevate privileges and take over the entire cluster."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control a worker node in the Kubernetes cluster and needs to be able to force a target pod to run on that node."
