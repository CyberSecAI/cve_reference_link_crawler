Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper handling of the `<embed>` tag within HTML by the Typora editor. Specifically, Typora doesn't sanitize or properly process the `src` attribute of the `<embed>` tag, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS, where malicious JavaScript code is injected and executed within the context of the Typora application.
- Insecure HTML parsing: The application's HTML parsing mechanism fails to prevent the execution of arbitrary scripts in embed tags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the Typora application.
- Potential for Data Exfiltration:  Malicious scripts can potentially access and exfiltrate sensitive data handled by Typora.
- Potential for Further Compromise: The attacker could use the execution context within Typora to perform additional malicious actions.
- Arbitrary File Operations: Though not explicitly stated, XSS could lead to the potential for file system access/manipulation through the browser context used by Typora.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted Markdown File: An attacker can create a specially crafted markdown file containing the malicious `<embed>` tag with a link to attacker-controlled JavaScript.
- Social Engineering: An attacker could use social engineering techniques to trick a Typora user into opening a malicious markdown file.
- File Sharing: Vulnerable Markdown files can be shared through various channels like email or file-sharing platforms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create or modify Markdown files: The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a markdown file.
- Ability to host JavaScript: The attacker needs to control a server to host a malicious javascript file.
- Social Engineering Skills: The attacker will need the capability to trick users into opening the crafted markdown files.
