| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1830805#c0)  Robert Scheck    2020-05-03 23:18:05 UTC  ``` Description of problem: By default, frr creates empty configuration files, however unfortunately with too wide permissions: As per <http://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/bgp.html>, /etc/frr/bgpd.conf is also meant to contain the BGP password for peerings/sessions, thus proper default permissions should be applied by frr when even creating this file for administrator convenience. Otherwise information leaks are eased.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): frr-7.0-5.el8.x86_64  How reproducible: See above and below.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. dnf install frr 2. sed -e 's/^zebra=no/zebra=yes/' -e 's/^bgpd=no/bgpd=yes/' -i /etc/frr/daemons 3. systemctl start frr.service 4. ls -l /etc/frr/bgpd.conf    -rw-r--r--. 1 frr frr 0 May  4 01:07 /etc/frr/bgpd.conf 5. ls -ld /etc/frr/    drwxr-xr-x. 2 frr frr 4096 May  4 01:07 /etc/frr/  Actual results: World-readable /etc/frr/bgpd.conf by default.  Expected results: /etc/frr/bgpd.conf should be maybe 640 by default.  Additional info: I did not investigate whether this is an upstream or a downstream issue, given frr.service seems to be built on an old initscript (/usr/lib/frr/frr) rather being a modern systemd unit.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1830805#c1)  Robert Scheck    2020-05-04 00:01:38 UTC  ``` As per <https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/blob/master/tools/frr.in#L100> this seems to be a possible frr vulnerability on upstream side rather a downstream mistake; please assign a CVE number.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1830805#c2)  Robert Scheck    2020-05-13 00:16:22 UTC  ``` Given the Red Hat Product Security team did not really care about this report, even after contacting secalert explicitly, I got in touch with upstream's security contact, which lead to <https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/pull/6383> which will be also backported to upstream stable branches.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1830805#c3)  Robert Scheck    2020-05-13 00:54:34 UTC  ``` Submitted CVE Request 892850 for CVE ID directly at MITRE.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1830805#c4)  Marian Rehak    2020-06-19 12:49:59 UTC  ``` Created frr tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1848993](show_bug.cgi?id=1848993 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2020-12831 frr: default permission issue eases information leaks [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1830805#c6)  Marco Benatto    2020-06-30 14:21:58 UTC  ``` Upstream commit for this issue: <https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/commit/5c9063771195bb51a8cc1c64f9924e53a0602817>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1830805#c8)  Marian Rehak    2020-07-03 14:44:03 UTC  ``` Hello Robert,  We are now handling this as a security issue. Thank you very much for reporting this earlier. May we acknowledge you as the reporter on our cve pages? If yes, how would you like to be called?  Best regards. Marian   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1830805#c9)  Robert Scheck    2020-07-06 14:33:53 UTC  ``` Hello Marian, yes, you may acknowledge me as the reporter, using just "Robert Scheck" is fine.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1830805#c10)  Marian Rehak    2020-07-23 16:02:36 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Robert Scheck   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1830805#c11)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-11-04 02:25:15 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
