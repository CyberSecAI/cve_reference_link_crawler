Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12831:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the default permissions assigned to configuration files created by the FRRouting (FRR) software, specifically `/etc/frr/bgpd.conf`.
- When FRR initializes, it creates empty configuration files, but these files are created with world-readable permissions (e.g., `-rw-r--r--`), which is insecure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Default Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is the creation of configuration files, particularly `bgpd.conf`, with overly permissive default file permissions.
- **Information Leak:** The `bgpd.conf` file is intended to store sensitive information, such as BGP passwords. World-readable permissions make this information easily accessible to unauthorized users on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read the configuration files, potentially exposing sensitive information such as BGP passwords.
- **Network Compromise:** With access to BGP passwords, an attacker might be able to compromise network routing.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the system (including low-privileged users) can exploit this vulnerability to read the configuration files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have local access to the affected system where FRR is installed.
- No specific user privileges are necessary as long as the user has permissions to read files with the permissions set by the service.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was identified in the upstream FRR project.
- A fix was implemented in the FRR init script to use a more restrictive configfile mode.
- The issue was also present in the old init scripts, which were also fixed, though the plan is to remove the older init scripts in the future.
- The fix sets the file mode to 640, which is more restrictive than the previous 644.
