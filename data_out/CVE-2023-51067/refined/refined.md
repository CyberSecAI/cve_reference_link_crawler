- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unauthenticated reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected XSS vulnerability. The username parameter within the login task is vulnerable to XSS injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** A crafted URL is used to inject malicious JavaScript into the vulnerable parameter. The victim must click on the crafted link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload. The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The victim needs to click the malicious link to trigger the XSS.
