  "CVE-2024-3738": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": [
      {
        "root_cause": "Inadequate input validation and sanitization, use of user-controlled paths and commands, and insecure file handling during upload and decompression.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper handling of shell metacharacters, allowing command injection.",
          "Path traversal vulnerabilities via zip file entries.",
          "Lack of proper validation of file uploads, allowing malicious file uploads.",
          "Insecure decompression of zip files in user-controlled directories.",
            "Use of user-controlled data in the construction of system commands"
        ],
        "impact": "Remote code execution (RCE) leading to server compromise and potential loss of server privileges.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Malicious zip file uploads with crafted filenames containing path traversal sequences (`../`).",
          "Command injection via specially crafted parameters to the `runCmd` function, exploiting insufficient sanitization of shell metacharacters.",
            "Exploitation of insecure configuration options that accept user-supplied values for binary execution paths."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to upload files and/or manipulate configuration parameters via the application's user interface.",
          "additional_info": "The vulnerability is present in versions 3.9.8 and 3.9.9 and was fixed in version 4.2.4. The vulnerability can be exploited to achieve RCE by abusing various aspects of the application's architecture, including zip file uploads, command execution, and configuration management, and is due to lack of validation and sanitization of user inputs and paths."
