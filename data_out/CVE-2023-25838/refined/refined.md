- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote, authorized attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands against the back-end database. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors**: 
    - Remote attack vector: Via network, targeting ArcGIS Enterprise.
    - Local attack vector: Targeting the ArcGIS Insights Desktop application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - For remote attacks, the attacker needs to be authorized (has valid credentials) and able to send network requests.
    - For local attacks, the attacker needs to have local access to the machine where ArcGIS Insights Desktop is installed and be an authorized user.
    - Exploitation requires generating crafted input, which is described as complex and requiring significant effort.
