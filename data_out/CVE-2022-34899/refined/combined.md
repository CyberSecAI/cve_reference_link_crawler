Please note, after **April 30, 2024**, Parallels Access will no longer receive support and you will no longer be able to use Parallels Access in any environment.

## Why are we taking this action?

Advancements in technology and shifts in the market landscape have led us to re-evaluate our product lineup.

As a result, we have decided to discontinue our development and support of Parallels Access. This decision allows us to concentrate our resources on developing and enhancing other Parallels products that continue to deliver value and innovation.

We remain focused on delivering high-quality solutions that best meet the evolving needs of our customers.

## What this means for you right now

### Purchases and renewals

Effective immediately, Parallels Access will no longer be available for purchase or renewal. We encourage you to look for an alternative solution that suits your needs. If your license term ends before March 5, 2024, you do not need to take any action. Your term will end on your license expiration date and will not be renewed.

### For current Parallels Access subscribers

If you have purchased a Parallels Access subscription, please note that your Parallels Access service will remain operational and supported until April 30, 2024. After this date, please be aware that the application will cease to function on all platforms and environments.

### Usage of Parallels Access offered as a bonus software for a Parallels Desktop license

If you are actively using Parallels Access through your Parallels Desktop subscription, you will continue to receive support until April 30, 2024. We encourage you to begin exploring alternative solutions to ensure a smooth transition once Parallels Access becomes unavailable.
