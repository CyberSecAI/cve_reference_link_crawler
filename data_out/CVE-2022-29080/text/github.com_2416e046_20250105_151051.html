### **[xiaofen9](/xiaofen9)** commented [Apr 6, 2022](#issue-1195102405)

| Hi,  Thanks for devloping this great npm package! We find a potential command injection vulnerabilty from it. The bug is caused by the fact that package-exported method fail to sanitize `pkgs` parameter and let it flow into a sensitive command execution API.  Here is the proof of concept.  ``` const dependencyVersions = require("./index.js") dependencyVersions({"pkgs":["|touch rce"]}) ```  Please consider fix it. thanks! |
