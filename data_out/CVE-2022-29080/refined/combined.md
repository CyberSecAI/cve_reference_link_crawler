# depver

## Install

```
npmÂ iÂ -gÂ npm-dependency-versions
```
## Binary dependencies

You'll need node & npm. Detective mode also requires git to be on the path.

## CLI

**Usage:** `depver [packages...]`

Determine the latest available version of npm packages at a given point in time. Parses local `package.json` if no packages are specified. Git blames local `package.json` to infer dates if no dates are specified either.

| Options: |  |
| --- | --- |
| `-h, --help` | output usage information |
| `-d, --date [date]` | the date at which the packages should be versioned (defaults to the present moment) |
| `-o, --output [filename]` | file to write the output to (defaults to stdout) |

## Examples

```
depver
```

Assumes you are in the root of an npm package (which does not need to be published on npmjs.org), which is git versioned. Git blames `package.json` in the current folder, determines when each dependency entry was added, and queries npmjs.org to determine which specific version of each dependency would have been returned at that time given the version range specified.

```
depverÂ --date=2016-07-06
```

Assumes you are in the root of an npm package. Determines what versions of each dependency in the local `package.json` would have satisfied the specified version range therein on 2016-07-06.

```
depverÂ mithrilÂ urijsÂ --date=2016-07-06
```

Determines what the latest versions of `mithril` and `urijs` would have been on 2016-07-06.

### **[xiaofen9](/xiaofen9)** commented [Apr 6, 2022](#issue-1195102405)

| Hi,  Thanks for devloping this great npm package! We find a potential command injection vulnerabilty from it. The bug is caused by the fact that package-exported method fail to sanitize `pkgs` parameter and let it flow into a sensitive command execution API.  Here is the proof of concept.  ``` const dependencyVersions = require("./index.js") dependencyVersions({"pkgs":["|touch rce"]}) ```  Please consider fix it. thanks! |
