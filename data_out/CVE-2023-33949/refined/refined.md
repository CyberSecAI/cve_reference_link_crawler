- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The default configuration of Liferay Portal and Liferay DXP does not require users to verify their email addresses.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure default configuration, specifically the lack of mandatory email verification.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can create accounts using fake or uncontrolled email addresses. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as spamming, impersonation, or other forms of abuse, potentially damaging the system's reputation and user trust.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access by creating accounts through the user registration functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to access the Liferay instance remotely and create new user accounts. No special permissions or position is required.
