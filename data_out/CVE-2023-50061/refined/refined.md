Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50061:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of SQL parameters within the `Oparteasyredirect::hookActionDispatcher()` method in the "Opart Easy Redirect" module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the module uses `htmlentities()` but not `pSQL()` on user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The module is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the lack of proper sanitization of input used in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete compromise of PrestaShop:** Attackers can potentially gain admin access, remove data from the database, copy data from sensitive tables (including tokens and admin AJAX scripts), and modify SMTP settings to intercept emails.
- **Data breach:** Sensitive information stored in the PrestaShop database can be exfiltrated.
- **Malicious actions:** Attackers could modify data and settings to disrupt the shop.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No authentication needed:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a guest user, requiring no prior authentication or privileges on the PrestaShop platform.
- **Low skill:** The exploit is very simple to trigger, requiring minimal technical skills.
- **Vulnerable PHP versions:** The vulnerability can be exploited on PHP versions 5.x, 7.x, and 8.0-.
