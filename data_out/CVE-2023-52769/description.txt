In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: fix htt mlo-offset event locking

The ath12k active pdevs are protected by RCU but the htt mlo-offset
event handling code calling ath12k_mac_get_ar_by_pdev_id() was not
marked as a read-side critical section.

Mark the code in question as an RCU read-side critical section to avoid
any potential use-after-free issues.

Compile tested only.
