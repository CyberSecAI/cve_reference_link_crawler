### Description

Hi,

I found a vulnerability in the auto-completion plugin.

The auto-completion plugin exposes an XML file containing all the words typed inside the posts both private and public. This file is exposed without authentication at :

<https://www.adomain.tld/plugins/web/service/search/auto-completion/adomain/en.xml>

It is possible for an attacker to extract the complete content of the xml file even with the limit set to 10 matching results using API scrapping techniques such as this one: <https://podalirius.net/en/articles/scraping-search-apis-depth-first-style/>

The information present in this xml file can contain sensitive information such as passwords, IP addresses, usernames and emails. I successfully managed to get a list of valid usernames from this auto-completion XML file in one of my clients apps, without authentication.

**Fix:** I think the auto-completion plugin should not expose this XML file at all, but if it does it should be at least protected by authentication.

Best regards,
