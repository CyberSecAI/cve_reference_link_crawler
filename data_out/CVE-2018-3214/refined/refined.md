Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-3214:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an infinite loop within the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) reader implementation in OpenJDK.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way the RIFF format reader processes the data, causing an infinite loop when parsing certain RIFF files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The vulnerable application or system will become unresponsive due to the infinite loop.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the processing of a malicious or specially crafted RIFF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious RIFF file to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or credentials on the target system. The ability to provide the crafted RIFF file to the vulnerable Java application is sufficient for the DoS attack.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability affects applications utilizing vulnerable versions of OpenJDK. This includes:
    *   IBM Java SE version 7 & 8
    *   Oracle Java SE versions 6, 7, 8, & 11
    *   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 & 7, as well as their derivatives and extended support versions, when running the affected OpenJDK packages, and various products that use vulnerable versions of Java.
    *   Debian 8 'Jessie' when running the affected OpenJDK version.
    *   Ubuntu 16.04 LTS when running the affected OpenJDK version.
    *   NetApp products integrating the vulnerable Java SE library.
*   **Specific Vulnerable Component:** The vulnerability resides in the "Sound" component of OpenJDK, specifically when reading RIFF formatted files.
*   **Mitigation:** Updating to patched versions of OpenJDK is essential to mitigate this vulnerability. Affected systems must restart all running Java instances after updates to apply the patches.
