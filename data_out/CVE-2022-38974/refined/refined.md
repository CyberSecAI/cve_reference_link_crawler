- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can perform actions that should only be accessible to higher-privileged users. The specific impact can vary.
- **Attack vectors:** Not explicitly stated, but it involves exploiting a function where access control checks are missing
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber (an unprivileged user in WordPress)
