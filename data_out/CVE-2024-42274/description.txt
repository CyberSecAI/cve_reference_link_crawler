In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Revert "ALSA: firewire-lib: operate for period elapse event in process context"

Commit 7ba5ca32fe6e ("ALSA: firewire-lib: operate for period elapse event
in process context") removed the process context workqueue from
amdtp_domain_stream_pcm_pointer() and update_pcm_pointers() to remove
its overhead.

With RME Fireface 800, this lead to a regression since
Kernels 5.14.0, causing an AB/BA deadlock competition for the
substream lock with eventual system freeze under ALSA operation:

thread 0:
    * (lock A) acquire substream lock by
	snd_pcm_stream_lock_irq() in
	snd_pcm_status64()
    * (lock B) wait for tasklet to finish by calling
    	tasklet_unlock_spin_wait() in
	tasklet_disable_in_atomic() in
	ohci_flush_iso_completions() of ohci.c

thread 1:
    * (lock B) enter tasklet
    * (lock A) attempt to acquire substream lock,
    	waiting for it to be released:
	snd_pcm_stream_lock_irqsave() in
    	snd_pcm_period_elapsed() in
	update_pcm_pointers() in
	process_ctx_payloads() in
	process_rx_packets() of amdtp-stream.c

Restore the process context work queue to prevent deadlock
AB/BA deadlock competition for ALSA substream lock of
snd_pcm_stream_lock_irq() in snd_pcm_status64()
and snd_pcm_stream_lock_irqsave() in snd_pcm_period_elapsed().

revert commit 7ba5ca32fe6e ("ALSA: firewire-lib: operate for period
elapse event in process context")

Replace inline description to prevent future deadlock.
