# Submit #425283: code-projects Pharmacy Management System 1.0 SQL Injection[info](?kb.submission)

| Title | code-projects Pharmacy Management System 1.0 SQL Injection |
| --- | --- |
| Description | A critical SQL injection vulnerability was identified in the Pharmacy Management System version 1.0, specifically in the supplier validation functionality when checking if a supplier is active (is\_active). This flaw arises from improper sanitization of the name parameter, which is sent via a GET request to the endpoint /php/add\_new\_purchase.php?action=is\_supplier. An attacker can exploit this flaw to inject and execute arbitrary SQL commands, compromising the security and integrity of the system's database. This vulnerability poses a significant risk, as it can expose sensitive supplier information and disrupt operations by manipulating purchase flows. With no available patch, this flaw remains critical, requiring immediate attention to prevent data leaks, unauthorized access, or operational disruptions. |

## **Affected Version:**

* **Pharmacy Management System**: 1.0

## **Vulnerability Information:**

* **Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection
* **Severity:** CRITICAL
* **Status:** Unpatched

## **Vulnerable Endpoint:**

* `/php/add_new_purchase.php?action=is_supplier&name=aaaa`

## **Vulnerability Description:**

A critical SQL injection vulnerability was identified in the **Pharmacy Management System** version 1.0, specifically in the **supplier validation functionality** when checking if a supplier is active (`is_active`). This flaw arises from improper sanitization of the `name` parameter, which is sent via a **GET** request to the endpoint `/php/add_new_purchase.php?action=is_supplier`. An attacker can exploit this flaw to inject and execute arbitrary SQL commands, compromising the security and integrity of the system's database.

This vulnerability poses a significant risk, as it can expose sensitive supplier information and disrupt operations by manipulating purchase flows. With no available patch, this flaw remains critical, requiring immediate attention to prevent data leaks, unauthorized access, or operational disruptions.

---

## **Proof of Concept (PoC):**

Below is an example of a **GET** request that demonstrates how the SQL injection can be exploited through the `name` parameter:

```
