The provided content relates to CVE-2024-26888.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A memory leak occurs in the Bluetooth subsystem when sending the `MSFT_OP_LE_MONITOR_ADVERTISEMENT` command. The buffer `cp` allocated to hold the command parameters was not being freed in the error case when `__hci_cmd_sync` fails.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Memory Leak: The allocated memory for `cp` is not freed when the command sending fails.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Repeatedly triggering the vulnerable code path would lead to a memory leak which could potentially lead to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could potentially trigger this vulnerability by repeatedly attempting to add address filters via the Bluetooth interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to interact with the Bluetooth interface and trigger the functionality that adds address filters.
