The provided content relates to CVE-2024-33153.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `com.j2eefast.framework.sys.controller.SysMsgPushController: com.j2eefast.common.core.utils.ResponseData commetList()` function in J2EEFAST does not filter `sql_filter` parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL injection vulnerability exists because the application fails to sanitize user-provided `sql_filter` parameters before using them in SQL queries. The `findPage` function in `SysMsgCommentsMapper.xml` is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious SQL payloads through the vulnerable parameter. This could allow the attacker to read, modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `sql_filter` parameter passed to the `commetList()` function of the `SysMsgPushController`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send requests with a malicious SQL payload in the `sql_filter` parameter to the affected `commetList()` function.
