Insufficient session timeout vulnerability in the FAST3686 V2 Vodafone router from Sagemcom. This vulnerability could allow a local attacker to access the administration panel without requiring login credentials. This vulnerability is possible because the 'Login.asp and logout.asp' files do not handle session details correctly.
