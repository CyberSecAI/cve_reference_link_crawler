Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1623:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient session timeout management in the FAST3686 V2 Vodafone router's web interface.
*   Specifically, the `Login.asp` and `logout.asp` files do not properly handle session details.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient Session Timeout (CWE-613):** The router fails to properly invalidate or expire user sessions, potentially leaving them active even after the user has seemingly logged out.

**Impact of exploitation:**
