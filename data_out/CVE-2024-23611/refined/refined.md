- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing bounds checks in LabVIEW, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can result in remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker provides a user with a specially crafted VI (Virtual Instrument) file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious VI to a user who will then open it with a vulnerable version of LabVIEW.
