- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Bitdefender Total Security HTTPS scanning functionality incorrectly trusts certificates that are not authorized to issue certificates, specifically when the "Basic Constraints" extension indicates the certificate is meant to be an "End Entity".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper certificate validation, specifically regarding the "Basic Constraints" extension. The software does not properly check if a certificate is authorized to act as a Certificate Authority.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, allowing them to intercept and potentially modify communications between the user and websites. This could lead to data theft, manipulation of web content, or injection of malicious code.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the victim. This could be a local network or a shared Wi-Fi connection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic (e.g., on the same local network) and have the capability to create and present a malicious certificate that is incorrectly trusted by Bitdefender. The attacker also requires some user interaction (UI:A). The attacker needs to be in a position where they can perform a man in the middle attack which can be an adjacent network or a network under attacker control.
