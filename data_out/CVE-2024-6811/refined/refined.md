- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing WSQ files, which can lead to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves user interaction, where the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious WSQ file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious WSQ file or host it on a malicious page that the target user interacts with.
