Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-29026:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a misconfigured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy in the `auth.go` file of the Owncast project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Lenient CORS Policy:** The server was reflecting the `Origin` header in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header, allowing any origin to make cross-origin requests to the admin API.
*   **`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` set to `true`:** This setting, along with the vulnerable CORS policy, allowed the attacker to make authenticated requests, sending credentials (cookies, HTTP authentication) along with the requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to make requests to sensitive admin endpoints, such as `http://owncast.domain/api/admin/serverconfig`, and extract the admin password, resulting in a potential account takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cross-Origin Request:** The attack is performed through a malicious website controlled by the attacker. When a logged-in admin of the Owncast instance visits this site, the attacker can use JavaScript to initiate cross-origin requests to the vulnerable admin API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Hosting a Malicious Website:** The attacker needs to host a web page containing malicious JavaScript that initiates the cross-origin request.
*   **Target User Interaction:** The attack requires a logged-in Owncast administrator to visit the malicious website.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerable code snippet from `router/middleware/auth.go`:
```go
w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", r.Header.Get("Origin"))
w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", "true")
w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization")
```
* The provided exploit HTML example steals the admin password via an XHR call
```html
<html>
<body>
<script>
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (xhr.readyState == XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {
        alert(xhr.responseText);
    }
}
xhr.open('GET', 'http://owncast.domain/api/admin/serverconfig', true);
xhr.withCredentials = true;
xhr.send(null);
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Resolution:**
* The vulnerability was patched by limiting the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to `http://localhost:3000` to support Owncast development

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered using a CodeQL query designed to detect CORS misconfigurations.
*   The commit `9215d9ba0f29d62201d3feea9e77dcd274581624` addresses the vulnerability.
