- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An authentication bypass vulnerability exists due to the way Jira Service Management handles signup tokens for users who have never logged in.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Insecure handling of signup tokens.
    - Exposure of signup tokens through email notifications and Jira issue/request participation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can impersonate another user and gain unauthorized access to a Jira Service Management instance. This could allow the attacker to view, modify, or delete sensitive information within the Jira instance.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - An attacker gains access to signup tokens by being included on Jira issues or requests with users who have never logged in.
    - An attacker gains access to emails containing "View Request" links intended for users who have never logged in.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs write access to a User Directory.
    - Outgoing email needs to be enabled on the Jira Service Management instance.
    - The attacker must either be included on Jira issues or requests with targeted users (who have never logged in) or gain access to emails containing "View Request" links for those users.
