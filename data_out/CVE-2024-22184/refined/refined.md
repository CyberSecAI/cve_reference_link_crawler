Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an uncontrolled search path in Intel® Quartus® Prime Pro Edition Design Software. This means the software may search for required files in locations that are not properly restricted, allowing an attacker to potentially influence which files are loaded.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the uncontrolled search path, which allows for a potential path traversal vulnerability. This is often due to the application's failure to validate or sanitize the paths used when loading resources.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to privilege escalation. An attacker could potentially load malicious libraries or other executables in place of legitimate ones, gaining higher privileges than they should have.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local access. An attacker must have some level of access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Local Access:** The attacker must have some form of access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the system, but may not initially require high privileges.
    * **User Interaction:** User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   **Physical Presence (CVSS 4.0):** CVSS 4.0 specifies physical presence is required to trigger the vulnerability

**Summary of CVSS Metrics:**

*   **CVSS v3.1:**
    *   **Base Score:** 6.7 (Medium)
    *   **Vector:** AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
        *   **AV:L (Local):** The vulnerability is exploitable with local access.
        *   **AC:H (High):** The attack complexity is high, likely requiring specific conditions or configurations to be met.
        *   **PR:L (Low):** Low privileges are required.
        *   **UI:R (Required):** User interaction is required.
        *   **S:U (Unchanged):** The vulnerability does not affect components beyond the vulnerable software.
        *   **C:H (High):** High impact to confidentiality.
        *   **I:H (High):** High impact to integrity.
        *   **A:H (High):** High impact to availability.
*   **CVSS v4.0:**
    *   **Base Score:** 5.4 (Medium)
    *   **Vector:** AV:L/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N
        *   **AV:L (Local):** The vulnerability is exploitable with local access.
        *  **AC:H (High):** High attack complexity.
        *  **AT:P (Physical):** Physical presence is required to trigger the vulnerability.
        *   **PR:L (Low):** Low privileges are required.
        *   **UI:A (Attended):** Attended user interaction is required.
        *  **VC:H (High):** High impact to confidentiality.
        *  **VI:H (High):** High impact to integrity.
        *  **VA:H (High):** High impact to availability.
        *   **SC:N (No Scope Change):** No scope change.
        *   **SI:N (No Integrity Impact):** No integrity impact to the scope.
        *   **SA:N (No Availability Impact):** No availability impact to the scope.

The document also states that Intel released software updates to mitigate this issue and recommends updating to version 24.1 or later.
