Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-20762:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient access control in the Common Execution Environment (CEE) ConfD CLI of Cisco Ultra Cloud Core - Subscriber Microservices Infrastructure (SMI) software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The vulnerability is due to a lack of sufficient access controls within the CEE ConfD CLI, which allows unauthorized privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker with low privileges can escalate to *root* privileges, allowing them to access privileged containers. This can lead to complete control over the affected system.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability Impact:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability has high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access (AV:L):** The attacker must have local access to the affected device.
*   **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** The vulnerability is easily exploitable.
*   **Low Privileges Required (PR:L):** An attacker only requires low level access to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction Required (UI:N):** No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Unchanged Scope (S:U):** The scope of impact is limited to the vulnerable component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to authenticate as a CEE ConfD CLI user on the targeted device.
*   The attacker needs to be able to execute specific CLI commands.

**Additional Details:**
*   Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
*   There are no workarounds that fully address this vulnerability, but administrators can reduce the scope of the vulnerability by preventing non-administrative users from executing CEE ConfD CLI commands. The provided workaround is not guaranteed to work in all environments.
*   Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
*   This vulnerability was found during internal security testing by Andrew Kim of the Cisco Advanced Security Initiatives Group (ASIG).
*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Ultra Cloud Core SMI.
*   Fixed software releases are available for specific releases, but some require migration to a fixed release.
*   The base CVSS score is 7.8 which is considered High Severity
