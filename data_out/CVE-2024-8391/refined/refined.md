- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The gRPC server in Eclipse Vert.x versions 4.3.0 to 4.5.9 does not limit the maximum size of the message payload. This allows a large message payload to be sent which can cause excessive memory consumption on the server or client.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling. The gRPC message decoder uses the default limit allowed by the gRPC HTTP/2 transport (2^32 bytes).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could send excessively large gRPC messages, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and denial-of-service on the server or client.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a gRPC message with an oversized payload to a vulnerable server or client.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to communicate with the gRPC server and send messages to it. No authentication or special privileges are required to trigger this vulnerability.
