- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application lacks sufficient protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Specifically, the `keyWord_deal.php` endpoint does not properly validate the origin of the request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The application does not use proper CSRF tokens to validate the requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a victim user, such as deleting keywords in this specific case.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTML page containing a form that submits a request to the vulnerable endpoint. When a victim user visits the attacker's page while logged into the vulnerable application, the malicious form will be submitted, triggering the unauthorized action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host or inject a malicious HTML page that the victim user will visit while being authenticated to the vulnerable application.
