Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1056:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the FunnelKit Funnel Builder Pro plugin's use of the `wp_kses_allowed_html` filter. The plugin's 'allow_iframe_tag_in_post' function globally allows script and iframe tags within posts. This bypasses the intended HTML sanitization, leading to the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is Stored XSS. Malicious scripts are saved in the database and executed when a user accesses the affected page.
- **Improper Input Neutralization:** The plugin fails to sanitize user-provided input, specifically HTML tags, before storing them in the database, which leads to the execution of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will execute in the context of a user's browser session when viewing an affected page.
- **Data Theft:** The injected script can be designed to steal sensitive user data, such as cookies, session tokens, or login credentials.
- **Session Hijacking:** If session data is stolen, attackers can impersonate legitimate users on the WordPress site.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers can use XSS to modify the appearance or behavior of the website.
- **Malware Distribution:** An attacker can inject code that redirects users to malicious websites or prompts downloads of malicious software.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Authenticated Users:** The attack vector requires a user account with "Contributor" level access or higher.
- **Plugin Functionality:** The vulnerability is in the `allow_iframe_tag_in_post` function which utilizes the `wp_kses_allowed_html` filter to allow script and iframe tags within posts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **WordPress Account:** An attacker must have a WordPress user account with a role of "Contributor" or higher.
- **Access to Post Editing:** The attacker needs the ability to create or edit posts where they can insert malicious HTML content.
