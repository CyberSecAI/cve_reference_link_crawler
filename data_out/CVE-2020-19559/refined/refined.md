Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the insecure deserialization of XML data within the .NET Remoting service used by the Diebold ATM software. Specifically, the `RemotingConfiguration.Configure()` function loads a server configuration that sets `typeFilterLevel="Full"`, enabling the deserialization of arbitrary types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The application deserializes untrusted XML data, which can be manipulated to execute arbitrary code. The use of `.NET Remoting` with `typeFilterLevel="Full"` makes the application vulnerable to this attack.
*   **Exposed Service:** The vulnerable service (Spiservice.exe) listens on port 8043 and is publicly accessible, increasing the attack surface.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:**  The application doesn't properly validate or sanitize the incoming XML data before deserialization, allowing malicious payloads to be processed.
*   **Insufficient Network Segmentation/Isolation:**  The ATM network was not sufficiently isolated, allowing remote access to the vulnerable service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the ATM machine by sending a specially crafted XML payload to the vulnerable service.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain full control of the ATM machine, potentially leading to unauthorized financial transactions, malware installation, and data breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attacker sends a malicious HTTP SOAP request containing a crafted XML payload to the exposed service listening on port 8043 of the ATM.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the ATM on port 8043. This implies they could be on the same network, or if the port is exposed, on a different network.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs a strong understanding of .NET Remoting, XML deserialization vulnerabilities, and SOAP protocol to create the exploit. They also need the ability to craft specific XML payloads with the correct method names to bypass the initial errors and achieve code execution.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable service is `Spiservice.exe`, which is part of Diebold's XFS services.
*   The software uses the `Aglis XFS for Opteva` version 4.1.61.1.
*   The attacker leverages .NET Remoting's XML deserialization capabilities by manipulating the `System.Runtime.Remoting` library.
*   The article mentions the initial exploit attempt failed due to method name resolution issues and how the attackers bypassed this limitation.
*   The article also indicates the vulnerability was successfully tested on multiple ATMs.

This vulnerability is a classic example of how insecure deserialization can lead to severe security breaches, and it highlights the importance of secure coding practices when dealing with user-controlled data.
