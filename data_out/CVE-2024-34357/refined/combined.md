Categories:
[Development](/help/security-advisories/development "Development"),

[TYPO3 CMS](/help/security-advisories/typo3-cms "TYPO3 CMS")

Created by Oliver Hader

It has been discovered that TYPO3 CMS is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

---

* **Component Type:** TYPO3 CMS

---

### Problem Description

Failing to properly encode user-controlled values in file entities, the *ShowImageController (eID tx\_cms\_showpic)* is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Exploiting this vulnerability requires a valid backend user account with access to file entities.

### Solution

Update to TYPO3 versions 9.5.48 ELTS, 10.4.45 ELTS, 11.5.37 LTS, 12.4.15 LTS, 13.1.1 that fix the problem described.

### Credits

Thanks to TYPO3 security team member Torben Hansen who reported this issue and to TYPO3 core & security team member Oliver Hader who fixed the issue.

### General Advice

Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Guide](https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/CoreApiReference/Security/Index.html#security). Please subscribe to the [typo3-announce](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce) mailing list.

### General Note

## Package

composer

typo3/cms-core
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

9.0.0-9.5.47, 10.0.0-10.4.44, 11.0.0-11.5.36, 12.0.0-12.4.14, 13.0.0-13.1.0

## Patched versions

## Description

### Problem

Failing to properly encode user-controlled values in file entities, the `ShowImageController` (*eID tx\_cms\_showpic*) is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Exploiting this vulnerability requires a valid backend user account with access to file entities.

### Solution

Update to TYPO3 versions 9.5.48 ELTS, 10.4.45 ELTS, 11.5.37 LTS, 12.4.15 LTS, 13.1.1 that fix the problem described.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
