Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-34357

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `ShowImageController` (eID `tx_cms_showpic`) in TYPO3 CMS fails to properly encode user-controlled values within file entities. Specifically, the file properties like 'alternative', 'title', 'width', and 'height' were not being properly sanitized before being used in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the HTML output of the `ShowImageController`. This can lead to:
    - Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
    - Stealing of session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacement of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
- A valid backend user account with access to file entities is required (PR:L).
- User interaction is required (UI:R).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs a valid backend user account with permissions to modify file metadata/properties.
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into file properties such as title, alternative text, width or height.
- The attacker has to cause a victim to trigger the `ShowImageController` to render the manipulated data.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability resides within the TYPO3 CMS frontend rendering component (ext:frontend).
- The vulnerable code is in `typo3/sysext/frontend/Classes/Controller/ShowImageController.php`.
- The fix involves encoding all file properties, including `alternative`, `title`, `width`, and `height`, using `htmlspecialchars()` before including them in HTML output.
- The vulnerability affects TYPO3 versions 9.0.0 to 9.5.47, 10.0.0 to 10.4.44, 11.0.0 to 11.5.36, 12.0.0 to 12.4.14, and 13.0.0 to 13.1.0.
- The patched versions are 9.5.48, 10.4.45, 11.5.37, 12.4.15, and 13.1.1.

**CVSS Score:**

- The CVSS score is 5.4 (Moderate), with the vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.
