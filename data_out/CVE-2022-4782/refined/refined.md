The provided content relates to CVE-2022-4782.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ClickFunnels plugin does not properly validate and escape a shortcode attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization of the `url` attribute within the `clickfunnels_embed` shortcode.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a website, which can be executed when a user views the affected page. This could lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, phishing, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors**: A user with Contributor role or higher can insert a crafted `clickfunnels_embed` shortcode with malicious JavaScript into a post/page which will then be rendered in the browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least Contributor role access in WordPress, and be able to insert a malicious shortcode within a page or post.
