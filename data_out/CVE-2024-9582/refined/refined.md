### Root cause of vulnerability
The Accordion Slider plugin for WordPress versions up to 1.9.11 suffers from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the ‘html’ attribute of an accordion slider.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
The plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The lack of proper sanitization of the ‘html’ attribute allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts.

### Impact of exploitation
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the HTML attribute of accordion sliders. When a user views a page containing an exploited slider, the attacker's script will execute in the user's browser. This can potentially lead to:
*   Session hijacking
*   Malware distribution
*   Defacement
*   Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

### Attack vectors
The vulnerability can be exploited by modifying the 'html' attribute of an accordion slider through the plugin's interface.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
*   The attacker must have Contributor-level access or higher to WordPress.
*   The attacker needs access to the Accordion Slider plugin's admin area. By default, this is restricted to Administrators, and Contributors need admin to provide access through the `Access` plugin setting.
