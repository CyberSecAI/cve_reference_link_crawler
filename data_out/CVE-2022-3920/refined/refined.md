- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `/v1/internal/ui/nodes` and `/v1/internal/ui/services` HTTP endpoints in Consul do not properly filter information by ACL policies when cluster peering is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control, information disclosure vulnerability, failure to enforce ACL policies.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can access node and service information that was imported through cluster peering without requiring an ACL token. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information about services and infrastructure in peered clusters.
- **Attack vectors:** By accessing the `/v1/internal/ui/nodes` and `/v1/internal/ui/services` HTTP endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No ACL token is required to exploit this vulnerability, suggesting that it can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the affected endpoints. The attacker would need to have access to the Consul cluster to make the HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
