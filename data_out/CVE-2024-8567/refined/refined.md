Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8567 (Although this CVE ID is a placeholder, the content clearly describes a SQL Injection vulnerability)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the `id` parameter in the `ajax.php` file of the "Payroll Management System." This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization/validation of user input.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied data before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access: Attackers can gain access to the application's database without proper authorization.
- Sensitive data leakage: Attackers can extract sensitive information stored in the database.
- Data modification/deletion: Attackers can modify or delete data stored in the database.
- System compromise: Attackers may gain comprehensive system control.
- Service interruption: The vulnerability can lead to service disruptions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `ajax.php` with the `action=delete_deductions` parameter.
- The malicious SQL injection payload is inserted via the `id` parameter in the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be logged in or authorized.
- The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP POST request with a malicious SQL payload.
- Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is a boolean-based blind SQL injection.
- The vulnerable parameter is `id` (POST).
- The provided PoC demonstrates a boolean-based blind payload to confirm the vulnerability: `id=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (2978=2978) THEN 1 ELSE (SELECT 7087 UNION SELECT 8578) END))`

**Suggested Remediation:**
1. **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:**  This is a primary measure to prevent SQL injection by treating input as data, not code.
2.  **Input validation and filtering:** Implement strict validation and filtering of user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format.
3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use least privilege principle for database access. The application should not use accounts with high privileges for routine operations.
4.  **Regular security audits:** Regularly conduct code and system security audits.
