Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1**

*   **Root Cause:** The `formSysCmd` function directly uses user-supplied input in a system command without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Command Injection. The `sysCmd` parameter is directly incorporated into a shell command executed by the `system()` function.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Remote Command Execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the device's operating system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** HTTP POST request to the `/goform/formSysCmd` endpoint. The `sysCmd` parameter is used to inject a malicious payload.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the device, which usually requires network access to the device's management interface.

**Vulnerability 2**

*   **Root Cause:** The `formUpgradeCert` function uses user-provided input (the `upname` parameter) in a system command. The input is not sanitized before being used in the `sprintf` function and then passed to the system function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Command Injection. The `upname` parameter is concatenated into a string that is executed as a shell command.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Remote Command Execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the device's operating system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** HTTP POST request to the `/goform/formUpgradeCert` endpoint. The `upname` parameter is used to inject a malicious payload.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the device, requiring network access to the device's management interface.

**Vulnerability 3**

*   **Root Cause:** The `formDelcert` function uses user-supplied data (the `certs` parameter) in a system command without sanitization.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Command Injection. The `certs` parameter is concatenated into a string which is passed to the `system` function
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Remote Command Execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the device's operating system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** HTTP POST request to the `/goform/formDelcert` endpoint. The `certs` parameter is used to inject a malicious payload.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the device, which typically involves network access to the device's management interface.
