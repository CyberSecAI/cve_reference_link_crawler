- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of FPJ files. This can lead to a write operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated data structure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by opening a malicious FPJ file or visiting a malicious page, indicating a file parsing attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious FPJ file, and the victim needs to open this file using the vulnerable FvDesigner software. User interaction is required, as the target must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.
