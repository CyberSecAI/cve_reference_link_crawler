# Improper input validation vulnerability leading to arbitrary creation of directories and a denial of service by deleting arbitrary directories.

High

[coderpatros](/coderpatros)
published
GHSA-6c74-9588-wq9j
Mar 22, 2022

## Package

bom-repo-server
(application)

## Affected versions

<=2.0.0

## Patched versions

2.0.1

## Description

### Impact

CycloneDX BOM Repository Server before version 2.0.1 has an improper input validation vulnerability leading to path traversal. A malicious user may potentially exploit this vulnerability to create arbitrary directories or a denial of service by deleting arbitrary directories.

### Patches

The vulnerability is resolved in version 2.0.1.

### Workarounds

The vulnerability is not exploitable in the default configuration with the post and delete methods disabled.

This can be configured by modifying the `appsettings.json` file, or alternatively, setting the environment variables `ALLOWEDMETHODS__POST` and `ALLOWEDMETHODS__DELETE` to `false`.

### Acknowledgement

The CycloneDX project would like to thank Florian Grunow from ERNW Enno Rey Netzwerke GmbH for responsibly disclosing this vulnerability.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [the BOM Repository Server issue tracker](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-bom-repo-server/issues/new)
* Email patrick.dwyer@owasp.org

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
