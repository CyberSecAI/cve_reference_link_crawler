Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2023-50441:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A compromised encrypted zone, when opened, can trigger a network access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability stems from how the ZONECENTRAL software handles the opening of encrypted zones, potentially leading to unintended network access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to:
*   Trigger a network access, potentially with an authentication request.
*   Obtain user privileges.
*   Potentially gain user credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is adjacent (A), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network segment.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by opening a compromised encrypted zone.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must be on the same network segment as the target machine.
*   The attacker must have access to, and be able to create, a compromised encrypted zone.
*   The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) to exploit this vulnerability.
*   No user interaction (UI:N) is required.

**Affected products and versions:**
*   ZONECENTRAL for Windows versions prior to 2023.5, including versions Q.2021.1

**Solutions and Recommendations:**
*   Upgrade to ZONECENTRAL for Windows version Q.2021.2 or later (validated by ANSSI).
