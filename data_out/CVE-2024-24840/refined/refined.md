- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control. The specific function with the missing check is not specified in the provided text.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user could potentially perform actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges. The exact impact is case-specific.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves exploiting the missing access control check within the plugin's functionality. The specific vulnerable function or method is not disclosed in the provided text.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a "Contributor" level user. This suggests that the attacker does not need high privileges to exploit the vulnerability, but needs to be a user with some access to the WordPress system.
