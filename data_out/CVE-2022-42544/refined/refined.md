{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to improper handling of Carriage Return Line Feed (CRLF) characters within the display SSID strings.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input validation of display SSID strings, allowing CRLF injection.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability leads to display errors. It does not affect the underlying Wi-Fi configuration; it only affects how the SSID is displayed to the user.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could craft a malicious Wi-Fi network with an SSID containing CRLF characters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control the SSID of a Wi-Fi network that the user connects to, or that is listed by the device for connection."
