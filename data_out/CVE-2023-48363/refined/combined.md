WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* Ensure that SIMATIC WinCC, SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional and SIMATIC PCS 7 stations communicate via encrypted channels (i.e. activate feature “Encrypted Communication” in SIMATIC WinCC and SIMATIC PCS 7). Enabling “Encrypted Communication” completely mitigates the vulnerability

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-48363

The implementation of the RPC (Remote Procedure call)
communication protocol in the affected products do not
properly handle certain unorganized RPC messages. An
attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service
condition in the RPC server.
