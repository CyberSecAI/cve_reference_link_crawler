Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-24045:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The application sets the session cookie on the browser via client-side JavaScript code after a successful login, without applying security attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Lack of security attributes (like "Secure", "HttpOnly", or "SameSite") on session cookies.
*   The session cookies are set via client-side JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Session cookies can be transmitted in plaintext over the network when using unencrypted HTTP connections.
*   An attacker can intercept the unencrypted session cookies.
*   Captured session cookies can be used by the attacker for unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Network sniffing of HTTP traffic.
*   Man-in-the-middle attacks on unencrypted HTTP connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be positioned on the network to sniff traffic or perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
*   The attacker must be on the same network or have the ability to intercept HTTP traffic between the client and the affected server/application.
*   The attacker needs the victim to connect via HTTP to be able to sniff the plaintext session cookies.
*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept the network traffic when a user successfully logs in.

**Additional Details:**

*   The document provides specific details about how the session cookie is set (via client-side Javascript) which is more specific than a generic description of cookie not being set with secure attributes.
*   The vulnerability is present in Desigo PXC and DXR devices.
* The CVSS v3.1 base score for this vulnerability is 6.5
* The corresponding CWE is CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute.
