| A path traversal issue was found in the (g \*GitArtifactReader).Read() API. Read() calls into (g \*GitArtifactReader).readFromRepository() that opens and reads the file that contains the trigger resource definition: <https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/blob/master/sensors/artifacts/git.go>  ``` func (g *GitArtifactReader) readFromRepository(r *git.Repository, dir string) ```  ```  ...              if err := w.Pull(pullOpts); err != nil && err != git.NoErrAlreadyUpToDate { 			return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to pull latest updates. err: %+v", err) 		} 	}  	return ioutil.ReadFile(fmt.Sprintf("%s/%s", dir, g.artifact.FilePath)) } ```  No checks are made on this file at read time, which could lead an attacker to read files anywhere on the system. This could be achieved in at least three ways:  Symbolic link in Git repository An attacker controls a Git repository that the victim uses in a Git Trigger Source. The attacker adds a file to the Git repository that is a symbolic link to a file containing sensitive information on the victims machine.  Argo then clones the repository onto the victims machine, and the symbolic link is followed during file read on the marked line above. An attacker could now read the file containing sensitive information.  Race condition An attacker who has limited access to the file system may be able to read arbitrary files by leveraging a race condition. The attacker could replace the git-temp directory created by argo with a symbolic link to the directory containing the file to be read. This could be done anytime between the time it is created in (g \*GitArtifactReader).Read() and the file is read in the return statement of (g \*GitArtifactReader).readFromRepository(r \*git.Repository, dir string).  Malicious manifest An attacker controls a manifest for a Git Trigger Source that the victim creates.  The manifest has a filePath to a sensitive file anywhere on the victims machine, for example:  ``` triggers:     - template:         name: workflow-trigger         k8s:           operation: create           source:             git:               url: "git@github.com:argoproj/argo-workflows.git"               cloneDirectory: "/git/argoproj"               sshKeyPath: "/secret/key"               namespace: argo-events               filePath: "/path/to/sensitive/file"               branch: "master" ```  Recommendations  Disallow symbolic links Check whether the file at GitArtifactReader.artificat.FilePath is a symbolic link before it is is opened and read in (g \*GitArtifactReader).readFromRepository(). Fail if it is.  Sanitize GitArtifactReader.artificat.FilePath This is includes checks for unsafe path patterns, such as: Check whether the string begins with “/”. Disallow “..”, “\”, “~” in path. Other checks to ensure that only the files from the Git repository can be read |
