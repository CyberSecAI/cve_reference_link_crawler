| A path traversal issue was found in the (g \*GitArtifactReader).Read() API. Read() calls into (g \*GitArtifactReader).readFromRepository() that opens and reads the file that contains the trigger resource definition: <https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/blob/master/sensors/artifacts/git.go>  ``` func (g *GitArtifactReader) readFromRepository(r *git.Repository, dir string) ```  ```  ...              if err := w.Pull(pullOpts); err != nil && err != git.NoErrAlreadyUpToDate { 			return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to pull latest updates. err: %+v", err) 		} 	}  	return ioutil.ReadFile(fmt.Sprintf("%s/%s", dir, g.artifact.FilePath)) } ```  No checks are made on this file at read time, which could lead an attacker to read files anywhere on the system. This could be achieved in at least three ways:  Symbolic link in Git repository An attacker controls a Git repository that the victim uses in a Git Trigger Source. The attacker adds a file to the Git repository that is a symbolic link to a file containing sensitive information on the victims machine.  Argo then clones the repository onto the victims machine, and the symbolic link is followed during file read on the marked line above. An attacker could now read the file containing sensitive information.  Race condition An attacker who has limited access to the file system may be able to read arbitrary files by leveraging a race condition. The attacker could replace the git-temp directory created by argo with a symbolic link to the directory containing the file to be read. This could be done anytime between the time it is created in (g \*GitArtifactReader).Read() and the file is read in the return statement of (g \*GitArtifactReader).readFromRepository(r \*git.Repository, dir string).  Malicious manifest An attacker controls a manifest for a Git Trigger Source that the victim creates.  The manifest has a filePath to a sensitive file anywhere on the victims machine, for example:  ``` triggers:     - template:         name: workflow-trigger         k8s:           operation: create           source:             git:               url: "git@github.com:argoproj/argo-workflows.git"               cloneDirectory: "/git/argoproj"               sshKeyPath: "/secret/key"               namespace: argo-events               filePath: "/path/to/sensitive/file"               branch: "master" ```  Recommendations  Disallow symbolic links Check whether the file at GitArtifactReader.artificat.FilePath is a symbolic link before it is is opened and read in (g \*GitArtifactReader).readFromRepository(). Fail if it is.  Sanitize GitArtifactReader.artificat.FilePath This is includes checks for unsafe path patterns, such as: Check whether the string begins with “/”. Disallow “..”, “\”, “~” in path. Other checks to ensure that only the files from the Git repository can be read |

### Threat Intelligence

EPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

## How to fix?

Upgrade `github.com/argoproj/argo-events/sensors/artifacts` to version 1.7.1 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal in the `(g *GitArtifactReader).Read()` API in `git.go`. This could allow arbitrary file reads if the `GitArtifactReader` is provided a pathname containing a symbolic link or an implicit directory name such as `..`.

## Details

A Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with "dot-dot-slash (../)" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.

Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:

* **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.

`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Ast%3A20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.

If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.

```
curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa

```

**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).

* **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`.

One way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.

The following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:

```
2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt
2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**
