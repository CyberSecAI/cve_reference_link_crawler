  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application responds differently depending on whether a provided username exists in Active Directory. A 200 response is returned for valid users, while a 500 error is returned for invalid ones.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Information Exposure Through Discrepancy (CWE-203)",
    "Sensitive Information Exposure Through HTTP Status Code (CWE-204)",
     "Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can enumerate valid Active Directory users. This can be a starting point for further attacks like brute-force password attempts or targeted spear-phishing attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending HTTP POST requests to the '/controller/api/Answer/ReturnUserQuestionsFilled' endpoint with a username in the request body.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No special privileges are required."
