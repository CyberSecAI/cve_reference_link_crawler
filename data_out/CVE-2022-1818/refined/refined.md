The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1818.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WordPress plugin "Multi-page Toolkit" lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating its settings. This allows an attacker to make a logged-in administrator unintentionally change settings through a crafted request. Additionally, there is a lack of sanitization and output escaping of the input, which results in stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): Missing CSRF protection on settings update functionality.
- Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting): Input fields are not sanitized, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary settings update: An attacker can modify plugin settings without the administrator's consent, potentially disrupting functionality.
- Stored XSS: Malicious JavaScript injected via the settings can be executed in the victimâ€™s browser when the settings page is viewed, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- CSRF: An attacker tricks a logged-in administrator into submitting a crafted request.
- XSS: The attacker uses the CSRF vulnerability to inject malicious JavaScript code via plugin settings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into submitting a form or visiting a malicious link that triggers the settings update.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or direct access to the WordPress dashboard.
