- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled search path in Intel® Graphics Command Center Service bundled within Intel® Graphics Windows DCH driver software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software does not properly control the search path used, which can allow an attacker to inject malicious executables into the search path that would be executed by the service. This is a classic DLL hijacking vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to an escalation of privileges, allowing the attacker to gain higher level access to the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the system and user interaction is required, as well as the user has to have specific driver software versions installed.
