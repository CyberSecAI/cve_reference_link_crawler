Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23617:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how XWiki handles page creation using templates. Specifically, when a user creates a new page based on a template, the system copies the content of the template page *before* verifying if the user has the necessary view rights on that template.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control enforcement during the template copying process. The system should first verify if the user has permission to view the template page before copying its content.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability leads to unauthorized information disclosure, allowing users to access the content of pages they are not permitted to view by using them as templates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** The main impact is the potential disclosure of confidential information. Attackers can gain access to sensitive content by creating new pages using restricted pages as templates.
*   **Data Leakage:**  Users can copy content from pages they shouldn't be able to see.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:**  While the issue itself does not allow to directly modify content, an attacker with this leaked information can use it in a secondary attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely via HTTP requests.
*   **Specific URL Manipulation:** An attacker crafts a specific URL (e.g., `/xwiki/bin/edit/Sandbox/NewPage/WebHome?template=Sandbox.SecretPage&parent=Sandbox.WebHome&title=NewPage`) to initiate the creation of a new page using a restricted template.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs only low privileges, specifically the ability to create or edit pages in XWiki.
*   **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability doesn't require any user interaction.
*   **Knowledge of Target Page:** The attacker needs to know the path of the restricted page they want to exploit as a template.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The vulnerability is located within the `CreateAction`, `EditAction`, `InlineAction`, `SaveAction` and `AdminAction` classes in XWiki.
*   The fix involves adding an authorization check in `XWikiAction.java` using the method `resolveTemplate()` before a template's content is copied during page creation. The `readFromTemplate` method also checks if the user has the view right before copying.
*   The vulnerability is identified by CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).
*   The vulnerability was resolved in XWiki versions 12.10.6 and 13.2-rc-1.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the `hasAccess(Right.VIEW, templateReference)` check is performed *before* the content is copied, in `XWikiAction.java` within the `resolveTemplate` method. The `readFromTemplate` method is also updated to check for access right on the provided template.
*   The commit `b35ef0edd4f2ff2c974cbeef6b80fcf9b5a44554` introduces the method `getCurrentMixedDocumentReferenceResolver()`.
*   The commit `30c52b01559b8ef5ed1035dac7c34aaf805764d5` introduces the method `resolveTemplate()` in `XWikiAction.java` to make sure the current user has access to the template before using it. The `readFromTemplate()` method is also introduced here to handle document updates when a template is provided.

**Summary:**

CVE-2022-23617 is a critical vulnerability caused by missing authorization checks during page creation using templates in XWiki. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker with minimal privileges can access confidential content from pages they are not supposed to view.
