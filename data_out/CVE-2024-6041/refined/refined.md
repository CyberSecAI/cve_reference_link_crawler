Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the "id" parameter in the `manage_user.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code directly into the query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability is present in the `manage_user.php` file.
- Insufficient user input validation for the "id" parameter.
- Direct use of user-supplied input in SQL queries without sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized database access:** Attackers can gain access to the database without proper authentication.
- **Sensitive data leakage:** Attackers can access and potentially extract sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Data tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Comprehensive system control:** In some cases, successful SQL injection can lead to complete system control if the database user has sufficient privileges.
- **Service interruption:** Attackers could potentially disrupt the normal operation of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the `manage_user.php` file.
- The attacker crafts a malicious SQL payload and injects it into the `id` parameter via the URL or HTTP request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- No special privileges are required; a regular user account is sufficient for exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the "Gym Management System Project In PHP With Source Code" version 1.0.
- The vulnerability can be exploited using various SQL injection techniques such as time-based blind, boolean-based blind, error-based, and UNION query.
- The provided GitHub issue includes a SQLmap command used for testing and a few screenshots of the testing result.
