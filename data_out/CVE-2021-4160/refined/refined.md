{
  "CVE-2021-4160": {
    "Description": "There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring procedure which affects multiple EC algorithms.  Attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m and 3.0.1 on the 15th of December 2021.",
    "Root cause": "Carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring procedure.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Carry propagation bug"
    ],
    "Impact": "May produce incorrect results on MIPS, potentially leading to compromised keys and data",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploiting the incorrect calculation in the `BN_mod_exp` function on MIPS platforms.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Targeting MIPS platforms where private keys are reused, or an attacker with significant resources may deduce information about a private key, although difficult."
