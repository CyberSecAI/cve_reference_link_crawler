Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-30228:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a result of insecure handling of user-supplied data leading to a PHP Object Injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **PHP Object Injection:** The core vulnerability is that the plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection. This occurs when an attacker can control serialized PHP objects that are later unserialized by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a variety of severe impacts, including:
    - **Code injection:**  Executing arbitrary code on the server.
    - **SQL injection:** Manipulating database queries.
    - **Path traversal:** Accessing unauthorized files on the server.
    - **Denial of service (DoS):** Causing the application to become unavailable.
- The severity is rated as **High** with a CVSS score of **9.9**, suggesting that it is highly dangerous and likely to be mass exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious, serialized PHP objects which, when unserialized, trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires the capability to inject malicious serialized objects, which can be achieved with **Subscriber** level access. This indicates a low barrier to entry for exploitation.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable software is the "Hercules Core" WordPress plugin, with versions <= 6.4 affected.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 6.5.
- Patchstack provides a virtual patch to mitigate the vulnerability until an update can be applied.
- The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 as "A3: Injection".
