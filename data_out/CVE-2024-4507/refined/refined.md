Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the Ruijie RG-UAC Unified Internet Behavior Management Audit System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The `/view/IPV6/ipv6StaticRoute/static_route_add_ipv6.php` interface is vulnerable to command injection. Specifically, the `text_prefixlen`, `text_gateway`, and `devname` parameters are likely vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Server Control:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is accessible through the network via the vulnerable web interface.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attacker crafts malicious HTTP requests targeting the vulnerable interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Ruijie RG-UAC system.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL (`/view/IPV6/ipv6StaticRoute/static_route_add_ipv6.php`) and parameters.
* No authentication information is mentioned, which suggests the vulnerability might be exploitable without prior authentication, or with low-privilege credentials.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided source link (GitHub) points to a proof-of-concept (POC) exploit, suggesting a readily available attack method.
*   The vulnerability is located in the backend application of the Ruijie RG-UAC system, which manages internet behavior.
*   The affected parameters (`text_prefixlen`, `text_gateway`, `devname`) suggest that the command injection occurs within a function that adds or modifies IPv6 static routes.
* This vulnerability is given the VulDB Entry ID 263111
