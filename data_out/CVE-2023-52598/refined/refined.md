{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "When modifying the floating point control (fpc) register of a traced process using the ptrace interface, the new value is checked for validity by temporarily loading it into the fpc register. An interrupt during this process, while floating point or vector registers are in use, could lead to incorrect saving and restoration of the tracer's fpc register, thus corrupting the tracer's fpc register value.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of FPU register state during ptrace operations, leading to potential corruption of the tracing process's FPU state.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The tracer process will continue running with an incorrect fpc register value.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by using the ptrace interface to modify the fpc register of a traced process, while an interrupt occurs when the value is temporarily loaded into the fpc register. The attacker needs to be able to control the traced process and be able to trigger an interrupt at the right time.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to use ptrace to modify the fpc register of a traced process. Additionally, an interrupt needs to happen while the value is temporarily loaded into the fpc register."
