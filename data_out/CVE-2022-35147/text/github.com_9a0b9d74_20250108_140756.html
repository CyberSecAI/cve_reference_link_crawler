### **[dontblame](/dontblame)** commented [Jul 1, 2022](#issue-1290941924)

| There is login bypass in doracms2.18 and earlier versions. When logging in, you can bypass the login user authentication by replacing the return package with the return package after a system successfully logs in. [Vulnerability proof] Step 1:Log in to the system through the default account doracms and record the returned package.
