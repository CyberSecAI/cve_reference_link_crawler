- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before it's copied to a fixed-length heap-based buffer during the parsing of PDF files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by enticing users to open a malicious PDF file. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need to create a malicious PDF file. The user must open this crafted file to trigger the vulnerability.
