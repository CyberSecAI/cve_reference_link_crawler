APRS™ is a multifaceted system for use with packet radio by Hams,
it allows the monitoring of real time geographical information such as the position of vehicles,
the status of weather, radio direction finding and much much more.
It envolves mapping, GPS tracking, packet radio, etc.
It is a VERY interesting facet of packet radio and has much to offer most everyone including non-hams that just want to watch over the internet.

# Hacking Ham Radio: WinAPRS â Part 1

Coalfire Cybersecurity Team

March 29, 2022

![Blog Images 2022 Ham tile](data:image/svg+xml;utf8...)

**Key takeaways:**

* Ham radios are still used today in emergency communications during times of war and disaster
* To this day they still can be used in binary exploitation
* The vulnerabilities of older technologies can be leveraged with todayâs hacking fundamentals

Ham radios are still used to this day in emergency communications during times of warÂ and disaster, and can still be used in binary exploitation.

Hackers have been breaching computer system defenses for more than half a century, and the networks they use to exploit those weaknesses have been around for far longer than that. With the internet replacing most wirelines and wavelengths, and with the rise of cybercrime sophistication from petty thieves to organized nation-states, the threat landscape has exploded over the last 20 years. Yet one of the oldest network protocols â amateur or âhamâ radio â is still used to this day in emergency communications during times of war and disaster, and to this day can still be used in binary exploitation.

Ham radio evokes an image of old guys turning knobs on vintage, tube radios and talking to other hobbyists about their configurations. Nowadays, radios are getting much more complicated, and with the built-in ability to perform digital communications, the possibilities are almost limitless. You can hook them up to computers to do anything from text messaging and email to sharing images and tracking weather balloons. Thereâs still something magical about connecting to a device or contacting someone across the planet without being hooked up to the internet or a phone line.

I recently passed the [Offensive Security Exploit Developer](https://www.offensive-security.com/exp301-osed/) (OSED) exam and wanted to apply what Iâd learned to real-world security problems. Iâm always looking for ways to improve my threat modeling, attack simulation, and penetration testing skills, and thought that ham radio would be a fun environment to explore. Amateur radio equipment and frequency spectrums are accessible all over the world and are instructive for a blog series that shows how the vulnerabilities of older technologies can be leveraged with todayâs hacking fundamentals. With ham radio as our testing and proving ground, weâll look at reverse engineering, the creation of custom exploits, and developing skills to bypass security mitigations. Weâll also take a look at writing handmade Windows shellcode and adopting older techniques to more modern versions of Windows.

## Packet Radio

I've been messing around with packet radio and various digital modes on and off for years and have wondered if any vulnerabilities exist that could allow an attacker to obtain remote code execution through the airwaves. I always thought it was a fun idea to be able to hack a computer that isn't even hooked up to the internet. Many ham programs are written by enthusiasts and are quite old, so it seemed likely that there would be exploitable vulnerabilities. In my research I decided to focus mainly on vulnerabilities that could lead to remote code or command execution, though if I found other vulnerabilities, I didn't ignore them. I also decided to start by focusing on Windows software, since the OSED exam focused on Windows user-mode exploitation and it's where I have the most experience. I started this project with a specific goal in mind: get a remote shell over ham radio.

As a hacker, I am most interested in the various digital modes that ham radio has to offer. There are many, and for my research I decided to focus on software that uses the AX.25 protocol.

"Packet radio" generally refers to a very specific digital mode of operation that uses the AX.25 protocol. AX.25 is a data-link layer protocol (layer 2 of the OSI model). In this mode, data is split into packets and transmitted over the air. AX.25 has support for different packet types and includes modes that are similar to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on Ethernet. In some cases, the protocol can do some error correcting, like TCP. Another mode will just send packets out into the air without waiting for any kind of acknowledgement, like UDP. Windows does not have any built-in way to handle AX.25 traffic, so end-user software would have to do this on its own or it must be abstracted away. The Linux kernel has built-in support for AX.25, so you can potentially set up AX.25 network interfaces that have callsigns for addresses instead of IP addresses.

AX.25 is commonly used today for Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS), Winlink email over ham radio, Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) operations, and more. It seems it is more generally used for a ham to make a contact with a computer, as opposed to making live contacts with other hams. More information about the AX.25 protocol can be found here: <http://www.ax25.net/AX25.2.2-Jul%2098-2.pdf>

## Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS)

The most common use of AX.25 is with the Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS). Therefore, I decided to focus first on APRS software for this research project. APRS allows hams to transmit telemetry data such as GPS coordinates, weather data, small generic messages, and more. An APRS station can send out a broadcast message, or it can send a message addressed to another specific station. Since the range on the 2m band isnât that great, APRS stations can âdigipeatâ the packets out again. This means that if one station receives a packet, it will retransmit it to send it further away. There are also âIGateâ systems which are bridged to the internet via the APRS Internet Service (APRS-IS) backbone (<http://www.aprs-is.net>). This adds extra usability to the APRS system and means you can transmit data globally using the internet if desired. In fact, you can view APRS traffic anywhere in the world at <https://aprs.fi> and you donât even need a license to check it out.

![](https://assets.coalfire.com/prod/images/imported/Blog-Images-2022-Ham-1.jpg)

How do APRS stations find each other? How does one station find an IGate to bridge to the internet? You can transmit APRS on basically any amateur frequency for which you are licensed, but around the globe each region generally has an allotted frequency where this traffic is used. In the US, that frequency is 144.390 MHz. Just about anywhere in the country you can tune a radio to this frequency and hear data being transmitted at least every minute or so.

APRS is a protocol that runs on top of AX.25, like how HTTP runs on top of TCP. APRS packets make use of the AX.25 unnumbered information (UI) frames. Since I was going to be reverse engineering APRS software, it made sense to examine APRS data frames to understand their structure. AX.25 UI frames look like this:

![](https://assets.coalfire.com/prod/images/imported/Blog-Images-2022-Ham-2.jpg)
**Image** [**source**](http://www.aprs.org/doc/APRS101.PDF)

In an AX.25 UI frame, all addresses will be ham radio callsigns with an optional SSID appended to them. If your callsign was K7HAX, your address could be something like K7HAX-14. The digipeater addresses field can contain up to eight digipeater addresses to specify the path the packet should take. A digipeater is a radio station that listens for packets and then retransmits those packets to extend the range. The information field contains user-specified data. APRS makes heavy use of this field and itâs likely to be the most interesting field to play with.

The APRS specification allows for various data types, formats, and encodings. Most of this information is stored in the information field of the AX.25 packet. A generic APRS information field structure looks like this:

![](https://assets.coalfire.com/prod/images/imported/Blog-Images-2022-Ham-3.jpg)
**Image** [**source**](http://www.aprs.org/doc/APRS101.PDF)

The data type specifies what kind of APRS data follows. Options include GPS position, direction finding, weather information, messages, and more. Hereâs a real APRS message I pulled from [here](https://aprs.fi).

:Are you working tonight?

The colon denotes that the APRS data contains a message. The rest of the data is just the plaintext message. In this case the APRS data extension and comment fields are unused. Hereâs another example:

=3319.44S/06012.46W#Â 144.930MHz.Â SNDigi

The equal sign denotes that the data contains position data without a timestamp. Immediately following that is the actual position data. Between the two coordinates is a forward slash and immediately following the data is a hash symbol. Combined, these symbols would make â/#â. This data tells the receiving station what type of station sent the message and what symbol or icon to use to display the station on a map.

APRS has two tables full of different symbols (car, truck, bicycle, balloon, etc.). The forward slash specifies which table to use. The hash tells which symbol to use in that table. After the hash symbol is some additional message data which appears to list the transmitting frequency and probably the software or device used to transmit (SNDigi). Thereâs so much more to APRS than just this but it gives a rough idea of how the packets look and what we can expect APRS software to be doing when decoding messages. More information about the APRS protocol can be found [here](http://www.aprs.org/doc/APRS101.PDF).

Since APRS is probably the most common packet protocol in use today, and there is no shortage of APRS software to choose from, I decided to start my research here. I focused on Windows-based APRS software that was written in C or C++ so I could continue honing my IDA and WinDbg reversing skills.

## Hardware for Packet Radio

There is a huge number of combinations of hardware to get on the air with packet, but in general youâll need three main components: a transceiver, a terminal node controller (TNC), and a computer. You use the computer to interact with the various packet radio software you want to use. The transceiver sends and receives the communications over the radio. The TNC is basically a packet radio modem that sits between the two, converting the data into sound. It works similarly to a dial-up modem, but for radio instead of telephone lines. A TNC is typically a little box thatâs hooked up to the computer and the radio. A TNC will often have a built-in microcomputer with its own operating system so you can open a terminal and send and receive messages right from the TNC. My TNC has a built-in mailbox where other hams can leave messages. It can decode APRS messages with its own software and display them in a human-readable format via serial console. Hereâs a photo of the hardware Iâm using for my receiving station:

###

## Keep It Simple, Stupid! (KISS)

Each TNC make and model has its own set of commands you must use to send packets, and they may display packets differently to the user. The computer software must therefore understand how to interface with each make and model, which is cumbersome. To remedy this, most TNCs support a mode called KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid). This mode disables all the âsmartâ features of the TNC and turns it into a dumb modem. The TNC will simply demodulate the signals from the radio and transmit the raw data back to your PC and vice versa. To simplify things, Iâll be placing my TNC into KISS mode for testing and using it wherever possible.

The important bit to know about the KISS protocol is that the TNC will add a 0xC0 control character to the beginning and end of each packet, and it will expect those characters to be there for any outgoing transmissions. There are also a few other special control characters the TNC will watch for, which is important to be aware of when writing shellcode later. These characters would be considered âbad charactersâ when writing shellcode and must be avoided. A full description of the KISS protocol can be found [here](http://www.ax25.net/kiss.aspx).

## Choosing an APRS Program

The [aprs-is.net](http://www.aprs-is.net/) website has a list of some known APRS client software.

![](https://assets.coalfire.com/prod/images/imported/Blog-Images-2022-Ham-5b.jpg)

Looking over the list, I figured an older client would be the most likely to contain exploitable memory corruption vulnerabilities. Looking at the various options, I found that the WinAPRS download page said it hadn't been updated since January 14, 2013. I figured that was a good sign that the software was likely not maintained and would therefore contain vulnerabilities. I downloaded the latest version (2.9.0) and got to work.

## Next Steps

The next post in this series will discuss the reverse engineering process using WinDbg. Weâll dive into the nitty gritty technical details of an exploitable memory corruption vulnerability in WinAPRS including how it was found and why itâs exploitable.

    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
    HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.

I found a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in WinAPRS that let me hack into a system over the air. The result is a reverse shell obtained over ham radio where the victim machine doesn't have to be connected to Ethernet at all, as long as they are running a WinAPRS station. Is it practical? Not really. But it was fun and I learned a lot. I always wondered if I could get RCE via ham radio through memory corruption and it feels good to have proved to myself that I can do it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [kloch](user?id=kloch) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31572415)   | [parent](#31571517) | [next](#31572477) [–]  Another place to look is DSD/mbelib, although to exploit you would have to transmit on a frequency they were monitoring and any replies/confirmation would have to come from another path (Internet). Since a common use case for that software is monitoring public safety frequencies an exploit might actually be practical for law enforcement agencies. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rickostuff](user?id=rickostuff) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31572482)   | [root](#31571517) | [parent](#31572415) | [next](#31573514) [–]  I'm not familiar with DSD/mbelib but based on what I saw with a quick web search this sounds like a really interesting attack vector. I do want to perform some more research in this area, so thanks for the idea. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jcims](user?id=jcims) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31572605)   | [root](#31571517) | [parent](#31572482) | [next](#31573514) [–]  Be sure to look at both the control channel and voice codecs. It's been a minute but IIRC there are a few open source implementations for both. Finding a bug in RDS would be pretty funny - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Data_System> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [thereddaikon](user?id=thereddaikon) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31573344)   | [root](#31571517) | [parent](#31572605) | [next](#31575842) [–]  There was an unintentional one earlier this year. Seattle's local NPR station bricked some Mazda infotainment sets by sending malformed data.

The local station had a UHF link from the studio to the TX site that was audio only, a very common setup in the mid-90s, and the RDS flag on the transmitter was switched "in band" by sending a burst of tones over the audio feed, right at the start of the traffic jingle. Slap the traffic announce jingle cart in, hit the button, tune starts with just three quick DTMF digits. Uh-huh, you're seeing where this is going, right? So if you put those three DTMF digits at the start of your single... :-D | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jcims](user?id=jcims) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31576313)   | [root](#31571517) | [parent](#31575842) | [next](#31576379) [–]  I know this isn’t a substantive reply to your content but that’s amazing! I love it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rickostuff](user?id=rickostuff) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31576379)   | [root](#31571517) | [parent](#31575842) | [prev](#31576313) | [next](#31573514) [–]  I'm going to have to see what I can find about this incident. Sounds like the early days of phone phreaking. Awesome! | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [\_abox](user?id=_abox) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31573514)   | [root](#31571517) | [parent](#31572415) | [prev](#31572482) | [next](#31572477) [–]  Mbelib is of questionable legality as it implements a codec patented by DVSI. Indeed you might trigger some vulnerability at a hobbyist but a professional would never use it. And public safety channels here are all encrypted so there's nothing to listen to, perhaps in the US that's not the case. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [codys](user?id=codys) [on June 1, 2022](item?id=31577625)   | [root](#31571517) | [parent](#31573514) | [next](#31572477) [–]  There's a long history of open source software implementing patented algorithms, especially in the video and audio codec space. Those open source implementations are definitely used by professionals, so I would recommend not being so assured about the scope of use of software that may contain patented algorithms. The vocal data on public safety channels being reported as encrypted does not necessarily say that there could be no vulnerability there. There's lots of control data that may or may not be encrypted, and encryption does not prevent all kinds of attacks here. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [\_abox](user?id=_abox) [on June 1, 2022](item?id=31587238)   | [root](#31571517) | [parent](#31577625) | [next](#31572477) [–]  No I was just talking about the codec of course. But nobody sells radio sets based on mbelib except the Chinese budget brands (e.g. baofeng) which have circumvented DVSI's patent by setting up a local company that sells the patent because they say they own it (even though they have no right to do it, but DVSI can't sue them in China). But all the public safety ones I've seen are brands like motorola and hytera that buy the real DVSI codecs. But I'm not saying there are no other vulnerabilities. I'm just saying that there will not be many people using mbelib to listen to public safety frequencies because there is nothing to listen to as it's encrypted. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [\_joel](user?id=_joel) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31572477)   | [parent](#31571517) | [prev](#31572415) | [next](#31573508) [–]  Excellent write up, bonus points if you can do an RCE via ISS repeater :D | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [landr0id](user?id=landr0id) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31573508)   | [parent](#31571517) | [prev](#31572477) | [next](#31576260) [–]  Excellent work! As I learned more about digital modes and packet radio I had similar thoughts! This is a really cool writeup and I'm stoked someone looked into this. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [heavyset\_go](user?id=heavyset_go) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31576260)   | [parent](#31571517) | [prev](#31573508) | [next](#31571946) [–]  What's the legality surround security research like this with ham radio? I was under the impression that the airwaves are highly regulated and those regulations could hamstring (forgive the pun) security research, but I also know next to nothing about it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rickostuff](user?id=rickostuff) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31576371)   | [root](#31571517) | [parent](#31576260) | [next](#31571946) [–]  I'm not a lawyer, but I used my real callsign when doing anything over the air. I used known protocols, no encryption, nothing commercial, etc. This was all against my own lab systems. I don't think I crossed any legal lines here. It probably would have been even better to use some kind of dummy load to further reduce the range of my transmissions but I didn't have anything like that to use at the time. I just kept my power as low as I was able. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [heavyset\_go](user?id=heavyset_go) [on June 1, 2022](item?id=31576606)   | [root](#31571517) | [parent](#31576371) | [next](#31571946) [–]  Cool, thanks for the details. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [xen2xen1](user?id=xen2xen1) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31571946)   | [parent](#31571517) | [prev](#31576260) | [next](#31572277) [–]  Sounds like a first, though I would not know. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rickostuff](user?id=rickostuff) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31572245)   | [root](#31571517) | [parent](#31571946) | [next](#31572277) [–]  I couldn't find where anyone else had done this before with ham radio. That was another motivating factor. It was an interesting new (but, actually old) attack vector. I've always been interested in weird attack vectors like this. I've read some fun research in the past about infrared communications, magnetic strips, etc. Things that are all around us but we don't really think of as attack vectors. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ImpulseGuided](user?id=ImpulseGuided) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31574020)   | [root](#31571517) | [parent](#31572245) | [next](#31574396) [–]  >I've read some fun research in the past about infrared communications, magnetic strips, etc. Things that are all around us but we don't really think of as attack vectors.

They are pretty old now, but still interesting. Infrared Hacking: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Fo-zg-DqI> Magstripe Hacking: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITihB1c3dHw> Satellite Hacking: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyXZX63etog> These all hit the sweet spot for me of technologies we use all the time but don't really consider the security implications. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ImpulseGuided](user?id=ImpulseGuided) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31574974)   | [root](#31571517) | [parent](#31574546) | [next](#31574396) [–]  Thank you very much for linking these. By the way, did you catch yesterday's thread on the Hack-a-Sat(ellite) CTF? ><https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31559117> Also congratulations on passing the OSED. Reading your 5-part report it looks like you got your money's worth. Did you study for the OSED full-time or did you manage to complete all studying and tasks after work? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rickostuff](user?id=rickostuff) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31575478)   | [root](#31571517) | [parent](#31574974) | [next](#31574396) [–]  Thanks! I actually took three OffSec courses last year. The first one I did was the OSWP (wifi) as a sort of warm up because it's the easiest course they offer and I knew I could knock that out pretty quick. Then I took the OSEP course which was a ton of content. Finally I took the OSED which was another ton of content and the most technical of those three. My work gave me 40 hours of in-office time to last year for training. I can't recall if I used that 40 hours for the OSEP or OSED, but I know I used it for one of those two. However, I still put in a ton of hours on my own time too. It's just a lot of content to go through. 40 hours isn't enough time for either of those courses in my opinion. Having no children (and an understanding spouse) made it easier for me to dedicate a lot of personal time on the training. I love OffSec's stuff though and recommend it to anyone who is into offensive security and wants practical training. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [amatecha](user?id=amatecha) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31574396)   | [root](#31571517) | [parent](#31572245) | [prev](#31574020) | [next](#31576818) [–]  Yeah, I've thought about this a lot with the increased popularity of digital modes. Especially those small programs made by one or two people, just as you identified. I mean, I crashed a friend's radio simply by sending him an SMS over DMR (seems like a known issue/limitation with the radio firmware). Even well-established products are susceptible to attacks.

I've managed to dump the firmware from my TNC but I haven't found a good way to get it disassembled yet. I've got a partial disassembly, but that's it. Unfortunately, I won't have more time to work on that for a few months. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hoppla](user?id=hoppla) [on June 1, 2022](item?id=31576818)   | [root](#31571517) | [parent](#31572245) | [prev](#31574396) | [next](#31572277) [–]  I fuzzed the direwolf aprs software using AFL some years back, but nothing interesting showed up.

I think it might just be more that it's a niche that matured in a different era, and the solutions are "good enough" to not warrant the recreation of these tools from scratch. The amateur radio community isn't enormous, and the overlap between operator and developer doesn't always exist. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [vitaflo](user?id=vitaflo) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31576062)   | [root](#31573484) | [parent](#31575453) | [prev](#31575671) | [next](#31578264) [–]  Because you are able to build and modify radios as a ham, many do and charge for said hardware. This just spilled over into software where people feel they should be paid for the work they’ve done just like the hardware folks. And since a lot of that started before OSS was popular it’s strangely stuck around. That said some of the most popular ham software (like WSJT-X) are open source. I think the trend is starting to shift the other direction. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pabs3](user?id=pabs3) [on June 1, 2022](item?id=31578264)   | [root](#31573484) | [parent](#31575453) | [prev](#31576062) | [next](#31575643) [–]  There is a lot of open source ham radio software. Enough that Debian has a team working on packaging it all.

If you compromise a PC that's connected to a ham radio, you might be able to transmit maliciously, or interfere with the radio owner's ability to transmit or receive. But it turns out that ham radio isn't only about communicating with other ham radio people - it's also about using PKI to store details of who you communicated with: <https://lotw.arrl.org/lotw-help/developer-pki/> Private key disclosure seems catastrophic because of their scorched-earth security policy <https://lotw.arrl.org/lotw-help/certificatesecurity/> where the server admins plan to invalidate all signed data, even if the same data had been sitting on the central server for years before the compromise happened. Yet, the docs don't recommend a password for the private key except on "shared or public computers." The adversary just looks for -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- in a text file in a keys directory (the filename is the call letters). In other words, although executing cmd.exe is a wonderful accomplishment, there's also the possibility of 1. wait for the PC and radio to be idle, 2. tune the radio to a clear frequency, 3. open the victim's private key file, 4. transmit the private key with Morse code. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jacquesm](user?id=jacquesm) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31575861)   | [parent](#31575643) | [next](#31572188) [–]  I think the idea here is to prove that it could be done, not to show that you can do even more damage once you have RCE. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [imperialdrive](user?id=imperialdrive) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31572188)   | [prev](#31575643) | [next](#31595198) [–]  As someone who spent time working on radio towers and assisting an operator, this was a very warm read.

Do you have to PTT out WiFi layer 2 packets by hand? Is the attacking station using a wired Ethernet connection? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rickostuff](user?id=rickostuff) [on June 7, 2022](item?id=31657738)   | [parent](#31595198) | [next](#31572248) [–]  The station model doesn't matter. The version of Windows is important, though. WiFi and Ethernet are not involved at all here. The victim machine has a radio and KISS TNC hooked up to their PC running WinAPRS. The attacker crafts a malicious AX.25 packet and sends it from their own station. When the victim's radio receives the packet, WinAPRS attempts to parse it and the exploit is triggered. The attacker just has to be within range of the victim station to trigger the exploit. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [\_\_\_8\_\_\_](user?id=___8___) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31572248)   | [prev](#31595198) | [next](#31578272) [–]  Your header image is not of a ham radio.

It was fascinating to see how a small billing discrepancy led you down such a rabbit hole. I also enjoyed the various solutions you came up with to crack the case using the technology of the time. I enjoy reading about the early days of the Internet. I have a sort of nostalgia for it, even though I didn't get on the net myself until around 1997. Your book hit a sweet spot for me with the combination of (now) retro technology and security. You might guess from this ham radio hacking post that I enjoy that kind of thing. If you are that Cliff Stoll, thanks for sharing your story! | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [O\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_O](user?id=O__________O) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31575753)   | [root](#31572248) | [parent](#31574512) | [next](#31575442) [–]  Yes, user you replied to is the author The Cuckoo's Egg according to this comment by the same user, which includes an explanation of how the book came to be: <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29387116> Here’s the wiki for those unfamiliar with it: [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Cuckoo%27s\_Egg\_(book)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo%27s_Egg_%28book%29) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [daveevad](user?id=daveevad) [on May 31, 2022](item?id=31575442)   | [root](#31572248) | [parent](#31574512) | [prev](#31575753) | [next](#31573468) [–]  Based on comment history, it looks like it's him; and also, it looks like he's a licensed amateur too.
