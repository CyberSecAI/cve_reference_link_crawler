■Mitigations and Protections

OMRON recommends that customers take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk

of exploitation of these vulnerabilities.

1. Anti-virus protection

Protect any PC with access to the control system against malware and ensure installation and

maintenance of up-to-date commercial grade anti-virus software protection.

    2. Security measures to prevent unauthorized access

- Minimize connection of control systems and equipment to open networks, so that untrusted

devices will be unable to access them.

- Implement firewalls (by shutting down unused communications ports, limiting

communications hosts) and isolate them from the IT network.

- Use a virtual private network (VPN) for remote access to control systems and equipment.

- Use strong passwords and change them frequently.

- Install physical controls so that only authorized personnel can access control systems and

equipment.

- Scan virus to ensure safety of any USB drives or similar devices before connecting them to

systems and devices.

- Enforce multifactor authentication to all devices with remote access to control systems and

equipment whenever possible.

3. Data input and output protection

Validation processing such as backup and range check to cope with unintentional modification

No. OMSR-2023-011_en (  3  /  3  )

of input/output data to control systems and devices.

4. Data recovery

        Periodical data backup and maintenance to prepare for data loss.
