- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The EventON plugin fails to sanitize and escape user-controlled input within its settings, specifically within the "List" field under "Other" in the language settings page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin does not properly sanitize user input, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be stored in the database and executed when the settings page is accessed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker, with administrative privileges, can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the WordPress admin interface, specifically the EventON language settings page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative level access within the WordPress site.
