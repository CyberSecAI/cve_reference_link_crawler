Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the patches:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the `iwl_trans_wait_tx_queues_empty()` function being called even after the firmware of the Intel Wi-Fi driver (iwlwifi) has died or is declared dead. This function waits for the transmit queues to become empty, which is an impossible condition when the firmware is not functional.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Incorrect logic:** The code was attempting to wait for TX queues to empty using `iwl_trans_wait_tx_queues_empty()` even after the firmware had crashed, leading to a warning and potentially causing issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   The primary impact is a warning message being triggered in the kernel logs due to the call to `iwl_trans_wait_tx_queues_empty()` when the firmware is dead which was recently converted from just a message. While this specific issue doesn't cause a system crash, it indicates a flaw in the logic and could potentially lead to other problems if not handled correctly.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   This is not a direct attack vector. The vulnerability arises when the Wi-Fi firmware crashes or is declared dead. An attacker could potentially cause a firmware crash to trigger this behavior, but there is no direct exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker would need to be able to cause a firmware crash in the Intel Wi-Fi module. This might involve sending specific malformed packets or exploiting a separate vulnerability to disrupt firmware operation.

**Summary of the fix:**

The fix adds a check for the `IWL_MVM_STATUS_HW_RESTART_REQUESTED` flag before calling `iwl_trans_wait_tx_queues_empty()`. This flag indicates that the firmware is dead and the wait function is skipped, preventing the warning message.
The code changes in `iwl_mvm_flush_no_vif` and `iwl_mvm_mac_flush` include checks to avoid calling `iwl_trans_wait_tx_queues_empty` when the firmware is dead.

Essentially, the fix ensures that the driver doesn't try to interact with a dead firmware, avoiding unnecessary warnings and potential instability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The code changes are present in multiple commits across different branches of the linux kernel, showing it was backported to several stable versions.
-  The commit message indicates this issue was recently converted from just a message to a warning.
