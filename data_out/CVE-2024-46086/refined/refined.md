The provided content relates to CVE-2024-46086.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in FrogCMS version 0.9.5.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application lacks sufficient CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can induce a logged-in administrator to perform unwanted actions, specifically deleting a file via the file manager using a crafted request.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker can craft a malicious HTML page containing a form that submits a request to the `/admin/?/plugin/file_manager/delete/123` endpoint. If a logged-in administrator visits this page, the form will be automatically submitted.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to trick an authenticated administrator of the FrogCMS instance to open a specially crafted HTML page. The attacker does not need to have direct access to the target system.
