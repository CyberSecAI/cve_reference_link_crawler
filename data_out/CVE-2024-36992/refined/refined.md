- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation of the "url" parameter in Dashboard elements allows for the injection of malicious payloads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Persistent Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The "url" parameter of the Dashboard element does not have proper input validation to reject invalid URLs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of a user who views a compromised dashboard. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can inject a malicious payload through a View that is then rendered in the browser of a user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs a low-privileged user account that does not hold the “admin” or “power” Splunk roles to craft a malicious payload through a View. The user must interact with the crafted view (UI).
