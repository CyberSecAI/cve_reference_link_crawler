**Advisory ID:** SVD-2024-0712

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2024-36992](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36992)

**Published:** 2024-07-01

**Last Update:** 2024-07-01

**CVSSv3.1 Score:** 5.4, Medium

**CVSSv3.1 Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**CWE:** [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

**Bug ID:** VULN-15645

## Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10 and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.1.2312.200 and 9.1.2308.207, a low-privileged user that does not hold the “admin” or “power” Splunk roles could craft a malicious payload through a View that could result in execution of unauthorized JavaScript code in the browser of a user.

The “url” parameter of the Dashboard element does not have proper input validation to reject invalid URLs, which could lead to a Persistent Cross-site Scripting (XSS) exploit.

## Solution

Upgrade Splunk Enterprise to versions 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10, or higher.

Splunk is performing upgrades on Splunk Cloud Platform instances as part of Routine Maintenance for customers, as described in the Splunk Cloud Platform Maintenance Policy. In the meantime, Splunk is actively monitoring for potential issues that could arise from this vulnerability.
