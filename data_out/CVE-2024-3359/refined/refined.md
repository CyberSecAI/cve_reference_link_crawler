Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability present in the `admin/login.php` file of the Online Library System version 1.0.
*   The vulnerability occurs due to improper handling of the `user_email` parameter in the login process, which allows for SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. This arises from the application directly incorporating user-supplied input (`user_email` parameter) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can use SQL injection to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database, such as customer information, personal data, trade secrets, and intellectual property.
*   **Data Modification:** Exploiting this vulnerability allows attackers to modify or delete data in the database, potentially leading to data corruption, loss, or unauthorized changes.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** In severe cases, an attacker could potentially achieve complete control over the database server and, by extension, the application itself.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `user_email` parameter of the `admin/login.php` file.
*   An attacker would craft malicious SQL code within the `user_email` field when attempting to log in.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `admin/login.php` page.
*   The attacker does not need prior authentication, as they can use SQL injection to bypass the login process.
*   The attacker must have some knowledge of SQL syntax and how to construct malicious queries.

In summary, this is a classic SQL injection vulnerability that could lead to significant data breaches and system compromise if not patched.
