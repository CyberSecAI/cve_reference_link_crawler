{
  "CVE-2024-46770": {
    "Description": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Intel ice driver in the Linux kernel, where ethtool callbacks can be executed during a reset operation and attempt to access deleted resources. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference, which results in a kernel crash.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause is that the ethtool callbacks can be executed while a device reset is in progress. During reset, some resources are deallocated which are then accessed by ethtool callbacks leading to a null pointer dereference.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "NULL pointer dereference due to accessing deallocated resources",
      "Race condition between reset and ethtool callback execution"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit results in a kernel NULL pointer dereference, leading to a kernel crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves triggering a device reset using the sysfs interface (`echo 1 > /sys/class/net/<interface>/device/reset`) while simultaneously using ethtool to query device settings (e.g., `ethtool -c <interface>`).",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to trigger a device reset and execute ethtool commands. This generally means the attacker needs to have root privileges or similar capabilities to manipulate the device through the sysfs interface and to execute the ethtool command."
