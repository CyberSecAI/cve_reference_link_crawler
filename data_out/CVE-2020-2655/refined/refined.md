Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2655:

**CVE-2020-2655**

*   **Root Cause:** Incorrect handling of unexpected CertificateVerify TLS handshake messages in OpenJDK's JSSE (Java Secure Socket Extension).
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Improper processing of CertificateVerify TLS handshake messages leading to potential security issues.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could possibly use this issue to insert, edit, or obtain sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A remote attacker with network access utilizing a malicious TLS server or man-in-the-middle attacks, could exploit this vulnerability.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** 
    * The attacker would need to control the TLS server and manipulate or inject unexpected `CertificateVerify` TLS handshake messages.
    * They need to be able to act as a man-in-the-middle.

**Additional Details (from the Red Hat advisory):**

*   The vulnerability is specifically located in the `JSSE` component of OpenJDK.

**Summary of Findings**

The provided information indicates that CVE-2020-2655 is due to improper handling of specific TLS handshake messages within the OpenJDK Java library. An attacker could exploit this flaw, possibly by acting as a malicious server or performing a man-in-the-middle attack, to potentially gain access to or modify sensitive information.
