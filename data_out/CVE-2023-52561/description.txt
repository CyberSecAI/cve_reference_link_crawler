In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845-db845c: Mark cont splash memory region as reserved

Adding a reserved memory region for the framebuffer memory
(the splash memory region set up by the bootloader).

It fixes a kernel panic (arm-smmu: Unhandled context fault
at this particular memory region) reported on DB845c running
v5.10.y.
