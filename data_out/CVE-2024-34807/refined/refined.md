- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting malicious links or HTML, an attacker could trick a logged-in user into unknowingly submitting a request that performs unwanted actions on the vulnerable WordPress plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to click a malicious link or access a malicious page crafted by the attacker.
