- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the mishandling of whitespace characters in the `exportDataObject` method of the `Doc` object in Foxit Reader. The application saves the new file to the temp directory without properly sanitizing directory traversal characters (../) before appending the filename. Additionally, a blocklist of file extensions is bypassed by adding a space at the end of the file extension, allowing the creation of arbitrary files in arbitrary locations.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Arbitrary file creation: The application doesn't properly validate the filename, allowing directory traversal using `../`.
  - Blocklist bypass: The file extension check can be bypassed by adding a space at the end of the extension.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can create arbitrary files at arbitrary locations on the file system, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution by exploiting the ability to launch the created file.

- **Attack vectors**:
  - Opening a specially crafted malicious PDF file.
  - Visiting a specially crafted, malicious website if the browser plugin extension is enabled.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into opening a malicious PDF file or visiting a malicious website with the vulnerable browser plugin.
