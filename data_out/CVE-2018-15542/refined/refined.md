{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Passcode feature in the Telegram Android application allows authentication bypass via runtime manipulation of the return value of the `ProcessDone` method.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure authentication, improper authentication (CWE-287). The application logic was not obfuscated, allowing analysis of the `ProcessDone` method which returns a boolean value. The lack of code obfuscation and reliance on a simple boolean check for authentication made it vulnerable to runtime manipulation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Authentication bypass. An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the Telegram application without knowing the correct passcode.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker with access to a rooted Android device can perform runtime manipulation by hooking into the `ProcessDone` method and forcing it to return 'true'. This can also be achieved by a malicious application evading Google Play Store detection.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to a rooted Android device. They also need to be able to perform runtime manipulation, either through a tool like Frida or a malicious app."
