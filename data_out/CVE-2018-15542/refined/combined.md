|  | > [Description] |
| --- | --- |
|  | > \*\* DISPUTED \*\* An issue was discovered in the org.telegram.messenger |
|  | > application 4.8.11 for Android. The Passcode feature allows |
|  | > authentication bypass via runtime manipulation that forces a certain |
|  | > method's return value to true. In other words, an attacker could |
|  | > authenticate with an arbitrary passcode. NOTE: the vendor indicates |
|  | > that this is not an attack of interest within the context of their |
|  | > threat model, which excludes Android devices on which rooting has |
|  | > occurred. |

|  | > [Additional Information] |
|  | > Exploitation Narrative for bypass local authentication on Passcode |
|  | > |
|  | > 1. De-compiling process was used to determine application logic |
|  | > through source code. Without code obfuscation implementation, We could |
|  | > analyse the logic of Passcode authentication on the "PasscodeView" |
|  | > class and "ProcessDone" method and found that the return type is |
|  | > Boolean type. |
|  | > |
|  | > 2. Frida script was created to hook into "ProcessDone" method in order |
|  | > to force the return value to be "true". |

|  | > [Attack Vectors] |
|  | > An attacker who is able to access on rooted Android device, could |
