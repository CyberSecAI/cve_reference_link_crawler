{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The frequency table arrays in the Qualcomm Multimedia Clock Controller (MMCC) driver for the APQ8084 are not terminated with an empty element, which can lead to out-of-bounds access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing array terminator",
       "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "Out-of-bounds read during clock frequency table traversal, possibly leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered when the functions `qcom_find_freq()` or `qcom_find_freq_floor()` traverse the frequency tables.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to influence the clock frequency settings such that the vulnerable functions are called."
