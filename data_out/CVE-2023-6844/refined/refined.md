**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The iframe plugin for WordPress versions 5.0 and below fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied attributes within the plugin's shortcode.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
- The plugin does not properly sanitize attributes besides `src`, allowing for injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code via shortcode attributes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows authenticated attackers with contributor-level permissions or higher to inject arbitrary web scripts.
- These scripts execute whenever a user accesses a page containing the injected shortcode, potentially leading to:
  - Data theft
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the website
  - Redirection to malicious websites

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious iframe shortcode with XSS payloads in attributes other than the `src` attribute.
- This malicious shortcode is then inserted into a page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least contributor-level permissions, as they need to be able to create or modify posts/pages to insert the malicious shortcode.
