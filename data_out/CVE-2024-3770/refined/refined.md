Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `del` parameter of the `manage-courses.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, stemming from unsanitized input being directly used in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Compromise of the Application:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Data Access and Modification:**  Attackers can read sensitive data from the database, modify existing data, or even delete data.
*   **Exploitation of Underlying Database:** Attackers can potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database system.
*   **Complete Database Takeover:** It could lead to complete compromise of database instance and server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `manage-courses.php` endpoint.
*   **`del` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `del` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application server.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to manipulate HTTP requests.
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
*   **Tooling:** The attacker can use automated tools like sqlmap to exploit the vulnerability.
