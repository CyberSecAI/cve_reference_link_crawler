- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Inadequate encryption of passwords during communication between LS ELECTRIC's XG5000 software and LS ELECTRIC PLCs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Passwords transmitted between the software and PLCs are not adequately encrypted (CWE-326). This allows for the possibility of traffic sniffing to obtain the passwords in a decryptable form.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can decrypt credentials and gain full access to the affected programmable logic controller (PLC).
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can intercept network traffic between the affected versions of the XG5000 software and the LS ELECTRIC PLCs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to sniff network traffic between the vulnerable devices. The attack complexity is considered low, and the attacker does not require any privileges. User interaction is required for the initial phase.
