Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information regarding CVE-2022-30966:

**CVE-2022-30966**

*   **Root Cause:** The Random String Parameter Plugin does not properly escape the name and description of the parameter type it provides.
*   **Weakness:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of a user viewing the parameter, potentially leading to information disclosure or unauthorized actions.
*  **Attack Vector:** An attacker with Item/Configure permission can configure a parameter with a malicious name or description. When this parameter is displayed on pages such as "Build With Parameters" or "Parameters" page, the injected script is executed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs Item/Configure permission to modify job configurations and inject malicious scripts. They also require a user to view the affected page for the script to execute.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content specifies that Jenkins core has prevented similar XSS exploitation on the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages since versions 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2. However, the vulnerability exists in the Random String Parameter Plugin and would require the injected parameter to be rendered on a different, vulnerable page.
*   As of the publication of this advisory, there is no fix available for this vulnerability.
*   This vulnerability is part of a larger group of similar XSS vulnerabilities found in other parameter plugins.
