Based on the provided information, this content is related to the following vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an SQL injection found in the `category.php` file of the "Online Food Ordering System Project" due to the direct use of the `custom` parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the `category.php` file.
- Lack of input sanitization/validation for the `custom` parameter.
- The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access
- Sensitive data leakage
- Data tampering
- Comprehensive system control
- Potential service interruption

**Attack vectors:**
- By sending a POST request to `addcategory.php` with a crafted payload in the `cname` parameter (which includes the vulnerable custom parameter).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is named 'custom', and it's accessible via the `cname` parameter in the HTTP POST request.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection using the `SLEEP()` function.
- The vulnerability can be exploited using tools like sqlmap.
- The affected version of the software is 1.0.
- The vulnerability is present in `category.php`, while the description also mentions `order.php`.
- Suggested mitigations include using prepared statements, input validation, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.
