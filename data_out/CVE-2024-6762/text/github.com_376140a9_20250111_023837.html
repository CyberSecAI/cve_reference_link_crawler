### @lachlan-roberts **[lachlan-roberts](/lachlan-roberts)** commented [Oct 19, 2023](#issue-1951063840)

Following the deprecation of the `PushSessionCacheFilter` in PR [#9715](https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/pull/9715) we should also deprecate the `PushCacheFilter`.

Sorry, something went wrong.
