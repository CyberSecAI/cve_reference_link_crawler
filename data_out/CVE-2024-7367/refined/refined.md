Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue in the SourceCodester Simple Realtime Quiz System 1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CSRF:** The application doesn't properly validate requests originating from the same domain, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks. Specifically, the `/ajax.php?action=save_user` endpoint lacks protection against CSRF.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to modify user data, specifically via the `save_user` action. Although not explicitly stated, this could allow an attacker to create new accounts, modify existing user roles, or alter other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **CSRF:** An attacker can craft a malicious web page or link that, when visited by a logged-in user of the vulnerable application, will send a forged request to `/ajax.php?action=save_user`.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to achieve this using a simple HTML form and JavaScript to automatically submit the request.
- The victim must be logged into the application for the attack to succeed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting the attacker's webpage or clicking a malicious link.
- No direct access or control over the vulnerable server is necessary.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects version 1.0 of the "Simple Realtime Quiz System" from SourceCodester.
- The PoC code shows that the following parameters are being tampered with `id`, `name`, `username`, `password`, and `type`, all of which are user attributes, meaning the CSRF allows an attacker to overwrite the user data of any user logged in.
