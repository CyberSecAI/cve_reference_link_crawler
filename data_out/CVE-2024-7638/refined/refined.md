Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection present in the `delete_client.php` file of the Kortex Lite Advocate Office Management System version 1.0. The application takes user input through the 'id' parameter and directly uses it in an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied data before being used in an SQL query. Specifically, the 'id' GET parameter passed to `delete_client.php` is directly used in a query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL code on the database. This can lead to:
    - Data breaches (access to sensitive information).
    - Data manipulation (modification or deletion of data).
    - Complete compromise of the database server, leading to a full system compromise
    - Could possibly lead to remote code execution (depending on database configuration).

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the HTTP GET parameter 'id' in the URL `/kortex_lite/control/delete_client.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific privileged access is needed to exploit the vulnerability other than accessing the application. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely if the application is accessible over the internet or an internal network.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content gives a specific vulnerable URL path `/kortex_lite/control/delete_client.php`.
- The content shows that the vulnerability can be exploited via the 'id' parameter.
- The vulnerability can be exploited using tools like sqlmap as also shown.
- The provided github link includes screenshots demonstrating the vulnerable location in the application.
