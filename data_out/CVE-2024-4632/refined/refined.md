### Summary of Vulnerability Information for CVE-2024-4632

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the `custom_upload_mimes` function of the WooCommerce Checkout & Funnel Builder by CartFlows plugin.

**Weaknesses:**
- The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling allowed mime types.
- The plugin does not properly escape output when generating web pages.

**Impact:**
- Authenticated attackers with contributor-level permissions or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to malicious actions, such as unauthorized data access, session hijacking, or defacement of the site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the allowed mime types through the `custom_upload_mimes` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated with at least contributor-level permissions.
- The attacker can inject malicious scripts through the plugin's settings or functionality related to allowed mime types.
