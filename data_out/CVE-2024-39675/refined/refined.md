- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Modbus service is incorrectly enabled in non-managed VLANs under certain configurations. This primarily affects serial devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect enabling of the Modbus service in non-managed VLANs, leading to exposure of the service in unintended network segments.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially leverage the exposed Modbus service to gain unauthorized access and control over the affected device. This could result in confidentiality breaches, data manipulation, and disruption of operations.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected device. Specifically, the attacker needs to reach the exposed Modbus port (502/tcp) in the non-managed VLAN.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have network adjacency to the affected device to reach the exposed Modbus service. No specific user privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
