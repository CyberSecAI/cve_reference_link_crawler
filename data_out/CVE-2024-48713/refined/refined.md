Root cause of vulnerability: The `wacWhitelistJsonToBin` function does not perform proper bounds checking on the `name` parameter, leading to a stack buffer overflow.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stack buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation on the size of the `name` parameter.

Impact of exploitation: The stack overflow can cause the router's server to crash, rendering the device unusable. Specifically, it results in the inability to connect wirelessly to the router and access the administrative interface.

Attack vectors: Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the router's web interface, specifically targeting the `wlan_access` endpoint with an oversized `name` parameter within the `white_list` table.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This typically means the attacker needs to be on the same network as the router, or have the ability to reach the router's IP address via a different network. Additionally, a valid session cookie is needed for the request.
