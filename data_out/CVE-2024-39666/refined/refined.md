- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This means that the plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on the web page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core weakness is a lack of input sanitization, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can inject scripts (such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts will execute when a user visits the compromised page. This could lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts through user-supplied input, which is then displayed without proper sanitization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the website.  The specific attack vector and the exact user inputs that cause the vulnerability are not detailed. The attacker does not need to be logged in, this can be done through a web browser by just loading the page.  The attack requires administrator privileges to exploit and the user can be a guest.
