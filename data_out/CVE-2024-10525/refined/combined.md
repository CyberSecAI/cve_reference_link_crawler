# Heap Buffer Overflow in my\_subscribe\_callback Function in Eclipse Mosquitto v2.0.18-4-g15292b20

## Basic information

**Project name:** Eclipse Mosquitto **Project id:** mosquitto.org

**Request type:** publication

**Versions affected:** [v2.0.18-4-g15292b20]

**Common Weakness Enumeration:**

* [CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)

**Common Vulnerability Scoring System:** -

**Summary:**

In Eclipse Mosquitto version v2.0.18-4-g15292b20, a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability was discovered that can be triggered when the broker processes a specially crafted packet. This vulnerability exists due to a boundary error within the `my_subscribe_callback` function in the `sub_client.c` file, which can lead to code execution or denial of service.

**Links:**

The project at "<https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto>" advises against posting discovered bugs directly in the issues section and instead requests the submission of details via the form at "<https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security>". I apologize for any inconvenience, and so I have documented the method for reproducing the issue here.

**Reproduce：**

1. Configure the building environment with ASan and UBSan by setting the environment variables for the compiler and linker:

   ```
   export CC=clang CXX=clang++
   export CFLAGS="-g -fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer"
   export CXXFLAGS="-g -fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer"
   export LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address,undefined"
   make clean
   make -j 8
   ```
2. Start the Mosquitto broker server in verbose mode on port 2883:

   ```
   mosquitto/src/mosquitto -v -p 2883
   ```
3. Write the data transmission from the proxy to the client using a series of hexstream found in `hexstream.txt`:

   [hexstream.txt](/-/project/3804/uploads/abdd422fd21616901eff5f58b225ca65/hexstream.txt)
   **Crash Report：**
   Here is the client log：

```
Run topic: test/tp
Run sub(Qos0) in topic [test/tp]
Run sub(Qos1) in topic [test/tp]
Run sub(Qos2) in topic [test/tp]
Run sub(Qos2) in topic [test/#]
Run Qos1 sub in topic [test/chat] with qos2 will
Hit CTRL+C
test/tp qos2
test/tp qos2
test/tp qos2
test/tp qos2
```

Here is the ASan reprot:

```
