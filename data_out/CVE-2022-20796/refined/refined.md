Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-20796:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability lies within the ClamAV scanning library, specifically in versions 0.103.5 and earlier, and 0.104.2 and earlier. It involves a NULL-pointer dereference crash during a scan verdict cache check. This is triggered when ClamAV attempts to process a truncated file.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **NULL-pointer dereference:** The vulnerability stems from a programming error where the code attempts to access a memory location via a pointer that is NULL (points to nothing). This can lead to a crash or unexpected behavior in the software.
   - The vulnerability is related to handling of truncated files during the scan verdict cache check.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can cause a denial-of-service condition, crashing the affected device/service. 
   - The vulnerability results in a crash/termination of the ClamAV scanning process and not other system resources.

**4. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Local Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is exploited through local access on the affected device.
   - **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to trigger the vulnerability, though only low privileges are required.
   - The attacker would need the ability to introduce a specially crafted, truncated file for ClamAV to scan.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Authenticated Local User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with low privileges on the target system to trigger this vulnerability.
   - **File Access:** The attacker requires the ability to provide specially crafted truncated files to ClamAV for scanning.

**Additional Technical Details:**
   - **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 6.5, categorized as a medium severity issue.
   - The CVSS vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H
   - Affected Cisco Products: Cisco Secure Endpoint for Linux, macOS and Windows

**Summary**

The vulnerability is a medium severity issue, which can result in denial of service. It can be exploited by an authenticated local attacker by introducing a crafted truncated file. Cisco has released fixes to address this issue.
