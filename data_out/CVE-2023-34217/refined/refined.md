The provided content is related to CVE-2023-34217.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Insufficient input validation in the web server of Moxa TN-5900 and TN-4900 series devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') (CWE-22). This allows an attacker to create or overwrite critical files used for code execution (programs or libraries).

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to denial-of-service, remote code execution, and privilege escalation. Specifically for CVE-2023-34217, an attacker can overwrite critical files.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending crafted input to the web service of the affected devices. This is done remotely over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web service of the affected device. They also need a valid user account to be able to access the web interface, thus requiring a low privileged account.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
*   TN-5900 Series prior to version 3.3
*   TN-4900 Series prior to version 1.2.4
*   EDR-G902 Series prior to firmware version v5.7.17
*   EDR-G903 Series prior to firmware version v5.7.15
*   EDR-G9010 Series prior to firmware version v2.1
*   NAT-102 Series prior to firmware version v1.0.3

The advisory also specifies that the EDR-810 Series prior to firmware version v5.12.27 is affected by related command injection vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-33238, CVE-2023-33239, and CVE-2023-34214), however, this is not the specified CVE.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is a path traversal vulnerability, allowing attackers to manipulate file paths and overwrite critical system files.
*   The web service is the attack surface for all mentioned vulnerabilities.
*   The provided CVSS v3.1 score for CVE-2023-34217 is 8.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)
*   Moxa recommends upgrading the firmware of affected devices to the specified versions to fix the vulnerability.
*   Moxa suggests minimizing network exposure and using VPNs for remote access as mitigations.
*   Temporarily disabling the web service is also advised until the firmware is updated.
