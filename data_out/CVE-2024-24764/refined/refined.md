- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The resolver for the page finder link schema (`october://`) in October CMS allowed external links, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Open redirect.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated administrator can be redirected to an untrusted URL, potentially leading to phishing or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with access to the administration panel crafts a malicious `october://` link, and another administrator user needs to interact with this link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the administration panel of the October CMS instance and trick another administrator into clicking the crafted link.
