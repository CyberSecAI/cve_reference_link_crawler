- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input sanitization in the CFEngine Enterprise web UI, specifically the Mission Portal login page, allows for SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Time-based SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can extract the entire database contents, including sensitive information like access tokens and salted password hashes.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting special queries using the `PG_SLEEP` function in the login page's input fields, an attacker can observe the server response time and deduce database contents character by character.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the CFEngine Mission Portal login page. No authentication is required to trigger this vulnerability on the login page.
