Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-47793:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically when creating or editing custom columns of type "images" or "files." This allows for malicious JavaScript code to be injected and stored within the application's database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- When a user accesses an edit screen containing the malicious custom columns, the injected JavaScript code will be executed within their web browser. This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
  - Session hijacking
  - Stealing sensitive information (e.g., cookies)
  - Redirecting to malicious websites
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user
  - Defacement of the web page

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with low-level privileges can inject malicious scripts while creating or editing custom columns (of type "images" or "files").

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a logged-in user with the ability to create or edit tables with custom columns within the Exment application.
