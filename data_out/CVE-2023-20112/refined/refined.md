- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of certain parameters within 802.11 frames.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of parameters within 802.11 association request frames.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker sends a crafted wireless 802.11 association request frame with malicious parameters to an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be adjacent to the affected device to send the crafted wireless frames. No authentication is required.
