**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10655

**Vulnerable Software:** Tongda OA 2017 up to 11.9

**Vulnerability Location:** `/pda/reportshop/new.php`

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw. The `repid` parameter in the `/pda/reportshop/new.php` file is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application constructs an SQL query using externally influenced input without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Confidentiality:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive data within the database.
*   **Integrity:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Availability:** Attackers can cause denial-of-service by disrupting database operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerable parameter `repid` is passed via a GET request to the `/pda/reportshop/new.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Tongda OA instance.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Technical Details:**
*   The provided GitHub issue shows example HTTP requests demonstrating how to inject SQL code through the `repid` parameter. The examples show using `and` and `substr` in the SQL injection to extract database information.
*   The provided exploit code shows the injection point: `GET /pda/reportshop/new.php?repid=1%20and%20(substr(DATABASE(),1,1))=char(116)%20and%20(select%20count(*)%20from%20information_schema.columns%20A,information_schema.columns%20B)`

**Additional Information:**
*   A public exploit is available and has been disclosed.
*   The vulnerability is considered easy to exploit.
*   Google hacking can be used to identify vulnerable targets using `inurl:pda/reportshop/new.php`.
*   No specific countermeasures are available, and the suggestion is to replace the affected product.
