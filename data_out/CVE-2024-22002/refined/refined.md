The provided content is related to CVE-2024-22002.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a DLL hijacking issue in CORSAIR iCUE v5.9.105 during the update process. The "iCUEUpdateService" service spawns "cuepkg.exe" with "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" privileges, and this process loads DLLs from the `\cuepkg-1.2.6` directory. Since a regular user can create files in this directory, a malicious DLL can be placed there and loaded by `cuepkg.exe` with elevated privileges.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- DLL Hijacking: The application loads DLLs from a user-writable directory, which allows an attacker to inject a malicious DLL.
- Privilege Escalation: The vulnerable process runs with "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" privileges, enabling the attacker to gain elevated privileges by injecting a malicious DLL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve local privilege escalation from a low-privileged user to SYSTEM level. This means the attacker can execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges on the system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves placing a malicious DLL (e.g., `MSASN1.dll`, `NTASN1.dll`, or `profapi.dll`) within the `\cuepkg-1.2.6` directory of the iCUE installation. The vulnerable application loads these DLLs during its update process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the system.
- The attacker must have write access to the `\cuepkg-1.2.6` directory within the iCUE installation directory.
- The attacker must be able to trigger the update process by either waiting for automatic updates or manually forcing an update check.
