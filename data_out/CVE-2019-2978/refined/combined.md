## Details

Jan Jancar, Petr Svenda, and Vladimir Sedlacek discovered that a side-

channel vulnerability existed in the ECDSA implementation in OpenJDK. An

Attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-2894](/security/CVE-2019-2894))

It was discovered that the Socket implementation in OpenJDK did not

properly restrict the creation of subclasses with a custom Socket

implementation. An attacker could use this to specially create a Java class

that could possibly bypass Java sandbox restrictions. ([CVE-2019-2945](/security/CVE-2019-2945))

Rob Hamm discovered that the Kerberos implementation in OpenJDK did not

properly handle proxy credentials. An attacker could possibly use this to

impersonate another user. ([CVE-2019-2949](/security/CVE-2019-2949))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference existed in the font

handling implementation in OpenJDK. An attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (application crash). ([CVE-2019-2962](/security/CVE-2019-2962))

It was discovered that the Concurrency subsystem in OpenJDK did not

properly bound stack consumption when compiling regular expressions. An

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash).

([CVE-2019-2964](/security/CVE-2019-2964))

It was discovered that the JAXP subsystem in OpenJDK did not properly

handle XPath expressions in some situations. An attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (application crash). ([CVE-2019-2973](/security/CVE-2019-2973),

[CVE-2019-2981](/security/CVE-2019-2981))

It was discovered that the Nashorn JavaScript subcomponent in OpenJDK did

not properly handle regular expressions in some situations. An attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash).

([CVE-2019-2975](/security/CVE-2019-2975))

It was discovered that the String class in OpenJDK contained an out-of-

bounds access vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (application crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.

This issue only affected OpenJDK 11 in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 19.04,

and Ubuntu 19.10. ([CVE-2019-2977](/security/CVE-2019-2977))

It was discovered that the Jar URL handler in OpenJDK did not properly

handled nested Jar URLs in some situations. An attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (application crash). ([CVE-2019-2978](/security/CVE-2019-2978))

It was discovered that the Serialization component of OpenJDK did not

properly handle deserialization of certain object attributes. An attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash).

([CVE-2019-2983](/security/CVE-2019-2983))

It was discovered that the FreetypeFontScaler class in OpenJDK did not

properly validate dimensions of glyph bitmap images read from font files.

An attacker could specially craft a font file that could cause a denial of

service (application crash). ([CVE-2019-2987](/security/CVE-2019-2987))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the SunGraphics2D class

in OpenJDK. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (excessive memory consumption or application crash).

([CVE-2019-2988](/security/CVE-2019-2988))

It was discovered that the Networking component in OpenJDK did not properly

handle certain responses from HTTP proxies. An attacker controlling a

malicious HTTP proxy could possibly use this to inject content into a

proxied HTTP connection. ([CVE-2019-2989](/security/CVE-2019-2989))

It was discovered that the font handling implementation in OpenJDK did not

properly validate TrueType font files in some situations. An attacker could

specially craft a font file that could cause a denial of service (excessive

memory consumption). ([CVE-2019-2992](/security/CVE-2019-2992))

It was discovered that the JavaDoc generator in OpenJDK did not properly

filter out some HTML elements properly, including documentation comments in

Java source code. An attacker could possibly use this to craft a Cross-Site

Scripting attack. ([CVE-2019-2999](/security/CVE-2019-2999))

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the OpenJDK Java
runtime, resulting in cross-site scripting, denial of service,
information disclosure or Kerberos user impersonation.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 11_11.0.5+10-1~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-11 packages.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in denial of
service, sandbox bypass, information disclosure or the execution
of arbitrary code.

Updates for the amd64 architecture are already available, new packages
for i386, armel and armhf will be available within the next 24 hours.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
7u241-2.6.20-1~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-7 packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
