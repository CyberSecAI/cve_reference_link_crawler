The provided content is related to CVE-2023-52155.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an SQL injection in the `/admin/sauvegarde/run.php` file. The `$currentSauv` variable, which is derived from the `$sauvegardes` array (a user-supplied GET parameter), is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: Unsafe concatenation of user-supplied input in SQL queries, specifically in the `/admin/sauvegarde/run.php` file.
- Lack of input validation/sanitization: The application does not sanitize or validate the `sauvegardes` GET parameter before using it in an SQL query.
- Command injection: The attacker can manipulate the result of the SQL query to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands. Specifically the `sauv_sauvegarde_compress_command` column value is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE): By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker can manipulate the compression command executed by the application, leading to arbitrary command execution on the server.
- Full system compromise: Successful exploitation can allow the attacker to gain complete control of the affected server.
- Data exfiltration and manipulation: The attacker can read and modify any data on the server.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): This vulnerability can also be triggered via CSRF when an authenticated user visits a malicious page, leading to RCE on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The attacker sends a malicious GET request to `/admin/sauvegarde/run.php` with a manipulated `sauvegardes` parameter.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):  The attacker can embed a malicious request in a page that, when visited by an authenticated user, triggers the vulnerability

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authentication: The attacker must be an authenticated user.
- Network access: The attacker must have network access to the PMB application.
- HTTP request manipulation: The attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP requests, including manipulating the GET parameters.
