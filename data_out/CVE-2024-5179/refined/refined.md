{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The plugin uses user-supplied input ('item_style' and 'style' parameters) to construct file paths for inclusion, without sufficient validation or sanitization, allowing path traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "Path Traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary files from the server. This can be leveraged to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution if they can upload malicious PHP code as an image, for instance.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted request with malicious values for 'item_style' or 'style' parameter to the vulnerable WordPress plugin via HTTP request.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated with Contributor level access or above. This implies the attacker must be a registered user on the WordPress site with at least Contributor privileges."
