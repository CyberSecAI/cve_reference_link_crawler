Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-8384:

**Root Cause:** The JavaScript garbage collector could mis-color cross-compartment objects under specific out-of-memory (OOM) conditions during its operation. This could occur between two garbage collection passes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Incorrect Object Coloring:** The garbage collector, under OOM conditions at a specific time between two passes, could improperly mark cross-compartment objects.
*   **Memory Corruption:** This improper marking could lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**  Memory corruption

**Attack Vectors:** Triggering specific out-of-memory (OOM) conditions during garbage collection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to manipulate the application in a way that causes OOM conditions at the correct time, between garbage collection passes.
