Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a "Broken Access Control" issue. This indicates a flaw in the plugin's authorization mechanisms, likely a missing authentication check or nonce validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is the lack of proper access controls, which allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An unprivileged user could potentially perform actions meant for higher-privileged users, leading to unauthorized modification, deletion, or disclosure of data. The exact impact will depend on the specific actions that are improperly protected.  The provided text states it is unlikely to be exploited and of low severity.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector would involve a user exploiting the missing access control checks to perform actions they are not authorized to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a user of the affected WordPress plugin and have at least the "Contributor" privilege, suggesting that they do not need high level administrative access to exploit this issue.

**Additional Notes:**
* The specific function with the broken access control is not detailed in this document.
* The provided information indicates the vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.3.8 and later versions.
* The CVSS score is 4.3 which is considered low severity.
