- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper certificate validation when establishing secure connections with public SDN connectors.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of client-side certificate validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack on the communication channel between the FortiADC device and public SDN connectors, leading to potential information disclosure and modification.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, through a Man-in-the-Middle attack on the communication channel with public SDN connectors.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the FortiADC device and the public SDN connector.
