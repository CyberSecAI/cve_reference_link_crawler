Aug 24, 2023

## Package

gomod

netmaker
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<v0.18.6

## Patched versions

v0.17.1,v0.18.6+

## Description

### Impact

Hardcoded DNS key usage has been found in Netmaker allowing unauth users to interact with DNS API endpoints.

### Patches

Issue is patched in 0.17.1, and fixed in 0.18.6+.

If Users are using 0.17.1, they should run "docker pull gravitl/netmaker:v0.17.1" and "docker-compose up -d". This will switch them to the patched users

If users are using v0.18.0-0.18.5, they should upgrade to v0.18.6 or later.

### Workarounds

If using 0.17.1, can just pull the latest docker image of backend and restart server.
