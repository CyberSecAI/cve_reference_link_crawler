Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-32077:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a hardcoded DNS secret key within the Netmaker application. This key was used to authenticate requests to the DNS API endpoints.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hardcoded Secret:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of a hardcoded string (`"secretkey"`) being used as the DNS key. This was located in `servercfg/serverconf.go` in the `GetDNSKey` function.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The authentication logic in `logic/security.go`, specifically the `authenticateDNSToken` function, directly compared the provided token with the hardcoded secret, without checking if the key was properly configured.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:**  Unauthenticated users could interact with the DNS API endpoints by using the hardcoded secret key, potentially gaining access to sensitive network information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if they have network access to the Netmaker server and know the hardcoded DNS key. They could then make unauthorized API requests to the `/api/dns/adm/{network}/nodes` endpoint (example mentioned in the pull request).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to reach the Netmaker server.
- **Knowledge of Hardcoded Key:** The attacker needs to know the hardcoded secret key ("secretkey").

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involved removing the hardcoded key and instead, retrieving it from an environment variable (`DNS_KEY`) or from the application's configuration (`config.Config.Server.DNSKey`).
- The patched versions are v0.17.1 and v0.18.6+.
- The vulnerability was identified and reported by Project Discovery.
- The commit `1621c27` introduced the fix to remove the hardcoded key, and commit `9362c39` merged this fix.

In summary, the vulnerability in Netmaker was due to the presence of a hardcoded DNS secret key, which allowed unauthenticated users to interact with DNS API endpoints. The fix involved removing the hardcoded key and relying on configuration or environment variables for the DNS key.
