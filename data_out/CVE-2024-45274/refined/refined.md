  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The device has a UDP service listening on port 25353 that accepts commands, including critical functions like OS command execution, without authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306)"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can execute OS commands with root privileges, leading to full compromise of the device.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker sends specially crafted UDP packets to the device's port 25353.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the affected device to send UDP packets. No prior authentication is needed."
