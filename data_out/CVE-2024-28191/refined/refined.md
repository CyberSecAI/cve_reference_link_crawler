Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28191:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-submitted form data when outputting it on a webpage. Specifically, the `SimpleTokenParser` in Contao was not properly encoding insert tags, allowing them to be interpreted rather than displayed as plain text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insert Tag Injection:** The core issue is that insert tags (special placeholders like `{{date}}` which are interpreted by Contao to output dynamic content) in the form data are not properly encoded when processed by the `SimpleTokenParser` and displayed on the webpage. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary insert tags into form fields and have them be executed when the data is displayed.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The `SimpleTokenParser` did not encode curly braces within token values, which are needed to prevent the execution of insert tags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality:** The impact is rated as low, with the possibility of unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data.
- **Integrity:** The impact is rated as none, as there is no data modification possible through this vulnerability.
- **Availability:** The impact is rated as none, as there is no way to affect the availability of the impacted component.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (potentially):** Although the severity is low and no specific exploit is provided, successful injection of insert tags can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution depending on the specific insert tags available and how the application handles them. The provided texts mention that “if-tags” and “insert tags” can be injected, so more complex attacks could potentially be created.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based.
- **Form Submission:** The attack involves submitting form data with crafted insert tags.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not require any special privileges on the system.
- **No User Interaction:** The attacker can submit the malicious form data without any user interaction.
- **Knowledge of Contao's Form Handling:** The attacker needs some knowledge of how Contao handles form data and displays it on the webpage. They need to find a way that user-submitted data is output to a page.

**Technical Details:**

- **Code Changes:** The fix involves changes in `Input.php` to properly encode curly braces `{` and `}` at the beginning and end of strings. Changes to `SimpleTokenParser.php` were made to use `Input::encodeInsertTags()` to process tokens. Additional tests were added to `InputTest.php` and `SimpleTokenParserTest.php` to verify the encoding and prevent regression.
- **Vulnerable Code:** The `SimpleTokenParser` in affected versions was not encoding curly braces within token values, allowing for the injection of insert tags.
- **Patched Code:** The `SimpleTokenParser` now encodes curly braces when processing token values by using `Input::encodeInsertTags()`.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is identified as GHSA-747v-52c4-8vj8.
