- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation of received traffic in the HTTP-based client profiling feature of Cisco IOS XE Software for Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation when processing traffic related to HTTP-based client profiling. This allows an attacker to send crafted traffic that can lead to excessive resource consumption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by causing increased CPU utilization on the affected device, which can also lead to new wireless client associations to fail. The device returns to normal operation once the offending traffic stops.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent, meaning the attacker must be within the same network vicinity as the targeted wireless access point. The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted network traffic through a wireless access point.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an unauthenticated adjacent attacker capable of sending crafted network traffic to the vulnerable device. The attacker does not require any prior authentication or privileges. They must be on the same network segment as the access point.
