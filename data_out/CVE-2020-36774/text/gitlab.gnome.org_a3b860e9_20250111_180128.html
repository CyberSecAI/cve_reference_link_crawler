# Glade 3.36.0 segfaults when opening a file

Everytime I open the attached file, [app.ui](/-/project/1069/uploads/86785cb90dd438480ac4ed651309c0f8/app.ui), Glade, shuts down. The UI file was created with the same Glade the day before, it worked normally, and the next day I couldn't open the file anymore. Glade can open other files.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Start a terminal.
2. Run `glade`.
3. Open the [app.ui](/-/project/1069/uploads/86785cb90dd438480ac4ed651309c0f8/app.ui) file.

## Expected result

I can see and edit the UI file normally.

## Unexpected result

Glade shuts itself down with the following message:

```
$ glade
GladeUI-Message: 09:59:00.658: 2 missing displayable value for GtkWidget::AtkObject::accessible-role
GladeUI-Message: 09:59:00.729: 1 missing displayable value for GtkEntry::input-purpose
