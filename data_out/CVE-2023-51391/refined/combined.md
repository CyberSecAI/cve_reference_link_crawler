# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2024-1945

## Silicon Labs Gecko Platform HTTP server header parsing invalid pointer dereference vulnerability

##### April 18, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-51391

##### SUMMARY

An invalid pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the HTTP server header parsing functionality of Silicon Labs Gecko Platform 4.3.2.0. A specially crafted network packet can lead to denial of service. An attacker can send a malicious packet to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Silicon Labs Gecko Platform 4.3.2.0

##### PRODUCT URLS

Gecko Platform - <https://www.silabs.com/developers/gecko-software-development-kit>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.5 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-690 - Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference

##### DETAILS

The Gecko Platform is a portion of the components within Gecko SDK which includes Micrium OS. A network stack is included within Micrium OS which supports TCP/IP with ipv4 and ipv6 and implementations for popular application protocols.

This invalid pointer dereference occurs when parsing header values of an HTTP request. The call to `Str_Char_N` at `[1]` will fail and return `NULL` if no colon `:` character is found between the header key value and the next occurrence of crlf `\r\n`. The return value is not checked before the pointer is incremented, which results in the pointer `p_val` having a value of `1`. Next, that pointer is dereferenced in the function `HTTP_StrGraphSrchFirst` which results in a crash.

```
File: http_server_req.c
1807: static CPU_CHAR *HTTPsReq_HdrParseValGet(CPU_CHAR   *p_field,
1808:                                          CPU_INT16U field_len,
1809:                                          CPU_CHAR   *p_field_end,
1810:                                          CPU_INT16U *p_len_rem)
1811: {
1812:   CPU_INT16U len;
1813:   CPU_CHAR   *p_val;
1814:
1815:   p_val = p_field + field_len;
1816:   len = (p_field_end - p_val);
1817:
1818:   p_val = Str_Char_N(p_val, len, ASCII_CHAR_COLON);             // Field val located after ':' (see Note #1a). [1]
1819:   p_val++;
1820:
1821:   len = (p_field_end - p_val);
1822:   p_val = HTTP_StrGraphSrchFirst(p_val, len);                   // Remove blank space before field value.
1823:
1824:   *p_len_rem = (p_field_end - p_val);
1825:
1826:   return (p_val);
1827: }

```

If this library is used on a system where `1` is addressable and contains data, this vulnerability could lead to further memory corruption. In this case, when `HTTPsReq_HdrParseValGet` returns the returned pointer `p_val` would point to an address that is out of bounds of the original buffer of `p_field` that was passed to this function.
