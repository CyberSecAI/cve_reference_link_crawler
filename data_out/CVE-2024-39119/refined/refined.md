Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Root Cause:** The idccms V1.35 application lacks proper CSRF protection in the `info_deal.php` component. This allows an attacker to craft malicious requests that, when triggered by an authenticated user, can cause unintended actions on the server.

**Weaknesses:** The primary weakness is the absence of anti-CSRF tokens or other mechanisms to prevent forged requests. The application blindly accepts requests from any source as long as the required parameters are included, enabling CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can leverage CSRF to perform actions as an authenticated user without the user's knowledge. In this specific Proof of Concept (POC), the attacker is able to modify content (`content` parameter), but potentially other actions, such as modification of news items, settings, or other data in the system, could be done.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTML page containing a form that submits a malicious request to the vulnerable `info_deal.php` component. The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into accessing the malicious page to execute the CSRF attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious web page or inject malicious code on a page that a logged-in user is likely to access.
*   The attacker needs to know the target application's URL and how to construct a valid POST request, including the necessary parameters, which could be discovered by analyzing legitimate requests from the application.
*   The targeted user must be logged into the idccms application in the same browser session where the malicious page is accessed.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided content includes a complete Proof-of-Concept (PoC) HTML form that demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability. This PoC form targets the `http://127.0.0.1:80/admin/info_deal.php?mudi=rev&nohrefStr=close` URL, which is likely a local development URL, and includes numerous parameters that are all submitted to that URL.
*   The `content` parameter in the POST request is being manipulated in the PoC, injecting HTML code into it.
*  The PoC form also includes `history.pushState('', '', '/')` which is likely to hide the URL of the malicious page from the user.
