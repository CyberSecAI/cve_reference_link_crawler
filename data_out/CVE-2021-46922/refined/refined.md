Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2021-46922.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing `tpm_try_get_ops()` call in the `tpm2_seal_trusted()` function within the Linux kernel's trusted key subsystem. This missing call was introduced during a rebase of a previous patch, causing an imbalance in TPM operations management.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Imbalanced TPM ops: The lack of `tpm_try_get_ops()` leads to an imbalanced "get" and "put" of TPM operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Kernel Oops: The imbalanced TPM operations result in kernel oopses, especially on TIS (Trusted Interface Specification) based hardware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Triggering the `tpm2_seal_trusted()` function, which is part of the trusted key subsystem.
- Exploiting the logic flaw causing imbalanced TPM operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to interact with the trusted key subsystem and trigger the `tpm2_seal_trusted()` function.
- Successful exploitation would require a system with TIS-based TPM hardware and use of trusted keys.

**More Details:**
The provided patches indicate the fix involves adding back the `tpm_try_get_ops(chip)` call within the `tpm2_seal_trusted()` function, ensuring TPM operations are correctly managed, preventing the kernel oops.
The original vulnerable code was introduced by commit `8c657a0590de` and the fix is applied with commit `9d5171eab462a63e2fbebfccf6026e92be018f20`. The fix is then backported to the stable kernels with commits `bf84ef2dd2ccdcd8f2658476d34b51455f970ce4` and `39c8d760d44cb3fa0d67e8cd505df81cf4d80999`
