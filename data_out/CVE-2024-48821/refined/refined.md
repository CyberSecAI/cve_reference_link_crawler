- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `FtpConfig.php` page does not sanitize user inputs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of users who visit the `FtpConfig.php` page. This could lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirecting users to malicious websites. The payload will also trigger for logged-in users visiting the FTP configuration page.
- **Attack vectors**:  A malicious actor can send a crafted HTTP POST request to `FtpConfig.php` containing the XSS payload in the `host`, `user`, and `password` fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `FtpConfig.php` page of the vulnerable application. They do not need prior authentication, but can trigger the vulnerability for authenticated users visiting the page.
