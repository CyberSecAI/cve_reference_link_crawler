  "CVE-2024-5037": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in OpenShift's Telemeter. If certain conditions are in place, an attacker can use a forged token to bypass the issue (\"iss\") check during JSON web token (JWT) authentication.",
    "Root cause": "The telemeter uses strings.Split(tokenData, \".\") to extract the payload, which means that the user should submit a Compact type JWS Token. However, go-jose's jwt.ParseSigned(tokenData) also supports authenticating JWS Token of JSON type. That means if the attacker submits a Token like:  ``` { \"fakeiss\":\".eyJpc3MiOiJhY2NvdW50cy5nb29nbGUuY29tIn0.\", \"protected\":\"\", \"header\":\"\", \"payload\":\"\", \"signature\":\"\" } ```  The attacker can forge a token issued by Google to pass the verification.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of JWT tokens",
      "Lack of strict adherence to compact serialization for JWS tokens"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can use a forged JWT token to bypass the issuer check during JWT authentication, potentially leading to privilege escalation if two servers share the same key.",
    "Attack vectors": "A crafted JWS token of JSON type, instead of the expected compact type, can bypass the `iss` check in telemeter's JWT authentication.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a valid JSON web token and must be targeting a telemeter instance using shared secrets, or one that relies upon the vulnerable issuer check."
