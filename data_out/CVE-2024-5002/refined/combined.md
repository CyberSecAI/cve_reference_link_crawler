## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# User Submitted Posts < 20240516 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Navigate to Settings >> Submitted Posts, and set the payload below as "Custom Content" (inside General Settings tab): `<script>alert(1)</script>`
2. Click on "Save All Changes"
3. Add the `[user-submitted-posts]` shortcode to a post or page and view the post or page on the frontend to see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
