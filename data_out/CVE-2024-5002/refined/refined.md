Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5002

**Vulnerable Plugin:** User Submitted Posts

**Versions Affected:** Versions prior to 20240516

**Root Cause:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape certain settings, specifically the "Custom Content" field within the plugin's settings. This allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weakness:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization and escaping of user-controlled input.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. When a page or post containing the `[user-submitted-posts]` shortcode is viewed, the malicious script will execute in the user's browser. This could allow the attacker to:

*   Steal user session cookies.
*   Redirect users to malicious websites.
*   Perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   Deface the website.

**Attack Vector:**

1.  An attacker with administrator or other high-privilege access to the WordPress admin panel navigates to the plugin's settings page.
2.  They inject a malicious JavaScript payload into the "Custom Content" setting.
3.  The administrator saves the changes.
4.  The malicious script is stored in the database.
5.  When a user views a page or post with the  `[user-submitted-posts]` shortcode, the stored script executes in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have administrative privileges or other high-privilege access to the WordPress admin dashboard.
*   The attacker must be able to modify the plugin's settings.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed, which is often the case in WordPress multisite setups.
*   The fix was included in version 20240516 of the plugin.
