- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of GLB files, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process with low integrity.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Visiting a malicious page
    - Opening a malicious file
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to entice a user to interact with a malicious GLB file, either by opening it or visiting a malicious page that triggers the parsing of the file. User interaction is required.
