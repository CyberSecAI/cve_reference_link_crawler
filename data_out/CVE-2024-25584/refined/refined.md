- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Dovecot incorrectly accepts `LF DOT LF` as the end of the DATA command in SMTP, instead of the required `CR LF DOT CR LF`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient verification of data authenticity (CWE-345). Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the improper parsing of the end-of-data sequence in the SMTP protocol.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A single email containing `LF DOT LF` within its body will be split into two separate emails during relaying by Dovecot, potentially leading to message manipulation, content alteration and data corruption.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks exploiting a vulnerable Dovecot server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No privileges or user interaction are required for this attack, only the ability to send an email with a crafted payload to the vulnerable server.
