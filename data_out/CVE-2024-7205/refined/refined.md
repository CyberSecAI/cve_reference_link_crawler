- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Sharing unnecessary device-sensitive information via the cloud interface when a device is shared with a secondary user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The eWeLink Cloud Service homepage module, in versions 2.0.0 to 2.19.0, exposes unnecessary key information about a device when shared with a secondary user. This allows the secondary user to obtain all device information.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A secondary user can take over a device as the primary user, gaining full control of it.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the eWeLink Cloud Service. A primary user shares a device with a secondary user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a secondary user who has had a device shared with them by the primary user. The attacker exploits the cloud interface to obtain the sensitive device information.
