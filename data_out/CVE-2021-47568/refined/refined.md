Based on the provided information, the content is related to CVE-2021-47568.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A memory leak exists in the `get_file_stream_info()` function within the ksmbd module. Specifically, if the calculated size for the stream info (`next`) exceeds the available buffer space (`buf_free_len`), the allocated `stream_buf` is not freed, leading to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The allocated memory for `stream_buf` is not released when the calculated `next` size exceeds `buf_free_len`, leading to a leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Resource exhaustion: Repeated exploitation could lead to memory exhaustion, potentially impacting the system's stability and performance.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending SMB2 requests that trigger the `get_file_stream_info` function with crafted parameters or conditions that result in the `next` exceeding `buf_free_len`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send SMB2 requests to the target system, and be able to cause the `next` variable to exceed the available buffer length to trigger the memory leak.
