Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2021-47281.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `snd_seq_timer_open()` function in the ALSA sequencer subsystem does not properly manage concurrent accesses to the timer instance per queue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Race Condition:** Concurrent calls to `snd_seq_timer_open()` can lead to one call overriding the timer instance of another, due to the lack of proper protection during the assignment of `tmr->timeri`.
- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** If a timer instance is overridden, the leftover instance can keep running even after the queue is closed, potentially resulting in a UAF condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a use-after-free condition, which could result in a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Concurrent calls to `snd_seq_timer_open()` on the same queue.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make concurrent calls to `snd_seq_timer_open()` on the same queue. This typically requires local access to the system.
