The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1066.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing authorization check in the Aethon TUG Home Base Server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing Authorization (CWE-862): An unauthenticated attacker can arbitrarily add new users with administrative privileges and delete or modify existing users. This is associated with CVE-2022-1066.
- Missing Authorization (CWE-862): An unauthenticated attacker can freely access hashed user credentials. (CVE-2022-26423)
- Channel Accessible by Non-endpoint (CWE-300): An unauthenticated attacker can connect to the TUG Home Base Server websocket to take control of TUG robots. (CVE-2022-1070)
- Cross-site Scripting (CWE-79): The “Reports” tab of the Fleet Management Console is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting attacks. (CVE-2022-27494)
- Cross-site Scripting (CWE-79): The “Load” tab of the Fleet Management Console is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting attacks. (CVE-2022-1059)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to a denial-of-service condition, allow full control of robot functions, or expose sensitive information.
-Specifically for CVE-2022-1066 an attacker can gain administrative access and manipulate user accounts

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (remote) with low attack complexity. Specifically, the lack of authorization allows for unauthenticated access to critical functions.
- For CVE-2022-1066 the specific attack vector is the manipulation of user accounts

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable TUG Home Base Server. No prior authentication is required.
- For CVE-2022-1066, the attacker needs to be able to send unauthenticated requests to the server in order to manipulate user accounts.
