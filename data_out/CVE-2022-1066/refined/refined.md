The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1066.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing authorization allows an unauthenticated attacker to add new users with administrative privileges and delete or modify existing users.
- Unauthenticated access to hashed user credentials.
- Unauthenticated access to the TUG Home Base Server websocket to take control of TUG robots.
- Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in the Fleet Management Console.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial-of-service condition.
- Full control of robot functions.
- Exposure of sensitive information.
- Account manipulation (creation, deletion, modification of users).
- Arbitrary code execution through XSS vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote exploitation via network access.
- Exploitation does not require user interaction, or authenticated sessions.
- Web-based attacks through the Fleet Management Console.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the TUG Home Base Server.
- No authentication is required to exploit the missing authorization and websocket access vulnerabilities.
- For XSS, user interaction is required, specifically by a user of the Fleet Management Console to trigger the script in the browser.
