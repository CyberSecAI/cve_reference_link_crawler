# One-click remote code execution via malicious deep link

High

[sidequestlegend](/sidequestlegend)
published
GHSA-3v86-cf9q-x4x7
Jan 4, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< v0.10.35

## Patched versions

v0.10.35

## Description

### Impact

The SideQuest desktop application uses deep links with a custom protocol (sidequest://) to trigger actions in the application from its web contents. Because the deep link URLs were not sanitized properly in all cases, a one-click remote code execution can be achieved in cases when a device is connected, the user is presented with a malicious link and clicks it from within the application.

### Patches

As of version 0.10.35 the custom protocol links within the electron application are now being parsed and sanitized properly.

It is strongly recommended that users upgrade to the latest version of the SideQuest desktop application.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-21625

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
