Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling the `id` parameter in the `deleteExamExe.php` file.
- This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to:
  - Leakage of sensitive user data and system information.
  - Potential compromise of the system's security.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the `/adminpanel/admin/query/deleteExamExe.php` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint `/adminpanel/admin/query/deleteExamExe.php`.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `id` parameter in the request.
- No specific privilege is mentioned, but it's inferred that the targeted component is located within an "adminpanel", and an attacker would therefore need to access to this component of the application

**Technical Details:**
- The provided payload `id=1';SELECT+SLEEP(5)#` demonstrates a time-based SQL injection attack. It injects a SQL query to pause the database processing for 5 seconds.
