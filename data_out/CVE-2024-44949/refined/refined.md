    {
      "cve": "CVE-2024-44949",
      "details": "The vulnerability lies in the parisc architecture of the Linux kernel. The `ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN` was initially defined as 16 bytes, which is smaller than the cache line size. This can cause data corruption during DMA operations. If two unrelated 16-byte allocations share the same cache line, and one is written using DMA while the other is written using cached write, the data written using DMA can be corrupted.\n\nTo address this issue, the `ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN` has been modified to be 128 bytes on PA20 architectures and 32 bytes on PA1.1 architectures. These values represent the largest possible cache line sizes for the respective architectures. Additionally, the functions `arch_slab_minalign()`, `cache_line_size()`, and `dma_get_cache_alignment()` are defined to dynamically adjust the slab cache parameters based on the detected cache line size.\n\nThe root cause of the vulnerability is an incorrectly defined minimum alignment for DMA operations, which did not account for the possibility of cache line sharing among unrelated memory allocations.",
      "affected_component": "parisc architecture in the Linux kernel",
      "vulnerability": "Data corruption due to insufficient DMA alignment",
      "impact": "Data corruption can occur if two unrelated memory allocations, with sizes smaller than cache line size, share the same cache line, and one is written using DMA while the other is written using cached write. The value written using DMA may be corrupted.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered when using DMA operations in the parisc architecture where memory allocations may not be properly aligned according to cache line size.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to allocate memory and perform DMA operations within the parisc architecture."
