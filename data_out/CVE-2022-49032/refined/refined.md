{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The array sizes of `afe4404_channel_leds` and `afe4404_channel_offdacs` are smaller than the number of channels. Therefore, accessing these arrays with `chan->address` can lead to an out-of-bounds read.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "An out-of-bounds read can lead to a crash and possibly information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": "Reading the raw value of an intensity channel via the sysfs interface triggers the vulnerability.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to read a specific sysfs file, e.g., `/sys/bus/i2c/devices/0-0058/iio:device0/in_intensity6_raw`."
  },
  "resolution": "The fix moves the access to the `afe4404_channel_values`, `afe4404_channel_leds` and `afe4404_channel_offdacs` arrays before using them in the `afe4404_read_raw` and `afe4404_write_raw` functions."
