  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2017-3531",
    "description": "The web container subcomponent in Oracle WebLogic Server 12.1.3.0, 12.2.1.0, 12.2.1.1, and 12.2.1.2 allows remote attackers to create and delete files via a serialized PartItem object, related to the DiskFileItem vulnerability in Apache Commons FileUpload.",
    "technical_details": [
      {
        "detail": "The vulnerability is present in the PartItem class within WebLogic's com.oracle.weblogic.servlet.jar. This class is based on Apache's DiskFileItem code and uses a DeferredFileOutputStream.",
        "detail": "The issue stems from the ability of a remote unauthenticated attacker to create and delete files using serialized PartItem objects. While Oracle partially addressed the NULL byte vulnerability by adding a check in the readObject function, they did not fix the file creation/deletion issue.",
        "detail": "The PartItem class is serializable, but it contains a non-serializable member called Multipart. To serialize PartItem, reflection can be used to set Multipart to NULL before serialization. When deserialized, it writes a file to a specified path with attacker-defined content.",
         "detail": "A proof of concept (PoC) was developed that writes a file to C:\\Users\\Public\\ with the content \"Save the lobsters!\". The PoC exploits the vulnerability through the WebLogic t3 interface on TCP port 7001."
      }
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insecure deserialization of a PartItem object, which allows for arbitrary file creation/deletion. It is rooted in the usage of the vulnerable 'DiskFileItem' code, where the ability to create, copy, and delete files through serialized objects is not properly addressed.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Insecure deserialization",
      "Arbitrary file creation",
      "Arbitrary file deletion"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to create and delete files on the server, which can lead to arbitrary code execution and system compromise.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Network (over the t3 protocol)",
      "Deserialization of a crafted PartItem object"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a serialized PartItem object to the server via the t3 protocol. No authentication is required.",
     "patches": [
         "Oracle has released a patch for this issue in the April 2017 CPU."
