# [R1] Oracle WebLogic Server Web Container Subcomponent Reflected PartItem File Manipulation Remote Code Execution

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

On July 21 2016, ZDI and Oracle did a coordinated release of CVE-2016-3499 / [ZDI-16-444](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-16-444/). ZDI’s advisory indicates that the "*PartItem class in WebLogic FileUpload allows remote attackers to write arbitrary files via NULL byte ... when used in conjunction with a specific version of Oracle Java. It also allows the attacker to copy any file into a different location.*" For those familiar with the recent slue of Java deserialization attacks, this description sounds very similar to Apache Commons FileUpload’s `DiskFileItem` attacks CVE-2013-2186 (NULL byte attack) and CVE-2016-1000031 (creating, copying, and deleting files).

A quick analysis of WebLogic 12.2.1.1.’s `PartItem` (found in WebLogic’s `com.oracle.weblogic.servlet.jar`) revealed that is was obviously based on the Apache's `DiskFileItem` code. They are both loose wrappers around a `DeferredFileOutputStream` and the `readObject` / `writeObject` functions are identical. What is most interesting though, is that Oracle only partially fixed CVE-2016-3499. Oracle added a check to the `readObject` function to look for a NULL byte in the repository string (this code was copy and pasted from `DiskFileItem` in FileUpload 1.3.2). Incidentally, the NULL byte File attack has been "fixed" since Java 7 update 40 which was [released in September of 2013](http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8014846). Any occurrence of a NULL byte in a `File()` call causes an exception.

However, Oracle did not fix the ability for a remote unauthenticated attacker to create and delete files using serialized `PartItem`. This attack is fairly well known having both been [published by Tenable](https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2016-12) and [Ysoserial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/blob/master/src/main/java/ysoserial/payloads/FileUpload1.java). We verified this testing against WebLogic 12.2.1.1 with Java 8 update 102 installed.

Serializing a `PartItem`

It might not be obvious at first that `PartItem` is serializable at all. While `PartItem` is declared as "*public class PartItem implements Serializable, Part*" it contains a non-serializable class member called `Multipart`. If we simply try to serialize `PartItem` after constructing the Object then we will get a `NotSerializeableException` which may cause some researchers to give up. However, we can just use reflection to set `Multipart` to `NULL` right before we serialize the object. Here is the code used to create a serialized `PartItem` that, upon deserialization, will write a file to `C:\Users\Public\` with the contents "*Save the lobsters!*":

```

Multipart mp = new Multipart(request, "do", 80, 80, 999999);
PartItem test = new PartItem(mp, null, "not", "eat", false, "lobsters");
Reflections.setFieldValue(test, "repository", new File("C:\\Users\\Public\\"));
Reflections.setFieldValue(test, "sizeThreshold", 1024);
Reflections.setFieldValue(test, "cachedContent" , new String("Save the lobsters!").getBytes());

test.getOutputStream();
Reflections.setFieldValue(test, "sizeThreshold", 0);
Reflections.setFieldValue(test, "multipart", null);

FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("/tmp/t.tmp");
ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fos);
oos.writeObject(test);
oos.close();
fos.close();

```
Tenable produced a proof of concept for Oracle that, like the above, will write a file to `C:\Users\Public\` with the contents "*Save the lobsters!*". The PoC attacks through the WebLogic t3 interface on TCP port 7001 just like the [original Breen attack](https://foxglovesecurity.com/2015/11/06/what-do-weblogic-websphere-jboss-jenkins-opennms-and-your-application-have-in-common-this-vulnerability/).

### Solution

Oracle has released a patch for this issue in the [April 2017 CPU](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuapr2017-3236618.html). Customers can authenticate to the portal and [access it here](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2228898.1).
