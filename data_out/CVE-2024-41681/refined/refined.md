- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker in an on-path position can read and modify any data passed over the connection between legitimate clients and the affected device.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to be in an on-path position to intercept the communication between the client and the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated attacker in an on-path position.
