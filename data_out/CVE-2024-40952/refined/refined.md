```
Root cause of vulnerability:
A NULL pointer dereference occurs in the ocfs2_journal_dirty() function because the b_assoc_map is not initialized. This happens because a prior commit changed the usage from bdev->bd_super to b_assoc_map->host->i_sb, without ensuring b_assoc_map was always initialized.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
- NULL pointer dereference

Impact of exploitation:
- Kernel crash/Denial of Service

Attack vectors:
- Triggering a condition where metadata journaling fails due to insufficient credits, such as running xfstests generic/186. This will lead to the call of ocfs2_journal_dirty() function with uninitialized `b_assoc_map`

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to trigger conditions that lead to metadata journaling errors in OCFS2 filesystem. Specifically, simulating a scenario where there are no more journaling credits available when using the ocfs2 file system.
