Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6531:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Open Dental versions 16.1 and prior install with a blank (empty) root password for the MySQL database by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Default Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the use of a blank password for the MySQL database upon initial installation. This is a weak default configuration that can easily be exploited.
- **Lack of Forced Password Change:** Open Dental does not force users to set a password for the MySQL database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker with network access to the vulnerable MySQL database instance can:
    - Read sensitive data within the database.
    - Modify or alter existing data.
    - Delete data.
- The data includes medical dental records.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by anyone who has network access to the MySQL database.
- **Local Network Access:**  The provided content suggests that the attacker would most likely require local network access.
- **Port Forwarding:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerability remotely if the database is exposed directly to the internet through port forwarding, although this is not the default configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the MySQL database server.
- **Local Network:** The attacker would most likely need local network access (unless port forwarding is configured).
- **No Authentication Required (Initial):** Due to the blank default password, the attacker initially does not need to provide valid credentials to access the database.

**Additional Details:**

- Open Dental clarified that the credentials are not hard-coded, but rather a default blank password, which the user can change.
- The vendor also stated that simply setting a password does not prevent data access if an attacker obtains a copy of the database (since grant tables could be replaced), and database encryption is required for that protection.
- The vendor also emphasizes that exposing the database directly to the internet is not the intended use.
- The provided CVSS score for the base metric is 8.3, indicating high severity. The vector is AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, meaning adjacent network, low attack complexity, no authentication, with complete impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability.
