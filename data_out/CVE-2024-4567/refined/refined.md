**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into a page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
  - Stealing session cookies
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Defacing websites
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim
  - Injecting malware

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `themify_button` shortcode. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code via the `onclick` attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This allows them to create or edit content where shortcodes can be used.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Themify Shortcodes plugin versions up to and including 2.0.9.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.1.0 by removing the `onclick` attribute from the `themify_button` shortcode.
- The `onclick` attribute was not properly sanitized before output, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
