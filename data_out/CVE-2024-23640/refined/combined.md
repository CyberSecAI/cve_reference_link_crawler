GHSA-9rfr-pf2x-g4xf
Mar 19, 2024

## Package

maven

org.geoserver:gs-main
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<2.23.3

## Patched versions

2.23.3, 2.24.0

maven

org.geoserver:gs-ows
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

<2.23.3

2.23.3, 2.24.0

## Description

### Summary

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists that enables an authenticated administrator with workspace-level privileges to store a JavaScript payload in uploaded style/legend resources or in a specially crafted datastore file that will execute in the context of another user's browser when viewed in the Style Publisher. Access to the Style Publisher is available to all users although data security may limit users' ability to trigger the XSS.

### Details

*Give all details on the vulnerability. Pointing to the incriminated source code is very helpful for the maintainer.*

### PoC

*Complete instructions, including specific configuration details, to reproduce the vulnerability.*

### Impact

If an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim's browser, then they can typically fully compromise that user. Amongst other things, the attacker can:

1 .Perform any action within the application that the user can perform.

2. View any information that the user is able to view.

3. Modify any information that the user is able to modify.

4. Initiate interactions with other application users, including malicious attacks, that will appear to originate from the initial victim user.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

This PR sets the "Content-Disposition: attachment" response header to style resources with certain content types and also now uses the same default content type as the Resources REST API to mitigate a security issue. The Style Publisher also no longer allows access to the XML configuration files even though they don't currently contain any sensitive information.

Note that with this PR and [#7161](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/pull/7161), the Classpath/File/Style Publisher and Resources REST API will always return the same Content-Type for a particular resource.

There is no easy way to tell if an xml document in the styles directory is part of the catalogue configuration, or just an xml document. So checking for "xml" extension is a fair assumption.

Technically an SLD file is just an xml document, and it is would be okay to upload such a file as a style for use.

There really shouldn't be any .xml files in the style directories that isn't a valid StyleInfo file since every one is going to be an XStream stack trace in the logs on every GeoServer restart/reload.
