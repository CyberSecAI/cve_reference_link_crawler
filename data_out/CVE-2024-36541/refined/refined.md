{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure permissions in logging-operator v4.6.0 and earlier versions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect Access Control allows attackers to access sensitive data.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can access sensitive data, escalate privileges by obtaining the service account's token, and potentially take over the entire Kubernetes cluster. This includes compromising Secrets components.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "An attacker steals the service account token from a pod. This can be done by forcing a logging-operator pod to run on a node under the attacker's control.",
     "The stolen token is used to authenticate with the API server.",
     "The attacker leverages the obtained privileges to access all Secrets in the cluster.",
      "The sensitive information in the Secrets are used to elevate privileges and explore other sensitive resources, potentially taking over the entire cluster."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control a worker node. In the given example, this is achieved by leveraging a vulnerability in the hwameistor project which has permissions to patch/update nodes, which can be used to force the logging-operator pod to run on the malicious node."
