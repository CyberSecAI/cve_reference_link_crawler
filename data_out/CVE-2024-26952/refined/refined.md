```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The ksmbd server did not properly validate the buffer offset fields in several SMB2 requests, which could lead to out-of-bounds access when reading or writing data within the request buffers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Out-of-bounds write",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially cause a denial-of-service, information disclosure, or potentially arbitrary code execution by sending crafted SMB2 requests with invalid buffer offsets.",
    "attack_vectors": "Sending maliciously crafted SMB2 protocol requests to the ksmbd server.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send SMB2 protocol requests to a vulnerable ksmbd server. No special privileges on the server are required to trigger the vulnerability."
  },
  "resolution": "The vulnerability was resolved by setting the minimum value of the buffer offset to the actual offset of the data buffer in the request structure. This change ensures that the server does not attempt to access data before the buffer itself, preventing out-of-bounds accesses."
