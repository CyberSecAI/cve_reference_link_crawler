The provided content is related to CVE-2020-19319.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `getauthcode` function of D-Link DIR-619L router firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The `sprintf` function is used to copy the "filecode" parameter into a local stack buffer without performing any bounds checking. This lack of bounds checking allows an attacker to provide an overly long filecode parameter causing a stack buffer overflow, and overwriting the return address.

**Impact of exploitation:**
By overflowing the stack, the attacker can overwrite the return address and achieve arbitrary code execution on the router.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/formLogin` endpoint. The attacker provides a long string value for the 'FILECODE' parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface, typically requiring network access to the device.
