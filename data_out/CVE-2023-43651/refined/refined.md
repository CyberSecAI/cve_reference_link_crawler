- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the way MongoDB sessions are handled within the Koko web CLI interface. An authenticated user can exploit this to execute arbitrary commands. Specifically, the `child_process` module is being used to execute system commands via the mongo shell.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the host system through a MongoDB session by utilizing javascript functionality. This bypasses the expected behavior of the mongo shell and is a result of using `child_process` module with `execSync`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the host system, potentially allowing an attacker to gain root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, and an authenticated user of the Koko web CLI is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Koko system. They can then use the web CLI interface to access the MongoDB database and perform the malicious operations.
