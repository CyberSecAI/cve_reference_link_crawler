- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Product Table by WBW plugin, in versions 1.8.6 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could force a higher privileged user to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker leverages CSRF, tricking an authenticated user into making requests that execute actions within the vulnerable plugin without the user's awareness or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in, higher-privileged user to perform an action, often by tricking the user into visiting a malicious site or clicking a specially crafted link. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
