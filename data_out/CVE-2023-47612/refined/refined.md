- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by insufficient access controls, which allows external parties to access files and directories on the target system. Specifically, a CWE-552 vulnerability is present in the affected Telit Cinterion modules.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is a CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties, allowing read/write access to any files and directories.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to obtain read/write access to any files and directories on the target system, including hidden ones. This could lead to data exfiltration, modification of critical files, and potentially complete control over the device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector requires physical access to the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs physical access to the targeted Telit Cinterion modules.
