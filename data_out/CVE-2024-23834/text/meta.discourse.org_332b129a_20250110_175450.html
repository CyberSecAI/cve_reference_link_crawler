## New features in 3.2.0.beta5

This is the 5th beta release, coinciding with the 3.2 major version release! Read on for the highlights and a full change log.

### You can now add groups to DMs

We’ve made it easier to start a chat conversation with just the people you want. You can now select one or more groups when creating new DMs or when inviting people to an existing DM. All members of the group with chat enabled are added to the DM, and there is no difference between adding a group or adding its members individually. [Learn more](https://meta.discourse.org/t/start-a-group-chat-with-a-discourse-group/292635)

### Mobile chat footer redesign

We improved the chat mobile interface with cleaner navigation between channels, threads, and DMs, as well as from within a thread to the main channel and from chat to the forum itself.

### Enable passkeys by default

Passkeys authentication is a quick, safe and convenient alternative to traditional passwords, and it is now supported in Discourse. To use it, site members register a passkey in their User Preferences > Security screen. Once that’s done, they can use their passkey to log in (and their browser will automatically suggest the passkey as a way to log in). [Learn more](https://meta.discourse.org/t/passwordless-login-using-passkeys/285589)

## Security Updates

This release includes fixes for this security issue reported by our community and [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/discourse).

* Improperly sanitized user input leads to XSS [(CVE-2024-23834)](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-rj3g-8q6p-63pc)
