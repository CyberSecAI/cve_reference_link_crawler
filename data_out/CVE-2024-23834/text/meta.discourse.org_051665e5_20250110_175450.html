## Discourse 3.1.5 Stable Release

Discourse strongly recommends that all sites follow the default tests-passed branch of Discourse. The “stable” branch is more focused on *lack of change* than *lack of bugs* - all releases, including those on tests-passed and beta are production ready.

## Security Updates

This release includes fixes for this security issue reported by our community and [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/discourse).

* Improperly sanitized user input leads to XSS [(CVE-2024-23834)](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-rj3g-8q6p-63pc)
