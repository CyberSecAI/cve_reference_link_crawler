- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Smart Online Order for Clover plugin <= 1.5.5 lacks sufficient protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin is vulnerable to CSRF, which means it doesn't properly validate the origin of requests, allowing attackers to potentially force authenticated users to perform actions without their consent.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users (e.g. admin) to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. Specific impacts will vary depending on the plugin's functionality and actions that can be triggered, but it could involve modifying settings, creating new entries, or deleting data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a malicious website or email that crafts a request to the vulnerable website, tricking a logged-in user's browser into making the request without the user's knowledge or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but they need to trick a logged-in user into visiting the attacker's malicious page or clicking a malicious link.
