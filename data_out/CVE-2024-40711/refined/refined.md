Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-40711:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a combination of two vulnerabilities:
   1.  **Insecure Deserialization:** A missing entry (`System.Runtime.Remoting.ObjRef`) in the blacklist of allowed .NET types during deserialization in `Veeam.Backup.Core.CProxyBinaryFormatter`. This allows an attacker to leverage the `ObjRef` gadget to achieve remote code execution (RCE) by deserializing a crafted object.
   2.  **Improper Authorization:** In versions prior to `12.1.2.172`, the `.NET remoting` interface did not properly validate user identity. Specifically, the `IsConnectingIdentityAuthorized` method in `Veeam.Common.Remoting.CConnectionInterceptor` always returned "true," effectively allowing unauthenticated access to the service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Deserialization Vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the use of `BinaryFormatter` with a blacklist, missing `ObjRef` gadget, making it susceptible to deserialization attacks. The `CProxyBinaryFormatter` class has a `Deserialize` method that uses the blacklist mode of `RestrictedSerializationBinder` which was vulnerable to the `ObjRef` gadget.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The authorization check in earlier versions of `Veeam.Common.Remoting` did not properly authenticate connections, allowing for unauthenticated access. This allowed attackers to connect to the .NET remoting channel even without proper credentials due to the incorrect logic implemented in the `IsConnectingIdentityAuthorized` method of the `CConnectionInterceptor` class.
*   **Bridge Gadget:** The vulnerability uses a bridge gadget, a serialized `CDbCryptoKeyInfo` object. During deserialization, this object will call the vulnerable `CProxyBinaryFormatter.Deserialize` method, using a *blacklist* binder, allowing the deserialization of the ObjRef gadget to achieve RCE.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target system with the privileges of the Veeam service account (NT Authority/System).
*   **System Takeover:** By achieving RCE, an attacker can effectively take over the affected system and gain full control over it.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is performed over the network by sending crafted .NET Remoting messages to vulnerable Veeam services.
*   **Unauthenticated (in versions prior to 12.1.2.172):** The improper authorization vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to send malicious payloads.
*   **Authenticated (in versions 12.1.2.172):** With the silent patch of the authorization bypass, exploitation of version 12.1.2.172 and newer would require low-privileged authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable Veeam Backup & Replication server.
*   **Unauthenticated Access (versions prior to 12.1.2.172):** In older versions, no authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Low-Privilege Authentication (version 12.1.2.172):** In version 12.1.2.172, authentication with a valid low-privilege Veeam account is required to achieve RCE.
*   **Exploitation Knowledge:** The attacker requires the knowledge to craft malicious .NET Remoting payloads leveraging the `ObjRef` gadget and `CDbCryptoKeyInfo` bridge gadget.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Florian Hauser of Code White Gmbh.
*   Veeam fixed the issue in version `12.2.0.334`.
*   Veeam initially patched the authentication bypass component in version `12.1.2.172`, which reduced the severity from unauthenticated RCE to authenticated RCE, before patching the deserialization component in version `12.2.0.334`. This was done silently without public announcement of the authorization bypass.
*   The vulnerability exploits the `BinaryFormatter` deserialization gadget `ObjRef` using `CProxyBinaryFormatter.Deserialize`, which was set with the *blacklist* mode.
*   Veeam used a custom binder named `RestrictedSerializationBinder` for restricting types that can be deserialized.
*  The advisory also indicates that `CVE-2024-40711` was a critical vulnerability with a CVSS score of 9.8. However, the blog post states the CVSS score should be 10 as the bug was unauthenticated before `12.1.2.172`.
