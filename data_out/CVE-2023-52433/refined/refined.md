{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the netfilter's nft_set_rbtree implementation in the Linux kernel. Specifically, new elements added within a transaction might expire before the transaction is complete. The synchronous garbage collection (GC) process might then try to access already released objects, leading to a use-after-free condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free vulnerability due to incorrect handling of garbage collection of newly added elements within a transaction.",
       "Race condition that can lead to accessing deallocated memory."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered through the netfilter subsystem, specifically when using nftables to manage sets with rbtree backend.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to configure nftables rules and sets, which typically requires administrative privileges. However, specific scenarios may involve less privileged access via other services or applications using netfilter."
