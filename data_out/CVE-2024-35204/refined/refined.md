- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Veritas System Recovery service logs information to a file (`C:\ProgramData\Veritas\VERITAS SYSTEM RECOVERY\LOGS\Veritas System Recovery.log.txt`) without exclusively opening it or protecting it. The log directory is modifiable by low-privileged users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Arbitrary file creation: Low-privileged users can modify the log directory into a directory junction and symbolic link, enabling them to create files in arbitrary locations.
    - Least Privilege Violation: The logging process runs with NT Authority\System privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Creation of arbitrary files in protected directories (e.g., C:\Windows, C:\windows\system32, C:\Program Files).
    - Denial of service.
    - Tampering with important services (e.g., the backup service).
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Local Access: An attacker needs to have low-privileged Windows system user access.
    - File system manipulation: Exploiting the modifiable log directory using directory junction and symbolic links.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Low-privileged Windows system user access.
    - Ability to create directory junctions and symbolic links.
