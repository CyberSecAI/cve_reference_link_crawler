- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "Add Custom CSS and JS" lacks CSRF checks in certain areas and fails to sanitize and escape user input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), lack of CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings. When a user views these settings, the injected JavaScript will execute, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions with the user's privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out via a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with author privileges or higher into opening a malicious HTML page. This page will then silently submit a form to the vulnerable plugin's settings page, injecting the malicious code.
