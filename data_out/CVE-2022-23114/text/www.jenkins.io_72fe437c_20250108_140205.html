### Access key stored in plain text by Metrics Plugin

**SECURITY-1624
/
CVE-2022-20621**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`metrics`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/metrics)**

**Description:**

Metrics Plugin 4.0.2.8 and earlier stores access keys unencrypted in its global configuration file `jenkins.metrics.api.MetricsAccessKey.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

This access key can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Metrics Plugin 4.0.2.8.1 stores access key encrypted once its configuration is saved again.

Additionally, the token value is only displayed once when it is generated.

### User passwords transmitted in plain text by Active Directory Plugin

**SECURITY-1389
/
CVE-2022-23105**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`active-directory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/active-directory)**

**Description:**

Active Directory Plugin implements two separate modes: integration with ADSI on Windows, and an OS agnostic LDAP-based mode.

Active Directory Plugin 2.25 and earlier does not encrypt the transmission of data between the Jenkins controller and Active Directory servers unless it is configured to use the OS agnostic LDAP mode and the system property `hudson.plugins.active_directory.ActiveDirectorySecurityRealm.forceLdaps` is set to `true`.

This allows attackers able to capture network traffic between the Jenkins controller and Active Directory servers to obtain credentials of users logging into Jenkins, as well as credentials of the manager DN (LDAP mode) or the Windows/Active Directory user Jenkins is running as (ADSI mode).

Active Directory Plugin 2.25.1 adds an option to only connect to Active Directory via TLS/SSL to both modes (ADSI and LDAP).
This option is enabled by default for new installations and is now the recommended way to enforce TLS/SSL for connections to Active Directory.
Unlike the existing StartTLS option for the LDAP-based mode, it will not proceed using an insecure connection if establishing a TLS/SSL connection fails.

Administrators upgrading from previous versions of the plugin will be shown a warning on the Jenkins UI requesting they update the plugin configuration unless the (now otherwise obsolete) flag `hudson.plugins.active_directory.ActiveDirectorySecurityRealm.forceLdaps` was set to `true`.

|  | The plugin exposes configuration of the ADSI flags implementing the TLS/SSL requirement via the system properties `hudson.plugins.active_directory.ActiveDirectoryAuthenticationProvider.ADSI_FLAGS_OVERRIDE` and `hudson.plugins.active_directory.ActiveDirectoryAuthenticationProvider.ADSI_PASSWORDLESS_FLAGS_OVERRIDE`. See the plugin documentation for further details. |
| --- | --- |

|  | Care needs to be taken when reconfiguring the security realm to not accidentally lock yourself out. See [the documentation](/doc/book/security/access-control/disable/) for advice how to resolve this problem if it occurs. |

### Non-constant time token comparison in Configuration as Code Plugin

**SECURITY-2141
/
CVE-2022-23106**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`configuration-as-code`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code)**

**Description:**

Configuration as Code Plugin 1.55 and earlier does not use a constant-time comparison when checking whether two authentication tokens are equal.

This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain a valid authentication token.

Configuration as Code Plugin 1.55.1 now uses a constant-time comparison when validating authentication tokens.

### Path traversal vulnerability in Warnings Plugin

**SECURITY-2090
/
CVE-2022-23107**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`warnings-ng`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng)**

**Description:**

Warnings Plugin 9.10.2 and earlier does not restrict the name of a file when configuring a custom ID.

This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to write and read specific files with a hard-coded suffix on the Jenkins controller file system.

Warnings Plugin 9.10.3 checks for the presence of prohibited directory separator characters in the custom ID.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Badge Plugin

**SECURITY-2547
/
CVE-2022-23108**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`badge`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/badge)**

**Description:**

Badge Plugin allows adding custom build badges with a custom description and optionally a link to a URL.

Badge Plugin 1.9 and earlier does not escape the description and does not check for allowed protocols when creating a badge.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

Badge Plugin 1.9.1 escapes the description and check for allowed protocols when creating a badge.

### Improper credentials masking in HashiCorp Vault Plugin

**SECURITY-2213
/
CVE-2022-23109**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`hashicorp-vault-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/hashicorp-vault-plugin)**

**Description:**

Pipelines display commands executed in their Pipeline step descriptions and their output in build logs.
To mask sensitive output, [Pipeline: Groovy Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-cps) 2.84 and earlier specified an allowlist of known non-sensitive variables and masked everything else.
This caused problems, so Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2.85 and newer expects pipeline steps to explicitly specify that variables are to be treated as sensitive and should be removed from output.

HashiCorp Vault Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier relied on the previous behavior and did not explicitly declare variables as sensitive or redacted them.

This can result in exposure of Vault credentials in Pipeline build logs and Pipeline step descriptions.

HashiCorp Vault Plugin 3.8.0 explicitly masks Vault credentials in build logs and Pipeline step descriptions.

This fix only applies to new builds.
Administrators are advised to review build logs and Pipeline metadata files created before HashiCorp Vault Plugin 3.8.0 for the presence of Vault credentials.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Publish Over SSH Plugin

**SECURITY-2287
/
CVE-2022-23110**

**Severity (CVSS):**
