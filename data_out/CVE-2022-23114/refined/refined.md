Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23114:

**CVE-2022-23114**

*   **Root Cause:** The Publish Over SSH Plugin stores passwords unencrypted in its global configuration file (`jenkins.plugins.publish_over_ssh.BapSshPublisherPlugin.xml`) on the Jenkins controller.
*   **Weakness:**  The plugin stores passwords in plain text instead of using encryption or a secure credential storage mechanism.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker who gains access to the Jenkins controller's file system can read the configuration file and obtain the plain text passwords.
*  **Attack Vector:** The attack requires the attacker to have access to the Jenkins controller's file system.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have the ability to read files on the Jenkins controller. This could be achieved through a compromised account, access to the underlying server, or other means that allows file system access.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects Publish Over SSH Plugin versions 1.22 and earlier.
*   As of the publication of this advisory, there is no fix available for this vulnerability.
