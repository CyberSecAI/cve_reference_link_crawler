- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A relative path traversal vulnerability exists due to insufficient restrictions on file uploads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of relative paths in file upload functionality, leading to path traversal (CWE-23).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute unauthorized code or commands on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests containing malicious file uploads with manipulated relative paths.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs low privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
