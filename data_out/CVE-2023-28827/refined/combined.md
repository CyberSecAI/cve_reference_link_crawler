WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* Disable the web server of the affected system

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC CP 1242 and CP 1243 related processors connect SIMATIC S7-1200 controllers to Wide Area Networks (WAN). They provide integrated security functions such as firewall, Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and support of other protocols with data encryption.

SIMATIC HMI Panels are used for operator control and monitoring of machines and plants.

SIMATIC IPC DiagBase diagnostics software allows to recognize early on any potential faults on SIMATIC IPCs and helps to avoid or reduce system downtimes.

SIMATIC IPC DiagMonitor monitors, reports, visualizes and logs the system states of the SIMATIC IPCs. It communicates with other systems and reacts when events occur.

Communication processor (CP) modules SIMATIC TIM 3V-IE and TIM 4R-IE have been designed to enable SIMATIC S7-300/S7-400 CPUs for Ethernet or Telecontrol communication.

SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Advanced is a visualization runtime platform used for operator control and monitoring of machines and plants.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the same firmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-28827

The web server of the affected devices do not properly handle certain requests, causing a timeout in the watchdog, which could lead to the clean up of pointers.

This could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition in the system.

| CWE | CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference |

Vulnerability CVE-2023-30755

The web server of the affected devices do not properly handle the shutdown or reboot request, which could lead to the clean up of certain resources.

This could allow a remote attacker with elevated privileges to cause a denial of service condition in the system.

| CWE | CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference |

Vulnerability CVE-2023-30756

The web server of the affected devices do not properly handle certain errors when using the Expect HTTP request header, resulting in NULL dereference.

This could allow a remote attacker with no privileges to cause a denial of service condition in the system.
