Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Missing Authorization

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10003

**Root Cause:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks in multiple AJAX functions, allowing lower-privileged users to perform administrative actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing capability checks within multiple AJAX functions in `admin/rover-panel-setup.php` .
- Inadequate role verification.
- Subscriber level users and above are able to perform plugin options modifications that should be limited to administrator level users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to plugin settings.
- Modification of plugin behavior.
- Potential for data loss or manipulation.
- Possible complete compromise of the website depending on the changes made by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs through the WordPress AJAX interface.
- Sending crafted AJAX requests to the vulnerable functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs to have an account on the affected WordPress site.
- Subscriber-level access or above is sufficient for the exploit.
- No need for a sophisticated attack, just direct HTTP requests

**Technical Details from the Patches:**
- The fix involves adding capability checks like  `current_user_can('manage_options')` or `current_user_can('edit_posts')` at the beginning of the vulnerable AJAX callbacks in  `admin/rover-panel-setup.php`, `admin/rover-panel-migrate-ds.php`, `admin/rover-panel-seo.php`,  `admin/rover-panel-social.php`, `admin/rover-panel-styling.php`
- Specifically functions `rover_idx_save_setup_callback`, `rover_idx_save_slug_excludes_callback`,  `rover_idx_save_style_settings_callback`, `rover_idx_reset_callback`, `rover_idx_quick_start_create_callback`, `rover_idx_quick_start_info_callback`, `rover_idx_quick_start_reset_callback`, `rover_idx_refresh_js_ver_callback`, `rover_idx_show_settings_callback` in  `admin/rover-panel-setup.php`, were all found to be vulnerable.
- Also patched were functions `rover_idx_migrate_ds_callback`, `rover_idx_dismiss_ds_callback`, `rover_idx_theme_callback`,`rover_idx_fetch_theme_settings_callback`, `rover_idx_import_wp_theme_callback` in files `admin/rover-panel-migrate-ds.php`, `admin/rover-panel-styling.php` respectively
- The `rover_idx_social_callback` function was also patched in `admin/rover-panel-social.php`
- Finally the functions `rover_idx_save_seo_settings`, `rover_idx_refresh_sitemap_callback`, `rover_idx_fetch_sitemap_history_callback`, `rover_idx_add_dynamic_city_callback`, `rover_idx_add_dynamic_subdivision_callback` functions were patched in `admin/rover-panel-seo.php`

The provided content indicates that the vulnerability exists because the plugin does not properly verify user permissions before performing actions, making it exploitable by users with lower privileges. The fix in version 3.0.0.2905 addresses these issues by adding capability checks to the relevant AJAX callback functions.
