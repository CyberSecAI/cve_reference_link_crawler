Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** A sensitive data disclosure vulnerability exists in SolarWinds Kiwi CatTools when a non-default setting, used for troubleshooting purposes, is enabled.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**  The vulnerability is a sensitive information disclosure, meaning that the system exposes data that should be protected. The specific nature of the sensitive information is not detailed in this advisory.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to the disclosure of sensitive information. The impact is rated as "Medium" severity. The specific impact will depend on the kind of sensitive information disclosed.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is "Local" (AV:L), suggesting that the attacker needs local access to the system where Kiwi CatTools is installed.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges (PR:H) on the local system and user interaction (UI:R) is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to enable a specific non-default setting to be able to exploit this.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** SolarWinds Kiwi CatTools version 3.12 and earlier.
*   **Fixed Version:** Kiwi CatTools 3.12.4
*   **CVSS Score:**  CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L, which translates to:
    *   **AV:L** - Local attack vector
    *   **AC:H** - High attack complexity
    *  **PR:H** - High privileges required
    *   **UI:R** - User interaction required
    *   **S:U** - Unchanged scope
    *   **C:H** - High impact on confidentiality
    *   **I:L** - Low impact on integrity
    *   **A:L** - Low impact on availability
