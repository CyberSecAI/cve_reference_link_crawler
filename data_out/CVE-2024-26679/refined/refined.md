{
  "CVE-2024-26679": {
    "root_cause": "The `inet_recv_error()` function in the Linux kernel is called without holding the socket lock. An IPv6 socket could mutate to IPv4 using the `IPV6_ADDRFORM` socket option, which can trigger a Kernel Concurrency Sanitizer (KCSAN) warning due to race conditions when accessing `sk->sk_family`.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Race condition when accessing `sk->sk_family` in `inet_recv_error()` without holding the socket lock.",
      "Potential mutation of IPv6 socket to IPv4 through `IPV6_ADDRFORM` socket option during concurrent access."
    ],
    "impact": "KCSAN warning due to race condition. Potentially leading to system instability or crashes if not handled properly.",
    "attack_vectors": "Concurrent access to the socket by multiple threads or processes where one might attempt to modify the socket's address family using the `IPV6_ADDRFORM` option while another thread calls `inet_recv_error`.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have the ability to manipulate socket options (specifically `IPV6_ADDRFORM`) and concurrently trigger the `inet_recv_error` function on the same socket. Requires local access to the affected system."
