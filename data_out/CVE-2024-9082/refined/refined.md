Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks in the `Users.php` file, specifically when handling the `save` function. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended access controls and create user accounts with arbitrary roles (e.g., administrator).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure User Creation:** The application doesn't properly validate or restrict the `type` parameter during user creation, leading to arbitrary user role assignment.
*   **Missing Authorization:** There's an absence of access controls or authentication checks that should prevent unauthorized users from adding new users, especially with administrative privileges.
*   **Direct Access to Backend Functionality**: The `Users.php` file with the `save` function seems directly accessible and manipulatable without proper security measures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers can create administrator accounts, granting them full control over the application.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** With admin access, attackers can potentially steal, modify, or delete sensitive data stored within the application.
*   **System Compromise:** Complete compromise of the online shop functionality.
*   **Business Disruption:**  The attack can lead to a complete outage of the service and damage the reputation of the affected shop.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request Manipulation:** The attacker sends a modified HTTP POST request directly to `/oews/classes/Users.php?f=save` with malicious values for user details and 'type' parameter, specifically setting it to '1' for an administrator role.
*   **Bypassing Front-End Controls:**  The vulnerability is exploited by directly interacting with the backend, bypassing any client-side controls that might have been intended to restrict user creation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker must have network access to the server running the application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable endpoint (`/oews/classes/Users.php?f=save`) and the structure of the HTTP request to send.
*   **Ability to Forge Requests:**  The attacker should be able to forge an HTTP POST request, including the required parameters to create a user with admin rights.
