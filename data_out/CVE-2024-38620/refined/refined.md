{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The removal of Bluetooth High Speed (BT_HS) support in the Linux kernel has made the HCI_AMP controller type obsolete.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The code still contained logic and structures related to HCI_AMP controllers despite them no longer being necessary."
    ],
    "impact": "This vulnerability does not introduce any direct exploit but rather it involves the presence of redundant code and structures. This could potentially introduce inefficiencies and confusion in the Bluetooth subsystem.",
     "attack_vectors": "There is no direct attack vector associated with this vulnerability.",
    "required_capabilities": "No attacker capabilities are required as this is not an exploitable vulnerability."
  },
    "resolution": "The fix removes all code and data structures related to HCI_AMP controllers, simplifying the Bluetooth subsystem.",
