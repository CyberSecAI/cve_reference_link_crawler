Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control and improper handling of translations in multilingual wikis within the XWiki platform. Specifically, users with edit rights on translation documents could modify translations, even if they lacked the required 'script' or 'admin' rights usually needed for authoring translations. This bypasses the intended security model and can be exploited if the translation content is not properly sanitized where it is used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The system failed to properly verify the author's rights when editing translations in non-default locales, allowing users with only edit rights to modify them.
*   **Unescaped Translations:** The translation values were not properly escaped before being used, leading to the ability to inject malicious code.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A user with edit rights could escalate their privileges by injecting code into a translation, thereby executing arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious code (e.g., Groovy scripts) into translations, an attacker could achieve remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely, as the attacker interacts with the web application.
*   **Edit Rights:** The attacker needs edit rights on a document containing translations within a multilingual wiki.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs a valid user account with the ability to edit documents on a multilingual XWiki instance.
*   No special permissions like script or admin rights are initially required.
*   The attacker can be a low-privileged user.
