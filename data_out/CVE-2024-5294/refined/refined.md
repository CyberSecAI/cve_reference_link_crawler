- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper memory management when processing HTTP cookie values in the `prog.cgi` program.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leak vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial-of-service condition on the affected D-Link DIR-3040 router.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-adjacent attackers can send malicious HTTP cookie values to the `prog.cgi` program via the lighttpd webserver on ports 80 and 443.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need to be network-adjacent to the vulnerable router and do not require authentication.
