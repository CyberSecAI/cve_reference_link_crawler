## Summary

EverShop web application in versions prior to 1.0.0-rc.8 is missing input validation in the function 'mkdirSync' in 'createFolder.js', leading to a Relative Path Traversal vulnerability that enables arbitrary folder creation. From the feature for adding an image to a Product's "Description" field, attackers can create a new folder in unintended locations by navigating backward with "../", potentially affecting system processes.

## CWE-22 - Path Traversal

Path traversal (or directory traversal), is a vulnerability that allows malicious users to traverse the server's root directory, gaining access to arbitrary files and folders such as application code & data, back-end credentials, and sensitive operating system files. In the worst-case scenario, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary files on the server, resulting in a denial of service attack. Such an exploit may severely impact the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of an application.
