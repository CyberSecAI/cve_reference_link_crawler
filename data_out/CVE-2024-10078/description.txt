The WP Easy Post Types plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access, modification, and loss of data due to a missing capability check on multiple functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to add, modify, or delete plugin options and posts.
