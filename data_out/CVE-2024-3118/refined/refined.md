- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from excessive permissions granted to common users in Dreamer CMS 4.1.3. These users, who should not have administrative privileges, are able to delete attachments, forms, and variables.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core vulnerability is an improper authorization check leading to privilege escalation. Common users possess capabilities that are meant to be reserved for administrators.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker leveraging this vulnerability can delete important system files through a regular user account, potentially leading to data loss, service disruption, or further compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web interface, utilizing a regular user account, and exploiting the flawed permission system in the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a valid user account with standard user access to the Dreamer CMS application.
