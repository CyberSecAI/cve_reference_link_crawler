Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-42132:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The "Test LDAP Users" functionality in Liferay Portal includes the LDAP credential in the page URL when paginating through the list of users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** LDAP credentials (usernames and passwords) are being exposed within the URL, which is not considered a secure location for transmitting this type of data.
- **Lack of proper credential handling:** The application does not securely handle LDAP credentials during the testing process, embedding them in URLs instead of using a secure method for transmission and storage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Disclosure:** Attackers who can intercept the HTTP requests (man-in-the-middle attacks), or those who have access to server request logs can obtain the LDAP credentials.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Exposed LDAP credentials can be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems or resources authenticated against the compromised LDAP server.
- **Lateral Movement:** Successful compromise of LDAP credentials might enable further lateral movement within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Attackers intercept network traffic and gain access to the vulnerable URLs containing the credentials.
- **Access to Request Logs:** Attackers who have access to server logs (e.g., web server logs, reverse proxy logs) can extract the credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **MitM Position:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept network traffic between the user's browser and the Liferay server to intercept the vulnerable requests.
- **Log Access:** The attacker must have access to the server's request logs to retrieve the exposed credentials.
- **Low Privilege Access:** The attacker does not need prior elevated privileges on the Liferay server to exploit this, as the vulnerability resides in how the application handles requests.

**Additional Details:**
- **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as High severity (8.0) according to CVSS:3.1.
- **Versions Affected:** Liferay Portal versions 7.0.0 to 7.4.3.4 are affected.
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is fixed in Liferay Portal 7.4.3.5. For affected versions that cannot be upgraded to 7.4.3.5, it is advised to assume the credentials have been leaked and to change the LDAP password immediately. Additionally, all deployments using LDAP should review their request logs.
- **HTTPS:** Using HTTPS would mitigate MitM attacks but the credentials would still be exposed in server request logs
