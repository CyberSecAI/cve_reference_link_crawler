- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the affected applications when parsing specially crafted CGM files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by enticing a user to open a malicious CGM file using the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious CGM file. The user has to open the malicious file with the vulnerable application. No special privileges are required.
