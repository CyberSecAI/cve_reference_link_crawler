SSA-794653: Multiple File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Teamcenter
Visualization and JT2Go

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

SUMMARY

Siemens Teamcenter Visualization and JT2Go are affected by multiple file parsing vulnerabilities that
could be triggered when the application reads malicious CGM files. If a user is tricked to open a malicious
CGM file with the affected products, this could lead the application to crash or potentially lead to arbitrary
code execution.

Siemens has released new versions for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Do not open untrusted CGM files in JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

JT2Go is a 3D JT viewing tool to allow users to view JT, PDF, Solid Edge, PLM XML with available JT,
VFZ, CGM, and TIF data.

Teamcenter Visualization software enables enterprises to enhance their product lifecycle management
(PLM) environment with a comprehensive family of visualization solutions. The software enables enter-
prise users to access documents, 2D drawings and 3D models in a single environment.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.first.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-51439

The affected applications contain an out of bounds read past the end of an allocated structure while
parsing specially crafted CGM files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the
current process.

CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read

Vulnerability CVE-2023-51744

The affected applications contain a null pointer dereference vulnerability while parsing specially crafted
CGM files. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to crash the application causing denial of
service condition.
