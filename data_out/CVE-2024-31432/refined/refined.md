- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, leading to a broken access control vulnerability. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher privileged users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control. Specifically, missing authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An unauthenticated attacker could potentially perform actions meant for higher-privileged users, however, the specific impact varies.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated user could exploit the missing access control check, likely via a direct request to a vulnerable endpoint within the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the WordPress site where the vulnerable plugin is installed. No prior authentication is required.
