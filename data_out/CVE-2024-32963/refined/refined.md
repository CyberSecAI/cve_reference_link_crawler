- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Parameter tampering in HTTP requests allows an attacker to manipulate the `ownerId` parameter when editing playlists, impersonating another user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly validate or authorize the `ownerId` parameter when updating a playlist. This allows an attacker to change the playlist owner to any other user's ID, leading to user impersonation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can impersonate another user by changing the owner of a playlist to the target user. This could lead to unauthorized actions or access to resources associated with the impersonated user. All users who have shared playlists are potentially impacted because their user ID may be disclosed.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack via HTTP requests, specifically by intercepting and modifying the PUT request for updating a playlist.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a valid user of the application, must obtain the target user's ID, and have the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
