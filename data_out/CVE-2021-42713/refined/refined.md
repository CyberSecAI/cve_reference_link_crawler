Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-42713:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the Splashtop Remote Personal Client for Windows handles repair operations using the Windows Installer framework. Specifically, an MSI file is cached in `c:\windows\installer`. When an unprivileged user triggers a repair operation, either through the Windows Installer API or by directly executing `msiexec.exe /fa c:\windows\installer\[XXXXX].msi`, it initiates file operations within the user's `%TEMP%` directory. Critically, some of these operations, including the execution of temporary files, are carried out with SYSTEM privileges via the Windows Installer service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The core issue is the creation of temporary files with insecure permissions within a user-controlled directory (%TEMP%) that are then executed with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Abuse of Windows Installer Service:** The vulnerability leverages the Windows Installer service to escalate privileges, as it executes temporary files with SYSTEM rights.
- **Lack of Input Validation or Sanitization:** The process does not seem to validate the origin or content of files written to the temp folder during the repair operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows an unprivileged local attacker to gain SYSTEM level privileges. This enables the attacker to perform any action on the system, including installing software, modifying system settings, and accessing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack is local, requiring an attacker to have a user account on the vulnerable Windows machine.
- **Repair Operation Trigger:** The attacker needs to initiate a repair operation for the Splashtop Remote Personal Client, which can be done through:
    - Using the Windows Installer API
    - Running `msiexec.exe /fa c:\windows\installer\[XXXXX].msi`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker must possess a valid local user account on the target Windows system.
- **Ability to Trigger Repair:** The attacker needs the ability to initiate a repair operation for the vulnerable software.
- **Basic knowledge of Windows Installer and command line:** While the exploit is described as trivial to produce, an attacker would need to know how to execute commands like `msiexec.exe`.

**Additional Information:**

- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.8, with a vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating high impact and exploitability.
- **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is resolved in version 3.4.8.4 of Splashtop Remote Personal Client for Windows.
