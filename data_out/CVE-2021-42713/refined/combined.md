# MNDT-2022-0006

Splashtop Remote Personal Client for Windows contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability prior to version 3.4.8.4

## Impact

High - Exploiting the vulnerability will give a local unprivileged attacker SYSTEM level privileges.

## Exploitability

Medium - Any authenticated local user can exploit the vulnerability and an exploit is trivial to produce.

## CVE Reference

CVE-2021-42713

## Common Weakness Enumeration

CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System

Base Score: 7.8 - Vector: AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

## Technical Details

The installation of the agent uses the Windows Installer framework and an MSI file is cached in c:\windows\installer. An unprivileged user can trigger a repair operation, either by using the Windows Installer API or by running "msiexec.exe /fa c:\windows\installer\[XXXXX].msi".

Running a repair operation will trigger a number of file operations in the %TEMP% folder of the user triggering the repair. Some of these operations will be performed from a SYSTEM context (started via the Windows Installer service), including the execution of temporary files.

## Resolution

The issue was fixed in version 3.4.8.4. Update to this version to address the vulnerability.

## Why Security Is Our Priority

Cybersecurity has become the biggest challenge faced by today’s IT professionals and MSPs. We take this seriously, which is why we’ve made security our top focus since day one. We work hard to ensure that our customers can trust our ability to protect their data and privacy.

That is why we invest millions every year to continually improve our infrastructure and security measures. We constantly scan our products to ensure their integrity, and we work with top-notch security firms to conduct audits regularly. We also formed our own [Security Advisory Council](/press/splashtop-announces-members-security-advisory-council) to help guide Splashtop in achieving our rigorous security and compliance goals.

Security is something that is never ‘done’; it’s a constant effort to keep up with ever-evolving threats. We owe it to our current and future customers to do everything in our power to make Splashtop’s remote access and remote support offerings as secure as they can be.
