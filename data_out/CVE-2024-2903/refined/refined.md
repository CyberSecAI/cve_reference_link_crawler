Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `GetParentControlInfo` function of the Tenda AC7 router firmware. Specifically, the function copies user-controlled input, provided via the `mac` parameter in a POST request, into a fixed-size buffer called `pc_info->mac_addr` using `strcpy`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `strcpy` function is used to copy the `mac` parameter into the `pc_info->mac_addr` buffer without proper bounds checking. If the user supplies a `mac` value larger than the buffer size, it leads to a buffer overflow on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution (likely):** A stack overflow can overwrite critical data on the stack, such as return addresses. By carefully crafting the overflow payload, an attacker can potentially hijack the control flow of the program and execute arbitrary code on the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a POST request to the `/goform/GetParentControlInfo` endpoint with the `mac` parameter set to a long string exceeding the buffer size.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable router or have network access to the router's web interface to send malicious HTTP requests.
- **Ability to send HTTP POST requests:** The attacker needs a tool capable of crafting and sending HTTP POST requests.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected firmware version is Tenda AC7V1.0 V15.03.06.44.
- The `mac` parameter is the vector of attack.
- The provided POC Python script shows how to trigger the overflow by sending a long string of "a"s as the value of the `m` parameter (which should be `mac`) in the POST request.
