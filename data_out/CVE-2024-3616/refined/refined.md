Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application directly inserts user-controlled input (specifically, `$admin_user`, `$admin_nama`, `$admin_alamat`, and `$admin_telepon` variables) into the `value` attribute of HTML input fields within the `pengguna.php` page without proper HTML entity encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Because the input is not sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the database through the vulnerable input fields. This malicious script will then be executed by the victim's browser when the page loads.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the web page
  - Redirection to malicious sites
  - Data theft
  - Other malicious activities, depending on the attacker's payload.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `pengguna.php` page, specifically when updating user information.
- An attacker can inject the XSS payload via the `admin_nama`, `admin_alamat`, or `admin_telepon` parameters during the editing of an administrator profile. The vulnerability is triggered when a user views the edited profile.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to make a POST request to the `/ci_wms/pengaturan/pengguna/edit/admin` endpoint. This suggests that the attacker needs to have authenticated access, likely as an administrator or a user with the capability to modify user information, to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious payload and insert it into the vulnerable input fields.

**Additional details:**
- The provided exploit shows how an attacker could insert a JavaScript payload `"><img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>` within the `admin_nama` field.
- The vulnerable code is located in `/ci_wms/application/views/admin/content/pengaturan/pengguna.php`.
- The vulnerable variables are `$admin_user`, `$admin_nama`, `$admin_alamat`, and `$admin_telepon`
