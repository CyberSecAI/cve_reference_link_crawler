- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unused and unstable HTTP service is exposed on port 80/tcp on the Modbus-TCP Ethernet interface of the affected devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The presence of an unused, unstable HTTP service. This falls under CWE-912: Hidden Functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker on the same Modbus network can create a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, forcing the device to reboot.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is network-based and can be exploited remotely via the Modbus-TCP Ethernet network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be on the same Modbus network as the affected device. No specific user privileges are needed.
