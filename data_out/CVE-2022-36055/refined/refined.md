The content is related to CVE-2022-36055.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a parser in the `strvals` package that converts strings into Go structures. Certain string inputs can lead to the creation of large array data structures, resulting in an out-of-memory panic.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled resource consumption due to the ability to create large array data structures in memory.
- Out-of-memory panic vulnerability in the `strvals` package, specifically during string parsing.
- The vulnerability allows a user to cause a denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) due to out-of-memory panic, which cannot be recovered from. Applications using the vulnerable `strvals` package and parsing user-supplied input are at risk of being crashed by an attacker.
- For the Helm client, this means that providing specific malicious input to commands such as `--set`, `--set-string` can cause the client to panic.
- While a panic in the Helm client is not persistent, it can cause interruptions and affect user workflow.

**Attack vectors:**
- User-supplied strings passed to functions in the `strvals` package.
- Specifically, the `--set`, `--set-string`, and other value-setting flags in the Helm client are vulnerable when processing user-provided input.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide input that will be parsed by the vulnerable `strvals` package, either directly or indirectly via a tool or system.
- For the Helm client, they must have the ability to execute commands and pass arguments such as `--set` and `--set-string`.

The provided content gives more details than the official CVE description by specifying the vulnerable package (`strvals`), the affected components (Helm client flags `--set`, `--set-string`), and the specific type of denial of service (out-of-memory panic). It also clarifies that while the Helm client panics, it is not a persistent issue, as Helm is not a long running service.
