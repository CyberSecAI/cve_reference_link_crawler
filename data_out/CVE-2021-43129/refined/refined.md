Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-43129

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from improper handling of URL parameters related to the "Disable Right Click" setting in D2L Brightspace's Quizzing component. The application relies on URL parameters (`&drc=1`) to enforce the "Disable Right Click" setting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere (CWE-668):** The application exposes the "Disable Right Click" setting to the user via a URL parameter, which allows a user to disable this intended restriction by simply modifying the URL.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the URL parameters. This allows users to remove the `&drc=1` parameter, effectively disabling the right-click restriction.
- **Reliance on Client-Side Enforcement:** The "Disable Right Click" feature appears to be primarily enforced on the client-side through Javascript, which is easily bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Circumvention of Restrictions:** A remote user (quiz taker) can bypass the "Disable Right Click" setting.
- **Data Exfiltration:** By disabling the restriction, the user can highlight text, copy and paste content, and potentially print the quiz content, facilitating data exfiltration and potentially cheating.
- **Privilege Escalation:** While not a traditional privilege escalation, the user gains unintended privileges by circumventing intended restrictions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Manipulation of URL:** The attacker (quiz taker) directly manipulates the URL in the browser's address bar.
- **GET Request Parameter Modification:**  The attacker removes specific parameters from the GET request made when loading the quiz.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Quiz Taker:** The attacker needs to be a user taking a quiz on the D2L Brightspace platform.
- **Basic Browser Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of how to modify the URL in their browser.
- **No special privileges:** The attacker does not need special privileges or access to the D2L system. The attack is executed via a standard web browser.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in D2L Brightspace's Learning Management System (LMS), specifically tested on version 20.21.7.
- D2L acknowledged the vulnerability and eventually retired the "Disable Right Click" feature in August 2022.
- The provided proof of concept (POC) details the process of removing `&ispriv=&drc=1` from the quiz URL to bypass the restriction.
- The github repository provides clear before/after screenshots of the exploit.
