# Learning Management System (LMS)

## What Is an LMS?

Imagine a Learning Management System (LMS) as your digital education headquarters. It’s a platform that helps deliver, manage and track all your educational courses and training programs. Acting as a central hub for both educators and learners, it makes creating, distributing and assessing educational content a breeze. Whether you’re in a classroom or a corporate setting, an LMS turns learning into an engaging, interactive experience.

![two professionals collaborating at a table with a laptop](data:image/svg+xml;base64...)

## LMS for Education and Training

### Built for Modern Learning

A well-designed LMS meets the evolving demands of modern education and training.

It simplifies content creation, facilitates seamless collaboration, and provides powerful analytics to track progress and outcomes.

By integrating multimedia resources, interactive tools and real-time communication, an LMS ensures an engaging and effective learning experience.

# [CVE-2021-43129](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43129)

## Vulnerability in D2L Brightspace’s Learning Management System(LMS)

### Vulnerability Type:

> [CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/668.html)

### Vendor of Product:

> Desire2Learn/D2L

### Affected Product Code Base:

> D2L Brightspace’s Learning Management System(LMS)
>
> > Tested version: 20.21.7

#### [D2L announced that the "Disable Right Click" setting will be retired in August 2022.](https://community.brightspace.com/s/article/retirement-notice-disable-right-click)

### Affected Component:

> Quizzing's "Disable Right Click" setting

### Attack Type:

> Remote

### Impact Escalation of Privileges:

> True

### Attack Vectors:

> The remote quiz taker can remove "&ispriv=&drc=1" from the quiz URL, reload, and have full privilege to highlight text, copy and paste via keyboard controls, and print the test data via keyboard controls.

# Methodology and Description

While taking quizzes with the setting "Disable right click" enabled, I found it can disabled by removing data from the GET request. The "Disable Right Click" setting is used to prevent users from having the privilege to highlight text, copy and paste via keyboard controls, and print the test data via keyboard controls. An exploit can remove the "Disable Right Click" setting completely for a remote user taking the quiz.

# Proof of Concept

After starting a quiz with the "Disable right click" setting enabled, the users search bar will contain this highlighted data.

The quizzes "Disable right click" setting acts as intended in its current state. When using CRTL+P results in this popup message.

If the quiz taker to remove "&ispriv=&drc=1" and reloads the page, the user now has the priviledge to highlight text, copy and paste via keyboard controls, and print the test data via keyboard controls.

The ou and qi elements GET request data were removed because they are personally identifying and does not effect the vulnerability. I disclosed this vulnerability privately and gave time to remediate in order to strengthen the integrity of the D2L's LMS application.

---

## Simplified POC

The request to load the quiz with the "Disable Right click" function enabled.

`https://domain.com/d2l/lms/quizzing/user/attempt/quiz_start_frame_auto.d2l?ou=123456&isprv=&drc=1&qi=123456&cfql=0&dnb=0&fromQB=0`

The request to load the quiz and disable the "Disable Right click" setting.

`https://domain.com/d2l/lms/quizzing/user/attempt/quiz_start_frame_auto.d2l?ou=123456&qi=123456&cfql=0&dnb=0&fromQB=0`
