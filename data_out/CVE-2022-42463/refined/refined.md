**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `Softbus_server` in the communication subsystem has an authentication bypass vulnerability within a callback handler function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Authentication bypass. The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of authentication within a callback handler function in the `Softbus_server` component.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can send Bluetooth rfcomm packets to any remote device on distributed networks, and execute arbitrary commands.
