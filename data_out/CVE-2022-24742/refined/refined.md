Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24742:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the browser's caching mechanism, specifically how it stores and retrieves previously visited pages. After a user logs out of the Sylius application, the browser may still have cached pages from the user's session. If the user (or someone else with access to the browser/computer) uses the browser's back button, these cached pages containing sensitive information could be displayed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate cache control: The application does not properly instruct the browser to avoid caching sensitive pages, particularly after a user has logged out. This allows the browser to store potentially sensitive information.
- Lack of proper redirect after logout: The application does not redirect to the login page immediately upon logout, leaving the cached user-specific pages accessible via the back button.
- Exposure of cached data: The vulnerability exposes cached data accessible through the browser back button.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive information disclosure: An attacker with access to the browser or computer could view sensitive data like customer details, payment gateway configurations, or other admin panel data. The data exposed is limited to the pages the user visited during their session.
- Data leak: The vulnerability can lead to a data leak if an attacker gains access to the cached information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Browser back button: The primary attack vector is the browser's back button.
- Physical access: This vulnerability requires an attacker to have physical or remote access to the computer/browser after a user has logged out and left the browser open.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to the user's computer/browser: The attacker needs access to the computer after the user has logged out but before the browser cache is cleared.
- Knowledge of the back button: The attacker must know how to use the back button in the browser.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content describes the fix for this vulnerability: implementing stricter cache policies using HTTP headers (`no-cache`, `max-age=0`, `must-revalidate`, `no-store`) on response objects, and adding a redirect to the login page after logout.
- The workaround code provided includes changes to `ShopUriBasedSectionResolver` and adding a new `ShopCustomerAccountSubSection`. This indicates that the vulnerability is present in the shop and admin sections of Sylius.
- The advisory mentions that no action can be performed, and a refresh will block further reads. This clarifies that the exposure is primarily for viewing cached content, not for performing actions.

The vulnerability is addressed in Sylius versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2.
