Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `usertype` parameter of the `submit_login.php` file within the Kashipara College Management System version 1.0 or earlier.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The system fails to sanitize user-provided input in the `usertype` parameter before rendering it in the application's response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Content Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, which is then executed within the victim's browser.
- **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal sensitive information, such as session cookies or user credentials, by capturing the information via the injected code.
- **Malware Distribution:** The injected code can redirect users to malicious websites or trigger the download of malware, potentially infecting their systems.
- **Defacement:** Attackers can alter the appearance or functionality of the web page.
- **Reputation Damage:** Successful exploitation can damage the reputation of the trusted website's owner.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET/POST Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious request to the `submit_login.php` endpoint, injecting malicious JavaScript code within the `usertype` parameter. Specifically, the provided payload is: `usertype=1'"()%26%25<zzz><ScRiPt%20>alert(9756)</ScRiPt>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know the `usertype` parameter in the `submit_login.php` file is susceptible to XSS.
