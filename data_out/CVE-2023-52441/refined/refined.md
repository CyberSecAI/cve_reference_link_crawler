Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2023-52441.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises because the `init_smb2_rsp_hdr` function is incorrectly called for SMB1 negotiate requests after an SMB2 negotiate request has already been processed. This occurs when the `need_neg` flag is set to false, but subsequent SMB1 packets are still processed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds access due to incorrect handling of SMB1 packets after an SMB2 negotiation.
- Improper state management regarding the `need_neg` flag.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially cause a crash or other unexpected behavior by sending a sequence of SMB2 and then SMB1 negotiate requests to trigger the out-of-bounds access.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted sequence of SMB2 and SMB1 negotiate requests to the ksmbd server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable ksmbd server.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of SMB protocol versions.
