# Users can import members from projects that they are not a maintainer on through API

## Report

##### Summary

Security patch 14.3.1 fixed ([link to patch notes](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/09/30/security-release-gitlab-14-3-1-released/#low-privileged-users-can-import-users-from-projects-that-they-they-are-not-a-maintainer-on) and [link to commit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/63ba9ad2a1067eb74df493e273707bb64a13a197 "Fix permissions check on project members import")) an issue where a maintainer in one project could import members from another project while not being a maintainer in that target project. This is now enforced in the GitLab UI and any requests putting the target project as a project where the user is not maintainer will fail.

This check is not enforced if the same user uses the API endpoint `/projects/:id/import_project_members/:project_id` [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#import-project-members). As long as the user have maintainer access to the project with id `:id` the users can import members from any target `:project_id` as long as it is visible for the user. That is all public projects and any private project where the user have a role `Guest` or higher.

##### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a two users `user1` and `user2`
2. Log in as `user1` and create a public project `project1` in the users namespace `user1`
3. Make a note of the project ID, we call it `ID1`
4. Log in as `user2` and create a private project `project2`
5. Make a note of the project ID, we call it `ID2`
6. Go to <https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens> and create an access token for `user2`, lets call it `TOKEN1`
7. Send this request in a terminal (replacing , and )
   ```
   curl --request POST --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <TOKEN1>" "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/<ID2>/import_project_members/<ID1>"
   ```
8. Go to <https://gitlab.com/user2/project2/-/project_members> and verify that `user1` is imported from the public project where `user2` is not a member

##### Impact

Importing members is supposed to be an action that is restricted to users who are maintainers on both target projects. The API allows users to bypass this restriction.

##### What is the current *bug* behavior?

The API endpoint does not validate the role of the requester as the UI does

##### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

The API should work as the functionality in the UI

##### Output of checks

This bug happens on GitLab.com

#### Impact

Importing members is supposed to be an action that is restricted to users who are maintainers on both target projects. The API allows users to bypass this restriction.
