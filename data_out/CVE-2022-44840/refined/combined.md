| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=29732#c0)  15664243668    2022-10-30 12:19:29 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 14421](attachment.cgi?id=14421 "readelf poc file") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=14421&action=edit "readelf poc file") readelf poc file  Hi  There is a heap buffer overflow bug in binutils-2.39 (commit 49c843e6).   The bug is triggered in find_section_in_set() at binutils/readelf.c:970 when parsing the debug sections of a malformed ELF file.  The bug is caused in the code stashing pool section entries.  With random nonsensical values in the index entries (rather than each index pointing to its own set distinct from other sets), it's possible to overflow the space allocated, losing the NULL terminator.  Without a terminator, find_section_in_set can run off the end of the shndx_pool buffer.  To reproduce this bug, use:  1. compile binutils-2.39 with clang-6.0 and address sanitizer: ```sh ./configure --disable-shared --disable-gdb --disable-werror make ```  2. use readelf to process the PoC file (see attachment): ```sh readelf -w ./PoC ```  The address sanitizer reports are as follows. ``` readelf: Error: Internal error: out of space in the shndx pool. readelf: Error: Internal error: out of space in the shndx pool. readelf: Error: Internal error: out of space in the shndx pool. readelf: Error: Internal error: out of space in the shndx pool. readelf: Error: Internal error: out of space in the shndx pool. readelf: Error: Internal error: out of space in the shndx pool.
