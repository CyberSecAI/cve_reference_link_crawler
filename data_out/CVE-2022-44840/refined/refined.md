- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap buffer overflow occurs in the `find_section_in_set()` function within `binutils/readelf.c` due to mishandling of section index entries. Specifically, when parsing debug sections of a malformed ELF file, random nonsensical values in the index entries can cause an overflow in the `shndx_pool` buffer, leading to a missing NULL terminator.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap buffer overflow, missing null terminator
- **Impact of exploitation:** The missing null terminator in `shndx_pool` causes `find_section_in_set` to read beyond the allocated memory, resulting in a heap buffer overflow. This can lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Maliciously crafted ELF files with corrupted debug sections.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to provide a malformed ELF file to the `readelf` utility.
