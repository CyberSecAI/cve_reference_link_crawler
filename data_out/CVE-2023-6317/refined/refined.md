{
  "CVE-2023-6317": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The account registration process in LG WebOS does not properly validate the association between a client key and user profile. Specifically, the `skipPrompt` variable is set to true if either `client-key` or `companion-client-key` parameters correspond to an existing profile, without verifying if the key belongs to the correct account.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authorization bypass. The vulnerability lies in the logic of the account registration where the PIN verification can be skipped.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can create a privileged user profile without user interaction, gaining access to a wider attack surface on the LG WebOS TV.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending specially crafted requests to the TV's service on ports 3000/3001 (HTTP/HTTPS/WSS), an attacker can manipulate the `client-key` and `companion-client-key` parameters to bypass the PIN verification.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device or able to reach the service exposed on the internet. They also require the ability to craft network requests to the webOS service."
