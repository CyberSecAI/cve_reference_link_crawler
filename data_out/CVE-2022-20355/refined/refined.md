{
  "CVE-2022-20355": {
    "Root cause": "The system does not properly validate the PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) URI before using it. Specifically, it does not check if the URL scheme is valid, leading to potential crashes when an invalid scheme is used.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Lack of URL scheme validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malformed URL could cause a system crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can provide a malformed PAC URI to the system.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to influence or provide the PAC URI that the system will process. This may be possible through network configurations or other means of providing a proxy configuration."
