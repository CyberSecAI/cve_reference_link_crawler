Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-26423:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to **Missing Authorization (CWE-862)** in the Aethon TUG Home Base Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   Specifically, the system does not properly restrict access to hashed user credentials.
-   An unauthenticated attacker can freely access these hashed user credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   Exposure of sensitive information (hashed user credentials)
-   The CVSS v3 base score of 8.2 indicates this is a high severity vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning it can be exploited remotely.
-   **Low Complexity:** The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
-   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required (UI:N).
-   **No Privileges Required:** No privileges are required for the attacker (PR:N)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be on the network and able to communicate with the TUG Home Base Server.
-   No prior authentication or privileges are needed to access the hashed user credentials.

**Summary**

The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to obtain hashed user credentials on the Aethon TUG Home Base Server, leading to potential sensitive information exposure. This is possible due to a lack of proper authorization checks.
