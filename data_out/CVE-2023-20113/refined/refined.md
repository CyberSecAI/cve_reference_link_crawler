- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protections for the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software when operating in cluster mode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  CSRF vulnerability (CWE-352)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. This includes modifying the system configuration and deleting accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the affected system's web-based management interface to click a malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to persuade a user of the vulnerable Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software's web-based management interface to click a malicious link. The attacker does not require prior authentication to the system. The affected system needs to be operating in cluster mode.
