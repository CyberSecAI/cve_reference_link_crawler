*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Google Map Shortcode plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin has an XSS vulnerability, which means it does not properly sanitize user input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, into the website. These scripts are executed when other users visit the site.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin, where unsanitized user input allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.

The content also notes that a virtual patch is available through Patchstack to mitigate the issue, as no official fix has been released by the plugin developer.
