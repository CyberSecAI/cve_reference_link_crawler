- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Premmerce WordPress plugin (versions <= 1.3.18) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, will execute actions on the website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user to trigger the malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
