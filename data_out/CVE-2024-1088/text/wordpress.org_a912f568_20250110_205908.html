It works great! So far have no problem. I am using it for protect certain type of WooCommerce’s categories, only show to the users who has the password.
I was wondering even we protected those categories, if a product is belonged to two or more categories that are not protected, will the users can access the product without a password or not.
After trying that, though the products will show up on the other category pages, the product is protected, it will ask for the password to see the product.
So it is working and I like it.
