- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because crafted, fragmented IKEv1 packets are not properly reassembled, leading to a heap overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap overflow due to improper reassembly of fragmented IKEv1 packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can send crafted UDP packets to an affected system to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated and needs to send crafted UDP packets to the targeted device. The device must have IKEv1 fragmentation enabled and the "buffers huge size" command configured for a value greater than 32,767.
