For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ikev1-NO2ccFWz>  This advisory is part of the March 2024 release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: March 2024 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75056).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software and both of the following conditions are true:    + IKEv1 fragmentation is enabled   + Any type of VPN that is based on IKEv1 is configured For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  **CVE-2024-20307:** For this vulnerability to be exploited, the **buffers huge size** command on the device must be configured for a value that is greater than 32,767.  **Determine the Configuration of IKEv1 Fragmentation**  To determine whether IKEv1 fragmentation is enabled, use the **show running-config | include crypto isakmp fragmentation** command. If the command returns any output, IKEv1 fragmentation is enabled, as shown in the following example:  ```   router#show running-config | include crypto isakmp fragmentationcrypto isakmp fragmentation   ```  **Determine the Device IKEv1 Configuration**  Features that use IKEv1 include different types of VPNs, such as the following:    + Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN)   + FlexVPN   + Group Encrypted Transport VPN (GET VPN)   + LAN-to-LAN VPN   + Remote access VPN (excluding SSLVPN) The preferred method to determine whether a device has been configured for IKEv1 is to use the **show ip sockets** or **show udp** EXEC command. If the device has UDP port 500, UDP port 4500, or UDP port 848 (GDOI) open, it is processing IKEv1 packets.  The following example shows the output of the **show udp** command on a device that is processing IKEv1 packets on UDP port 500 and UDP port 4500, using either IPv4 or IPv6:  ```   router# show udp Proto        Remote      Port      Local       Port  In Out  Stat TTY OutputIF17        --listen--          192.168.130.21    500   0   0 1001011   0   17(v6)    --listen--          UNKNOWN           500   0   0 1020011   0   17        --listen--          192.168.130.21   4500   0   0 1001011   0   17(v6)    --listen--          UNKNOWN          4500   0   0 1020011   0  ...router#   ```  **Determine the Buffers Huge Configuration (Required for CVE-2024-20307 Only)**  To determine if the buffers huge size has been altered from the default value, use the **show running-config | include buffers huge** command and verify that it returns output. If the command returns output and the value of the buffers huge size is greater than 32,767, as shown in the following example, the device is considered vulnerable:  ```   router#show running-config | include buffers hugebuffers huge size 50000   ```    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Adaptive Security Appliance Software   + Firepower Threat Defense Software   + IOS XR Software   + Meraki products   + NX-OS Software  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2024-20308: Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software IKEv1 Fragmentation Heap Underflow Denial of Service Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the IKEv1 fragmentation code of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a heap underflow, resulting in an affected device reloading.  This vulnerability exists because crafted, fragmented IKEv1 packets are not properly reassembled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted UDP packets to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  **Note:** Only traffic that is directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwh66334](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwh66334)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20308Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 8.6CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H  **CVE-2024-20307: Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software IKEv1 Fragmentation Heap Overflow Denial of Service Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the IKEv1 fragmentation code of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a heap overflow, resulting in an affected device reloading.  This vulnerability exists because crafted, fragmented IKEv1 packets are not properly reassembled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted UDP packets to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.  **Note:** Only traffic that is directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwf11183](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf11183)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20307Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 6.8CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H  Workarounds  * **CVE-2024-20308**: There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability. Disable IKEv1 fragmentation.  Use the commands in the following example to disable IKEv1 fragmentation:  ```   Router# configure terminalRouter(config)#no crypto isakmp fragmentationRouter(config)#endRouter#   ```  **CVE-2024-20307**: There are workarounds that address this vulnerability. Either revert the buffers huge configuration to its default value or disable IKEv1 fragmentation.  Use the commands in the following example to revert the buffers huge configuration to its default value:  ```   Router# configure terminalRouter(config)#default buffers huge sizeRouter(config)#endRouter#   ```  Use the commands in the following example to disable IKEv1 fragmentation:  ```   Router# configure terminalRouter(config)#no crypto isakmp fragmentationRouter(config)#endRouter#   ```  The IKE v1 fragmentation feature provides for the fragmentation of large IKE packets into a series of smaller IKE packets to avoid fragmentation at the UDP layer (for example, for large certificate payloads or certificate request payloads). Some third-party vendor devices, such as firewalls that are configured for stateful packet inspection, do not permit the passthrough of UDP fragments in case they are part of a fragmentation attack.  While these workarounds have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
