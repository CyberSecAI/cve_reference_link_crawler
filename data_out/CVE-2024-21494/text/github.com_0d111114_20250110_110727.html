| *Severity: Medium*  By manipulating the X-Forwarded-For header, an attacker can spoof an IP address used in the user identity module (/whoami API endpoint). This could lead to unauthorized access if the system trusts this spoofed IP address.  HTTP request-response cycle with the injected `X-Forwarded-For` header:  ``` GET /oauth2/google/authorization-code-callback?state=REDACTED&code=4%REDACTED-REDACTED-0pJfgn3DHsYbipfxJA1w&scope=email+profile+openid+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fuserinfo.email+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fuserinfo.profile&authuser=0&hd=portal-caddysecurity.com&prompt=none HTTP/2 Host: portal-caddysecurity.internal Cookie: AUTHP_SESSION_ID=REDACTED User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/115.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7 X-Forwarded-For: 1.3.3.4 Referer: https://portal-caddysecurity.internal/ ```  ``` HTTP/2 303 See Other Authorization: Bearer REDACTED Cache-Control: no-store Location: https://portal-caddysecurity.internal/portal Pragma: no-cache Server: Fly/a0b91024 (2023-06-13) Set-Cookie: access_token=REDACTED; Domain=portal-caddysecurity.internal; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly; Set-Cookie: AUTHP_SANDBOX_ID=delete; Domain=portal-caddysecurity.internal; Path=/; Expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; Date: Wed, 19 Jul 2023 09:33:16 GMT Content-Length: 0 Via: 2 fly.io Fly-Request-Id: 01H5PQY91PBMM0W8XWJ2JFBR11-waw ```  [image](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/38883201/268910519-5511f52f-c105-4c80-863f-59f50bb17006.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.t2mPSmBJNGi0y6bL8JKVqt8T0E6vivOcrU5h90ixS3k)  To resolve this vulnerability, reimplement the application to not rely on user-provided headers when obtaining a user’s IP address. If user-provided headers are required (e.g., X-Forwarded-For for logging purposes), ensure the header is properly validated (i.e., the value is consistent with IP address format through regular expression) or sanitized (to avoid [CRLF log injection attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/CRLF_Injection), for example).  In addition to this immediate fix, we recommend considering these long-term recommendations:   * Implement appropriate checks for potential IP spoofing and X- headers on the unit testing level. Consider [other headers that can rewrite IP sources](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/special-http-headers#headers-to-change-location). * Cover the IP spoofing scenarios and user-provided header processing in Golang’s native fuzz tests. * Use the dynamic testing approach with Burp Suite Professional and the [Param Miner](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/17d2949a985c4b7ca092728dba871943) extension to identify the processing of hidden headers. * Expand the caddy-security documentation to increase user awareness of this type of threat; show an example of misconfiguration, how to resolve, and how to test it.
