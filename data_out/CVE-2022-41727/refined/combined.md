# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Version v0.5.0 of [golang.org/x/image](http://golang.org/x/image) fixes a vulnerability in the [golang.org/x/image/tiff](http://golang.org/x/image/tiff) package which could cause a denial of service.

An attacker can craft a malformed TIFF image which will consume a significant amount of memory when passed to DecodeConfig.

This issue was discovered by OSS-Fuzz and reported to us by Philippe Antoine (Catena cyber), and is tracked as CVE-2022-41727 and <https://go.dev/issue/58003>.

Cheers,
Roland on behalf of the Go team
