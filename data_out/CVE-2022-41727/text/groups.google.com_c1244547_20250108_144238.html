Version v0.5.0 of [golang.org/x/image](http://golang.org/x/image) fixes a vulnerability in the [golang.org/x/image/tiff](http://golang.org/x/image/tiff) package which could cause a denial of service.

An attacker can craft a malformed TIFF image which will consume a significant amount of memory when passed to DecodeConfig.

This issue was discovered by OSS-Fuzz and reported to us by Philippe Antoine (Catena cyber), and is tracked as CVE-2022-41727 and <https://go.dev/issue/58003>.

Cheers,
Roland on behalf of the Go team
