## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2022/02/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Tuesday, February 1, 2022

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 98 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 98 is also promoted to our new [extended stable](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2B/refs/heads/main/docs/process/release_cycle.md) channel for Windows and Mac. This will roll out over the coming days/weeks.

Chrome 98.0.4758.80 / 98.0.4758.81 / 98.0.4758.82 for Windows and  98.0.4758.80 for Mac and Linux contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/97.0.4692.99..98.0.4758.82?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](https://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](https://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 98.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[1293087](https://crbug.com/1293087)] Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity), [libFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer), or [AFL](https://github.com/google/afl).
