### Analysis of vulnerability in MIPS SMP

The provided content details a bug in the MIPS SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing) implementation of the Linux kernel related to the order of operations during secondary CPU initialization. Specifically, it relates to the sibling and core maps initialization before starting the core scheduling.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is that the `set_cpu_sibling_map()` and `set_cpu_core_map()` functions, which are responsible for setting up the CPU's sibling and core mappings, were being called *after* the `notify_cpu_starting()` function. The `notify_cpu_starting()` function triggers CPU hotplug callbacks, including `sched_core_cpu_starting()`.  `sched_core_cpu_starting()` relies on the sibling and core maps being initialized before being called. This resulted in a warning message and incorrect core scheduling behavior when `CONFIG_SCHED_CORE` is enabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect initialization order:** The core issue is that the CPU sibling and core maps are initialized too late in the CPU startup process, after the scheduler core initialization.
- **Race condition:** A race condition exists as `sched_core_cpu_starting()` is called before the sibling and core maps are setup
- **Missing CPU SMT mask:** The `smt_mask` is empty when `sched_core_cpu_starting()` is invoked, leading to incorrect core scheduling parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this issue is a warning message being printed, and the CPU core scheduling not working as expected. This can cause performance degradation and potentially other issues due to incorrect scheduling decisions.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is not directly exploitable by an attacker but will trigger the issue whenever a secondary CPU core is initialized on a MIPS system using `CONFIG_SCHED_CORE`. This issue is triggered during normal operation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
No specific attacker capabilities are required as the issue occurs during normal system operation. It is a bug within the kernel's SMP initialization sequence for MIPS architecture, exposed when `CONFIG_SCHED_CORE` is enabled.

**Technical Details:**
The core of the fix involves moving the calls to `set_cpu_sibling_map()` and `set_cpu_core_map()` before the `notify_cpu_starting()` function call in `arch/mips/kernel/smp.c` within the `start_secondary()` function. The following diff shows the changes that fixes this vulnerability.

This correction ensures that the CPU's sibling and core maps are initialized *before* the CPU hotplug callbacks are invoked.
