  "CVE-2020-18651": {
    "Root cause": "Heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability in the `ID3_Support::ID3v2Frame::getFrameValue` function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Over-read"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service by crashing the application due to out-of-bounds read.",
    "Attack vectors": "Processing a specially crafted file with a malformed ID3 tag.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to provide the vulnerable application with a crafted file.",
      "Details": "The vulnerability occurs because the code reads 4 bytes from a buffer when processing an ID3 tag, without verifying that the buffer has at least 4 bytes remaining, resulting in out-of-bounds access."
