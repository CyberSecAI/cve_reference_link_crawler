- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a covert timing channel in Dell BSAFE SSL-J.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Covert Timing Channel vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can eavesdrop on encrypted communications, leading to the exposure of sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network, without requiring any user interaction or special privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the system running the vulnerable software, making network-based attacks possible, and with high attack complexity.
