The provided content describes two heap buffer overflow vulnerabilities in libboron v2.0.8.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** Heap buffer overflow in `ur_parseBlockI` function at `i_parse_blk.c:21`. The vulnerability occurs when processing malformed input.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient bounds checking when copying data to a heap buffer.
*   **Impact:** Heap corruption, leading to program crashes and potential for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vector:**  Providing a specially crafted `.b` file as input to the `boron` program.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker must be able to supply the crafted input to the `boron` program.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** Heap buffer overflow in `ur_strInitUtf8` function at `string.c:343`. The vulnerability occurs when processing malformed input that leads to a heap overflow in the string initialization.
*   **Weakness:**  Insufficient bounds checking when initializing a UTF-8 string, leading to out-of-bounds write.
*   **Impact:** Heap corruption, potentially leading to program crashes and arbitrary code execution. The ASAN output indicates that the heap metadata is being corrupted (`corrupted size vs. prev_size`).
*   **Attack vector:**  Providing a specially crafted `.b` file as input to the `boron` program.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker must be able to supply the crafted input to the `boron` program.

**Mitigation:**

The reporter suggests implementing checks on the size of the data being copied to the heap to prevent these overflows. The vulnerabilities are addressed by commits `b22dd72f` and `dd793349` in the official SourceForge repository.
