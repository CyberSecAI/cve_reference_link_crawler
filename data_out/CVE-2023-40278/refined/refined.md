- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper error handling in `printAppointmentPdf.jsp`. The application responds with different error messages based on whether an appointment exists with the specified `AppointmentUid`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure vulnerability due to varying error messages that reveal the existence of appointments.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can infer the existence of specific appointments, leading to potential compromise of patient and clinic scheduling data, privacy violations, targeted attacks, and social engineering.
- **Attack vectors**: Manipulating the `AppointmentUid` parameter in the `printAppointmentPdf.jsp` URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `printAppointmentPdf.jsp` endpoint and observe the application's responses. No authentication is mentioned, therefore it seems that the vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.
