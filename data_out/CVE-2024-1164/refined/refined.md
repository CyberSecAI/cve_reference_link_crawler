Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1164:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the Brizy Page Builder plugin's contact form widget. Specifically, user-supplied error messages and redirect URLs are not properly handled, leading to the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. Malicious scripts injected through the contact form are stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize user-provided error messages and redirect URLs before storing them.
- **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape these stored messages when rendering them on a webpage, allowing the injected scripts to execute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into pages created with the Brizy Page Builder.
- This code can execute in the context of a user's browser session when they access the page containing the vulnerable form.
- The injected code can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, perform actions on behalf of the user, and potentially gain control of their accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Contact Form Widget:** The primary attack vector is through the contact form widget within the Brizy page builder.
- **Error Messages and Redirect URLs:** Malicious payloads are injected using error messages or redirect URLs within the contact form settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have an account on the target WordPress site.
- **Contributor-level Permissions:** The attacker must have at least contributor-level permissions to be able to use the Brizy Page Builder and create/edit contact forms.
- **Ability to Configure Contact Forms:** The attacker needs the ability to access the Brizy page builder interface and configure the settings for the contact form widget.
