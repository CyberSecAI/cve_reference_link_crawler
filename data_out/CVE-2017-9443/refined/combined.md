| Multiple Security Issue of SQL code execution exists in BigTree CMS Less than 4.2.18  FILE： \BigTree-CMS-4.2.18\core\admin\modules\developer\extensions\install\process.php  ``` 	$manifest = json_decode(file_get_contents(SERVER_ROOT."cache/package/manifest.json"),true);  	// Insert the extension and growl 	$admin->installExtension($manifest);  ```  continue installExtension() function file：\BigTree-CMS-4.2.18\core\inc\bigtree\admin.php  ``` function installExtension($manifest,$upgrade = false) { 			$bigtree["group_match"] = $bigtree["module_match"] = $bigtree["route_match"] = $bigtree["class_name_match"] = $bigtree["form_id_match"] = $bigtree["view_id_match"] = $bigtree["report_id_match"] = array(); 			$extension = sqlescape($manifest["id"]);  			// Turn off foreign key checks so we can reference the extension before creating it 			sqlquery("SET foreign_key_checks = 0");  			// Upgrades drop existing modules, templates, etc -- we don't drop settings because they have user data 			if (is_array($upgrade)) { 				sqlquery("DELETE FROM bigtree_module_groups WHERE extension = '$extension'"); 				sqlquery("DELETE FROM bigtree_modules WHERE extension = '$extension'"); 				sqlquery("DELETE FROM bigtree_templates WHERE extension = '$extension'"); 				sqlquery("DELETE FROM bigtree_callouts WHERE extension = '$extension'"); 				sqlquery("DELETE FROM bigtree_field_types WHERE extension = '$extension'"); 				sqlquery("DELETE FROM bigtree_feeds WHERE extension = '$extension'");  			// Import tables for new installs 			} else {  				foreach ($manifest["components"]["tables"] as $table_name => $sql_statement) { 					sqlquery("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `$table_name`");                     var_dump($sql_statement); 					sqlquery($sql_statement); 				} 			}  ```  Note here：  $manifest["components"]["tables"] as $table\_name => $sql\_statement sqlquery($sql\_statement);  we can execute any sql code at here.  POC: 1、build extension 2、Add modules, templates, callouts, field types, feeds, and settings to your extension. 3、Add additional files to your extension. 4、create extension 5、download extension（a zip file） 6、modify manifest.json content in extension（a zip file） 7、install extension（upload and install） 8、the sql code will be execute when install successful Here we write a file to the web root directory：  "tables": { "your\_table\_name": "SELECT '' into outfile 'd:/wamp/www/BigTree-CMS-4.2.18/shell.php'" }  we can get the web root directory at here ： <http://127.0.0.1/BigTree-CMS-4.2.18/site/index.php/admin/ajax/developer/extensions/file-browser/> when you select a file，then save-files，you can get the web root directory  [sqlexec](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17606708/26778011/049e6800-4a12-11e7-81d2-c071095a965a.png)  The same vulnerability exists in the file \BigTree-CMS-4.2.18\core\admin\modules\developer\packages\install\process.php  thank you~ email ： xfkxfk@secbook.net |

| This is a feature and one that we don't consider a security hole. You must implicitly trust any package or extension you install as they all have the ability to write PHP files (and as they are PHP scripts could already remotely call the database and write to the file system). |

| When you install the package or extension must verify the contents of the file include, rather than the user to confirm their own. If you install a malicious file will be attacked. If you want to execute sql code, it has to be limited, can not execute any sql code. |

| Without signing extensions with a private key there's no way for the system to verify an extension hasn't been modified. If an extension has been modified then it's free to execute any PHP code it wants. Having the SQL inside the manifest or inside of sqlquery() calls in a PHP file included in the extension makes little difference. Extensions can already install files into the public root (inside /site/extensions/) so if you simply included a "shell.php" file inside of the /public/ folder in an extension it would be a much easier way to write a shell script than through the manifest SQL. |
