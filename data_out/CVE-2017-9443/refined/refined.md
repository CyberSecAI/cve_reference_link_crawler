{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly executes SQL statements from a JSON manifest file during extension installation, without proper sanitization or validation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Unvalidated input from manifest file"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary SQL code execution leading to potential database compromise, including data exfiltration, modification, or denial of service. An attacker could write a malicious php file to the web root directory.",
  "Attack vectors": "Uploading a modified extension package containing malicious SQL code in the manifest.json file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create and modify extension packages and upload them to the vulnerable BigTree CMS instance. Access to the admin panel is implied for installing extensions."
