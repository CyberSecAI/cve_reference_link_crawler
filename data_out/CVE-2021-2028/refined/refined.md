    "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in MySQL and its components",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Code vulnerabilities in MySQL server",
      "Vulnerabilities in InnoDB storage engine"

    "impact": "An attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process, escalate privileges, gain access to critical data or complete access to all MySQL server accessible data, or cause a Denial of Service condition.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Network exploitation",
           "Local exploitation"
