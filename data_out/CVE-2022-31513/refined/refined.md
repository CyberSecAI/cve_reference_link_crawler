*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Attack vectors**: Network-based exploitation by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint with an absolute path as a parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the application, no prior authentication or user interaction is required.

**CVE-2022-31572**
*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unsafe usage of the Flask `send_file` function, allowing an attacker to traverse the file system using absolute paths provided as user input.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Path traversal (CWE-22) due to insecure use of `send_file`.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the server.

**CVE-2022-31574**
*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `os.path.join` call is unsafe for use with untrusted input. When the `os.path.join` call encounters an absolute path, it ignores all the parameters it has encountered till that point and starts working with the new absolute path. This is then passed to `send_file`.
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Path traversal (CWE-22) due to insecure use of `os.path.join` and `send_file`.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the server.
