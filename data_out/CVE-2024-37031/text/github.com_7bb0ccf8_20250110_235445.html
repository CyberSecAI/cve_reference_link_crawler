# Stored persistent XSS in dynamic form legends

High

[deivid-rodriguez](/deivid-rodriguez)
published
GHSA-9mg6-x45v-hcfm
May 31, 2024

## Package

bundler

activeadmin
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 3.2.2
>= 4.0.0.beta1, < 4.0.0.beta7

## Patched versions

3.2.2
4.0.0.beta7

## Description

### Impact

Users settings their active admin form legends dynamically may be vulnerable to stored XSS, as long as its value can be injected directly by a malicious user.

For example:

* A public web application allows users to create entities with arbitrary names.
* Active Admin is used to administrate these entities through a private backend.
* The form to edit these entities in the private backend has the following shape (note the dynamic `name` value dependent on an attribute of the `resource`):

```
  form do |f|
    f.inputs name: resource.name do
      f.input :name
      f.input :description
    end

    f.actions
  end
```

Then a malicious user could create an entity with a payload that would get executed in the active admin administrator's browser.

Both `form` blocks with an implicit or explicit name (i.e., both `form resource.name` or `form name: resource.name` would suffer from the problem), where the value of the name can be arbitrarily set by non admin users.

### Patches

The problem has been fixed in ActiveAdmin 3.2.2 and ActiveAdmin 4.0.0.beta7.

### Workarounds

Users can workaround this problem without upgrading by explicitly escaping the form name using an HTML escaping utility. For example:

```
  form do |f|
    f.inputs name: ERB::Util.html_escape(resource.name) do
      f.input :name
      f.input :description
    end

    f.actions
  end
```

Upgrading is of course recommended though.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
