Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2024-37031:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize or escape user-controlled input when rendering form legends in ActiveAdmin. Specifically, if the `name` attribute of a form input is dynamically populated using user-provided data, it can lead to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**  The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. This occurs because malicious input is saved and later executed in the context of the Active Admin interface when it is rendered. The application fails to sanitize user-provided input that is used to set the value of form legends, enabling the injection of malicious HTML or Javascript code.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The application does not adequately sanitize the input used to set the form legend, allowing for HTML or JavaScript injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser of an administrator who is accessing the Active Admin interface.
- **Account Compromise:** The attacker could potentially steal session cookies, redirect the administrator to malicious websites, or perform actions on behalf of the compromised administrator.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker might also be able to manipulate data within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is network-based, requiring access to the affected application.
- **User Input:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious code into a field that is used to dynamically generate the form legend (typically the `name` field of the form inputs).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the data used to populate the form legends in Active Admin.
- They do not need to be an administrator, they only need to control a field which is used as input to the form legend.
- They need network access to the web application.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in ActiveAdmin versions prior to 3.2.2 and in versions between 4.0.0.beta1 and 4.0.0.beta7.
- Patches are available in ActiveAdmin versions 3.2.2 and 4.0.0.beta7.
- A workaround involves manually escaping the form name using an HTML escaping utility (e.g., `ERB::Util.html_escape`).
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.2, categorized as high severity.
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-80 (Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)).
