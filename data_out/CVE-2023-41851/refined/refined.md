- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress WP Custom Post Template plugin version 1.0 and below is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can craft a malicious request that is then unknowingly executed by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into executing a malicious request. The vulnerability is classified as requiring an unauthenticated user to exploit it, but this is misleading. It should say an attacker without an account on the site can exploit it, which is more clear and common to CSRF bugs.
