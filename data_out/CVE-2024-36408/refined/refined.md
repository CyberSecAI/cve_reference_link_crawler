**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially view sensitive data they are not authorized to access. This includes data of other users and other application data.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker could modify or delete data, leading to persistent changes in the application's content and behavior.
- **Complete System Takeover:**  The content does not explicitly mention it, however, SQL injection vulnerabilities often lead to complete system takeover if not properly handled.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker requires low privileges to exploit the vulnerability, meaning they must have some level of access to the application.
