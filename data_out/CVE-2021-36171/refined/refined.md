- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The FortiPortal password reset feature uses a cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator (PRNG).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Use of a cryptographically weak PRNG (CWE-338)
    - Insecure password generation
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can potentially predict parts or the whole of a newly generated password within a given time frame.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate a password reset.
