| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1034591#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2017-04-18 09:05:46 UTC  ``` CVE-2017-7252  Botan’s implementation of bcrypt password hashing scheme truncated long passwords at 56 characters, instead of at bcrypt’s standard 72 characters limit. Passwords with lengths between these two bounds could be cracked more easily than should be the case due to the final password bytes being ignored.  References <https://botan.randombit.net/security.html#id1> <http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2017/CVE-2017-7252.html> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1034591#c1)  Marcus Meissner   2017-04-18 09:06:52 UTC  ``` 2017-03-23 (CVE-2017-7252): Incorrect bcrypt computation  Botan’s implementation of bcrypt password hashing scheme truncated long passwords at 56 characters, instead of at bcrypt’s standard 72 characters limit. Passwords with lengths between these two bounds could be cracked more easily than should be the case due to the final password bytes being ignored. Found and reported by Solar Designer.  Bug introduced in 1.11.0, fixed in 2.1.0. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1034591#c2)  Marcus Meissner   2017-04-18 09:15:04 UTC  ``` sle12 has 1.10.x , so SLE not affected. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1034591#c3)  Daniel Molkentin   2017-04-25 09:57:17 UTC  ``` Factory has 1.10.16, and and 2.1.0 is pending for submission to Factory (separate package). Both are unaffected. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1034591#c4)  Daniel Molkentin   2017-04-25 09:58:46 UTC  ``` Back to security team for further processing. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1034591#c5)  Marcus Meissner   2017-05-08 11:55:21 UTC  ``` if its in factory -> good ``` |  |
