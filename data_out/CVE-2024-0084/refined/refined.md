The provided content is a security bulletin from NVIDIA, and it includes information about CVE-2024-0084.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in the NVIDIA vGPU software for Linux within the Virtual GPU Manager, where the guest OS can execute privileged operations on the host.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper restriction of operations within the vGPU Manager allows the guest OS to perform actions with elevated privileges. The specific weakness is identified as CWE-250, which refers to "Improper Preservation of Permissions."

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
  - Information disclosure
  - Data tampering
  - Escalation of privileges
  - Denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is local, meaning that an attacker needs to have access to the guest OS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have low privileges on the guest operating system.

**Additional details:**
This vulnerability affects the Virtual GPU Manager component of the NVIDIA vGPU software on Linux and is present in multiple driver branches (R550, R535, and R470) and impacts multiple hypervisors like Citrix Hypervisor, VMware vSphere, Red Hat Enterprise Linux KVM, and Ubuntu.
