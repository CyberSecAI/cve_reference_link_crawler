- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A weakness in AMD's SPI protection features.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability allows bypassing System Management Mode (SMM) ROM protections.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker with Ring0 (kernel mode) access can bypass SMM ROM protections, potentially leading to a loss of system integrity.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker needs Ring0 (kernel mode) access to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have Ring0 level access, which is typically achieved through a compromised operating system kernel.
