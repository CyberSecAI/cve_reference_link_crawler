{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The pfBlockerNG package (versions <= 2.1.4_26) uses the PHP `exec()` function with user-controlled data from the `HTTP_HOST` header, allowing command injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unvalidated input passed to `exec()` function",
      "Use of user-controlled data in shell commands"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthenticated remote command execution as root, leading to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious `Host` header to the vulnerable pfSense instance, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary system commands.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the pfSense instance and the ability to send HTTP requests. No authentication is required."
