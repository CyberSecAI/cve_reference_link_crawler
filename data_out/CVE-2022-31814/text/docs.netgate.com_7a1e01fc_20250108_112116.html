# pfBlocker-NG Package[Â¶](#pfblocker-ng-package "Link to this heading")

**pfBlocker-NG** introduces an enhanced alias table feature to pfSenseÂ®
software.

This package enables users to:

* Assign many IP address URL lists from sites like I-blocklist to a single alias
  and then choose a rule action.
* Block countries and IP address ranges.
* Use native functions of pfSense software instead of file hacks and table
  manipulation.

Features include:

* Geographical/Country Blocking
* IP block lists
* Dashboard widget
* XMLRPC Sync
* Frequently updated lists
* Many options to control what to block and how to block
* Network lists can be used in custom rules

## General Setup[Â¶](#general-setup "Link to this heading")

Set the interfaces to be monitored by pfBlocker-NG (both inbound and outbound),
where the inbound is the Internet connection.

To prevent devices or users from accessing sites in the selected countries/IP
addresses, select local interfaces under **outbound**.

## Setting up Lists[Â¶](#setting-up-lists "Link to this heading")

This is the IPBlocklist feature, enter IP addresses here to specifically block.
It must be in the file format or CIDR. Create a list for each type of action to
be taken by pfBlocker.

Options are:

Deny Both

Will deny access on Both directions.

Deny Inbound

Will deny access from selected lists to the local network.

Deny Outbound

Will deny access from local users to IP address lists selected to block.

Permit Inbound

Will allow access from selected lists to the local network.

Permit Outbound

Will allow access from local users to IP address lists selected to block.

Disabled

Will just keep selection and do nothing to selected Lists.

Alias Only

Will create an alias with selected Lists to help custom rule assignments.

The rest of the tabs (except sync) specify the other lists included with
the package. They are separated by continent with the exception of the
spammer list which contains countries from around the globe that are
known to harbor spammers.

Sync tab configures pfBlocker to sync its configuration to other pfSense
devices.

## Available lists[Â¶](#available-lists "Link to this heading")

Spamhaus

DROP and EDROP.

## FAQ[Â¶](#faq "Link to this heading")

Iâm getting memory errors while applying pfblocker lists, how to fix this?:

Increase table size to avoid memory errors in Advanced settings.

I canât see any pfblocker rules applied, whats wrong?:

pfblocker requires at least one firewall entry (any interface) for it to be
active. One way to verify is to check the front page widget.

pfBlocker always moves its rules to the top, how can I stop this?:

Change rule action to Alias only and then apply custom rules using pfBlocker
aliases with an arbitrary sequence.

How can I apply pfBlocker lists in floating rules?:

Aliases are used for customized filter entries and float rules.
