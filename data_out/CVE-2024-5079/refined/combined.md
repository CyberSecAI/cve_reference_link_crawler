## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP eMember < 10.6.7 - Unauthenticated Stored XSS via Member Registration

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of the fields when members register, which allows unauthenticated users to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

1. Add a membership level at https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=eMember\_membership\_level\_menu
2. On https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=eMember\_settings\_menu check the "Allow Free Membership" and add the membership level "2" (the default created in step 1
3. As a logged out user, go to the default registration page: https://example.com/join-us/registration/
4. Fill out the form, for the name fields, enter the payload: `"><script>alert(1)</script>`
5. As an admin, access the "members" section to see the XSS: https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp\_eMember\_manage
