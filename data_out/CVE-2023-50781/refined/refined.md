Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-50781:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is an incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability ([CVE-2020-25657](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-25657)) in the m2crypto library's RSA decryption API. The original fix did not fully address the timing leakage present in RSA decryption. Due to the API design, a complete fix is considered difficult to achieve.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Bleichenbacher Timing Attack:** The vulnerability allows for Bleichenbacher timing attacks during RSA decryption with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. This means an attacker can infer information about the decrypted data by observing the time it takes to perform the decryption.
*   **Incomplete Fix:** The original fix for CVE-2020-25657 was not comprehensive enough, leaving the timing side-channel vulnerability exploitable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Decryption of TLS Messages:** A remote attacker can potentially decrypt captured TLS messages from servers that use RSA key exchanges.
*   **Exposure of Confidential Data:** Successful exploitation can lead to the exposure of confidential and sensitive data transmitted over TLS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **TLS Servers with RSA Key Exchange:** Attackers target TLS servers that use RSA key exchanges with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding.
*   **Timing Side-Channel:** The attacker measures the timing differences in decryption operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to observe and intercept network traffic between the client and the vulnerable server.
*   **Timing Measurement:** The attacker needs to accurately measure the time it takes for the server to perform RSA decryption operations.
*   **Knowledge of Bleichenbacher Attacks:** The attacker needs to have a working understanding of how Bleichenbacher attacks work.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by using a cryptographic backend that implements implicit rejection (Marvin workaround).

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue affects applications using RSA decryption with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding.
*   The bug report mentions that fixes for affected packages are being tracked.
*   The vulnerability is related to the `m2crypto` library and affects packages using it (pywbem and virt-who).
*   The fix for the original CVE-2020-25657 was inadequate.
