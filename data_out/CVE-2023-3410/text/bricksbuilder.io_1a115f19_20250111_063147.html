# 1.10.2 Changelog

August 27, 2024On this page

We are crossing off some roadmap items in this release alongside 60+ other changes.

**Resizing the structure panel** by dragging it from the inner edge towards the canvas is now possible.

You can instantly spot unsaved changes thanks to the new **save button indicator**.

## Element breadcrumb navigation

Quickly view and navigate to any parent of the active element. This opt-in builder feature can be enabled under `Bricks > Settings > Builder > Element breadcrumbs`.

Select between showing either the default Bricks element names or your custom-set names.

## Form element additions

The form action “Registration” has a new control that allows you to set the role the newly registered user should get. The default is set under Settings > General > New User Default Role. As a security precaution, the user role administrator is not available.

The field type checkbox, select, and radio now support setting the value and label for every option, separated by a colon by enabling the `Set options as value:label` control, as shown in the following screenshot.

## More powerful link control

We renamed the link type “External URL” to “Custom URL” as the phrase external is somewhat misleading, considering you can link to any URL or section on the same page (e.g., `#hero`).

The new link type **“Taxonomy (Term)”** lets you link to any taxonomy term on your site:

When linking to any “Internal post/page”, you can now also add any **URL parameters**:

## Other noteworthy changes

One notable fix concerns the custom “**HTML tag**” setting available for multiple elements. Bricks now extracts and validates the HTML tag to prevent potential XSS vulnerabilities.

With maintenance mode enabled, popups are no longer rendered by default. Like header and footer templates, you can enable popup render under `Bricks > Settings > Maintenance mode`.

Google Maps can now be used without an API key through the Embed API, which is very limited by Google. It only allows for one address, zoom level, and map type. For more options, you have to use an API key.

Create a product “Quick view” inside your WooCommerce product query using popups by following this guide at <https://academy.bricksbuilder.io/article/how-to-create-product-quick-view-with-bricks/>
