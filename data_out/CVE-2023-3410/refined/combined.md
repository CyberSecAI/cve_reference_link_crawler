# 1.10.2 Changelog

August 27, 2024On this page

We are crossing off some roadmap items in this release alongside 60+ other changes.

**Resizing the structure panel** by dragging it from the inner edge towards the canvas is now possible.

You can instantly spot unsaved changes thanks to the new **save button indicator**.

![](https://bricksbuilder.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bricks-1.10.2-builder-element-breadcrumbs.png)
## Element breadcrumb navigation

Quickly view and navigate to any parent of the active element. This opt-in builder feature can be enabled under `Bricks > Settings > Builder > Element breadcrumbs`.

Select between showing either the default Bricks element names or your custom-set names.

## Form element additions

The form action “Registration” has a new control that allows you to set the role the newly registered user should get. The default is set under Settings > General > New User Default Role. As a security precaution, the user role administrator is not available.

![](https://bricksbuilder.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bricks-1.10.2-form-options-value-label.png)

The field type checkbox, select, and radio now support setting the value and label for every option, separated by a colon by enabling the `Set options as value:label` control, as shown in the following screenshot.

## More powerful link control

We renamed the link type “External URL” to “Custom URL” as the phrase external is somewhat misleading, considering you can link to any URL or section on the same page (e.g., `#hero`).

The new link type **“Taxonomy (Term)”** lets you link to any taxonomy term on your site:

![](https://bricksbuilder.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bricks-1.10.2-link-type-taxonomy-term.png)

When linking to any “Internal post/page”, you can now also add any **URL parameters**:

![](https://bricksbuilder.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bricks-1.10.2-link-type-internal-url-parameters.png)
## Other noteworthy changes

One notable fix concerns the custom “**HTML tag**” setting available for multiple elements. Bricks now extracts and validates the HTML tag to prevent potential XSS vulnerabilities.

With maintenance mode enabled, popups are no longer rendered by default. Like header and footer templates, you can enable popup render under `Bricks > Settings > Maintenance mode`.

Google Maps can now be used without an API key through the Embed API, which is very limited by Google. It only allows for one address, zoom level, and map type. For more options, you have to use an API key.

Create a product “Quick view” inside your WooCommerce product query using popups by following this guide at <https://academy.bricksbuilder.io/article/how-to-create-product-quick-view-with-bricks/>

### Description

The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘customTag' attribute in versions up to, and including, 1.10.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with access to the Bricks Builder (admin-only by default), to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This becomes more of an issue when Bricks Builder access is granted to lower-privileged users.

> Bricks has solved all the problems I've had with any other WP builders I've tried. Excellent performance (both front and back end), really easy to use, a UI that hugely inspires me to design, a solid theme styling system, the ability to create any extended global styles I can think of, and native features that other tools require 3rd party plugins for.

> After years of working with Elementor and Visual Composer, I decided to switch to Bricks. Performance and simplicity were key aspects to improve on my websites, and Bricks has definitely given me what I was after. Thanks to Bricks, my SEO efforts don´t get obscured by tons of lines of code that don´t do anything to my website but slow it down.

> What I love the most about Bricks is the query loop builder. It's rich in features and has the capability of querying taxonomies, and paired with Bricks dynamic data tags, it pushes the limits of what you can do with dynamic data.

I can say, with confidence, that Bricks Builder is #1 in the WordPress ecosystem right now. There’s no better option for building clean, scalable, maintainable, accessible websites. Buy it without hesitation.
