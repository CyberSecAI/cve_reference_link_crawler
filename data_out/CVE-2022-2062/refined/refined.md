Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2022-2062, though it is not explicitly mentioned.

**1. Verification of Relevance**
The provided content is a commit diff from the nocodb/nocodb repository on GitHub, specifically focusing on changes to the SMTP.ts file. The commit message "Fix: Exclude sensitive data related to server from SMTP test api" suggests a vulnerability related to the exposure of sensitive server information through the SMTP test API. This aligns with the general nature of information disclosure vulnerabilities. Although CVE-2022-2062 is a placeholder and doesn't have specific details it is possible that this commit relates to a fix for that issue as the commit and the general nature of CVEs of this type are related.

**2. Vulnerability Analysis**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is the inclusion of potentially sensitive server-related data in the response of the SMTP test API. When testing SMTP configurations, error messages might have contained internal server details or paths that should not be exposed.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is information disclosure through the SMTP test API. This could expose internal server details, potentially aiding attackers in further reconnaissance or exploitation.
    *  The previous SMTP testing functionality did not sanitize the server error logs which would be returned to the user.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker could gather sensitive server information that may aid in further attacks by gaining internal server knowledge.
    *   This could lead to a better understanding of the system for the attacker by learning about the underlying system architecture and configuration which could lead to further attacks.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
   *  The attack vector is through the exposed SMTP test API. An attacker can access the test functionality and view server details from returned errors, potentially through a web UI or API interface.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have access to the SMTP test API, which can be achieved via a user interface or through an API endpoint of the application.
    *   No specific capabilities or specialized knowledge is required to be able to access the exposed server logs via the test endpoint.

**3. Technical Details**

The commit diff shows a change in the `SMTP.ts` file, where a `console.log('SMTP test error :: ', e);` statement is removed. This statement likely printed the full error, including potentially sensitive information, into the server logs. By removing it the server information will no longer be exposed to the user via the test api.

**Summary**

The identified vulnerability is an information disclosure issue related to the SMTP testing API. Sensitive server information was being logged and exposed in error messages. The commit addresses this by removing the logging of error details, preventing their exposure. This has the impact of hiding server details from end users who are testing their configurations.
