{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sufficiently sanitize user input in the ‘read_more_text’ parameter, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability lies in the lack of input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied data, specifically within the 'read_more_text' parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts. These scripts will be executed in the victim's browser whenever they access a page with the injected malicious content, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves manipulating the 'read_more_text' parameter of the Sina Extension for Elementor plugin through the WordPress editor.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least Contributor level access or higher to be able to inject arbitrary web scripts into the affected pages or posts."
