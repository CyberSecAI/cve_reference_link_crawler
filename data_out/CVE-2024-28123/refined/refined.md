Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28123:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds buffer write in the WASMI interpreter's engine executor when calling or resuming a WebAssembly (Wasm) function from the host side with more than 128 parameters. The issue is that the stack was not correctly reserving space for the parameters, leading to a write past the end of the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787):** The core issue is writing data outside the allocated memory region, which can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:** The out-of-bounds write can corrupt memory, potentially leading to unexpected program behavior, crashes, or even arbitrary code execution.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, memory corruption vulnerabilities can often be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Host-to-Wasm Function Calls:** The vulnerability is triggered when a host application calls a Wasm function with more than 128 parameters or resumes such a call. It is not triggered by wasm-to-wasm calls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Call Wasm Functions from the Host:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate calls to Wasm functions from the host environment.
- **Control over Function Parameters:** The attacker needs to be able to control the number of parameters passed to the Wasm function, specifically by passing more than 128 parameters.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Versions:** Versions of `wasmi` between 0.15.0 and 0.31.0 are affected.
- **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.31.1 and later.
- **Mitigation:** Update `wasmi` to version 0.31.1 or later.
- **Workaround:** Ensure that host-to-Wasm calls do not pass more than 128 parameters.
- The issue was found and reported by Stellar Development Foundation.
- The vulnerability is considered "critical".
- It was determined that systems such as Polkadot that use `pallet_contracts` are not affected because they do not support host-to-Wasm calls with more than 128 parameters.
