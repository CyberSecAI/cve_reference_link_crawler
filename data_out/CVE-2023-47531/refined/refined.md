  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Droit Dark Mode plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a CSRF attack, where a malicious actor crafts a request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, performs unintended actions in the vulnerable application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges into triggering a malicious request."
