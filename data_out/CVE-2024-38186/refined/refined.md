{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `DeviceLicenseInstall` function within the `clipsp.sys` driver when handling license data of type 0x2. The code doesn't validate if the provided `entry_size` matches the actual size of the device ID, leading to out-of-bounds reads. Furthermore, due to a double-fetch of the device ID size, a race condition can occur, leading to an out-of-bounds write during the memcpy operation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency",
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Out-of-bounds write",
      "Double-fetch",
      "Race Condition"

    ],
    "impact": "Privilege escalation. By exploiting the out-of-bounds write vulnerability, an attacker can overwrite memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by calling the `NtQuerySystemInformation` function with the `SystemPolicyInformation` class and providing a specially crafted license blob with a malformed type-0x2 entry. The vulnerability occurs when the license is being installed.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to make the `NtQuerySystemInformation` call with the specific arguments, which can be done from a low-privilege user or even from within an LPAC container. They also need to be able to craft a malicious license blob."
