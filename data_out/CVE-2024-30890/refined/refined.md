  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization or output encoding in the categories.php file of ED01cms v1.0.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page. This could lead to various impacts such as session hijacking, credential theft, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious sites.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious scripts into an input field or parameter that is not properly sanitized in the categories.php file. These scripts are then rendered in the browser when a user accesses a page containing this unsanitized input.",
