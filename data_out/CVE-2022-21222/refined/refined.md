Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21222:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to the usage of an insecure regular expression in the `re_attr` variable within the `index.js` file of the `css-what` package.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS):** The vulnerable regular expression is susceptible to catastrophic backtracking when processing specific crafted inputs, leading to excessive CPU consumption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a specially crafted input string to the `parse` function, an attacker can cause the application to become unresponsive, leading to a denial of service. This is achieved by forcing the regex engine to perform a large number of steps for validation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a malicious input string through the `parse` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted input to the vulnerable application or component, which uses the vulnerable `css-what` package. No special privileges or user interaction is required. The attack can be launched remotely over a network.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided PoC demonstrates how a crafted input (a long string of `\=\\=`) can be used to trigger the ReDoS vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in `css-what` versions prior to 2.1.3.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.3 (Medium) by Snyk and 7.5 (High) by NVD and Red Hat.
- The Snyk documentation explains the concept of catastrophic backtracking and provides a good example of how ReDoS works in general, and provides a breakdown of the vulnerable component
