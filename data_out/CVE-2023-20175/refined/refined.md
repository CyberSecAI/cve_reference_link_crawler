- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user-supplied input in a specific Cisco ISE CLI command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection (CWE-78).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can perform command injection attacks on the underlying operating system and elevate privileges to root.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker with valid read-only or higher privileges can exploit the vulnerability by submitting a crafted CLI command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have valid read-only or higher privileges on an affected device. They also need to be a local attacker, implying they have some form of access to the device, like CLI.
