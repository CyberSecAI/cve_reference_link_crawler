Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-2788:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Path Traversal: The vulnerability is due to a ZipSlip attack through an upload procedure in Emerson Proficy Machine Edition. Specifically, the software does not properly sanitize file paths within a ZIP archive, allowing an attacker to include "..\filename" sequences in the file names which will write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem during extraction

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Path Traversal vulnerability (CWE-29), allowing a malicious .BLZ file to be implanted on the PLC, which, through the engineering station, can then execute the malicious code on connected Windows workstations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Allows for the execution of arbitrary code on connected Windows workstations via a malicious .BLZ file uploaded to the PLC.
*   Potential compromise of the PLC and connected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   A specially crafted ZIP archive (.BLZ file) containing path traversal sequences is uploaded to the PLC using vulnerable software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to upload files to the PLC through the engineering workstation.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to craft a malicious BLZ file with path traversal sequences.
* The attacker must have privileges to upload the file.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerable software is Proficy Machine Edition Version 9.80 and prior.
* The vulnerability can be exploited even when the engineering station is run under a non-administrator account.
*  The vulnerability is referred to as a "ZipSlip" attack.
