The content is related to CVE-2022-2788.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a path traversal issue within the Proficy Machine Edition software related to how it handles file uploads, specifically .BLZ files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Path Traversal: The software is vulnerable to a ZipSlip attack, which allows an attacker to upload a malicious .BLZ file to the PLC due to improper handling of the '\..\filename' sequence during the upload.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to implant a malicious .BLZ file on the PLC, which can then transfer to connected Windows workstations, potentially executing arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves uploading a specially crafted .BLZ file to the PLC through the vulnerable software.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs local access with low privileges on a system running the vulnerable software, and they must be able to initiate a file upload to the PLC. They also need user interaction to trigger the transfer of the malicious file to Windows workstations.
