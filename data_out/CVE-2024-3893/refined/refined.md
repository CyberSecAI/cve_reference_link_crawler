Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3893

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Missing authorization check in the `rtcl_fb_gallery_image_delete` AJAX action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to delete attachments. Specifically, it does not check for the capability `edit_rtcl_listing` when handling the `rtcl_fb_gallery_image_delete` AJAX action.
- **Arbitrary Attachment Deletion:** Lack of proper authorization allows any authenticated user (subscriber level and above) to delete any attachment, regardless of whether they own the attachment or have the right to modify it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Loss:** Attackers can delete arbitrary attachments from the WordPress site, potentially causing loss of images and other media files.
- **Integrity Compromise:** Deleting attachments can alter the content and appearance of listings, impacting the site's integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network via an AJAX request.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must be a logged-in user with at least subscriber-level permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with at least subscriber-level privileges on the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious AJAX request to trigger the vulnerable `rtcl_fb_gallery_image_delete` action and supply the attachment ID to be deleted.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was patched in version 3.0.11 of the plugin by adding a capability check before deleting attachments.
- The provided changeset (3073754) on plugins.trac.wordpress.org shows the code changes where the authorization check was implemented.
- The Wordfence article provides the CVSS score and vector, and detailed description and references.
