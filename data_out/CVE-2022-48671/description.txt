In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cgroup: Add missing cpus_read_lock() to cgroup_attach_task_all()

syzbot is hitting percpu_rwsem_assert_held(&cpu_hotplug_lock) warning at
cpuset_attach() [1], for commit 4f7e7236435ca0ab ("cgroup: Fix
threadgroup_rwsem <-> cpus_read_lock() deadlock") missed that
cpuset_attach() is also called from cgroup_attach_task_all().
Add cpus_read_lock() like what cgroup_procs_write_start() does.
