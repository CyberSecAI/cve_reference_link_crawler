**Security**

* Fix issue where challenge solves and account names could be seen despite accounts not being visible

**Admin Panel**

* Add a Localization section in the Config Panel
* Add the Default Language config in the Admin Panel to allow admins to configure a default language
  + Previously CTFd would default to an auto-detected language specified by the user's browser. This setting allows for that default to be set by the admin instead of auto-detected.

**Translations**

* Fix issue where Simplified Chinese would be used instead of Traditional Chinese
* Update the language names for Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese for clarity
* Update Vietnamese translation
* Add Catalan translation

# CTFd 3.7.3

[![Kevin Chung](/content/images/2020/12/166333.jpeg)](/author/kevin/)

#### [Kevin Chung](/author/kevin/)

02 Aug 2024 • 1 min read

CTFd 3.7.3 has been released with a security fix for a vulnerability where an attacker could determine the names of accounts that had solved a challenge even though CTFd was configured to hide account information.

v3.7.3 has already been deployed to Hosted CTFd customers. Self-hosted users can download the latest version of CTFd from [Github](https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/releases/tag/3.7.3?ref=blog.ctfd.io).
