# 3.7.3 / 2024-07-24

**Security**

* Fix issue where challenge solves and account names could be seen despite accounts not being visible

**Admin Panel**

* Add a Localization section in the Config Panel
* Add the Default Language config in the Admin Panel to allow admins to configure a default language
  + Previously CTFd would default to an auto-detected language specified by the user's browser. This setting allows for that default to be set by the admin instead of auto-detected.

**Translations**

* Fix issue where Simplified Chinese would be used instead of Traditional Chinese
* Update the language names for Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese for clarity
* Update Vietnamese translation
* Add Catalan translation
