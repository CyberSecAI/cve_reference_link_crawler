CTFd 3.7.3 has been released with a security fix for a vulnerability where an attacker could determine the names of accounts that had solved a challenge even though CTFd was configured to hide account information.

v3.7.3 has already been deployed to Hosted CTFd customers. Self-hosted users can download the latest version of CTFd from [Github](https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/releases/tag/3.7.3?ref=blog.ctfd.io).
