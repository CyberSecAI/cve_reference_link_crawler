Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is an SQL injection present in the `index` parameter within the `/view/teacher_salary_history1.php` file of the Complete Web-Based School Management System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, specifically the `index` parameter, before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Leaking of sensitive user and system data.
    - Compromising the overall security of the system.
    - Potentially allowing further malicious actions due to the ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessed through a web interface by manipulating the `index` parameter of the `/view/teacher_salary_history1.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and manipulate the `index` parameter.

**Technical details:**
- The provided payload `index='%2B(select(0)from(select(sleep(2)))v)%2B'` demonstrates a time-based SQL injection. The `sleep(2)` function will cause a delay, confirming the injection is successful.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable software is "Complete Web-Based School Management System" version <= 1.0.
- The provided link to the source code on github is not directly accessible, it links to a pdf file containing the report of the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is identified by VulDB entry 265985.
