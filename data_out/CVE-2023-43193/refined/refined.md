Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-43193

**Vulnerability Description:**
Submitty before v22.06.00 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in its forum component due to improper sanitization of user input in Markdown links. An attacker can craft a malicious Markdown link containing embedded JavaScript code that executes when a user clicks the link.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the usage of the `CommonMarkConverter` library for rendering Markdown content. The library's `allow_unsafe_links` option was not explicitly set to `false`, which resulted in the parser permitting `javascript:` URLs. These URLs can be used to execute JavaScript code directly in the browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-provided markdown links.
- Insecure default configuration of the `CommonMarkConverter` library, where `allow_unsafe_links` is enabled by default.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** Attackers can read data within the victim's browser context.
- **Integrity:** Attackers can perform actions with the victim's privileges.
- **Availability:** If the victim is an administrator, the attacker can disrupt the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious Markdown link containing a `javascript:` URL.
- The attacker posts this malicious link in the Submitty forum.
- A user clicks the crafted link in the forum.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to create forum posts.
- The attacker needs basic knowledge of XSS and Markdown.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is easily discoverable.
- The fix is available in pull request 8032.
- The CVSS v3.1 score is 6.5 with vector `AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L`.
