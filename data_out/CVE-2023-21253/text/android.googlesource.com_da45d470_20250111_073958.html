Commit Message:
--------------
Add errors from signature verify result to returned resultDuring APK signature verification, the apksig library will maintainan internal Result instance for the current signature version beingverified; any errors / warnings from the specific version signer(s)verification will then be copied to a Result instance that isreturned to the caller containing details for each of the signatureversions that the library attempted to verify. The internal Resultinstance can also contain more general errors / warnings abut theverification; these are currently not merged with the Result to bereturned to the caller, so some APKs may fail to verify without avalid error returned. This commit resolves this by merging allgeneral errors / warnings with the Result to be returned to thecaller.Bug: 266580022Test: gradlew test(cherry picked from https://googleplex-android-review.googlesource.com/q/commit:0b086bdc130e1e6216fcbc5436fe8e3cdc9ec011)Merged-In: Id0f4ee47a964a3bb5d30916808a3108858e6a0cfChange-Id: Id0f4ee47a964a3bb5d30916808a3108858e6a0cf
