Limit the number of supported v1 and v2 signersThe v1 and v2 APK Signature Schemes support multiple signers; thiswas intended to allow multiple entities to sign an APK. Previously,the platform had no limits placed on the number of signers supportedin an APK, but this commit sets a hard limit of 10 supported signersfor these signature schemes to ensure a large number of signersdoes not place undue burden on the platform.Bug: 266580022Test: Manually verified the platform only allowed an APK with the maximum number of supported signers.(cherry picked from https://googleplex-android-review.googlesource.com/q/commit:6f6ee8a55f37c2b8c0df041b2bd53ec928764597)Merged-In: I6aa86b615b203cdc69d58a593ccf8f18474ca091Change-Id: I6aa86b615b203cdc69d58a593ccf8f18474ca091
