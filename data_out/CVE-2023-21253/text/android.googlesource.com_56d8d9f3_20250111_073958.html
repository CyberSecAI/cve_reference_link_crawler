Limit the number of supported v1 and v2 signersThe v1 and v2 APK Signature Schemes support multiple signers; thiswas intended to allow multiple entities to sign an APK. Previously,there were no limits placed on the number of signers that couldsign an APK, but this commit sets a hard limit of 10 supportedsigners for these signature schemes to ensure a large number ofsigners does not place undue burden on the platform.Bug: 266580022Test: gradlew test(cherry picked from https://googleplex-android-review.googlesource.com/q/commit:6be64b9339c1dad28abf75b53d3866fd42f320d6)Merged-In: I4fd8f603385dd7e59c81695a75fe6df9a116185dChange-Id: I4fd8f603385dd7e59c81695a75fe6df9a116185d
