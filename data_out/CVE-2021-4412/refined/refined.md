Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Root Cause:** The `WP Prayer` plugin versions 1.6.5 and below are vulnerable to CSRF attacks due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `save()` and `export()` functions. The plugin uses the following logic:

```php
if ( isset( $_REQUEST['_wpnonce'] ) ) {
   $nonce = sanitize_text_field( $_REQUEST['_wpnonce']  ); 
}
if ( isset( $nonce ) and ! wp_verify_nonce( $nonce, 'wpgmp-nonce' ) ) {
   die( 'Cheating...' );
}
```

The vulnerability arises because the nonce check is only performed if `$_REQUEST['_wpnonce']` is set. If this parameter is missing, the code proceeds without nonce verification, allowing an attacker to bypass the CSRF protection.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Missing nonce validation**: The primary weakness is that the nonce check is conditional on the presence of the `$_REQUEST['_wpnonce']` parameter. This allows requests without the nonce to bypass the security check.
- **Insecure use of isset**: The code uses `isset()` incorrectly by only checking if the nonce is set in the request. This check should be done *before* calling wp_verify_nonce.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthenticated attackers can potentially modify plugin settings.
- Unauthenticated attackers can potentially trigger a data export.
- An attacker could trick an administrator into clicking a malicious link which will then perform the unwanted action.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious link or form that targets the vulnerable plugin endpoints.
- The attacker would need to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious link or submitting the form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator of the WordPress site to click a malicious link or form to trigger the CSRF request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jerome Bruandet from NinTechNet.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.6.6 of the plugin.
- The blog posts from nintechnet.com provide a deeper understanding of CSRF vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins in general and this case in particular.
- Several other plugins also suffer from similar issues. The main issue seems to be the conditional checking of the nonce only if it exists, which causes bypass if it doesn't.
