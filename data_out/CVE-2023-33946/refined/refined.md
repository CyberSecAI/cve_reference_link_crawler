- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Object module in Liferay Portal and Liferay DXP does not properly isolate objects between different virtual instances.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control, specifically concerning the isolation of objects between virtual instances. This allows unauthorized access to objects via the OAuth 2 scope administration page.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote authenticated user in one virtual instance can view objects in a different virtual instance. This is a confidentiality breach, potentially exposing sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, exploiting the OAuth 2 scope administration page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a remote authenticated user with high privileges (as indicated by the 'PR:H' in the CVSS vector) within one of the virtual instances in order to access the OAuth 2 administration page and then access objects in different virtual instances.
