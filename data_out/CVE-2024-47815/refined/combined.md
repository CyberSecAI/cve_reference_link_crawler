# Description

I have this in my config:

```
$wgIncidentReportingServices = [
   '<script>alert("OOPSIE WOOPSIE!! Uwu We made a fucky wucky!! A wittle fucko boingo! The code monkeys at our headquarters are working VEWY HAWD to fix this!")</script>' => false,
];
```

And I also edited MediaWiki:Incidentreporting-label-upstream‎ to Upstream<script>alert("Marketable Witix plushie")</script>

With that, I get:

Advisory: <https://github.com/miraheze/IncidentReporting/security/advisories/GHSA-9p36-hrmr-98r9>

For this task, I plan to:

* Sleep (it's been a bit of a long day)
* Do a code review of IncidentReporting (more XSSes than I expected)
* Create the advisory
* Fix the XSSes in the private fork

Dunno whether or not if I should open an advisory, since Agent (overzealously) fixed some of them in public: <https://github.com/miraheze/IncidentReporting/commit/9656e04dc1a6ee8914d9b29640aa8d4bd514a4ee>

Security policies should always be followed and we should never be fixing them in public when there is this many (one or two I may be okay with). Additionally ->parse() is wrong here. If it is ->text() before it should likely be ->escaped(). Additionally->text was properly used in some places and using ->parse() just opens up another security vulnerability. Double escaping can also lead to XSS.

I'll try my best to explain what can happen with double escaping here for future records:

Suppose a user creates a page in MediaWiki and adds the following content:

```
<script>alert('Hello!');</script>
```

Step 1: MediaWiki stores this as:

```
&lt;script&gt;alert('Hello!');&lt;/script&gt;
```

Step 2: When retrieving the content, if MediaWiki incorrectly applies another escaping function:

```
&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert('Hello!');&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
```

Step 3: If this content is later rendered without proper handling, the browser could interpret it as:

```
<script>alert('Hello!');</script>
```

I'm not sure how we got from step 2 to step 3? Wouldn't that need two HTML decode calls?

I'm not saying its likely, but it can be weird. And browsers sometimes interpret the &amp and everything back into the decoded versions of plain text which then rerenders it as html because we aren't using &gt we are using &amp;gt. I have encountered this issue once myself actually. I can't remember exactly how it happened but it sometimes does indeed cause that which is why MediaWiki even has their own checks and standards in phan to prevent doubling escaping.

Weird but alright, guess I'll have to redo my security review to get rid of the double escapes :)

It is very unlikely to actually be a vulnerability in the case of interface messages. But as best practices double escaping should normally be avoided.

1. My parents helped contribute to my C-PTSD
2. Do you... not keep your cups in a centralized place?

Anyway, CA noticed that he didn't realize that formatValue() returns raw HTML, so he suggested that I look at the other Miraheze extensions. For bugs I found from that, I marked CA as the reporter and myself as the remediation developer on the security advisories.

Sorry to ask, and sorry to hear that(I'm not exactly sure what the correct response to that is but uh hug🤗 ). Also, of course I do, cupboard above the junk counter next to the oven and fridge. Don't mean they all live there, leaving them around to use is easier then putting them in the washing machine all the time.

Nah, it's alright (my sense of humor includes seriously replies to jokes for some reason). I also don't know how you should respond to that, but uh... hug accepted! 🤗

Huh, okay. I keep my cup in one constant place

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
