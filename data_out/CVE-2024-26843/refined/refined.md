Based on the provided information, this CVE relates to a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the Linux kernel's EFI runtime services, specifically in how the size of soft-reserved memory regions is calculated.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is an integer overflow when calculating the size of a soft-reserved memory region in the EFI runtime services. The `md_size` variable, which stores the size of the memory region, was defined as an `int`. When the number of pages in the region is large (specifically, when the region is 4GB or more), multiplying the number of pages by the page size (EFI_PAGE_SHIFT) could result in an integer overflow, wrapping around to a much smaller value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Integer overflow: The use of a signed `int` to store the size calculation.
- Incorrect size calculation: The overflow leads to an incorrect `md_size` value when the soft-reserved region is larger than 4GB.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, a smaller than expected `md_size` value can lead to unexpected behaviors in memory allocation and resource management by the EFI runtime service. This could lead to memory corruption, system instability, or even allow for a privilege escalation. The text implies that the vulnerability can lead to memory corruption and possible security issues if the size of memory is not correctly calculated.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector would involve manipulating the EFI memory map such that a soft-reserved region with a large number of pages (>= 4GB) is created. Then the vulnerable code in the kernel's EFI runtime initialization would be triggered to calculate the region size using the vulnerable multiplication operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to control or influence the system's EFI configuration. This could be achieved by modifying the EFI firmware or by using a malicious bootloader.
- The attacker would likely need low-level access to the system to be able to influence the EFI memory map configuration

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves changing the type of `md_size` from `int` to `u64` to ensure the calculation can hold the maximum possible size of the memory region without overflowing.
- The vulnerability affects both ARM and RISC-V architectures as the fix modifies the respective runtime service files for these architectures
- The patch was backported to multiple stable kernel branches
- A Debian LTS advisory lists this CVE along with many others
