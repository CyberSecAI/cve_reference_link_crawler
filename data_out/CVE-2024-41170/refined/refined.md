- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Siemens Tecnomatix Plant Simulation when parsing specially crafted SPP files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process or application crash.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious SPP file using the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious SPP file. This can be achieved through social engineering or other means of delivering the malicious file to the user. Local access is required (AV:L) for the attack. User interaction is also required (UI:R)
