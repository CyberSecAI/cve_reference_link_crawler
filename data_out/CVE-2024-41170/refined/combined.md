SSA-427715: Stack-Based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Tecnomatix Plant Simulation

| Publication Date: | 2024-09-10 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-09-10 |
| Current Version: | V1.0 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.8 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 7.3 |

SUMMARY

Siemens Tecnomatix Plant Simulation is affected by a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability that could be triggered when the application reads files in SPP file format. If a user is tricked to open a malicious file with any of the affected products, this could lead the application to crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

Siemens has released new versions for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.
