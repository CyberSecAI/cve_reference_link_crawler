    "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Oracle MySQL database server and client library.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Various code flaws in MySQL server components like the optimizer, InnoDB, stored procedures, DDL/DML handling, security privilege/role handling and the replication module, along with vulnerabilities in the C API client libraries.",
      "Third party libraries included in MySQL also have vulnerabilities, like SQLite, Apache Commons BeanUtils, OpenSSL, Spring Framework, and jackson-databind."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation may lead to unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all of the MySQL Server accessible data, or to a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server. Other exploits may permit execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process.",
