## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP ULike < 4.7.2.1 - Subscriber+ Stored-XSS

### Description

The plugin does not properly sanitize user display names when rendering on a public page.

### Proof of Concept

1. Enable the visibility of likers on content. The easiest way is to create a new post or page and use the `wp\_ulike\_likers\_box` shortcode:
\* Enable the toggle `Display Likers Box` from the settings page `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-ulike-settings#tab=configuration/content-types`
\* Create a new post or page with a likers box using the `wp\_ulike\_likers\_box` shortcode. e.g: `[wp\_ulike\_likers\_box]`
2. Create a new subscriber level user with a first name of the following. Ensuring that the display name is set to contain this payload:
```
sub"id="x"tabindex="1"autofocus="1"onfocus="alert(`subf`)"x=
```
3. As this user, like the content created in step 2.
4. Observe XSS JavaScript execution when any user visits the page. You may need to hard refresh to avoid caching.
