- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user display names when rendering them on a public page, specifically within the likers box.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when they view a page containing the vulnerable likers box. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing cookies, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A subscriber-level user can create an account with a malicious payload in their first name, which is then reflected in their display name.
    - By liking a post containing the `wp_ulike_likers_box` shortcode, the malicious payload in the display name is stored and rendered on the page when the likers are displayed.
    - When any user visits the page, the stored XSS payload executes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Attacker needs to be a subscriber-level user on the WordPress site.
    - Attacker needs to be able to set their display name.
    - Attacker needs to be able to like a post with the vulnerable shortcode.
