- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from ADAudit Plus's incorrect assumption that any Windows user account ending with a "$" symbol is a system account and should be ignored. This leads to the product not monitoring these accounts, even if they are legitimate user accounts performing activities.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to an improper filtering mechanism in ADAudit Plus that relies on the "$" suffix to identify system accounts and excludes these from monitoring.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation allows a malicious actor to perform undetected actions on the network. The user's activities, including logon attempts, successful or unsuccessful, will not be recorded by ADAudit Plus. This can lead to significant risks as organizations relying on the product will lack visibility into such activities, hindering threat detection, compliance and auditing.

- **Attack vectors:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by creating a new user account ending with "$" or renaming an existing user to have the suffix. They can then move across machines and perform malicious actions undetected by ADAudit Plus.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to create or rename user accounts on the monitored systems. This can be an internal user or an external actor with access to the domain.
