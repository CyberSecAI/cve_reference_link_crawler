Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by commit `b0ef15f4737d0c801154c1991b52ff5cab4f5c83`, which is related to CVE-2022-1592 (as described in the commit message):

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `remote_cors` function in `scout/server/blueprints/alignviewers/views.py` was vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This function acted as a proxy, fetching content from a remote URL provided in the `remote_url` parameter.  Without proper validation, an attacker could supply an arbitrary URL, potentially allowing the server to make requests to internal resources or external services.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SSRF:** The primary vulnerability was the lack of proper input validation on the `remote_url` parameter. The server would blindly make a request to the provided URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Internal Resource Access:** An attacker could potentially use the server as a proxy to access internal resources that are not exposed to the public internet.
- **External Service Interaction:** An attacker could make the server interact with external services, potentially leading to denial of service or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker would need to craft a malicious `remote_url` and send it to the `remote_cors` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application and know the structure of the API.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to know the location of the `remote_cors` endpoint, and the `remote_url` parameter.

**Mitigation:**
The commit mitigates the vulnerability by implementing the `check_session_tracks` function to ensure that the requested `remote_url` is present in the user's session. The session object is populated during the loading of the IGV tracks, so this ensures that only files the user has access to can be loaded via the `remote_cors` function.

**Changes Made in the Commit:**
- Added `check_session_tracks` function in `scout/server/blueprints/alignviewers/controllers.py` to verify that user is authenticated and the resource is in the session's IGV tracks
- Modified `set_session_tracks` to add the correct file paths to the session.
- Modified `remote_cors` in `scout/server/blueprints/alignviewers/views.py` to use `check_session_tracks` before making the remote request.
- Added tests for both positive and negative `remote_cors` scenarios in  `tests/server/blueprints/alignviewers/test_alignviewers_views.py`.
- Added an entry in the CHANGELOG.md for the patch.
