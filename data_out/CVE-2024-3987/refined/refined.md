Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3987

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the WP Mobile Menu plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided data when handling image alt text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS via the image alt text field. This occurs because the plugin does not properly sanitize user-provided input for the image alt attribute and then renders it in the HTML without proper escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the image alt text. When a user accesses a page where the image with the malicious alt text is rendered, the injected script will execute within the user's browser.
*   **Potential for Malicious Activities:**  The attacker could potentially perform various malicious actions, such as:
    *   Stealing cookies
    *   Redirecting users to phishing sites
    *   Modifying page content
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Image Alt Text Injection:** The attacker injects the malicious script as part of the image alt text.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least Contributor-level access or higher to the WordPress site. This level of access allows the user to modify content that can include images and their alt text.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions of the WP Mobile Menu plugin up to and including 2.8.4.2 are affected.
*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.8.4.3 and later.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by the researcher "stealthcopter".
*   The fix for the vulnerability can be seen in the provided changeset link. The patch focused on sanitizing the menu item icon value with `sanitize_text_field()`
