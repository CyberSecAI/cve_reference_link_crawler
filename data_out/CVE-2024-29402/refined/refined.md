Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-29402:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient session expiration in cskefu v7. When a user is deleted by an administrator, their existing session is not immediately invalidated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Session Expiration:** The application fails to properly invalidate user sessions upon user deletion. This allows a deleted user's session to remain active.
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The system allows a deleted user to perform actions because their session is still valid.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A deleted user can retain access to the application and perform actions they should no longer be authorized to do, including deleting contacts. This effectively allows them to escalate their privileges beyond their current status.

**Attack Vectors:**
1. **User Login:** A user logs into the system.
2. **Admin Deletion:** An administrator deletes the user's account.
3. **Continued Access:** The deleted user can still perform actions due to their existing, active session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account.
- The attacker needs to have their account deleted by an admin.
- The attacker needs to attempt to perform actions after being deleted, while their old session is still active.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration.
- The fix for this issue involved adding a `deleteUserSession` function to the `AgentSessionProxy` class and checking session validity in `UserInterceptorHandler`. This ensures that user sessions are invalidated upon deletion.
- The vendor has acknowledged and confirmed the vulnerability.
- A patch has been implemented and merged into the master branch of the cskefu project.
