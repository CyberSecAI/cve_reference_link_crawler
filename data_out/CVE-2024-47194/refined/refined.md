Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-47194:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `vish2.exe` executable in affected Siemens applications loads a DLL file from the current working directory. This behavior is vulnerable because if `vish2.exe` is launched from a user-writable directory, a malicious DLL can be placed there and loaded by the application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427):** The application does not properly control the locations from which it loads DLL files, specifically loading from the current working directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code injection:** A local attacker can inject and execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious DLL in the current working directory.
- **Privilege escalation:** This can lead to privilege escalation if `vish2.exe` is launched by administrators or processes with elevated privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **User-writable directory:** The attacker needs to be able to write to the directory from which `vish2.exe` is executed.
- **DLL hijacking:** The attacker places a malicious DLL with the expected name in the directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user on the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to write to the directory from where `vish2.exe` is executed.
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the execution of `vish2.exe` (e.g., by being able to get a privileged process to execute `vish2.exe` from a user controlled location).
- The attacker needs to know the DLL name that vish2.exe is attempting to load.
