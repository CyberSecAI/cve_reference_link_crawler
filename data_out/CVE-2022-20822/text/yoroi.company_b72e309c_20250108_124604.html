# CVE Advisory - Full Disclosure Cisco ISE Path Traversal

###### 03/28/2023

## Introduction

In July 2022 the Yoroi advisory team, in the context of its internal project Saguri, started analysing the Cisco Identity Service Engine (ver. 3.1.0.518-Patch3-22042809).
Cisco ISE is a network management tool which allows definition and implementation of security and management policies, which enable precise controls over who can access the network, what they have access to, when and how they can do it.
ISE therefore not only guarantees software-defined access and automates network segmentation within IT and OT environments, but also provides a means of visibility into the 'state' of the network.

### Description

The functionality of local disk management is impacted by a Path Traversal vulnerability. Exploiting this vulnerability, an authenticated attacker can read and delete arbitrary files within the file system. This vulnerability endangers both the integrity and confidentiality of the system that runs the Cisco Identity Services Engine.

### Owasp Category

**A01 – Broken Access Control** – An attack of this type aims to gain access to files and directories stored outside the directory tree directly exposed by the web service; this is mainly done by manipulating variables with 'dot-dot-slash' sequences `(../)` and similar techniques or by using absolute paths.
The kind of attack allows an attacker to navigate through the filesystem to reach sensitive files that are not normally allowed access to, such as configuration files, source code and others.

## Proof of Concept

### Technical Description

Via the GUI, administrators belonging to the groups: Elevated System Admin and Super Admin have the local disk resource management functionality; as the official documentation states, through this functionality it is possible to “*easily add, download or delete files used for local disk management.*”

![](https://yoroi.company/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/1-1024x457.png)

*Figure 1 UI Local Disk Management*

These feature allows the aforementioned users to list the files contained in the localdisk folder, which is mapped to the `/localdisk` path in the filesystem.

![](https://yoroi.company/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2-1024x822.png)

*Figure 2 Local Disk Folder*

The GUI (see *Request 1*) renders the file tree based on the data returned from requests made to the following endpoint:
`/admin/rs/uiapi/diskmngmnt/getAllFile`
These requests contain the following header: `qph`
This header’s value is the base64-encoded string `hostName=[cisco.nameserver]`

---

`GET /admin/rs/uiapi/diskmngmnt/getAllFile HTTP/1.1
Host: Ciscoise.server
Cookie: APPSESSIONID=omitted
Owasp_csrftoken: XUOJ-BRHN-A58J-WJRA-K6FQ-AJG4-O53Z-HA18
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/103.0.5060.53 Safari/537.36
Accept: application/json, text/javascript; q=0.01
qph: aG9zdE5hbWU9Y2lzY29pc2UuZG5zLm9wZW5kbnMuY29t
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest, XMLHttpRequest
Referer: https://ciscoise.server/admin/
Connection: close`

*Request 1 Retrieve all file from localdisk folder*

---

It is worth noting that this header can be removed, and its value submitted instead via the URL parameter hostName, like in the following example:

`https://cisco.server/admin/rs/uiapi/diskmngmnt/getAllFile?hostName=[cisco.nameserver]`

As this notation is more compact, this is the syntax that will be used in the rest of this report.
During our analysis of the endpoint it was discovered that by submitting arbitrary filepaths via the `filePath` parameter, it is possible to enumerate, at least partially, files and directories outside the `/localdisk` folder.

![](https://yoroi.company/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/3-1-1024x624.png)

*Figure 3 Original getAllFile request*

![](https://yoroi.company/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/4.png)

*Figure 4 Modified getAllFile request by adding the filePath parameter*

This issue is better known as Path Traversal; an attack of this type aims to access files and directories stored outside of the exposed tree directly from the web service; this is mainly done by manipulating variables with "dot-dot-slash" sequences `(../)` and their variants or by using absolute paths.
The goal of an attacker in this case is to navigate the filesystem to reach sensitive files not normally allowed access to such as configuration files, source code, and more.

Since the file deletion process runs with user `iseadminportal`, it is not possible to delete all files within the filesystem, but only files whose user has write permissions, to see the files that can be written, so deleted, we can use, for example, the following command as iseadminportal:
`find / -type f -writable -print`
Thus, by performing a request like the following:
`/admin/rs/uiapi/diskmngmnt/deletefile?hostName=&filepath=[file_to_delete]`
it is possible to delete file on the filesystem.

The other callable endpoint that suffers from Path Traversal is `/admin/rs/uiapi/diskmngmnt/filedownload`
In this case the response received will not contain the directory listing, but the contents of the invoked file.
Below are two screens that give evidence of the vulnerability by invoking the `/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow` files.

![](https://yoroi.company/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/5-1024x637.png)

*Figure 5 Modified filedownload request to retrieve etc/passwd*

![](https://yoroi.company/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/6-1024x613.png)

*Figure 6 Modified filedownload request to retrieve etc/shadow*

### Impact

A successful exploit could allow the attacker to list, download, or delete specific files on the device that their configured administrative level should not have access to.

Below is a simple script in python, to facilitate file retrieval, It takes a cookie value and the IP address of the target server as input, then repeatedly reads and displays the content of files specified by their absolute paths.
