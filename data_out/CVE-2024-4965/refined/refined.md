Based on the provided information, here's an analysis related to the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The primary root cause is the lack of parameter verification in various web interfaces of the D-Link DAR-7000 and DAR-8000 routers. Specifically, the `/useratte/resmanage.php` interface on the DAR-7000 is mentioned. This lack of input sanitization allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The most critical vulnerability is command injection, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the router. Multiple instances of this are cited in the security announcement.
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** Several reports mention arbitrary file upload vulnerabilities through different interfaces. This allows an attacker to upload malicious files to the router's file system. Specific vulnerable interfaces mentioned are:
    - licenseauthorization.php
    - onlineuser.php
    - resmanage.php
    - url.php
    - urlblist.php

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The command injection vulnerabilities directly lead to RCE, enabling attackers to gain full control over the affected devices.
- **Compromise of Router Functionality:** Attackers can manipulate the router's settings, potentially disrupting network services.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers could use RCE to steal data stored on the router or transmitted through it.
- **Malware Installation:** Attackers could install malware to further compromise the network or launch attacks on other devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the web-based management interface of the routers.
- Exploitation likely occurs via crafted HTTP requests to vulnerable endpoints (`/useratte/resmanage.php`, etc.)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router, which implies network access to the device's management interface. The attacker would also need to know the vulnerable endpoints and parameters.

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected devices are end-of-life (EOL) and end-of-service (EOS), meaning that no security updates will be provided by D-Link.
- D-Link recommends that these devices be retired and replaced.
- The vulnerability was reported by multiple sources via github.
- The VulDB entry specifically mentions the command injection vulnerability in `/useratte/resmanage.php` of the D-Link DAR-7000-40, confirming this vulnerability as a concrete issue.
- There are multiple file upload vulnerabilities present, which also could lead to arbitrary code execution.
