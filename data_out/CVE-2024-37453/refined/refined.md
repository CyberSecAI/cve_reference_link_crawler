**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** Specifically, the plugin does not adequately restrict access to certain functions, allowing users with lower privileges to potentially execute higher-privileged actions. This could be due to missing or insufficient checks on user roles, capabilities, or necessary security tokens.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The impact is described as low severity. The specific actions that an attacker could perform are not detailed, but it is stated that an unprivileged user could execute "certain higher privileged action".

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is present within the ProfileGrid WordPress plugin, meaning it can be exploited by interacting with the plugin's functionalities.
*   The specific functions are not identified in the content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to have a user account on the WordPress site, specifically a subscriber role, which is the lowest privileged role.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in ProfileGrid plugin versions <= 5.8.7 and is fixed in version 5.8.8
*   The CVSS score is 4.3 which is considered Low Severity
*   The content indicates that the vulnerability is "unlikely to be exploited" despite the broken access control issue.
