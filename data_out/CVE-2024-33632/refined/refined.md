Root cause of vulnerability: The Piotnet Addons For Elementor Pro plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
Impact of exploitation: A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to perform unwanted actions under their current authentication.
Attack vectors: A malicious actor can craft a request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, performs unwanted actions on the vulnerable plugin.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page that executes the forged request on their behalf. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target website.
