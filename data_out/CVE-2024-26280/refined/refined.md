Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-26280:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from overly broad default permissions granted to "Viewer" and "Ops" users in Apache Airflow, allowing them to access audit logs that contain sensitive information, such as DAG names and usernames, which they should not have access to.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The core issue lies in the improper configuration of default permissions, where users with "Viewer" and "Ops" roles were granted access to audit logs without explicit authorization. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized users could gain access to sensitive information contained within the audit logs, including:
    - DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) names, which could reveal the structure and purpose of workflows.
    - Usernames, potentially exposing internal user accounts.
- This information could be used for further malicious activities, although the specific impact beyond information disclosure isn't detailed.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attack vector requires an attacker to have valid credentials as either a "Viewer" or "Ops" user within the Apache Airflow instance.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Apache Airflow with either a "Viewer" or "Ops" role. No other special privileges or positioning is mentioned.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in Apache Airflow version 2.8.2 by revoking the default audit log permissions from "Viewer" and "Ops" roles. Now, only administrators have these permissions by default.
- The fix was implemented in the FAB provider and later cherry-picked back to core for versions prior to 2.9.
- The pull request #37501 on the Apache Airflow GitHub repository is the source of the fix.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Yusuf AYDIN (@h1_yusuf).
