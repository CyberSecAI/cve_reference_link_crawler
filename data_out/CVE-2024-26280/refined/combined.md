The viewer role and any other users apart from admin don't need to have audit\_log permissions. Revoking it.

Alternatively, I moved the revoked permissions to ADMIN\_PERMISSIONS.

I agree with you that only admin (and custom roles) should have these permissions, but I don't know if we can consider this a bug fix, because otherwise it will be considered a breaking change. (not a big problem anymore after creating fab provider)

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Not tricky. We agreed with [@vincbeck](https://github.com/vincbeck) that when we cherry-pick FAB things for 2.8.0, we will cherry-pick them to core - moving the changes back where they were in before 2.9, so once we cherry-pick this one with a newsfragment, it will nicely go into 2.8.2 (or 2.8.3 whatever it will be released in) |

The fab provider will be functional only for Airflow 2.9.0 does it not? so only when user is upgrading to Airflow 2.9.0 the user will notice the change thus adding it to newsfragmant of 2.8.2 is not helpful. |

| No. This issue can be cherry-picked to 2.8.2 to the place where Fab was previously. We've already done that |

| When we separated FAB provider right after we created 2.8.0 - this was what we agreed to with [@vincbeck](https://github.com/vincbeck) - that security related and small fixeds will be cherry picked to 2.8.\* airflow core |

| [@potiuk](https://github.com/potiuk) do I have to do anything with respect to cherry picking to earlier branches?  Thanks for the offer :). We'll handle it. Usually cherry-picking is done by release managers and those who directly help them and are familiar with the process - becuase this is rather delicate process and there are a number of decisions to made on the spot (currently those people are [@ephraimbuddy](https://github.com/ephraimbuddy) [@jedcunningham](https://github.com/jedcunningham) [@eladkal](https://github.com/eladkal) and myself mostly. So doing it just for one PR introduces potential more issues than it solves. But if at some point in time you would like to join the release team and cherry-pick next changes (after seeing how it's done - absolutely :D . Just look what's dicussed in `#release-management` channel and follow it, and then raise hand before the release. Though - extra care is needed while doing it |

I was curious if anything special was needed because this is a different kind of fix. Got it cleared now, thanks |

Subject: CVE-2024-26280: Apache Airflow: Overly broad default permissions
 for Viewer/Ops (audit logs)

Severity: low

Affected versions:

- Apache Airflow before 2.8.2

Description:

Apache Airflow, versions before 2.8.2, has a vulnerability that allows authenticated Ops and Viewers users to view all information on audit logs, including dag names and usernames they were not permitted to view. With 2.8.2 and newer, Ops and Viewer users do not have audit log permission by default, they need to be explicitly granted permissions to see the logs. Only admin users have audit log permission by default.

Users of Apache Airflow are recommended to upgrade to version 2.8.2 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability
