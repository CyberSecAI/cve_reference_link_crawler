  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2024-20749",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the processing of OpenType font files embedded in a PDF, specifically within the CFF2 table's CharStrings Index. An out-of-bounds read occurs when an element in the CharStringsOffset array is greater than the calculated valid range, leading to reading memory outside the allocated buffer.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)"
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary memory of the process. The potential impact could be disclosure of sensitive information, which could aid in further exploitation and bypass exploit mitigations. The Adobe Security Bulletin lists the impact as a memory leak.",
       "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted font file embedded within a PDF document.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious PDF file.",
       "additional_information": "The provided Talos report includes a detailed explanation of the vulnerable code path using debugger output, and explains the structure of the CFF2 table."
