- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Rank Math SEO plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape settings within the "Table of Contents Title" field in the general settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the browsers of other users viewing pages where the table of contents block is rendered. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious code in the `Table of Contents Title` field in the Rank Math SEO plugin general settings. The injected payload is triggered when the "Table of Contents" block is added to a post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the general settings of the Rank Math SEO plugin. By default, this is typically an admin role, but this access can be granted to users with lower roles via the plugin's role manager.
