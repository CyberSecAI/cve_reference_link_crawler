## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Contact Form Builder by Bit Form < 2.2.0 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a Blank form or select contact form.
2. Select Builder Tab.
3. Select the setting button.
2. Put XSS payload or HTML code in input fields like the label.
Almost all Input fields are vulnerable to XSS and HTML Injection.

### Affects Plugins
