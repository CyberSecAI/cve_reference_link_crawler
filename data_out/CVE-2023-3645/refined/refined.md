The provided content is related to CVE-2023-3645.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WordPress plugin "Contact Form Builder by Bit Form" does not properly sanitize and escape some of its settings, specifically in the form builder's input fields.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization and output escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the form builder's settings fields. This injected code would then be stored in the database, and executed when an administrator views the affected page, allowing for arbitrary actions within the administrator's session.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must have admin or a similar high-privilege role.
- They must access the plugin's settings and specifically the form builder.
- They need to insert malicious payloads into input fields (e.g., label fields).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have admin-level or equivalent privileges in the WordPress site.
