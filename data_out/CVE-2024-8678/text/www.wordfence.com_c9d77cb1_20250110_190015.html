### Description

The Revolut Gateway for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the /wc/v3/revolut REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 4.17.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to mark orders as completed.
