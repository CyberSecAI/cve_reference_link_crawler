- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-based buffer overflow in `DecoderStream::Append` due to an integer overflow when calculating the size of the heap buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow in memory allocation, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted JPEG 2000 file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.
