The provided content relates to CVE-2024-41072.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `cfg80211_wext_siwscan()` function in the Linux kernel's wireless subsystem. Specifically, it lacks a proper check on the number of channels provided by a user-space application through the `SIOCSIWSCAN` ioctl.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing input validation:** The `cfg80211_wext_siwscan()` function receives a number of channels (`wreq->num_channels`) from user space without validating if it exceeds the maximum allowed (`IW_MAX_FREQUENCIES`).
- **Potential memory corruption:** If `wreq->num_channels` is greater than `IW_MAX_FREQUENCIES`, the function calculates an invalid value for `n_channels`. This can potentially lead to an allocation of insufficient memory via `kzalloc`, causing a buffer overflow or memory corruption when the allocated memory is used later in the code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious user-space application could pass an excessively large number of channels, triggering a buffer overflow or memory corruption in the kernel. This could lead to:
- Kernel crash (Denial of Service)
- Potential arbitrary code execution in kernel mode

**Attack vectors:**
- A user-space process making a `SIOCSIWSCAN` ioctl call with a crafted `iw_scan_req` structure containing a large `num_channels` value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute code in user-space.
- A vulnerable wireless driver/hardware needs to be present.
- No special privileges needed to trigger the vulnerability.

The provided diffs show the fix, which adds a check to verify if `wreq->num_channels` is greater than `IW_MAX_FREQUENCIES` and return `-EINVAL` if it is, thus preventing the overflow.
