CVE-2024-48200 Advisory

 [Raw](/ahmedsherif/ad56cd3a9ef86cdc05175fb591804c64/raw/77ff01dbc1755d1b8abd2259e88ec9706d45f82b/CVE-2024-48200.md)

[**CVE-2024-48200.md**](#file-cve-2024-48200-md)

## **ID**: CVE-2024-48200

**Description** An issue in MobaXterm v.24.2 allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code via the function of the MobaXterm MSI, which spawns an Administrative cmd (conhost.exe).

---

**Vulnerability Type**

Local Privilege Escalation (LPE)

---

**Author**

Ahmed Sherif (<https://xphantom.nl>)

---

**Vendor of Product**

<https://www.mobatek.net/>

---

**Affected Product Code Base**

MobaXterm - v24.2

---

**Affected Component**

The MSI installer of MobaXterm v24.2 (`MobaXterm_installer_24.2.msi`)

---

**Attack Type**

Local

---

**Impact Code Execution**

true

---

**Impact Escalation of Privileges**

true

---

**Attack Vectors**

An attacker could carry out a TOCTOU attack by locking files that the MobaXterm MSI installer attempts to modify/delete. This causes the `conhost.exe` privileged window to hang, allowing the attacker to exploit the situation. By enabling legacy mode, they can open a new `cmd.exe` instance with 'NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM' privileges and execute commands.
