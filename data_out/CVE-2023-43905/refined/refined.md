Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause:** Incorrect access control in Writer CMS v1.1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control mechanisms. This allows unauthorized users to access sensitive information.
