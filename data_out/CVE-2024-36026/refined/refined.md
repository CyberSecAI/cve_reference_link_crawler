Based on the provided information, all of the content relates to the same vulnerability and provides more details than a placeholder CVE description.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is an invalid state that the Graphics Controller (GC), Radio Link Controller (RLC), and Power Management Firmware (PMFW) enter during multiple S4 (suspend to RAM) stress tests. This leads to hard hangs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The system enters an invalid state during S4 transitions, leading to a hang.
- The power management sequence for the AMD GPU on SMU v13.0.4/11 does not handle S4 transitions correctly under stress.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- System hangs, requiring a hard reboot.
- Loss of system availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Triggering multiple S4 suspend/resume cycles.
- This is not an attack vector from an external user, but rather an internal bug within the power management.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No specific attacker capabilities or position are required. The issue is triggered by normal system operation involving multiple suspend/resume cycles.
- An attacker might be able to trigger this via repeatedly sending the system to sleep and then waking it up, which is a low bar.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves adding a GFX reset as a workaround just before sending the `MP1_UNLOAD` message during the S4 transition to prevent the invalid state.
- The vulnerability affects AMD GPUs using SMU v13.0.4/11.
- The fix is implemented in the `smu_v13_0_4_ppt.c` driver file.
- The changes involve inserting a call to `smu_cmn_send_smc_msg_with_param` to send a `SMU_MSG_GfxDeviceDriverReset` message with `SMU_RESET_MODE_2` before sending the `SMU_MSG_PrepareMp1ForUnload` message, when the system is not in s0ix state and going to suspend.
