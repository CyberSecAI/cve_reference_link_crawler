# [HCSEC-2022-05 - Consul Ingress Gateway Panic Can Shutdown Servers](/t/hcsec-2022-05-consul-ingress-gateway-panic-can-shutdown-servers/35739)

**Bulletin ID:** HCSEC-2022-05

**Affected Products / Versions:** Consul and Consul Enterprise 1.8.0 through 1.9.14, 1.10.7, and 1.11.2; fixed in 1.9.15, 1.10.8, and 1.11.3.

**Publication Date:** February 15, 2022

**Summary**

Consul and Consul Enterprise (“Consul”) clusters with at least one Ingress Gateway allow a user with `service:write` permissions to register a specifically-defined service that will cause the Consul server to panic. This vulnerability, CVE-2022-24687, was fixed in Consul 1.9.15, 1.10.8, and 1.11.3.

**Background**

Consul may be configured to provide [Ingress Gateways](https://www.consul.io/docs/connect/gateways/ingress-gateway), enabling connectivity within your organizational network from services outside the Consul service mesh to services in the mesh. An ingress gateway is a type of proxy and must be registered as a service in Consul, with the kind set to `ingress-gateway`.

**Details**

It was reported that clusters with at least one ingress gateway configured may allow a user with `service:write` permission to register a specifically-defined service that can cause the Consul server to panic and shutdown.

**Remediation**

Customers should evaluate the risk associated with this issue and consider upgrading to Consul or Consul Enterprise 1.9.15, 1.10.8, and 1.11.3, or newer. Please refer to [Upgrading Consul](https://www.consul.io/docs/upgrading) for general guidance and version-specific upgrade notes.

**Acknowledgement**

This issue was identified by an external party who reported it to HashiCorp.

*We deeply appreciate any effort to coordinate disclosure of security vulnerabilities. For information about security at HashiCorp and the reporting of security vulnerabilities, please see [Security at HashiCorp](https://hashicorp.com/security).*
