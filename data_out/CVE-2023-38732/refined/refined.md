- **Root cause of vulnerability:** In specific error conditions, a login ID may be logged to the application log un-obfuscated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive information (login IDs) in application logs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized disclosure of user login IDs, potentially leading to further compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially gain access to the logs through some means. The attack vector described is not through direct interaction with the application but through the logs it creates.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need access to the application logs where the sensitive information is exposed.
