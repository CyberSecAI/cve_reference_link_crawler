- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A relative path traversal vulnerability exists in FortiClient for Windows.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Relative path traversal (CWE-23).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local, unprivileged attacker can escalate their privileges to SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via a named pipe responsible for the FortiESNAC service. This implies the attacker needs local access to the machine where FortiClient is running.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access to the machine is required, but no elevated privileges are initially needed.
