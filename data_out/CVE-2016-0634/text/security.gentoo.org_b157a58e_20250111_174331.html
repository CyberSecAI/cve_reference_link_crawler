# Bash: Arbitrary code execution — GLSA **201612-39**

A vulnerability in Bash could potentially lead to arbitrary code
execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-shells/bash** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.3\_p46-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.3\_p46-r1** |

### Background

Bash is the standard GNU Bourne Again SHell.

### Description

A vulnerability was found in the way Bash expands $HOSTNAME. Injecting
malicious code into $HOSTNAME could cause it to run each time Bash
expands \h in the prompt string.

### Impact

A remote attacker controlling the system’s hostname (i.e. via DHCP)
could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process,
or cause a Denial of
Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Bash users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-shells/bash-4.3_p46-r1"

```
