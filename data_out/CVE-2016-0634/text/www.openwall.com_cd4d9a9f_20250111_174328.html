Subject: CVE-2016-0634 -- bash prompt expanding $HOSTNAME

Hello All,

A little while ago, one of our users discovered that by setting the
hostname to $(something unpleasant), bash would run "something
unpleasant" when it expanded \h in the prompt string.

We informed Chet (cc'd) and this has been fixed in the recently
announced bash-4.4.

I believe the fix in parse.y is this (Chet, please correct me if I'm wrong):

I appreciate that it's relatively difficult to set the hostname to a
string of your choosing but there are plenty of helpful agents that will
call sethostname(2) on your behalf.
