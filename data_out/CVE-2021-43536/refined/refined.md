Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-43536:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in how Firefox and Thunderbird handle navigations initiated while an asynchronous function is executing. Under specific circumstances, the navigation could fail, but the target URL would be exposed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **URL Leakage:** The primary weakness is the leakage of the target URL. Even if the navigation fails, the application still reveals the destination URL, which can expose sensitive information about the user's intended action.
-   **State Management:** The issue is connected to the state of the docshell, which is left in an odd state due to an early return in a navigation method if the ContentViewer initialization fails.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Information Disclosure:** The leaked URL could contain sensitive data.
-  **Redirect Exposure:** The vulnerability could expose redirects cross-origin, allowing an attacker to potentially understand the user's browsing history or intentions

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The vulnerability is triggered through a combination of asynchronous functions and navigation requests. 
-   An attacker would need to craft a page that executes JavaScript which initiates an asynchronous operation that attempts a navigation request, causing a leakage of the target URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   An attacker would need to have the ability to execute Javascript on a user's browser. This could be achieved by enticing the user to visit a malicious website or by injecting malicious script through other means

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**
-   The vulnerability occurs due to an early return in `nsGlobalWindowOuter.cpp`, which leads to the docshell being in an inconsistent state.
-   The fix involves ensuring that the `ContentViewer` is properly closed even when its initialization fails, preventing the URL leakage.
-   The vulnerability was present in Firefox and Thunderbird.
-   The vulnerability can lead to a SOP (Same Origin Policy) bypass and the exposure of the redirection target
-   A race condition is present when navigating and the application doesn't correctly close the ContentViewer, leading to the exposure of the target URL

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability was reported by Sunwoo Kim and Youngmin Kim of SNU CompSec Lab.
- This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-43536
- The fix for this vulnerability has been included in Firefox 95, Firefox ESR 91.4, and Thunderbird 91.4.
