Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-33976:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a missing shape validation in the `array_ops.upper_bound` and `array_ops.lower_bound` functions in TensorFlow.
- The shape function in `array_ops.cc` for these operations requires the input argument "values" to have a rank of 2 (matrix). However, this validation is bypassed when switching between graph and eager execution modes. This allows an argument with an invalid rank to be passed through, leading to a segfault.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper input validation for the "values" argument in the `UpperBoundOp` and `LowerBoundOp` kernels when switching between graph and eager modes. The shape of the input tensor was not being properly checked, which allowed tensors with an incorrect rank to be passed.
- **Mode Switching Bypass:** The intended shape validation present in `array_ops.cc` is bypassed when switching between graph and eager modes. This created a situation where the kernels did not receive the input they were expecting and therefore crashed when trying to process it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a segmentation fault (segfault), which causes the program to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves providing `array_ops.upper_bound` or `array_ops.lower_bound` with an input tensor for the `values` argument that does not have a rank of 2. This could be triggered in either graph or eager mode if the validation is bypassed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs the ability to provide the inputs to the vulnerable TensorFlow operations, specifically `array_ops.upper_bound` and `array_ops.lower_bound`. This implies the attacker has control over how those functions are called in the application using the library.

**Additional Information:**

- The fix involves adding explicit checks in `searchsorted_op.cc` to ensure that the `values` tensor has a rank of 2, replicating the shape requirement from `array_ops.cc`.
- The fix also includes new tests in `array_ops_test.py` to catch cases where inputs with the wrong rank are used, raising an appropriate exception rather than crashing.
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions before 2.13.0. The fix is included in 2.13.0 and was also backported to 2.12.0.
- The provided commit details (`6fa05df43b00038b048f4f0e51ef522da6532fec` and `915884fdf5df34aaedd00fc6ace33a2cfdefa586`) show the changes made to address this issue.
- The security advisory (GHSA-gjh7-xx4r-x345) confirms the vulnerability, affected versions, and fix details. It also mentions that the vulnerability was reported by dmc1778.
