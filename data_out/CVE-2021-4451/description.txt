The NinjaFirewall plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authenticated PHAR Deserialization in versions up to, and including, 4.3.3. This allows authenticated attackers to perform phar deserialization on the server.  This deserialization can allow other plugin or theme exploits if vulnerable software is present (WordPress, and NinjaFirewall).
