Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-4451:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an authenticated Phar deserialization issue within the NinjaFirewall WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin uses filesystem functions (`file_exists`, `is_readable`) on user-provided input, which can trigger the deserialization of a malicious phar archive if a `phar://` wrapper is provided as input, leading to code execution. This occurs because these functions can trigger the unserialization of Phar's metadata if the input path starts with a "phar://" wrapper.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Phar Deserialization:** The core weakness is the plugin's vulnerability to PHP's Phar deserialization mechanism when handling filesystem functions with potentially malicious `phar://` wrappers. This allows an attacker to control the unserialization process.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** While the plugin attempts to validate the input path using `file_exists` and `is_readable`, these functions inadvertently trigger the vulnerability when a `phar://` wrapper is provided.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:**  By crafting a malicious phar archive and exploiting the deserialization vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This is possible if there is a vulnerable POP chain in another theme or plugin installed on the blog.
- **Complete System Compromise:**  Successful exploitation can lead to complete control over the affected WordPress site, including data exfiltration, defacement, and further attacks on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Phar Archive:** The attacker must first create and upload a malicious phar archive to the WordPress server.
- **File Check Input Field:**  The attacker then needs to, as an administrator, use NinjaFirewall's File Check and enter the path to the malicious phar archive in an input field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Administrator Access:** The attacker must have administrator-level access to the WordPress dashboard, including the `manage_options` and `unfiltered_html` capabilities, be in the NinjaFirewall whitelist, and any restriction lists implemented.
- **Vulnerable POP Chain:** There must exist a vulnerable POP chain in another theme or plugin, because neither WordPress nor NinjaFirewall themselves are vulnerable.
- **PHP Version:** The target server must be running an older, unsupported version of PHP < 8.0 as this vulnerability was fixed in php 8.0 and later.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is not directly within WordPress or NinjaFirewall's core code but is triggered when the plugin processes a specially crafted input with a `phar://` wrapper.
- NinjaFirewall has a built-in policy to protect against phar wrappers, but it doesn't apply to whitelisted admin users.
- The blog post from NinTechNet provides more technical detail and a clear explanation of how the vulnerability is triggered with the usage of phar wrappers and filesystem functions.

In summary, CVE-2021-4451 describes a critical vulnerability that could allow a privileged attacker to achieve remote code execution on a vulnerable WordPress site if all preconditions are met.
