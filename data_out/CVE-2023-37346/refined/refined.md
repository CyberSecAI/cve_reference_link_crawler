{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the parsing of TIF files, specifically due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data during TIF file parsing.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a malicious TIF file or visiting a malicious page that leads to processing a malicious TIF file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious TIF file to the user. The user must then open the malicious TIF file using the vulnerable software, or visit a malicious page that triggers the parsing of the malicious TIF file. No special privileges are required as it can be exploited with user interaction."
