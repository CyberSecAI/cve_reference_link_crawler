To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid *Administrator* privileges on an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to *root*.  There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
