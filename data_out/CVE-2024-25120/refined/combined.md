[TYPO3 CMS](/help/security-advisories/typo3-cms "TYPO3 CMS")

Created by Oliver Hader

It has been discovered that TYPO3 CMS is susceptible to information disclosure.

* **Component Type:** TYPO3 CMS
* **Subcomponent:** Link Handler (ext:core, ext:backend, ext:filelist)
* **Release Date:** February 13, 2024
* **Vulnerability Type:** Information Disclosure
* **Affected Versions:** 8.0.0-8.7.56, 9.0.0-9.5.45, 10.0.0-10.4.42, 11.0.0-11.5.34, 12.0.0-12.4.10, 13.0.0
* **Severity:** Medium
* **Suggested CVSS:** CVSS:3.1/[AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)
* **References:** [CVE-2024-25120](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25120), [CWE-200](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html), [CWE-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

### Problem Description

The TYPO3-specific [t3:// URI scheme](https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-typoscript/main/en-us/Functions/Typolink.html#resource-references) could be used to access resources outside of the users' permission scope. This encompassed files, folders, pages, and records (although only if a valid link-handling configuration was provided). Exploiting this vulnerability requires a valid backend user account.

### Solution

Update to TYPO3 versions 8.7.57 ELTS, 9.5.46 ELTS, 10.4.43 ELTS, 11.5.35 LTS, 12.4.11 LTS, 13.0.1 that fix the problem described.

### Credits

Thanks to Richie Lee who reported this issue and to TYPO3 core & security team member Benjamin Franzke who fixed the issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# typolink

Wraps the incoming value in a link with an HTML 'a' tag.

If you do not want to have the HTML 'a' tag around the link, then you
must set the property by `returnLast = url` or
`$lconf['returnLast'] = 'url'`.

Attention

If typolink is used from `parseFunc` the `$cObj->parameters` array is
loaded with the lowercase link parameters!

## Properties

### extTarget

### extTarget

`extTarget`

Type
string / [stdWrap](Stdwrap.html#stdwrap)

Default
"" (no target set)

Target used for external links

### fileTarget

### fileTarget

`fileTarget`

Type
string / [stdWrap](Stdwrap.html#stdwrap)

Target used for file links

### language

### language

`language`

Type
[integer](../Syntax/StringFormats/Index.html#data-type-integer)

Language uid for link target

Omitting the parameter `language` will use the current language.

Example
```
page.10 = TEXT
page.10.value = Link to the page with the ID 23 in the current language
page.10.typolink.parameter = 23

page.20 = TEXT
page.20.value = Link to the page with the ID 23 in the language 3
page.20.typolink.parameter = 23
page.20.typolink.language = 3
```

Copied!

### target

### target

`target`

Type
string / [stdWrap](Stdwrap.html#stdwrap)

Target used for internal links

### no\_cache

### no\_cache

`no_cache`

Type
[boolean](../Syntax/StringFormats/Index.html#data-type-boolean) / [stdWrap](Stdwrap.html#stdwrap)

Adds `&no_cache=1` to the link

### additionalParams

### additionalParams

`additionalParams`

Type
[string](../Syntax/StringFormats/Index.html#data-type-string) / [stdWrap](Stdwrap.html#stdwrap)

This is parameters that are added to the end of the URL. This must be
code ready to insert after the last parameter.

Example
EXT:site\_package/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript
```
page.10.typolink.additionalParams = '&print=1'
page.20.typolink.additionalParams = '&sword_list[]=word1&sword_list[]=word2'
```

Copied!

Applications

This is very useful â for example â when linking to pages from a
search result. The search words are stored in the register-key
SWORD\_PARAMS and can be insert directly like this:

EXT:site\_package/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript
```
page.20.typolink.additionalParams.data = register:SWORD_PARAMS
```

Copied!

Note

additionalParams are only considered for internal links.

### addQueryString

### addQueryString

`addQueryString`

Type
[boolean](../Syntax/StringFormats/Index.html#data-type-boolean) / [string](../Syntax/StringFormats/Index.html#data-type-string)

Add the current query string to the start of the link.

Note

This option does not check for any duplicate parameters. This is not a
problem: Only the last parameter of the same name will be applied.

Possible values:

`0`
No query parameters are added.
`1`
Only query parameters resolved by
[route enhancers](https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/main/en-us/ApiOverview/Routing/AdvancedRoutingConfiguration.html#routing-advanced-routing-configuration-enhancers)
are added, any other query arguments are rejected. This way, additional
query arguments are never added by default. This is the recommended
behaviour.

`untrusted`

> Any given query parameters of the current request are added.

Example
```
# Pass resolved query parameters to the link
typolink.addQueryString = 1

# Pass all query parameters to the link
typolink.addQueryString = untrusted
```

Copied!

#### addQueryString.exclude

### addQueryString.exclude

`addQueryString.exclude`

Type
[string](../Syntax/StringFormats/Index.html#data-type-string)

List of query arguments to exclude from the link. Typical examples are
`L` or `cHash`.

Attention

This property should not be used for cached contents without a valid
cHash. Otherwise the page is cached for the first set of parameters
and subsequently taken from the cache no matter what parameters
are given. Additionally the security risk of cache poisoning has to
be considered.

Example
```
# Remove parameter "gclid" from query string
typolink.addQueryString.exclude = gclid
```

Copied!

### wrap

### wrap

`wrap`

Type
[Wrap](Wrap.html#data-type-wrap) / [stdWrap](Stdwrap.html#stdwrap)

Wraps the links.

### ATagBeforeWrap

### ATagBeforeWrap

`ATagBeforeWrap`

Type
[boolean](../Syntax/StringFormats/Index.html#data-type-boolean)

Default
0

If set, the link is first wrapped with `wrap` and then the
<A>-tag.

### parameter

### parameter

`parameter`

Type
[string](../Syntax/StringFormats/Index.html#data-type-string) / [stdWrap](Stdwrap.html#stdwrap)

This is the main data that is used for creating the link. It can be
the id of a page, the URL of some external page, an email address or
a reference to a file on the server. On top of this there can be
additional information for specifying a target, a class and a title.
Below are a few examples followed by full explanations.

Examples

1. Most simple. Will create a link to page 51 (if this is not default language,
   the correct target language will be resolved from the parameter):

   EXT:site\_package/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript
   ```
   page.10.typolink.parameter = t3://page?uid=51
   ```

   Copied!
2. A full example. A link to the *current* page that will open in a new window.
   The link will have a class attribute with value "specialLink" and a
   title attribute reading "Very important information":

   EXT:site\_package/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript
   ```
   page.10.typolink.parameter = t3://page?uid=current _blank specialLink "Very important information"
   ```

   Copied!

   which is converted to a link like this:

   Example output
   ```
   <a href="?id=51" target="_blank" class="specialLink" title="Very important information">
   ```

   Copied!
3. An external link with a class attribute. Note the dash (-) that
   replaces the second value (the target). This makes it possible to
   define a class (third value) without having to define a target:

   EXT:site\_package/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript
   ```
   page.10.typolink.parameter = https://example.com/ - specialLink
   ```

   Copied!
4. A mailto link with a title attribute (but no target and no class):

   EXT:site\_package/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript
   ```
   page.10.typolink.parameter = mailto:info@example.org - - "Send a mail to main TYPO3 contact"
   ```

   Copied!

As you can see from the examples, each significant part of the
parameter string is separated by a space. Values that can themselves
contain spaces must be enclosed in double quotes. Each of these values
are described in more detail below.

Link targets that are external or contain `_blank` will be added
`rel="noreferrer"` automatically.

Resource reference

1. The link

   The first value is the destination of the link. It may start with:

   * `t3://`: internal TYPO3 resource references.
     See [Resource references](#resource-references) for an in depth explanation on the
     syntax of these references.
   * `http(s)://`: regular external links
   * `mailto:info@example.org`: regular mailto links

   It's also possible to direct the typolink to use a custom function (a
   "link handler") to build the link. This is described in more detail
   below.
2. Target or popup settings

   Targets are normally as described above (extTarget, fileTarget,
   target). But it is possible to override them by explicitly defining
   a target in the parameter property. It's possible to use a dash (-)
   to skip this value when one wants to define a third or fourth
   value, but no target.

   Instead of a target, this second value can be used to define the
   parameters of a JavaScript popup window into which the link will be
   opened (using window.open). The height and width of the window can be
   defined, as well as additional parameters to be passed to the
   JavaScript function. Also see property "Jswindow".

   Examples

   Open page 51 in a popup window measuring 400 by 300 pixels:

   EXT:site\_package/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript
   ```
   typolink.parameter = 51 400x300
   ```

   Copied!

   Open page 51 in a popup window measuring 400 by 300 pixels. Do
   not make the window resizable and show the location bar:

   EXT:site\_package/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript
   ```
   typolink.parameter = 51 400x300:resizable=0,location=1
   ```

   Copied!
3. Class

   The third value can be used to define a class name for the link tag.
   This class is inserted in the tag before any other value from the
   "ATagParams" property. Beware of conflicting class attributes. It's
   possible to use a dash (-) to skip this value when one wants to define
   a fourth value, but no class (see examples above).
4. Title

   The standard way of defining the title attribute of the link would
   be to use the `title` property or even the `ATagParams`
   property. However it can also be set in this fourth value, in which
   case it will override the other settings. Note that the title
   should be wrapped in double quotes (") if it contains blanks.

   Attention

   When used from `parseFunc`, the value should not
   be defined explicitly, but imported like this:

   EXT:site\_package/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript
   ```
   typolink.parameter.data = parameters : allParams
   ```

### forceAbsoluteUrl

### forceAbsoluteUrl

`forceAbsoluteUrl`

Type
[boolean](../Syntax/StringFormats/Index.html#data-type-boolean)

Default
`false`

Forces links to internal pages to be absolute, thus having a proper
URL scheme and domain prepended.

Additional sub-property: [forceAbsoluteUrl.scheme](#typolink-forceAbsoluteUrl-scheme)

Note

If the option [config.forceAbsoluteUrls](../TopLevelObjects/Config.html#setup-config-forceAbsoluteUrls)
is enabled, [forceAbsoluteUrl.scheme](#typolink-forceAbsoluteUrl-scheme) is overridden.

#### forceAbsoluteUrl.scheme

### forceAbsoluteUrl.scheme

`forceAbsoluteUrl.scheme`

Type
[string](../Syntax/StringFormats/Index.html#data-type-string)

Values

`http` / `https`

Default

`http`

Defines the URL scheme to be used (https or http). http is the
default value. Example:

EXT:site\_package/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript
```
typolink {
   parameter = 13
   forceAbsoluteUrl = 1
   forceAbsoluteUrl.scheme = https
}
```

Copied!

### title

### title

`title`

Type
[string](../Syntax/StringFormats/Index.html#data-type-string) / [stdWrap](Stdwrap.html#stdwrap)

Sets the title parameter of the A-tag.

### JSwindow\_params

### JSwindow\_params

`JSwindow_params`

Type
[string](../Syntax/StringFormats/Index.html#data-type-string)

Preset values for opening the window. This example lists almost all
possible attributes:

EXT:site\_package/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript
```
page.10.typolink.JSwindow_params = status=1,menubar=1,scrollbars=1,resizable=1,location=1,directories=1,toolbar=1
```

Copied!

### returnLast

### returnLast

`returnLast`

Type
[string](../Syntax/StringFormats/Index.html#data-type-string)

If set to "url", then it will return the URL of the link
(`$this->lastTypoLinkUrl`).

If set to `target`, it will return the target of the link.

So, in these two cases you will not get the value wrapped but the URL
or target value returned!

If set to `result`, it will return the json\_encoded output of the
internal `LinkResult` object.

```
{
    "href": "/my-page",
    "target": null,
    "class": null,
    "title": null,
    "linkText": "My page",
    "additionalAttributes": []
}
```

Copied!

### section

### section

`section`

Type
[string](../Syntax/StringFormats/Index.html#data-type-string) / [stdWrap](Stdwrap.html#stdwrap)

If this value is present, it's prepended with a "#" and placed after
any internal URL to another page in TYPO3.

This is used create a link, which jumps from one page directly the
section on another page.

### ATagParams

### ATagParams

`ATagParams`

Type
<A>-params / [stdWrap](Stdwrap.html#stdwrap)

Additional parameters

Example
EXT:site\_package/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript
```
page.10.typolink.ATagParams = class="board"
```

Copied!

### linkAccessRestrictedPages

### linkAccessRestrictedPages

`linkAccessRestrictedPages`

Type
[boolean](../Syntax/StringFormats/Index.html#data-type-boolean)

If set, typolinks pointing to access restricted pages will still link
to the page even though the page cannot be accessed.

### userFunc

### userFunc

`userFunc`

Type
[function name](../Syntax/StringFormats/Index.html#data-type-function-name)

All of the `typolink` TypoScript configuration will be parsed and evaluated
by the TYPO3 Core's `LinkFactory->create()` method, and then passed on
to the defined `userFunc` for further manipulation. The `userFunc` needs to
return an object implementing the `LinkResultInterface`. The currently calculated
typolink is passed as an argument to the `userFunc` as an object of the same type. This allows
to return either an enriched link, or a completely new one.

The detailed execution steps are:

First, the `typolink` will be created as configured by the specified TypoScript.
This will result in an object of Type `LinkResultInterface`. This immutable object receives
all of the TypoScript `typolink` configuration as properties, and makes them
available via corresponding getters. Then your custom `userFunc` is executed
and receives the following arguments (delivered via `$contentObjectRenderer->callUserFunction()`):

`$content`

This contains the object implementing `LinkResultInterface`. Inside your `userFunc()` you
can call for example:

* `$content->getUrl()` to get the URL of a link,
* `$content->getLinkText()` to get the text of your link
  (everything with the `<a>...</a>` tag),
* `$content->getLinkConfiguration()` for the array with all typolink configuration options,
* `$content->getAttributes()` returns current anchor link attributes (like `typolink.additionalArguments`),
* `$content->getType()` returns the kind of link that is operated on, like
  `LinkService::TYPE_PAGE` (specific pages in your TYPO3 setup) or `LinkService::TYPE_URL`
  for links to external pages.

See the PHP definition of `LinkResultInterface` for the full list of getters.

Since `LinkResultInterface` is an immutable object, you must use the methods `withLinkText()`
and/or `withAttributes()` to create a new object variant, which at the end of your
`userFunc` must be returned (see below for examples). In case you do not make any
changes to the object, the function must return the original object.

`$conf`
Contains an array of the TypoScript configuration of your `userFunc` parameters.
`$request`
Contains the PSR-7 request object that allows you to operate on your current frontend
environment and retrieve things like Site Settings, current Language, current URL,
related `ContentObjectRenderer` (`$cObj`) and other aspects,
see [TYPO3 request object](https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/main/en-us/ApiOverview/RequestLifeCycle/Typo3Request.html#typo3-request).

See [Examples for typolink.userFunc](_Examples/Typolink-Example.html#typolink-userfunc-examples) for more details.

## Resource references

TYPO3 supports a modern and future-proof way of referencing resources using an
extensible and expressive syntax.

In order to understand the syntax, we will guide you through using a simple
page link.

`t3://page?uid=13&campaignCode=ABC123`

The syntax consists of three main parts, much like parts on an URL:

Syntax Namespace (`t3://`)
The namespace is set to `t3://` to ensure the `LinkService` should be called
to parse the URL. This value is fixed and mandatory.
Resource handler key (`page`)

The resource handler key is a list of available handlers that TYPO3 can work
with. At the time of writing these handlers are:

* [page](#typolink-handler-page)
* [file](#typolink-handler-file)
* [folder](#typolink-handler-folder)
* [url](#typolink-handler-url)
* [email](#typolink-handler-email)
* [record](#typolink-handler-record) (see `[\TYPO3\CMS\Core\LinkHandling\RecordLinkHandler](https://api.typo3.org/main/classes/TYPO3-CMS-Core-LinkHandling-RecordLinkHandler.html)` )
* [phone](#typolink-handler-phone) (see `[\TYPO3\CMS\Core\LinkHandling\TelephoneLinkHandler](https://api.typo3.org/main/classes/TYPO3-CMS-Core-LinkHandling-TelephoneLinkHandler.html)` )

More keys can be added via `[$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['linkHandler']](https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/main/en-us/Configuration/Typo3ConfVars/Index.html)`  in
an associative array where the key is the handler key and the value is a
class implementing the LinkHandlerInterface.

Resource parameters (`?uid=13&campaignCode=ABC123`)
These are the specific identification parameters that are used by any
handler. Note that these may carry additional parameters in order to
configure the behavior of any handler.
