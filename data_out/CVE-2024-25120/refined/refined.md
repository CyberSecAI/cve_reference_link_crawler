Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-25120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper access control within the TYPO3 CMS when handling the `t3://` URI scheme. This scheme is used for referencing internal resources like files, folders, pages, and records. The core issue is that the system doesn't properly enforce permissions when resolving these `t3://` URIs, allowing users to potentially access resources they shouldn't have access to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper permission checks when resolving `t3://` URIs. This allows a logged-in backend user to potentially bypass access restrictions.
*   **Information Disclosure:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could gain access to information they are not authorized to see. This could include files, folders, pages, or records that should be restricted to other users or roles.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit allows an attacker with a valid backend user account to access resources (files, folders, pages, records) they are not authorized to view. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the manipulation of the `t3://` URI scheme within the TYPO3 CMS.
*   A valid backend user account is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a valid backend user account within the affected TYPO3 instance.
*   The attacker must be able to manipulate or craft `t3://` URIs to target specific resources they wish to access.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `t3://` URI scheme is a TYPO3-specific mechanism for referencing internal resources.
*   The vulnerability affects the link handling mechanism in the TYPO3 core, backend, and file list extensions.
*   The vulnerability is related to how TYPO3 resolves resource references within the `t3://` URI scheme using the `LinkService`.

**Affected Versions:**

*   TYPO3 versions 8.0.0-8.7.56
*   TYPO3 versions 9.0.0-9.5.45
*   TYPO3 versions 10.0.0-10.4.42
*   TYPO3 versions 11.0.0-11.5.34
*   TYPO3 versions 12.0.0-12.4.10
*   TYPO3 versions 13.0.0

**Patched Versions:**

*   TYPO3 8.7.57 ELTS
*   TYPO3 9.5.46 ELTS
*   TYPO3 10.4.43 ELTS
*   TYPO3 11.5.35 LTS
*   TYPO3 12.4.11 LTS
*   TYPO3 13.0.1

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is categorized as "Medium" severity.
*   The CVSS score is 4.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
*   The vulnerability is related to CWE-200 (Information Exposure) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).
*   The fix involves updating to the patched versions mentioned above.
