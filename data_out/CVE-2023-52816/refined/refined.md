Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-52816

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds shift operation within the `svm_range_apply_attrs` function in the `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdkfd/kfd_svm.c` file of the Linux kernel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `prange->granularity` was directly assigned a value from the `attrs[i].value` without proper bounds checking.
- When `attrs[i].value` was greater than `0x3F` (63), a shift operation with the exponent exceeding the bounds of a 64-bit integer occurred.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The out-of-bounds shift operation triggers a `__ubsan_handle_shift_out_of_bounds` error.
- The system will crash, due to a page fault. The kernel call trace shows that the crash occurs in the `__get_user_8` function.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `KFD_IOCTL_SVM_ATTR_GRANULARITY` ioctl call. An attacker could craft an ioctl with an attribute value that exceeds the maximum permissible value (0x3F), causing a crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to make ioctl calls to the amdgpu driver, which typically requires a local user with appropriate permissions or an application running with sufficient privileges.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet before the fix was: `prange->granularity = attrs[i].value;`
- The fix implemented is: `prange->granularity = min_t(uint32_t, attrs[i].value, 0x3F);`. This ensures the granularity value is capped at `0x3F`.
- The code change restricts the value of `prange->granularity` to a maximum value of 63, preventing the shift out-of-bounds.
- The `min_t` macro selects the smallest of the provided values.
- The fix addresses a shift exponent out-of-bounds issue as shown in the kernel logs: `shift exponent 255 is too large for 64-bit type 'long unsigned int'`.
