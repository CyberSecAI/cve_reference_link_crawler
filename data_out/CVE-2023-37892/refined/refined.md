- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Shortcode IMDB WordPress plugin lacks proper CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact will vary on a case by case basis but is described as "low severity impact".
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to trick a higher-privileged user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website while the user is authenticated to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to authenticate. The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user of the targeted website to perform actions through a malicious link or website.
