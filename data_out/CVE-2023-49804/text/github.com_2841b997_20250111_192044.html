## Description

Warning

As is written in our [**security policy**](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/policy), please **DON'T REPORT SECURITY ISSUES TO OUR PUBLIC ISSUE TRACKER**

Posting as [an advisory](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/advisories/new) and then create a [`security`-issue without details](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/issues/new?assignees=&labels=help&template=security.md) allows us to privately come up with a securty fix without having to scramble and potentialy miss/break something.

These steps were violated in this case, as the issue was first raised as a `bug`-report in issue #4188 [1](#user-content-fn-1-4feab2c4c6a1cd85a55c29cda1c54a2d)

## Overview:

A moderate security vulnerability has been identified in Uptime Kuma platform that poses a significant threat to the confidentiality and integrity of user accounts.

When a user changes their login password in Uptime Kuma, a previously logged-in user retains access without being logged out.

This behaviour persists consistently, even after system restarts or browser restarts.

This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to user accounts, compromising the security of sensitive information.

The same vulnerability was partially fixed in [GHSA-g9v2-wqcj-j99g](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/advisories/GHSA-g9v2-wqcj-j99g "GHSA-g9v2-wqcj-j99g") but logging existing users out of their accounts was forgotten.

## Impact:

The impact of this vulnerability is moderate, as it enables attackers or unauthorized individuals to maintain access to user accounts even after the account password has been changed. This can lead to unauthorized data access, manipulation, or compromise of user accounts, posing a threat to the integrity and confidentiality of Uptime Kuma.

A better impact-analysis is included in [GHSA-g9v2-wqcj-j99g](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/advisories/GHSA-g9v2-wqcj-j99g "GHSA-g9v2-wqcj-j99g")

## PoC

* Change the password for a user account
* Access the platform using the previously logged-in account without logging out
* Note that access (read-write) remains despite the password change
* Expected behaviour:

  After changing the password for a user account, all previously logged-in sessions should be invalidated, requiring users to log in again with the updated credentials.
* Actual behaviour:

  The system retains sessions and never logs out users unless explicitly done by clicking logout.

## Remediation:

To mitigate the risks associated with this vulnerability, we made the server emit a `refresh` event (clients handle this by reloading) and then disconnecting all clients except the one initiating the password change.

It is recommended to Update Uptime Kuma to `>= 1.23.9`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
