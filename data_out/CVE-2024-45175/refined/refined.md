Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The C-MOR video surveillance system stores sensitive information, such as camera login credentials and FTP server credentials, in cleartext within the file system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker gaining access to the file system can retrieve sensitive login credentials for cameras and the FTP server. This could allow unauthorized access to the video feeds and other potentially sensitive data managed by the surveillance system.

**Attack vectors:**
- File system access through methods like path traversal vulnerabilities (as referenced in SYSS-2024-025).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs some form of file system access, which could be achieved through exploiting other vulnerabilities (e.g., a path traversal vulnerability).

**Additional Details:**
