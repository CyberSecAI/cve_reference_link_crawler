Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-31156

**Description:** The provided content describes a Path Traversal vulnerability in Allied Telesis AT-S115 1.2.0 devices, specifically those running versions prior to 1.00.024 with Boot Loader version 1.00.006.

**Root Cause:** Insufficient security validation and sanitization of user-supplied input file paths within the device's web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to navigate the device's directory structure and access files outside the intended web directory. This is achieved through manipulation of file paths by injecting sequences like `../`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access sensitive system files, potentially leading to the exposure of confidential information.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows bypassing normal access controls.
*   **Potential System Compromise:** Access to sensitive files can lead to further system exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is performed remotely through the device's web interface.
*   **HTTP:**  The exploit is executed using crafted HTTP requests (specifically via `curl`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker must be able to craft HTTP requests, as demonstrated in the provided PoC using `curl`.
*   **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability is exploitable without any prior authentication.

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**
The provided PoC demonstrates the vulnerability by using `curl` to send a request containing a path traversal sequence to access the `/etc/passwd` file:
```
curl --path-as-is http://<target>/../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
```
This confirms that the vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted URL to the web interface of the affected devices.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability exists in Allied Telesis AT-S115 1.2.0 devices running software versions prior to 1.00.024 with Boot Loader version 1.00.006.
* The vulnerability was discovered by the Bit Sentinel Red Team.
* The provided links lead to Allied Telesis' website which includes the release notes mentioning the fix for this vulnerability in version 1.00.024
