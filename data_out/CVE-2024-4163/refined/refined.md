- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Skylab IGX IIoT Gateway limited shell (IGX) has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to read, write, and modify any file in the operating system using the shell's file execution and download functions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The limited shell does not properly restrict file access, allowing arbitrary file manipulation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By exploiting the vulnerability, an attacker can replace the `/etc/passwd` file, creating a new root user entry and gain unrestricted root shell access. This allows full control over the IoT Gateway.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker leverages the file exec and download functions of the limited shell.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs access to the limited shell on the IGX IIoT Gateway.
