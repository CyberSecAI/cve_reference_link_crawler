{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper authentication allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication via a specially crafted direct request when another user has an active session.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper Authentication, Forced Browsing (Direct Request)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass authentication and potentially gain unauthorized access to the device's functionality.",
  "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted direct request to the device when another user has an active session.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the device's web interface, and a valid user must already have an active session."
