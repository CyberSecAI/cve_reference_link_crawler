Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `button` shortcode of the Arconix Shortcodes WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided attributes, allowing for injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These injected scripts will execute whenever a user accesses a page containing the malicious shortcode.
- This could lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, or unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the plugin's `button` shortcode.
- Specifically, the vulnerability lies within the processing of the shortcode attributes like `url`, `title`, `rel`, and potentially others.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least contributor-level access. This is because contributors can create and edit posts which include shortcodes.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Arconix Shortcodes plugin up to and including 2.1.12.
- The fix is included in version 2.1.13, which implements proper sanitization and escaping of shortcode attributes.
- The provided code diff shows the introduction of sanitization functions like `esc_url()`, `sanitize_html_class()`, and `sanitize_text_field()` to the shortcode's attributes in version 2.1.13
- The code diff also shows that the output of the shortcode was modified to use `esc_html()` on the content, and `esc_attr` for attributes.
