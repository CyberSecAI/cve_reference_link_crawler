Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-0954

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied protocols within the `data-eael-wrapper-link` wrapper when editing context. The plugin fails to properly validate the URL, which allows execution of arbitrary web scripts

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into pages by manipulating the 'data-eael-wrapper-link' attribute when editing context.
- This code will execute whenever a user accesses the page, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Website defacement
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by authenticated users with contributor-level permissions or higher.
- Attackers inject malicious code into the `data-eael-wrapper-link` attribute during page editing.
- When a user views the page, the injected code is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least contributor-level access.
- The attacker needs the ability to edit content that uses the vulnerable wrapper.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable code is located within the `wrapper-link.js` file.
- The fix implemented in version 5.9.8 includes a `sanitizeURL` function that validates the URL protocol before using it.
- The allowed protocols are http:, https:, ftp:, ftps:, mailto:, news:, irc:, irc6:, ircs:, gopher:, nntp:, feed:, telnet:, mms:, rtsp:, sms:, svn:, tel:, fax:, xmpp:, webcal:, and urn:.
- The vulnerability affects all versions up to and including 5.9.7 of the Essential Addons for Elementor plugin.
