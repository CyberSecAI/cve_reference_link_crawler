The content discusses a potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the mPDF library.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The mPDF library, when processing HTML content to generate PDFs, fetches external resources (like images) specified in `<img>` tags without any restrictions. This allows an attacker to control the URL being requested by the server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization and URL validation by mPDF when processing user-supplied HTML. The library directly fetches resources from URLs provided within the HTML input, including potentially internal or private network addresses.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially use this vulnerability to:
    - Perform SSRF attacks, allowing them to scan internal networks.
    - Interact with internal services that are not exposed to the outside world.
    - Exploit vulnerabilities in internal servers by sending crafted requests.
    - In the specific case mentioned, the attacker was able to exploit a Struts2 vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL in an `<img>` tag, and exfiltrate data to a remote server.
- **Attack vectors**: The primary attack vector is by injecting HTML code containing `<img>` tags with attacker-controlled URLs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide arbitrary HTML input to a server utilizing the vulnerable mPDF library. They can be positioned remotely if the server processes user-supplied HTML.
