{
  "CVE-2021-1645": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A design issue with the Data Protection API (DP API) in Windows containers caused all containers to use the same key for encryption. This key was also publicly available in the base image layers published by Microsoft.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Use of the same encryption key across different containers.",
      "Exposure of the encryption key through public base images."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Data encrypted using DP API within Windows containers was not secure as it could be decrypted by anyone with access to the base image or other containers using the same image. This leads to potential compromise of sensitive data stored using DP API within containers.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker with access to a container, the base image, or an encrypted blob from a container, could decrypt the data.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need access to the base image or any container utilizing the vulnerable DP API to decrypt data encrypted within other containers based on the same base image. This includes the ability to run a script or program to invoke the DP API to decrypt the data, and understanding of how the DP API was used in the target container."
