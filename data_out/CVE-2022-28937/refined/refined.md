{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow during view change process.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "The view value, which is an int64, can overflow when a malicious node broadcasts a large view change message with view set to int64_max. When other nodes receive this message, they try to switch to the view + 1 which causes an overflow and reset the value to zero.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The system gets stuck and cannot process blocks, resulting in an abnormal consensus. The malicious node can always be the leader.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious node starts first and broadcasts a large viewchange message packet (view = int64_max) to other nodes.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a node within the FISCO BCOS network and needs to be able to send messages to other nodes."
