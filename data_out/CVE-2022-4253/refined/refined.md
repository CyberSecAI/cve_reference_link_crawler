- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly neutralize user-controllable input before placing it into the output, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. Specifically, the `builtin_echo` function within the `customer.php` file is affected.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can affect the integrity of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating an unknown input to the `builtin_echo` function within the `customer.php` file. It is a remote vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to manipulate user-controllable input. The victim must interact with the malicious output.
