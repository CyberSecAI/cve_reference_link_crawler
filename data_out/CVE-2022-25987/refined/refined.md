- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of Unicode encoding in source code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The Intel C++ Compiler Classic is not properly handling unicode encoding.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated user can potentially achieve privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network access and the ability to provide input to the compiler.  User interaction is required.
