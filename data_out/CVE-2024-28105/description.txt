phpMyFAQ is an open source FAQ web application for PHP 8.1+ and MySQL, PostgreSQL and other databases. The category image upload function in phpmyfaq is vulnerable to manipulation of the `Content-type` and `lang` parameters, allowing attackers to upload malicious files with a .php extension, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE) on the system. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.2.6.
