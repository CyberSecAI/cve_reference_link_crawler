- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ActiveMQ integration for Cortex XSOAR and Cortex XSIAM was logging the configured ActiveMQ credentials in cleartext within log bundles.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of ActiveMQ credentials, which could potentially allow unauthorized access to the ActiveMQ system.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based. The vulnerability requires an attacker to obtain access to the log bundles.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to have access to the log bundles where the credentials are exposed. The attack complexity is considered high, and user interaction is passive, meaning that the attacker's access to the log bundle is not directly initiated by user actions.
