Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-9987:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9987

**Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated Time-Based SQL Injection via API

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application's API is vulnerable to SQL injection which can be exploited without authentication. Specifically, a time-based SQL injection is possible, likely exploiting timing differences in query execution to infer information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Unauthenticated access: The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.
*   Time-Based SQL Injection:  The specific type of SQL injection is time-based.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform SQL injection, potentially leading to:
*   Data exfiltration: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database
*   Potential full database compromise: Depending on database privileges, attacker can modify or delete data

**Attack vectors:**
*   API endpoint: The vulnerability is present in the application's API.
*   Network access:  The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable API endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Network access: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application API.
*   No authentication required: The attacker doesn't need any user credentials or prior authentication.

**Additional notes:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 777.3 of Pandora FMS.
*   The vulnerability was published on October 22, 2024.
*   This entry provides more specific information about the vulnerability than the placeholder description in the CVE. It specifies time-based SQL injection and that no authentication is required.
