The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `member_type.php` file of the SLIMS (Senayan Library Management System) software, specifically version 9 Bulian 9.6.1.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the `reborrowLimit` parameter is taken directly from the POST request and injected into SQL queries without any validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection: The vulnerability exists because the application uses unsanitized user input directly in a SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- Lack of prepared statements: The application uses direct string concatenation to build SQL queries instead of prepared statements, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
- Unsafe parsing of input from POST request: The code directly takes the input from `$_POST` array without any sanitization before use.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, read sensitive information, modify data, or even take complete control of the database server.
- In this case, the attacker was able to obtain the database user with the SQL injection.
- The vulnerability can lead to a full database compromise, which allows attackers to control the application completely.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `admin/modules/membership/member_type.php` file.
- The attack vector involves sending a crafted POST request to this file with malicious SQL code injected into the `reborrowLimit` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user (admin or a user with access to the membership type) to access the vulnerable page.
- The attacker needs to be able to capture and modify HTTP requests, which can be done with tools like Burp Suite.
- The attacker needs to have some familiarity with SQL injection techniques, such as using `sqlmap` for automated exploitation.
