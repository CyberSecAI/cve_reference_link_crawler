- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `ParameterVersionJavaSerializationCodec` class, leading to deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, network-based attack. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs network access to the affected service.
