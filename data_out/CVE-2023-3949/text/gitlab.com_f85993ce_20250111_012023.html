## Report

##### Summary

Hello,

I reported similar issue here #1824226 which is fixed few months back and i see similar issue exists at different endpoint too.

`Releases` can be restricted for `Only Project Members` in project settings. This should ensure that no release information is visible outside team members.

However, anyone can see release `Description` in public projects through tags endpoint `/-/tags?format=atom` at `https://gitlab.com/<Namespace>/<projectName>/-/tags?format=atom` even when releases are set as project members only.

##### Steps to reproduce

1.As a project owner, set your project as public with `Releases` as `Only Project Members` at `https://gitlab.com/<NameSpace>/<ProjectName>/edit#js-general-project-settings`.

2.Now create a `Release` at `https://gitlab.com/<NameSpace>/<ProjectName>/-/releases`. Put something important within Description field for eg `THIS_IS_IMPORTANT_RELEASE_DESCRIPTION`.

3.Access the `https://gitlab.com/<NameSpace>/<ProjectName>/-/releases` without authentication but you will get 404 as Release is only visible for Team members.

4.Now visit `https://gitlab.com/<NameSpace>/<ProjectName>/-/tags` but you will see Tags but no release information here too.

5.Now append `?format=atom` to the end of above URL. For eg `https://gitlab.com/<NameSpace>/<ProjectName>/-/tags?format=atom`. In response, you should see Release Description `THIS_IS_IMPORTANT_RELEASE_DESCRIPTION` which you shouldnt!.

##### Examples

You can visit my test project at `https://gitlab.com/groupjulypremium2023/project_july2023/-/tags`. You will see tags but no release information.

Now visit `https://gitlab.com/groupjulypremium2023/project_july2023/-/tags?format=atom` and you should find `Release_1234`  in response which is description of one of my release which you shouldnt see.

##### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Release Description are disclosed in tag atom response endpoint despite release set as project members only.

##### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Release Description should not be visible for unauthenticated users when they are set as only project members

##### Output of checks

This bug happens on GitLab.com `GitLab Enterprise Edition 16.3.0-pre f7d52011546`

Regards,

Ashish
