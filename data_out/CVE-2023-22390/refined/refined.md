- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper buffer restrictions in some Intel(R) Thunderbolt(TM) DCH drivers for Windows.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient validation of buffer sizes leading to potential out-of-bounds access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure via local access
- **Attack vectors**: Local access by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a locally authenticated user.

The vulnerability is present in Intel(R) Thunderbolt(TM) DCH drivers for Windows before version 88. An authenticated user on the system can potentially exploit this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information via local access due to the improper buffer restrictions.
