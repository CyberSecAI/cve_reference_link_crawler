- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Identical SSH keys are included in the OVA image used for installing Brocade SANnav. This means every installation of SANnav from the official OVA image shares the same SSH keys.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Usage of identical SSH keys across different SANnav instances.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack over SSH, decrypt the SSH traffic, and compromise the SANnav system.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack (MITM) targeting SSH traffic to the SANnav server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept SSH traffic between a client and the vulnerable SANnav server (e.g. man-in-the-middle on the network). They also need to be aware of the vulnerability in order to leverage it.
