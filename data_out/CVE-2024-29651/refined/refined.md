The provided content is related to CVE-2024-29651.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unsafe merge method within the `@apidevtools/json-schema-ref-parser` library. The functions `bundle()`, `parse()`, `resolve()`, and `dereference()` pass user-controlled `options` to this unsafe merge function. The merge function recursively copies properties from a source object to a destination object. This allows an attacker to modify properties of any object reachable from the destination object, including the built-in `Object.prototype`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Prototype Pollution: The core vulnerability is that the unsafe merge function can be manipulated to modify the `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` properties, leading to prototype pollution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Modification of object behavior: By polluting the prototype, an attacker can alter the behavior of all objects inheriting from the affected prototype.
-  Denial of Service (DoS):  Prototype pollution can be exploited to cause a denial of service.
-  Remote Code Execution (RCE): Depending on the application logic, prototype pollution could potentially be escalated to remote code execution.
-  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): In certain cases, it could also be used for cross-site scripting attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
-  Specially crafted JSON input: An attacker can provide a malicious JSON object containing `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` properties to the vulnerable functions (`bundle()`, `parse()`, `resolve()`, `dereference()`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the vulnerable functions. This may involve controlling data passed into the application that utilizes the vulnerable package.

**Additional Notes:**
- Affected versions of the package are 11.0.0 and 11.1.0. It is suggested that the vulnerability may exist in older versions as well.
- A Proof of Concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating how an attacker can modify the prototype by injecting a `polluted` property.
- A mitigation is provided: upgrading the package to version 11.2.0 or later.
