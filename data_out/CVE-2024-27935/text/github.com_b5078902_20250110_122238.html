This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

fix(ext/node): simultaneous reads can leak into each other ([#20223](https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/20223))

```
Reported in [#20188](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/20188)

This was caused by re-use of a global buffer `BUF` during simultaneous
async reads.
