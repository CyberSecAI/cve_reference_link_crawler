This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

fix(ext/node): simultaneous reads can leak into each other ([#20223](https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/20223))

```
Reported in [#20188](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/20188)

This was caused by re-use of a global buffer `BUF` during simultaneous
async reads.

| Issue Description When testing two pairs of independent server-socket connections using the provided code, an unexpected data cross-reception issue occurs. The setup involves creating two separate servers, each with their corresponding client socket. The servers receive data from their respective sockets and echo the data back. However, during the test, the data sent by one socket is received by the other socket. This issue leads to incorrect data reception and potential data corruption.  This issue affects any Deno code using node packages that rely on `require(net)`. Example:. having 2 `ioredis.Redis` clients connecting to 2 Redis Servers results in issues since one client might receive data from the other client which does not correspond with the actual redis command being sent, thus it results in unexpected errors. Steps to Reproduce  1. Create a Deno test file named `socket.test.ts` with the provided test code. 2. Run the test using the command: `deno test -A ./socket.test.ts`  Expected Behavior The expected behavior is that each socket should receive the data it sent, without any cross-reception. Specifically:   * Socket1 should send "111-111-111" and receive "111-111-111". * Socket2 should send "222-222-222" and receive "222-222-222".  Actual Behavior After running the test, the issue arises where:   * Socket1 receives "222-222-222" instead of the expected "111-111-111". * Socket2 receives "222-222-222" as expected.  Environment Details ``` // deno --version deno 1.36.1 (release, x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)                             v8 11.6.189.12                                                              typescript 5.1.6   ``` Test Code ``` // socket.test.ts import { assertEquals } from "https://deno.land/std@0.198.0/assert/assert_equals.ts"; import net_1 from "node:net";  function setupServerSocketPair(port: number): {     socket: net_1.Socket,     res: string[] } {     const server = Deno.listen({ port, transport: "tcp" });     const socket = net_1.createConnection({ port });     const res: string[] = [];      (async () => {         for await (const conn of server) {             conn.readable.pipeTo(conn.writable);         }     })();      socket.on("data", (data: Uint8Array) => {         res.push(new TextDecoder().decode(data));     });      return {         socket,         res     }; }  Deno.test({     name: "Multiple Sockets should get correct server data",     sanitizeResources: false,     sanitizeOps: false, }, async () => {     const setup1 = setupServerSocketPair(10001);     const setup2 = setupServerSocketPair(20002);      assertEquals(setup1.socket.write("111-111-111"), true);     assertEquals(setup2.socket.write("222-222-222"), true);      // hacky way to wait for socket to receive the data back     await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 200));      console.log({ res1: setup1.res, res2: setup2.res });      assertEquals(setup1.res, [ "111-111-111" ]); // This fails !!!  Actual / Expected "222-222-222"/ "111-111-111"     assertEquals(setup2.res, [ "222-222-222" ]); }); ``` |

| (Redacted until better fix is merged.)  Edit: Now that the fix is released, I should point out that this enabled bugs similar to [CVE-2023-28858](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-24wv-mv5m-xv4h)  [@mmastrac](https://github.com/mmastrac) it would be appropriate to issue a CVE here. I note Deno is not yet registered as a vendor: <https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners> which would be a good idea. |

| There seems to still be an issue with concurrent reads. Here is a test using `npm:ioredis` npm package. Running this test multiple times gives different actual values.  ``` // To run this test: // 1. Start a redis server instance: "docker run -d --name redis-stack-server -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack-server:latest" // 2.

# Cross-Session Data Contamination in Deno's Node.js Compatibility Runtime

## Package

cargo

deno
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

> 1.35.1

## Patched versions

1.36.3

## Description

### Summary

A vulnerability in Deno's Node.js compatibility runtime allows for cross-session data contamination during simultaneous asynchronous reads from Node.js streams sourced from sockets or files. The issue arises from the re-use of a global buffer (BUF) in stream\_wrap.ts used as a performance optimization to limit allocations during these asynchronous read operations. This can lead to data intended for one session being received by another session, potentially resulting in data corruption and unexpected behavior.

### Details

A bug in Deno's Node.js compatibility runtime results in data cross-reception during simultaneous asynchronous reads from Node.js network streams. When multiple independent network socket connections are involved, this vulnerability can be triggered. For instance, two separate server sockets that receive data from their respective client sockets and then echo the received data back to the client using Node.js streams may experience an issue where data from one socket may appear on another socket. Due to the improper isolation of the global buffer (`BUF`), data sent by one socket can end up being incorrectly received by another socket. Consequently, data intended for one session may be exposed to another session, potentially leading to data corruption and unexpected behavior.

This buffer was introduced as a performance optimization to avoid excessive allocations during network read operations.

In cases where the [net.Stream](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html) is connected to a remote server such as a database or key/value store such as Redis, this may result in a packet received on one connection being presented to another, causing data cross-contamination between multiple users and potentially leaking sensitive information.

It is important to note that this vulnerability does not affect Deno network streams created with the `Deno.listen` and `Deno.connect` APIs.

The impact of this issue may extend beyond node.js network streams, however, and may also affect asynchronous reads from non-network node.js Stream such as those created from files.

### PoC

[#20188](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/20188)

### Impact

This affects all users of Deno that use the node.js compatibility layer for network communication or other streams, including packages that may require node.js libraries indirectly.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
