{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper authentication in the Python gateway of Apache DolphinScheduler.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The Python gateway in versions 3.0.0 to 3.1.1 does not properly authenticate incoming connections, allowing unauthenticated access via a socket bytes attack.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code through the python gateway without authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A socket bytes attack.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send data to the python gateway via a socket connection, but does not require any prior authentication or knowledge of credentials."
