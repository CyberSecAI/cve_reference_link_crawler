- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from how GitLab handles specially crafted table syntax within issue descriptions. When a table is created with rows that have a varying number of columns, the system automatically extends rows with too few columns. This extension process, when combined with a large table, results in a quadratic complexity issue during issue moves, leading to high CPU usage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerability**: The process of expanding table rows to a consistent number of columns during issue moves has a quadratic time complexity, making it vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks with a large table.
    - **Lack of Input Validation**: There is insufficient validation or sanitization of the table syntax in issue descriptions, allowing for the creation of tables that trigger this high CPU usage.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Exploiting this vulnerability results in high CPU usage for 60 seconds, causing request timeouts and making the GitLab instance unavailable.
    - **Resource Exhaustion**: Multiple concurrent requests with the crafted input can exhaust server resources and disrupt the API/GraphQL endpoint.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **Issue Description**: Attackers can inject the malicious table syntax into an issue description.
    - **Move Issue Functionality**: The vulnerability is triggered when an issue containing the malicious table is moved to another project using the "Move Selected" feature or the graphql endpoint `moveIssue`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - **Authenticated User**: An attacker must be an authenticated GitLab user with the ability to create and edit issues.
    - **Project Access**: The attacker needs to have access to at least one project where they can create an issue and another project to move the issue to.
