SUMMARY

Several SIMATIC CP devices contain direct memory access vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to
execute code, access the PROFINET network without restrictions or perform denial of service attacks.

Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Ensure that only trusted persons have access to the system and avoid the conﬁguration of additional

accounts with admin rights.

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC CP 1623, CP 1626 and CP 1628 are PCI express cards for connection to Industrial Ethernet.

SIMATIC CP 1604 and CP 1616 are PCI/PCI-104 cards for high-performance connection of ﬁeld devices
to Industrial Ethernet with PROFINET.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-37194

The kernel memory of affected devices is exposed to user-mode via direct memory access (DMA)
which could allow a local attacker with administrative privileges to execute arbitrary code on the host
system without any restrictions.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-284: Improper Access Control

Vulnerability CVE-2023-37195

Affected devices insufﬁciently control continuous mapping of direct memory access (DMA) requests.
This could allow local attackers with administrative privileges to cause a denial of service situation on
the host. A physical power cycle is required to get the system working again.
