- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Affected devices insufficiently control continuous mapping of direct memory access (DMA) requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper control of DMA leading to uncontrolled resource consumption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can cause a denial of service situation on the host system. A physical power cycle is required to restore the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the host system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs administrative privileges on the host system.
