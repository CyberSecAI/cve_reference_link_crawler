            Unbind CallScreeningService when timeout reached.In a vulnerability, the exploiter showed that an app which implements aservice with role holding ROLE_CALL_SCREENING can be used to keep aservice alive. The assumption is that the CallScreeningService classuses MSG_SCREEN_CALL to screen the call and results in the service beingunbound for outgoing calls once screening completes. However, a vanillaservice which holds the ROLE_CALL_SCREENING role can still be used asthe default call screening app which keeps the service alive.This CL ensures that after the timeout is reached that we try to unbindthe service if possible.Bug: 300904123Test: Manual test to verify that onDestroy is called for the serviceafter the timeout is reached.(cherry picked from commit 9d97cd5825066ac8e15bbf97f6755663c5341afb)(cherry picked from https://googleplex-android-review.googlesource.com/q/commit:d57f25311acb7fb887fb0296364526345cc905bb)Merged-In: I30d276867c571ece113106d3b363fce99d64f441Change-Id: I30d276867c571ece113106d3b363fce99d64f441
