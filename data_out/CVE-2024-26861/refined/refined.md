{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A data race condition exists when accessing `keypair->receiving_counter.counter` in the WireGuard implementation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Data race"
    ],
    "impact": "The data race can lead to undefined behavior and potential security issues. It is explicitly mentioned that syzkaller with KCSAN identified this issue, which usually indicates potential for crashes or unexpected behavior.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The race occurs between two different contexts: 1) interrupt on a CPU and 2) task running on a different CPU.",
      "Specifically, the write occurs within the `counter_validate` function called from the interrupt context in `wg_packet_rx_poll`, while the read happens in the `decrypt_packet` function called from a task context in `wg_packet_decrypt_worker`"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to send network packets that would be processed by WireGuard, triggering the receive path to expose this race condition. No special privileges are needed beyond normal network activity, but precise packet timings may be needed to trigger the race."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The fix involves using `READ_ONCE()` and `WRITE_ONCE()` annotations for accesses to the `keypair->receiving_counter.counter` variable.",
      "Specifically, the read accesses are changed to `READ_ONCE(keypair->receiving_counter.counter)` and write accesses are changed to `WRITE_ONCE(counter->counter, their_counter)`"
  ],
  "additional_notes": "The provided content includes the commit messages and code diffs that fix the vulnerability. The fixes are related to marking data races as intentional through the use of READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE(), which provides the compiler with instructions to properly handle concurrent memory access. The commits reference the syzbot report as the source of the bug."
