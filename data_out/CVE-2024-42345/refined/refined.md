- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly handle user session establishment and invalidation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Session Fixation (CWE-384). The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to circumvent multi-factor authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack could allow a remote attacker to bypass multi-factor authentication, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system. The attacker could achieve a limited impact on integrity, but no impact on confidentiality or availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is remote and requires low privileges
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the network and have low privileged user credentials.
