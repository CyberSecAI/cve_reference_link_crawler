| **Bug description**  Looking at the headscale logs, it logs this at info level when accessing the HTTP api:  ``` 2023-03-11T21:13:56Z INF unary dur=0.815623 md={":authority":"/var/run/headscale.sock","authorization":"Bearer XXX.XXX","content-type":"application/grpc","grpcgateway-accept":"*/*","grpcgateway-authorization":"Bearer XXX.XXX","grpcgateway-user-agent":"python-httpx/0.23.3","user-agent":"grpc-go/1.51.0","x-forwarded-for":"xxxxx","x-forwarded-host":"xxxxxx"} method=ListApiKeys req={} service=headscale.v1.HeadscaleService  ```  This includes the whole bearer token. It would be great if the credentials wouldn't get logged :) |

| Would you like to contribute a PR which fixes the perceived regression? I think the maintainers accept contributions again.  [The readme](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale#design-goal) clearly states that this is a project for "self-hosters and hobbyists".  If you have specific security requirements, it's probably better to switch to the commercial Tailscale offer. |

| Hi [@disconn3ct](https://github.com/disconn3ct), also not a maintainer but please don't try to get a CVE. You are apparently operating under the assumption that a project has to live up to certain security standards. This is not necessarily the case (I have no idea what the security policy for headscale is) and no one forces you to use headscale. Threatening to issue a CVE will usually only have the effect of getting completely ignored.  If you want to invest your time productively, you could check if this issue is actually still an issue (I don't know I don't use headscale anymore) and if yes try to come up with a patch. |
