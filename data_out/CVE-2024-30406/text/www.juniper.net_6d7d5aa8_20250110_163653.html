## Description

Installs and runs an instance of the Paragon Active Assurance (PAA) test agent
on the node. Once this configuration is committed, the node downloads the
PAA test agent Docker image from the PAA Control Center. The node then
starts the Docker daemon and loads the PAA test agent Docker image into a
Docker container. The loaded software sets up the `nlsd`
configuration required by the PAA test agent and then starts the PAA test
agent.

Install the Paragon Active Assurance (PAA) test agent. Once the configuration
for the test agent is committed, the system fetches the PAA test agent
software image from the PAA Control Center for you and installs the software
into a Docker container.

Before configuring this statement, make sure you have an HTTPS connection to
the PAA Control Center (port 443 is open) and either port 6800 or a port of
your choosing is open to connect the test agent with the PAA Control Center.
In the PAA Control Center, make sure your SSL certificate is correct on both
ports, and both are either secure or self-signed.

If the test agent version is prior to 4.2.0, you must configure 127.0.0.1 as
the loopback address (lo0.0) on the router. For more information about
loopback addresses and how to configure them, see [Loopback Interfaces (Junos OS
Evolved)](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/interfaces-fundamentals-evo/interfaces-fundamentals/topics/topic-map/loopback-interfaces.html). If the test agent version is 4.2.0 or newer, you do
not need to configure a loopback address.

We support installation on two VRFs, `vrf0` and
`mgmt_junos`. By default, the operating system installs
the PAA test agent on the `vrf0` VRF. If configuration for
`mgmt_junos` is present, the operating system installs
the PAA test agent on the `mgmt_junos` VRF.

If you already have a committed configuration for the PAA test agent, and you
make and commit some changes to the options below, the PAA test agent is
re-installed using the new changes to the configuration.

## Default

For `cc-port`, 6800. For `ta-name`, the node
name.

## Options

| cc-account user-account-name | (Required) Your PAA Control Center user account. |
| --- | --- |
| cc-host DNS-name | (Required) IP address or DNS host name of the PAA Control Center. |
| cc-insecure | (Optional) Allow an insecure connection between the test agent and the PAA Control Center. In other words, disable SSL certificate checking and use self-signed SSL certificates. |
| cc-password plain-text-password | (Required) Your PAA Control Center password. The plain-text password is encrypted and is shown as such in the configuration. But the password is decrypted before being passed along to the test agent, which uses it when authenticating towards the Control Center. The test agent sends the password itself, but inside a secure SSL connection. |
| cc-port port-number | (Optional) Port over which the router can communicate with the PAA Control Center. Make sure the port you specify here (or port 6800 if taking the default) is open.   * Range: 1-65535 * Default: 6800 |
| cc-user "user@domain" | (Required) The email address registered with the PAA Control Center. |
| ta-name test-agent-name | (Optional) The name you want to use to refer to this PAA test agent. The default is the router's hostname.  The `ta-name` is used to identify the test agent in the PAA Control Center, and PAA wonât allow two test agents with the same name to run at the same time. |
| ta-version version-number | (Optional) The PAA test agent software version you would like to install. Check the PAA Control Center for the versions available. If not specified, the operating system installs the latest PAA test agent software version from the Control Center. |
