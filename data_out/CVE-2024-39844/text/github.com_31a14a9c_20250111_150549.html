```
* This is a security release to fix CVE-2024-39844: remote code execution vulnerability in modtcl.
    * To mitigate this for existing installations, simply unload the modtcl module for every user, if it's loaded. Note that only users with admin rights can load modtcl at all.
    * Thanks to Johannes Kuhn (DasBrain) for reporting, to glguy for the patch, and to multiple IRC network operators for help with mitigating this on server side before disclosure.
* Improve tooltips in webadmin.
```
