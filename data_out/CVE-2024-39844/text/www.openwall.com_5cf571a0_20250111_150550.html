Subject: CVE-2024-39844: ZNC modtcl RCE

Hi,

ZNC before 1.9.1 has a remote code execution vulnerability in its modtcl
module, that can for example be triggered through a prepared kick message

<https://wiki.znc.in/ChangeLog/1.9.1>

Alternatively the following patch needs to be applied to mitigate this
vulnerability:

<https://github.com/znc/znc/commit/8cbf8d628174ddf23da680f3f117dc54da0eb06e>

The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Johannes Kuhn
(DasBrain). The patch was created by glguy.
