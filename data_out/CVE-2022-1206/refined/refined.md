Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-1206

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing file extension sanitization within the `adrotate_insert_media()` function of the AdRotate plugin. This lack of proper sanitization allows attackers to upload files with double extensions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to upload files with arbitrary content and double extensions due to the lack of proper sanitization of the filename and extension during the upload process. This bypasses the intended file type restrictions.
*   **Missing File Extension Sanitization:** The `adrotate_insert_media()` function does not adequately check or sanitize the file extension, allowing double extensions (e.g., `file.php.jpg`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (Potential):** The primary impact is the potential for remote code execution.  In specific server configurations where the server executes the first extension in a double extension filename, a malicious actor can upload and execute code by using files such as `malicious.php.jpg`
*   **Complete System Compromise (Potential):** Successful remote code execution can lead to complete compromise of the server and the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending an HTTP POST request to the server, using the file upload functionality provided by the plugin's admin interface.
*   **Malicious File Upload:** Attackers upload a file with a double extension, bypassing file type restrictions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have administrator-level access (or above) to the WordPress site.
*   **Access to WordPress Admin Panel:** The attacker must be able to access the WordPress admin panel to upload files.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability exists in AdRotate plugin versions up to and including 5.13.2.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 5.13.3.
*   The Wordfence article explicitly states that the impact is contingent on the server executing the first extension in the double extension filename, indicating some environments may not be vulnerable even if the upload is possible.

**Summary of Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is located in the `adrotate-admin-manage.php` file, specifically in the `adrotate_insert_media()` function (around line 418). The function fails to properly sanitize the file extension during file uploads, which allows an authenticated administrator to upload files with double extensions, potentially leading to remote code execution. The fix involves updating the plugin to version 5.13.3 which addresses this sanitization issue.
