Based on the provided advisory, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references within the `doDocument` method of Voltronic Power ViewPower Pro.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The software is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. This occurs because the XML parser does not properly restrict external entity references. When processing a crafted XML document, the parser will access the URI specified in the external entity and embed the content into the XML document.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information from the server running the application. The information is disclosed in the context of LOCAL SERVICE.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send a specially crafted XML document to the vulnerable application. The application does not require authentication, making it easier to exploit.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the server running the vulnerable Voltronic Power ViewPower Pro application. No authentication is required, and they do not need any special privileges on the target system to exploit this vulnerability.
