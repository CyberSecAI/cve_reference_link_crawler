- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization, leading to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is Stored XSS (CWE-79), occurring in multiple instances within the application.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring low complexity (AC:L), and a low privilege level user can initiate the attack (PR:L) by injecting malicious scripts. The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), and the scope is changed (S:C), meaning that the malicious script executes within the security context of the vulnerable site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to inject malicious code, typically through a user interface feature that does not sanitize input. A low privileged user is able to inject code. The attacker needs to have a user to interact with the injected code.
