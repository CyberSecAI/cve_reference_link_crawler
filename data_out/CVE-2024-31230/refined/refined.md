- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, which could allow an unprivileged user to execute a higher privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. Specifically, missing authorization checks that allow for unauthorized access to privileged functions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is described as low severity, meaning it's unlikely to be exploited. However, the specific impact can vary case by case, which suggests unauthorized actions could be performed by unprivileged users.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is not explicitly defined, but it involves exploiting a function lacking proper authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any privileges, meaning the vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
