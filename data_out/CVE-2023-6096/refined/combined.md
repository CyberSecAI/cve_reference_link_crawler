RISK ANALYSIS

CVE

Review Opinion

Severity

An attacker could inject arbitrary attack code by manipulating

HTTP headers. However, in order to succeed in the attack, the

base  address  of  the  stack  memory  must  be  obtained.  The

default address depends  on firmware  version, configuration

option  information,  and  the  attack  is  unlikely  to  succeed.

Nevertheless,  we  believe  that  this  vulnerability  has  a

significant impact on the product because it allows arbitrary

attacks without authentication.

By dismantling the firmware, an attacker can analyze

internal information, as well as configure the manipulated

firmware to update the product. If the attacker has the

ability to log into the product, they can take control of it.

◼  Solution and Required Action

-  As some models  do  not fall under  Hanwha's  long-term firmware support policy when they

were  discontinued,  it  is  not  mandatory  to  distribute  firmware  that  corrects  security

vulnerabilities.  However,  since  Hanwha  takes  cybersecurity  matters  seriously,  we  distribute

corrected firmware out of consideration for customers in this case.

-  Please  update  the  affected  models  with  the  latest  firmware  as  soon  as  possible.  It  is

recommended to use the Wisenet Device Manager tool to download & update device firmware.

Firmware can also be downloaded from Hanwha Vision websites.
