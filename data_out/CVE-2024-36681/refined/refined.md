The provided content is related to CVE-2024-36681.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `pk_isotope::saveData` and `pk_isotope::removeData` methods in the Isotope module for PrestaShop contain SQL calls that are vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper neutralization of SQL parameters.
- SQL injection vulnerability in the `pk_isotope` module.
- Specifically, the module's ajax.php endpoint is vulnerable using the pID parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Obtain admin access.
- Remove data from the associated PrestaShop.
- Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to expose tokens and unlock adminâ€™s ajax scripts.
- Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.
- Deploy a webskimmer to steal credit card data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack via HTTP requests.
- The vulnerable methods can be accessed with trivial HTTP calls

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No specific privileges are required.
- No user interaction is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected PrestaShop instance.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is actively exploited to deploy webskimmers for credit card theft.
- The module author does not know the exact affected versions but refuses to provide the latest version for analysis.
- The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability using a crafted `curl` request.
-  It is recommended to upgrade to the latest version of the module and PrestaShop, though upgrading PrestaShop does not fully mitigate the issue because SQL injection can still be performed using UNION clauses and the absence of pSQL functions can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.
