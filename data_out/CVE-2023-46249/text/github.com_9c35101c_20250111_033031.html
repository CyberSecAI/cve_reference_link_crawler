|  |  |  |
|  |  | \_Reported by [@devSparkle](https://github.com/devSparkle)\_ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Potential Installation takeover when default admin user is deleted |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Summary |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | In the affected versions, when the default admin user has been deleted, it is potentially possible for an attacker to set the password of the default admin user without any authentication. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Patches |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | authentik 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2 fix this issue, for other versions the workaround can be used. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Impact |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | authentik uses a blueprint to create the default admin user, which can also optionally set the default admin users' password from an environment variable. When the user is deleted, the `initial-setup` flow used to configure authentik after the first installation becomes available again. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Workarounds |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Ensure the default admin user (Username `akadmin`) exists and has a password set. It is recommended to use a very strong password for this user, and store it in a secure location like a password manager. It is also possible to deactivate the user to prevent any logins as akadmin. |
|  |  |  |
