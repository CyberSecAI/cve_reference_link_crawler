Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11447:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Bell Home Hub 3000 router uses the serial number as a secondary means of authentication.
*   This serial number can be retrieved through an unauthenticated request to the router's API using the `/cgi/json-req` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The router exposes the serial number through the API without requiring prior authentication.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The leaked serial number can be used to bypass authentication, although the exact method is not detailed in this document.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the router's administrative interface by using the leaked serial number.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker can send a `getValue` request to the `/cgi/json-req` endpoint with the XPATH `Device/DeviceInfo/SerialNumber`.
*   This request can be made from a machine on the same network as the router, or potentially through other means such as cross site request forgery (CSRF), although not mentioned directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Bell Home Hub 3000 router.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP requests to the router's API endpoint, `/cgi/json-req`.

**Additional Notes:**
* The article mentions that the researcher was authenticated when performing the request, this does not align with the claim that there is an authentication bypass possible using the leaked serial number and requires further research to fully confirm. The text suggests the researcher was authenticated by using the existing session, but was able to retrieve the serial number even when already authenticated, therefore implying this would be the case without authentication as well.
* The article mentions that the Bell team were contacted, but "ghosted" the researcher.
* The researcher also found other interesting findings such as ssh and telnet, along with captive portal, and remote management features within the device.
