# How to set up Access control in a Home Hub 1000 modem?

[Internet support](/Internet/Connection-help)

What is Access control

## What is Access control

The Access control feature of your Home Hub lets 1000 you set the time and day a particular device can access the Internet. It blocks all Internet features, including email, social messaging or Skype.

There are two ways you can control access to the Internet:

1. Create a schedule for specific devices
2. Always block a device

As an example, you can limit the time your children spend online by specifying a day and time when their device (laptop, tablet, etc.) cannot access the Internet.

Access control only blocks Internet connections; it will not prevent devices from accessing other devices on the local network (e.g. , network printers, local file sharing between devices).

For a Home Hub  2000 modem and above, manage Access control with the [Bell Wi-Fi app](/internet/connection-help/what-is-the-bell-wi-fi-app-and-how-do-i-use-it?step=5#step5).

Create a schedule

With your Home Hub 1000 modem, you can specify time periods when particular devices cannot access the Internet.

1. Open your web browser and visit **[bell.ca/mymodem](https://bell.ca/mymodem) or 192.168.2.1**.
2. From the home screen, click on **Access control**.
3. Click the **Create a new schedule** button.
4. Give the schedule a name.
5. From the list of available devices, select the ones that you want to apply this schedule to.
   **Note:** A device must have connected to your network at least once for it to show up in the list.
6. Click the **Apply** button.
7. A calendar will appear. Select the start and end times as well as the days of the week during which you want the blocked access to be in effect.
8. Click the **Apply** button.
9. Click the **Save** button.

Always block access

You can block devices from accessing the Internet at all times. These devices will not have access to the Internet until you remove them from this list.

To block Internet access:

1. Open your web browser and visit **[bell.ca/mymodem](https://bell.ca/mymodem) or 192.168.2.1**.
2. From the home screen, click on **Access control**.
3. Click on the pencil next to **Always block**.
4. Select the devices you want to block.
5. Click the **Apply** button.
6. Click the **Save** button.

Modify an existing schedule

You can modify the devices and blocked times for existing schedules:

1. Open your web browser and visit **[bell.ca/mymodem](https://bell.ca/mymodem) or 192.168.2.1**.
2. From the home screen, click on **Access control**.
3. Click on the pencil next to the schedule you wish to change.
4. Add or remove devices.
5. Click the **Apply** button.
6. Add new blocked time or click on an existing time block to modify or delete it.
7. Click the **Save** button.

Delete an existing schedule

You can delete existing schedules by clicking on the 'X' next to the schedule you wish to delete. This will delete the entire schedule.

1. Open your web browser and visit **[bell.ca/mymodem](https://bell.ca/mymodem) or 192.168.2.1**.
2. From the Home screen, click on **Access control**.
3. Under *Edit / View* rules select the rule you wish to delete and click the ‘X’.

Override an active blocked session

You can temporarily grant Internet access to a device that is currently blocked by Access control. Overriding provides access to the Internet until the next scheduled blocked time takes effect.

If you have access to the device that's blocked, simply sign in with your modem's administrator password directly on the status page that appeared when the device tried to access the Internet.
