WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Limit access to port 102/tcp to trusted users and systems only

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory. Wherever
applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-25622

The PROFINET (PNIO) stack, when integrated with the Interniche IP stack, improperly handles internal
resources for TCP segments where the minimum TCP-Header length is less than defined.

This could allow an attacker to create a denial of service condition for TCP services on affected devices
by sending specially crafted TCP segments.

WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* Limit access to port 102/tcp to trusted users and systems only

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.
Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

PN/MF coupler is used to connect an EtherNet/IP network to a PROFINET subnet or to interconnect two PROFINET subnets.

PN/PN coupler is used for connecting two PROFINET networks.

SIMATIC Compact Field Unit (SIMATIC CFU) is a smart field distributor for use as an I/O device on PROFINET of an automation system.

SIMATIC ET 200 Interface modules for PROFINET IO are used to connect field devices (IO Devices) to controllers (IO Controller) via PROFINET.

SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU products have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC S7-300 controllers have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC S7-400 controllers have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC TDC is a multiprocessor automation system for drive, control and technology tasks. The system is used particularly for large plants.

SIMATIC WinAC RTX is a SIMATIC software controller for PC-based automation solutions.

With the SINAMICS converter series you can solve drive tasks in the low, medium and DC voltage range.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the same firmware as the product they are based on.

The SIPLUS HCS 4x00 heating control system is used to control and switch heaters in industry
control und operation e.g. quartz, ceramic, flash, halogen or infrared heaters.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-25622

The PROFINET (PNIO) stack, when integrated with the Interniche IP stack, improperly handles internal resources for TCP segments where the minimum TCP-Header length is less than defined.

This could allow an attacker to create a denial of service condition for TCP services on affected devices by sending specially crafted TCP segments.
