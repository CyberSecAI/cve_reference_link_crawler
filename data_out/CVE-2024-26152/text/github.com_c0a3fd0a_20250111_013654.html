# üåü What's New

## üéâ New Features

### Consolidated Label Studio Codebase

This release introduces a simplified Label Studio repository structure.

Previously, the Label Studio frontend and Data Manager codebases were each located in a separate repository: [label-studio-frontend](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio-frontend) and [dm2](https://github.com/HumanSignal/dm2). Starting with this release, the Label Studio Frontend and Data Manager code will be updated and maintained in the main [label-studio](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/tree/develop) repository.

The Label Studio Frontend code is now located in the label-studio repository under **`web/libs/editor`,** and the Data Manager code can be found under **`web/libs/datamanager`.** For more information, see our [contributing guide](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-organization).

This consolidated codebase has many benefits, including streamlined and simplified workflows, increased efficiency when performing cross-component changes, and improved navigation. Most importantly, a unified codebase will make it easier for our Open Source community to navigate and understand the Label Studio code architecture, lowering the barrier to entry for new contributors. ([#5154](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/pull/5154))

# üîê Security

* This release includes several measures to increase SSRF protection ([#5316](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/pull/5316)), which address [`CVE-2023-47116`](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/security/advisories/GHSA-p59w-9gqw-wj8r) ([#5316](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/pull/5316)):
  + When `SSRF_PROTECTION_ENABLED` is set to `true` (note that it defaults to `false`), our new default is to ban [all IPs within reserved blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses), for both IPv4 and IPv6.
  + We are introducing two new environment variables, to be used in conjunction with `SSRF_PROTECTION_ENABLED=true`:

    `USER_ADDITIONAL_BANNED_SUBNETS` ‚Äî Use this to specify additional IP addresses or CIDR blocks to ban from server-side requests (e.g. the URL-based file uploader).

    `USE_DEFAULT_BANNED_SUBNETS` ‚Äî This is set to `True` by default. If you would like to have full control over banned subnets, you can set this to `False` and use `USER_ADDITIONAL_BANNED_SUBNETS` to specify all the IP addresses / CIDR blocks you‚Äôd like to disallow instead.
  + We have also improved our error messages to make it clearer when an action is being blocked due to SSRF protections.
* Implemented comprehensive HTML sanitization to safeguard against vulnerabilities and ensure a secure user experience.¬†This addresses [`CVE-2024-26152`](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/security/advisories/GHSA-6xv9-957j-qfhg). ([#5232](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/pull/5232))
* Addressed several vulnerabilities found in the npm-axios package. ([#5229](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/pull/5229))

# üêû Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where Label Studio crashed when configuring multiple hotkeys using the `hotkey=","`¬†format. ([#5240](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/pull/5240))
* Fixed an issue where credential validation was failing in the Label Studio interface for cloud storages configured using SDK. ([#5228](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/pull/5228))
* Fixed an issue where cancelled and updated annotations were not recalculating `is_labeled` and other counters. ([#4472](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/pull/4472))
* Fixed an issue where annotation drafts were not changing when switching to view all mode. ([#5141](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/pull/5141))
* Fixed an issue where users would encounter an error when using the **Storage filename** filter in the Data Manager. ([#5289](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/pull/5289))
* Fixed an issue where users were unable to use the **View all annotations** option when the project included images that had an empty URL. ([#5245](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/pull/5245))
* Fixed an issue where relations were not displayed if they were added by a user while reviewing a task. ([#5140](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/pull/5140))
* Fixed an issue where users were seeing the Comments tab (an Enterprise-only feature) when resizing their screen. ([#5230](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/pull/5230))
