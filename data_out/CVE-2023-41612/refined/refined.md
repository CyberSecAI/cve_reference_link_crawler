Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-41612:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `anyka_ipc` binary checks for a file named `enable_telnetd.dat` on the mounted micro-SD card during boot. If present, it attempts to decrypt this file using the 3DES algorithm with a hardcoded key.
*   The decrypted content is then moved to `/tmp/autoexec.sh` and executed with root privileges before any other functions of the binary.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Encryption Key:** The 3DES encryption key is hardcoded to `123` padded with null bytes. This allows anyone with knowledge of the key to encrypt malicious code for execution on the device.
*   **Unauthenticated Code Execution:** The device executes code from the SD card without any authentication or validation as long as it is encrypted with the correct key and placed in the correct path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected device by placing a specially crafted file on a micro-SD card. This allows the attacker to completely control the device.
*   **Full Device Compromise:** The ability to execute code as root allows for any action on the device such as enabling telnet for easy remote access, creating reverse shells, capturing the camera's video feed, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The primary attack vector is physical access to the camera to insert a malicious micro-SD card.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the camera to insert an SD card containing the exploit.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the hardcoded 3DES key and the filename expected by the `anyka_ipc` binary. They also need to be able to prepare a file encrypted with the 3DES key and place it on a micro-SD card.
*  **Basic Linux Skills**: Required to create the reverse shell and enable telnetd on the device.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability was fixed in firmware version 4.4.14.
*  The blog provides a more detailed explanation of the vulnerability than is typically provided in a CVE description.
* The blog also provides specific examples on how to exploit the vulnerability using `CyberChef` and demonstrates the use of reverse shell to gain access to the device.
