Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-35550:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) component of the Oracle Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE). Specifically, the issue is related to how the default cipher suites are enabled in Java SE.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary weakness is an improperly configured default enabled cipher suites preference which can allow weaker ciphers to be used. This can lead to a downgrade attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.
* The vulnerability also may lead to unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (DoS) of Java SE.
*  The vulnerability could allow for unauthorized read, update, insert or delete access to some Java SE accessible data

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker could exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
* The attacker needs to be able to intercept and manipulate network traffic to influence the selection of cipher suites during TLS communication.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple products that incorporate the vulnerable Java SE libraries, including NetApp products, OpenJDK, and Oracle products.
*   Patches have been released by multiple vendors, including NetApp, Debian, Fedora, and Oracle to address the vulnerability in their respective products that use the vulnerable Java SE components.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity by NetApp and Debian with a CVSS v3.1 score ranging from 5.3 to 5.9.
*   Oracle rates this as Medium risk with a CVSS 3.1 score of 5.9.

**In summary, CVE-2021-35550 highlights an issue in the default configuration of cipher suites within Java SE's JSSE component, that allows for the use of weak ciphers during TLS communication.  This can be exploited remotely by an unauthenticated attacker, with potential impacts ranging from information disclosure to denial of service.**
