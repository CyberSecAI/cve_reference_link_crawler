Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `quarantine.php` file of the "Farm Management System In PHP" application. Specifically, the `pigno` parameter is directly used in SQL queries without any cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw, allowing attackers to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious code through the `pigno` parameter. Both error-based and time-based blind SQL injection techniques are possible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can access and steal sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Comprehensive System Control:** In severe cases, attackers could potentially gain control over the entire system.
- **Service Interruption:** Exploitation can lead to service disruptions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `quarantine.php` file and is triggered via the `pigno` POST parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `quarantine.php` endpoint.
- They need to be able to craft malicious SQL injection payloads within the `pigno` parameter.
- No prior authentication seems to be required to exploit the vulnerability, making it remotely exploitable.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects version 1.0 of the "Farm Management System In PHP" software.
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates how to exploit the SQL injection using both error-based and time-based blind techniques.
- The sqlmap tool can be used to automate the exploitation process, as shown in the content.
- The vulnerable parameter is `pigno`.
- Suggested mitigations include using prepared statements with parameter binding, input validation and filtering, minimizing database user permissions, and conducting regular security audits.
