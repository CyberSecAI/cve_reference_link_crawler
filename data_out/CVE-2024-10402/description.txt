The Forminator Forms â€“ Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on a function in all versions up to, and including, 1.35.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, and permissions granted by an Administrator, to create new or edit existing forms, including updating the default registration role to Administrator on User Registration forms.
