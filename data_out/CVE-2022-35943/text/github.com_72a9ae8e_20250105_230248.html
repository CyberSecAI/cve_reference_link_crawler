# SameSite Attackers may Bypass the CSRF Protection

Moderate

[MGatner](/MGatner)
published
GHSA-5hm8-vh6r-2cjq
Aug 7, 2022

## Package

composer

CodeIgniter Shield
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

1.0.0-beta

## Patched versions

1.0.0-beta.2

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability may allow [SameSite Attackers](https://canitakeyoursubdomain.name/) to bypass the [CodeIgniter4 CSRF protection](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/libraries/security.html) mechanism with CodeIgniter Shield.

For this attack to succeed, the attacker must have direct (or indirect, e.g., XSS) control over a subdomain site (e.g., `https://a.example.com/`) of the target site (e.g., `http://example.com/`).

This vulnerability exists whether `Config\Security::$csrfProtection` is `'cookie'` or `'session'`.

It is also exploitable whether `Config\Security::$regenerate` is `true` or `false`.

### Patches

Upgrade to **CodeIgniter v4.2.3 or later** and **Shield v1.0.0-beta.2 or later**.

### Workarounds

Do all of the following:

* set `Config\Security::$csrfProtection` to `'session'`
* remove old session data right after login (immediately after ID and password match)
* regenerate CSRF token right after login (immediately after ID and password match)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
