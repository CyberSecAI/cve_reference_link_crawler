Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2023-5752:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from how `pip` handles Mercurial VCS URLs when installing packages. Specifically, when a user installs a package using a command like `pip install hg+...`, the provided Mercurial revision could be manipulated to inject arbitrary configuration options to the "hg clone" command using the `--config` option. This allows an attacker to control the Mercurial configuration, potentially modifying how and which repository is installed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Handling of VCS URLs:** The `pip` tool improperly handles the revision part of a Mercurial VCS URL, failing to sanitize it before passing it to the `hg clone` command.
*   **Configuration Injection:** By controlling the revision parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary Mercurial configuration options through the `--config` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By manipulating the Mercurial configuration, an attacker could potentially cause the `hg clone` command to execute malicious code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
*   **Installation of Malicious Packages:** An attacker could manipulate the Mercurial configuration to clone a malicious repository instead of the intended one, leading to the installation of compromised software.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  The injected configuration could be crafted to exfiltrate sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Mercurial VCS URLs:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user attempts to install a package using a Mercurial VCS URL via a command such as `pip install hg+...`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control over Mercurial URL:** The attacker needs to control the Mercurial URL or be able to inject malicious data into the Mercurial repository which is used by pip. This could be accomplished by providing a malicious package or controlling the content of a valid Mercurial repository.
*  **Targeted User Action:**  The victim must execute a `pip install` command that uses a malicious Mercurial URL.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects `pip` versions before 23.3.
*   The fix involves changing how `pip` passes the revision parameter to the `hg clone` command, using `-r=...` instead of `-r ...`. This prevents the revision from being misinterpreted as an option.
*   The issue is rated as **MEDIUM** severity.
