Subject: CVE-2020-13946 Apache Cassandra RMI Rebind Vulnerability

CVE-2020-13946 Apache Cassandra RMI Rebind Vulnerability

Versions Affected:
All versions prior to: 2.1.22, 2.2.18, 3.0.22, 3.11.8 and 4.0-beta2

Description:
It is possible for a local attacker without access to the Apache Cassandra process or configuration files to manipulate the RMI registry to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and capture user names and passwords used to access the JMX interface. The attacker can then use these credentials to access the JMX interface and perform unauthorised operations.
Users should also be aware of CVE-2019-2684, a JRE vulnerability that enables this issue to be exploited remotely.

Mitigation:
2.1.x users should upgrade to 2.1.22
2.2.x users should upgrade to 2.2.18
3.0.x users should upgrade to 3.0.22
3.11.x users should upgrade to 3.11.8
4.0-beta1 users should upgrade to 4.0-beta2

```
