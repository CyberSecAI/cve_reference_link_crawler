Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8624:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient escaping of the user-supplied `meta_key` parameter within the 'mdf_select_title' shortcode, coupled with a lack of proper preparation in the existing SQL query within the "MDTF â€“ Meta Data and Taxonomies Filter" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw, arising from the direct inclusion of the unescaped `meta_key` parameter within an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can exploit the SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the WordPress database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the 'mdf_select_title' shortcode, using the 'meta_key' parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** Attackers must have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
- **Ability to use Shortcodes:** Attackers must be able to utilize shortcodes, which is generally available to users with Contributor-level permissions or higher.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `core.php` file of the plugin.
- The vulnerable versions include all versions up to and including 1.3.3.3.
- The patched version is 1.3.3.4
- The fix involved using `$wpdb->prepare` to sanitize the input, preventing the SQL Injection vulnerability by properly escaping the `meta_key` parameter before embedding it in the SQL query.
