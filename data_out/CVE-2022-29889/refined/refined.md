- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Abode Systems, Inc. iota All-In-One Security Kit uses a hard-coded method to generate the root password, which is derived from the device's MAC address using a known algorithm, prefix, postfix, map values, and a lookup table. This password can be calculated off-device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Hard-coded credentials (CWE-798), predictable password generation based on MAC address, telnet service enabled with vulnerable password.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain root access to the device, leading to arbitrary command execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the device's telnet service on TCP/55023.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker needs network access to the device, knowledge of the hard-coded password generation method, including prefix, postfix, map values, lookup table, and the device's MAC address.
