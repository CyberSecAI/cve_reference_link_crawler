    - Display advertisements
    - Insert other HTML payloads
    - Execute these scripts when other users visit the website

**Attack Vectors:**
- The exact attack vector is not explicitly detailed, but it involves injecting malicious script through an input field handled by the vulnerable plugin. The injected scripts will be executed when other users access the vulnerable page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script.
