{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `padata_do_parallel` function in the Linux kernel's padata module returns -EBUSY when the `PADATA_RESET` flag is set, preventing the completion callback from being triggered. This leads to a hung task scenario in the `test_aead_vec_cfg` function, which waits indefinitely for the completion of the parallel operation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect error handling in `padata_do_parallel` when the `PADATA_RESET` flag is set.",
      "Lack of proper notification or handling of the reset state in the `test_aead_vec_cfg` function.",
       "Potential for deadlock or hung task due to improper synchronization between parallel tasks and completion callbacks."
    ],
    "impact": "A hung task scenario can lead to a kernel panic and denial of service. The `cryptomgr_test` task gets blocked indefinitely, and the system becomes unresponsive. If the hung task timeout is disabled, the system will eventually experience a kernel panic due to blocked tasks.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could trigger the `PADATA_RESET` flag, potentially by manipulating the system's crypto configurations, to cause a hung task in the kernel's crypto module, and trigger a denial of service.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to manipulate crypto configurations or trigger the `PADATA_RESET` flag via an operation that makes use of the padata module. This could require root access or specific privileges, depending on the system's configuration."
  },
  "fix": "The fix involves changing the return error in `padata_do_parallel` from `-EBUSY` to `-EAGAIN` when `PADATA_RESET` is set. This signals the caller that the parallel data is changing and they should retry the operation. This avoids the hang and allows the `test_aead_vec_cfg` function to eventually complete. The fix is applied to both `pcrypt_aead_encrypt` and `pcrypt_aead_decrypt` functions."
