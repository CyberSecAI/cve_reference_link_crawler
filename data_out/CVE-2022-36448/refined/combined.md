# **Insyde's Security Pledge**

#

![](/sites/default/files/page_images/insyde-pledge-3.jpg)

Since our inception 20 years ago, security has been essential. Hundreds of OEMs and ODM partners have trusted us with enabling the platforms that form the foundation of their products, knowing we share their commitment to make them secure. Product security is a top priority with our company and an area of focus that we continue to improve upon every day.

* We sit on the security review team of the industry’s leading firmware standards body; the UEFI Security Response Team.
* We have internal product security experts that drive our Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) process within our BIOS and BMC firmware teams and evaluate existing and emerging threats.
* We issue regular and timely security alert bulletins when mitigations to vulnerabilities are discovered.
* We work closely with all of our silicon vendor partners to ensure the timely and critical delivery of microcode updates and other patches.

At Insyde, we work with the broader industry to identify, report, mitigate and disclose security vulnerabilities. We support you, our customers and partners, in closing the door to anything which compromises the security or privacy in your platforms. We take this role seriously, because if your firmware is not secure, your product is not secure.

This is our pledge to you. If you have any questions about Insyde Software’s commitment to security, I urge you to reach out to us at security.report@insyde.com

**Tim Lewis, Chief Technology Officer**

# [BRLY-2022-023] SMM memory corruption vulnerability in Software SMI handler

September 21, 2022Severity:HighCVSS Score8.2Public Disclosure Date:September 21, 2022CVE ID:

[CVE-2022-36448](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36448)

## Summary

Binarly REsearch Team has discovered a SMM memory corruption vulnerability allowing a possible attacker to write fixed or predictable data to SMRAM. Exploiting this issue could lead to escalating privileges to SMM.![Vendors Affected Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65d392ca924b59f0fcd873eb/6698dd226326f191c074ad7b_Vendors.svg)
### Vendors Affected

FrameworkInsyde[Framework](/advisory-vendor/framework),[Insyde](/advisory-vendor/insyde),![Affected Products icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65d392ca924b59f0fcd873eb/6698dd3fad8b6d927d1b45c4_Affected%20products.svg)
### Affected Products

No items found.
## Potential Impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges from ring 0 to ring -2, execute arbitrary code in System Management Mode - an environment more privileged than operating system (OS) and completely isolated from it. Running arbitrary code in the SMM additionally bypasses SMM-based SPI flash protections against modifications, which can help an attacker to install a firmware backdoor/implant into the BIOS. Such a malicious firmware code in the BIOS could persist across operating system re-installs. Additionally, this vulnerability potentially could be used by threat actors to bypass security mechanisms provided by the UEFI firmware (for example, Secure Boot and some types of memory isolation for hypervisors).

## Summary

**Binarly REsearch Team** has discovered a SMM memory corruption vulnerability allowing a possible attacker to write fixed or predictable data to SMRAM. Exploiting this issue could lead to escalating privileges to SMM.

## Vulnerability Information

* BINARLY internal vulnerability identifier: BRLY-2022-023
* Insyde PSIRT assigned CVE identifier: CVE-2022-36448
* FwHunt rule: [BRLY-2022-023](https://github.com/binarly-io/FwHunt/blob/main/rules/Vulnerabilities/Insyde/BRLY-2022-023.yml)

## Potential impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges from ring 0 to ring -2, execute arbitrary code in System Management Mode - an environment more privileged than operating system (OS) and completely isolated from it. Running arbitrary code in the SMM additionally bypasses SMM-based SPI flash protections against modifications, which can help an attacker to install a firmware backdoor/implant into the BIOS.

Additionally, this vulnerability potentially could be used by threat actors to bypass security mechanisms provided by the UEFI firmware (for example, Secure Boot and some types of memory isolation for hypervisors).

## Vulnerability description

The vulnerability exists in the Software SMI handler (`SwSmiInputValue = 0x47`) located at offset `0x3690` in the module.The pseudocode of the vulnerable handler is shown below:

```
EFI_STATUS __fastcall SwSmiHandler(
        EFI_HANDLE DispatchHandle,
        const void *Context,
        void *CommBuffer,
        UINTN *CommBufferSize)
{
  __int64 Ptr;
  __int16 Index;
  __int16 ResValue;
  UINTN Val;
  __int64 IhisiParamBufferValue;

  if ( ToGetIhisiParamBufferVar(&IhisiParamBufferValue, &Val, CommBuffer) >= EFI_SUCCESS )
  {
    Ptr = IhisiParamBufferValue;
    if ( *(IhisiParamBufferValue + 16) == 'BSI$' )
    {
      Index = *(*(IhisiParamBufferValue + 0x28) + 6);
      if ( (Index & 0xFFF8) == 80 )             // Index: 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87
        ResValue = (gFuncsTable[Index & 7])(*(IhisiParamBufferValue + 0x28));
      else
        ResValue = 0x82;
      *(Ptr + 8) = ResValue;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

`IhisiParamBufferValue` will contain the NVRAM variable value:\* name: `IhisiParamBuffer`\* GUID: `92e59835-5f42-4e0b-9a84-47c7810ea806`\* DataSize: `8`

The `IhisiParamBuffer` variable contains an address that is not checked (except for the check for signature located at `IhisiParamBufferValue + 16`).

As you can see from the pseudocode, a predictable value can be written by address `IhisiParamBufferValue + 8`.This can lead to DOS or execution of arbitrary code in SMM.
