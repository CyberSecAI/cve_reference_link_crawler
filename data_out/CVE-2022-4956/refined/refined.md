Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a DLL hijacking vulnerability in Advanced Installer. Specifically, the installer attempts to load the `GdiPlus.dll` library from a specific path, first checking a local directory relative to the installer's location (`%INSTALLER_LOCATION%\ProtonVPN_win_v2.0.0.exe.Local\x86_microsoft.windows.gdiplus_6595b64144ccf1df_1.1.19041.1706_none_d94bc52be10975a7`). If the directory doesn't exist, it loads the DLL from the Windows system directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **DLL Hijacking:** The installer doesn't properly validate the location where `GdiPlus.dll` is loaded. The installer first checks for the DLL in a user-writable directory, allowing an attacker to place a malicious DLL at this location.
*   **Insecure DLL Loading:** By checking a user-writable location before the system directory, the installer is susceptible to DLL hijacking

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** By placing a malicious `GdiPlus.dll` in the vulnerable location, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer. Because the vulnerable installer is often run with administrative rights, this will lead to SYSTEM level privileges
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The injected DLL can perform any actions the compromised user has permissions for, including creating new processes, modifying the system, or exfiltrating data

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File System:** The attacker must be able to create a directory and place a malicious DLL in a specific location.
*   **Targeted Installer:** The exploit targets installers created with Advanced Installer and which are vulnerable due to the insecure DLL loading pattern.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable installer is being executed.
*   **Write Permissions:** The attacker needs write access to the directory where the malicious DLL will be placed (e.g., `%INSTALLER_LOCATION%\ProtonVPN_win_v2.0.0.exe.Local\...`)
*   **Knowledge of the DLL Path:**  The attacker needs to know the specific path where the vulnerable program will look for `GdiPlus.dll`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided code is a proof-of-concept (PoC) DLL that, when loaded, attempts to escalate privileges to SYSTEM by impersonating a winlogon token, demonstrating the impact of the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was present in Advanced Installer versions up to 19.7.
*   The vulnerability was discovered via the Proton VPN installer which was created using Advanced Installer, and the vulnerability was fixed in Advanced Installer version 19.7.1.
