Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the EazyDocs WordPress plugin. This lack of proper access control allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of sufficient access control mechanisms. The plugin fails to verify if the user has the necessary permissions before allowing them to perform specific actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user (e.g., a "Subscriber") can execute higher-privileged actions. The specific impact varies depending on the affected function.
- The content indicates that this vulnerability is considered "moderately dangerous" and likely to be exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the absence of authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a specific function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user with the "Subscriber" role, or another role without the necessary privileges for the action they want to perform.
- The attacker would need to find the vulnerable function to exploit the lack of access control.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects EazyDocs Plugin versions <= 2.5.0.
- The issue is fixed in version 2.5.1.
- Patchstack has issued a virtual patch to mitigate this issue by blocking any attacks until users have updated to the fixed version.
- The vulnerability is classified as a medium severity, with a CVSS score of 7.1.
- The vulnerability has been reported by Khalid Yusuf on 18 Mar 2024, and published by Patchstack on 11 Jul 2024.
