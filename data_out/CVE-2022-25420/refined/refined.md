Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a CRLF injection vulnerability in the NTT Resonant Incorporated goo blog App Web Application version 1.0. This vulnerability occurs because the application improperly handles user-supplied input when constructing HTTP responses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CRLF Injection:** The application fails to sanitize or encode user-supplied data that is used within HTTP headers. Specifically, carriage return (%0d) and line feed (%0a) characters are not filtered, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary headers.
- **HTTP Response Splitting:** By injecting CRLF sequences, an attacker can split the HTTP response, potentially injecting malicious content or redirecting the user to a different website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** The attacker can inject malicious code through a crafted HTTP response, potentially leading to execution of this code in the user's browser environment, which in turn, may lead to full compromise of the user's session on the web application.
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker might inject headers to perform session hijacking through the injection of cookies or other session-related attributes.
- **XSS Attacks:**  Response splitting can be used to inject malicious JavaScript code, leading to XSS attacks.
- **Cache Poisoning:** An attacker might manipulate the response headers to cause proxy servers and caching mechanisms to cache malicious content or redirect responses.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing CRLF characters (%0d%0a) within the query parameters.
- **Remote Exploitation:**  The attack is performed remotely by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific privileges are mentioned as required to perform this attack. The attacker only needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoints and be able to craft a specific malicious URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided GitHub repository contains a README file with a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including a proof-of-concept URL.
- The proof-of-concept URL demonstrates how to inject a custom header into the response using CRLF characters: `https://blog.goo.ne.jp/portal/xmarchel/7%0d%0aCustomInjectionHeader:%20injected_by_abhiunix`
- A screenshot `crlf.png` is included in the repository demonstrating the successful injection of the custom header.
