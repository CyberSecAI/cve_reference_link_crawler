- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic error occurs when an Access Control List (ACL) transitions from inactive to active in the running configuration of Cisco ASA and FTD software. This is specifically related to the object group search (OGS) ACL optimization feature being enabled and an inactive ACL containing a network object group but not a network service group (NSG).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the incorrect activation of an ACL, which should become active with specified rules but fails to do so. This leads to a bypass of ACL rules.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass the protection offered by a configured ACL. This could result in unauthorized access to trusted networks that the device protects, potentially allowing traffic that should be denied to pass through, or conversely, denying traffic that should be permitted. The impact applies to both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic and dual-stack ACL configurations.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, involving sending traffic through the affected device. Specifically, the attacker sends traffic that the configured ACL should deny.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote. They need to send traffic through the device which is configured with the vulnerable configuration.
