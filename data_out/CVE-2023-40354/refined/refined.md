Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that when creating a service in MariaDB MaxScale using the `maxctrl create service` command, even when an encrypted password is provided, the password is not stored in an encrypted format in the configuration file (`/var/lib/maxscale/maxscale.cnf.d/Read-Service.cnf`). Instead, the password is saved in plaintext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Plaintext Password Storage:** The primary vulnerability is storing sensitive user passwords in plaintext in the configuration files. This violates basic security best practices.
*   **Incorrect Handling of Encrypted Passwords:** The system fails to properly handle encrypted passwords passed through the `maxctrl` command, effectively ignoring the encryption and storing the unencrypted form.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Exposure:** An attacker who gains access to the MaxScale server's filesystem can easily retrieve sensitive passwords from the configuration files.
*   **Lateral Movement/Privilege Escalation:** Exposed passwords can be used to access other systems or databases, potentially escalating an attacker's access and control over the infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File System Access:** The primary attack vector is unauthorized access to the filesystem of the MariaDB MaxScale server. This could occur through various means such as:
    *   Compromised server accounts.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system or other services running on the server.
    *   Physical access to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to MaxScale Server:** The attacker must have read access to the `/var/lib/maxscale/maxscale.cnf.d/` directory on the MaxScale server.
*   **Basic File Reading Skills:** Ability to read text files.
* **No network access required:** The attacker doesn't require any network access to exploit this once they have achieved the required file system access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue is present in multiple versions of MariaDB MaxScale including 2.5.26, 6.4.7, 22.08.6, and 23.02.1.
*   The issue was resolved in versions 2.5.28, 6.4.9, 22.08.8, and 23.02.3.
* The issue description includes the steps to reproduce the vulnerability, by creating a service using `maxctrl` with an encrypted password, then reading the configuration file.
