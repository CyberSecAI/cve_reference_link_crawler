# 1.9.9 Changelog

June 13, 2024On this page

This release includes plenty of in-builder improvements and fixes. We tackled builder lag issues when adding and removing classes and rendering nested query loops. Duplicating, renaming, and reordering elements should also be much snappier now üöÄ.

The builder received a new set of interface icons üî•. The ‚ÄúView on frontend‚Äù icon is now always visible. We reordered the builder toolbar icons slightly. There‚Äôs a toolbar setting indicator when the active element has pseudo-classes. Give it a bit of time to get used to üòâ

### Global Data Sync ‚Äì Classes

The new and experimental **Global Data Sync** feature marks Bricks‚Äôs next big step towards more synchronous and efficient teamwork.

Until now, editing global data (global classes, CSS variables, theme styles, color palettes, etc.) in Bricks could lead to unwanted overwrites if another team member simultaneously edited the same global data.

With the new Global Data Sync enabled for classes under `Bricks > Settings > Builder > Global data sync`, all global class changes (add, delete, or modify classes) made in any other builder instance are automatically pulled into your builder instance whenever you perform a save.

IMPORTANT: This is an experimental feature. Please DO NOT use it on any production website! It is only meant to test and share feedback with the Bricks team via email or the forum at this stage of development!

### Query Sort & Filter: Production-ready

We removed the `experimental` flag from the Query Sort & Filter (<https://academy.bricksbuilder.io/article/query-filters/>), introduced in Bricks 1.9.6.

We are still working to extend, improve, and fix this feature. But it‚Äôs now at a stage where you can start using it on production-level sites.

### Access control fix for user role ‚ÄúContributor‚Äù

WordFence informed us that users with the role ‚ÄúContributor‚Äù and builder access could edit Bricks post data they did not create.

Which, to be in line with WordPress [contributor capabilities](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#contributor), shouldn‚Äôt technically be possible.

Bricks 1.9.9 fixes this issue by aligning the WordPress contributor capabilities when editing with Bricks. Meaning that contributors can now only edit their own Bricks-created posts.

To be clear, those edits could only affect the generated content, not any executable code. Only users with code execution capability can add, edit, or sign executable code in Bricks.

### Description

The Bricks Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.8 via the postId parameter due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to modify posts and pages created by other users including admins. As a requirement for this, an admin would have to enable access to the editor specifically for such a user or enable it for all users with a certain user account type.
