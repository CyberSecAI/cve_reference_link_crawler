Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4874

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing validation on the `postId` parameter, which is user-controlled. This lack of validation allows an attacker to manipulate the parameter and access/modify data associated with arbitrary posts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application directly uses the `postId` parameter provided by the user without proper authorization checks. This allows an attacker to access or manipulate resources they should not have access to by altering this ID.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Authenticated attackers with "Contributor" level access (or higher) can modify posts and pages created by other users, including administrators. This allows them to alter content on the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is performed by exploiting the `postId` parameter.
*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with Contributor-level access or higher to the WordPress site.
*   An admin must have enabled the Bricks builder editor access for the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "Contributor" access level in WordPress.
*   The attacker needs to have access to the Bricks builder editor.
*   The attacker needs to know, or guess, the `postId` of the post or page they want to modify.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Bricks Builder version 1.9.9 by aligning the WordPress contributor capabilities when editing with Bricks.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Francesco Carlucci.
*   The vulnerability affects the content and structure of the site, but does not allow for code execution since "Only users with code execution capability can add, edit, or sign executable code in Bricks".
