The provided content relates to CVE-2023-37476.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a zip slip issue in the project import functionality of OpenRefine. The application fails to properly sanitize filenames within a tar archive, allowing an attacker to create files outside of the intended destination directory during project import.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation of file paths in the imported tar archive.
- Lack of path sanitization during tar extraction.
- Vulnerability to "zip slip" attack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By crafting a malicious tar archive, an attacker could write files to arbitrary locations on the server's filesystem, potentially leading to code execution if the written files are scripts or executables.
- File system manipulation: Malicious file creation or overwriting.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious OpenRefine project tar file.
- Import project functionality of OpenRefine.
- An attacker needs to convince a user to import the malicious project file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create a specially crafted tar archive.
- Ability to deliver the malicious archive to a user of OpenRefine.
- Needs to convince a user to import the malicious project.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure that extracted file paths do not escape the destination directory.
- A test case was added to verify the fix.
- A similar issue existed in the "Create Project" feature (CVE-2018-19859).
