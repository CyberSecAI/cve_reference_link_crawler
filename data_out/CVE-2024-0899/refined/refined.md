### Root cause of vulnerability:
The s2Member plugin did not properly restrict access to content via the WordPress REST API, allowing unauthenticated users to view restricted posts and pages.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- **Improper Access Control**: The plugin failed to enforce access restrictions on content when accessed through the WordPress REST API.

### Impact of exploitation:
- **Information Exposure**: Unauthenticated attackers could view the contents of posts and pages that were intended to be restricted to members only.

### Attack vectors:
- The vulnerability is exploitable via the WordPress REST API.

### Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable WordPress site's REST API endpoints.

### Additional details:
- The vulnerability was fixed by applying access restrictions to WP REST requests in version 240315.
- The fix included adding a `security-rest.inc.php` file and a filter `rest_pre_dispatch` to `src/includes/hooks.inc.php`.
