- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of SQL parameter in the `ReferralByPhoneDefaultModuleFrontController::ajaxProcessCartRuleValidate` method. Specifically, the `$ws_voucher` parameter from the request is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization using `pSQL()`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89).
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Obtain admin access.
    - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop database.
    - Copy/paste sensitive data, like tokens, from database tables to frontend, potentially allowing privilege escalation.
    - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.
    - Actively used to deploy a webskimmer to steal credit card data.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks via HTTP requests. The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious request to the `ajaxProcessCartRuleValidate` method with a specifically crafted `ws_voucher` parameter. The specific path is not easily identified in normal logs, which makes detection more challenging.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No privileges are required; any guest can exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PrestaShop instance.
