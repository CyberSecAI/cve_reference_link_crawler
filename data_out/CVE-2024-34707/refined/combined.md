### @glennmatthews **[glennmatthews](/glennmatthews)** commented [May 9, 2024](#issue-2288241422)

# Closes [#1858](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1858)

# What's Changed

* The `BRANDING_FILEPATHS` setting can now include `javascript` and `css` as keys. The filepaths under `MEDIA_ROOT` identified by these settings are included as a custom script and a custom stylesheet respectively, if set.
* The `BANNER_TOP`, `BANNER_LOGIN`, and `BANNER_BOTTOM` configs now support Markdown (new feature) and a limited subset of sanitized HTML (new restriction) as a result of replacing the `safe` templatetag with use of `render_markdown`. This addresses security concerns about userswith Nautobot admin privileges potentially configuring a malicious payload into any of these settings via Constance. ([GHSA-r2hr-4v48-fjv3](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r2hr-4v48-fjv3 "GHSA-r2hr-4v48-fjv3")).

Will backport this to `ltm-1.6` as well.

# Closes [#1858](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1858)

# What's Changed

LTM backport of [#5697](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/5697).

* The BRANDING\_FILEPATHS setting can now include javascript and css as keys. The filepaths under MEDIA\_ROOT identified by these settings are included as a custom script and a custom stylesheet respectively, if set.
* The BANNER\_TOP, BANNER\_LOGIN, and BANNER\_BOTTOM configs now support Markdown (new feature) and a limited subset of sanitized HTML (new restriction) as a result of replacing the safe templatetag with use of render\_markdown. This addresses security concerns about users with Nautobot admin privileges potentially configuring a malicious payload into any of these settings via Constance. ([GHSA-r2hr-4v48-fjv3](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r2hr-4v48-fjv3 "GHSA-r2hr-4v48-fjv3")).

# BANNER\_\* configuration can be used to inject arbitrary HTML content into Nautobot pages

High

## Package

pip

nautobot
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<1.6.22; >=2.0.0, < 2.2.4

## Patched versions

1.6.22, 2.2.4

## Description

### Impact

A Nautobot user with admin privileges can modify the `BANNER_TOP`, `BANNER_BOTTOM`, and `BANNER_LOGIN` configuration settings via the `/admin/constance/config/` endpoint. Normally these settings are used to provide custom banner text at the top and bottom of all Nautobot web pages (or specifically on the login page in the case of `BANNER_LOGIN`) but it was reported that an admin user can make use of these settings to inject arbitrary HTML, potentially exposing Nautobot users to security issues such as cross-site scripting (stored XSS).

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

Patches will be released as part of Nautobot 1.6.22 and 2.2.4.

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

As [described in the Nautobot documentation](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/user-guide/administration/configuration/optional-settings/#administratively-configurable-settings), these settings are only configurable through the admin UI of Nautobot if they are *not* explicitly set to some non-empty value in the `nautobot_config.py` or equivalent Nautobot configuration file. Therefore, adding the following configuration to said file completely mitigates this vulnerability in both Nautobot 1.x and 2.x:

```
BANNER_LOGIN = " "
BANNER_TOP = " "
BANNER_BOTTOM = " "
```

or alternately (Nautobot 2.x only), if those variables are not defined explicitly in your configuration file, setting the following environment variables for the Nautobot user account serves the same purpose:

```
NAUTOBOT_BANNER_LOGIN=" "
NAUTOBOT_BANNER_TOP=" "
NAUTOBOT_BANNER_BOTTOM=" "
```

Limiting all users who do not need elevated privileges to non-admin access (`is_superuser: False` and `is_staff: False`) is a partial mitigation as well.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
