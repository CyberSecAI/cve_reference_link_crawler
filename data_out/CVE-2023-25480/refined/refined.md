  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, performs unauthorized actions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website where the request is triggered. No authentication is needed, however, it does require an authenticated user to perform actions."
