[#1171](https://github.com/GeoWebCache/geowebcache/issues/1171)

This PR updates the GWC Demos Page to properly escape special characters from GeoServer catalog information. One thing to note here is that StringEscapeUtils::escapeEcmaScript is not secure when used in HTML attributes so the OWASP Encoder library is used instead.

Sorry, something went wrong.
