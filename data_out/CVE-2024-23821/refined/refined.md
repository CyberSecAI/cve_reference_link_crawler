{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The GWC Demos Page was not properly escaping special characters from the GeoServer catalog, allowing for a stored XSS vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-79"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with workspace-level privileges can store a JavaScript payload in the GeoServer catalog. When another user views the GWC Demos Page, this payload will execute in their browser. This allows the attacker to potentially fully compromise the user's session, performing actions, viewing information, modifying data, and initiating interactions with other users as if they were the victim.",
    "attack_vectors": "An authenticated administrator with workspace-level privileges can inject malicious JavaScript into the GeoServer catalog. This payload is then executed when another user views the GWC Demos Page.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker requires workspace-level privileges and the ability to modify the GeoServer catalog. A separate user must then access the GWC Demos Page to trigger the XSS."
  },
  "resolution": "The vulnerability was addressed by properly escaping special characters from the GeoServer catalog information in the GWC Demos Page using the OWASP Encoder library instead of StringEscapeUtils::escapeEcmaScript. This was done via pull request #1173 in the GeoWebCache repository, and then backported to GeoServer versions 2.23.4 and 2.24.1.",
