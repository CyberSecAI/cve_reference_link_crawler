Vulnerable URL: https://localhost/customer/account/orders/print/\*
Issue: Other users' invoices can be accessed
Affected Version: Bagisto v1.5.0
Fixed Version: Bagisto v1.5.1
Steps to reproduce:1. Login in demo account and note the invoice number of any order.2. Now logout from demo account & create an another account (ex test account).3. Now place and order. (approve and create invoice from admin panel)4. ​Now in the test user profile click on invoice print option and intercept the request ​5. Now change the id value for invoice either we can set it to the value that we have copied fromstep 1 or in case we don't know any value we can apply bruteforce6. we can view other users personal and order details.
Reference link : https://github.com/bagisto/bagisto/pull/4697
Recommendation: ​Validate users actions and their privileges before processing their request.we can alsoset such ids to unique and unguessable to make it quite difficult to guess.
CVE: CVE-2023-36238
