# Incorrect handling of `\_in` filter

Moderate

## Package

npm

directus
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>=9.23.0, <=10.5.3

## Patched versions

>=10.6.0

## Description

### Summary

Directus >=9.23.0, <=v10.5.3 improperly handles \_in, \_nin operators.

It evaluates empty arrays as valid so expressions like {"role": {"\_in": $CURRENT\_USER.some\_field}} would evaluate to true allowing the request to pass.

### Details

This results in Broken Access Control because the rule fails to do what it was intended to do: Pass rule if **field** matches any of the **values**. ref: <https://docs.directus.io/reference/filter-rules.html#filter-operators>

In my example this would translate to "Pass rule if **.role** matches any of **[]**". Which should fail. This instead passes in Directus <= v10.5.3, >=v9.23.0

### PoC

{"role": {"\_in": $CURRENT\_USER.some\_field}} field validation would pass if $CURRENT\_USER.some\_field is null.

Real scenario: Using <https://github.com/u12206050/directus-extension-role-chooser> with the specified versions of Directus (I tested on 10.0.0) allows users with access to this feature set their role to whatever role if they don't have any roles assigned (user\_roles.role is left with the default value, null) despite the validation rule being

```
validation:
    role:
      _in: $CURRENT_USER.user_roles.role
```

Latest version of Directus (v10.8.3 and above) handles the above validation rule correctly.

### Impact

Permissions fail to open for setups relying on this filter and can lead to users getting access to things they're not supposed to.

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
