{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromSafeSetMacFilter` function due to insufficient bounds checking when handling the `remark`, `type`, and `time` parameters.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
    "The vulnerability can be triggered via the `remark`, `type`, and `time` parameters in the `fromSafeSetMacFilter` function."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would likely need to send a crafted request to the `/goform/setMacFilterList` endpoint with overly long `remark`, `type` or `time` parameters, exploiting the lack of input validation in the `fromSafeSetMacFilter` function."
