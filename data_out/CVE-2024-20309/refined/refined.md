- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of specific ingress traffic when flow control hardware is enabled on the AUX port.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect handling of specific ingress traffic on the AUX port with flow control hardware enabled.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to cause the device to reset or stop responding, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by reverse telnetting to the AUX port and sending specific data after connecting.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated and have local access to the device. The attacker also needs to be able to reverse telnet to the AUX port.
