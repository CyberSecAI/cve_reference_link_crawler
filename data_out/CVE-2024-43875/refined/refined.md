The provided content relates to a fix for a bug in the Linux kernel's PCI endpoint driver.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The code in `vpci_scan_bus()` incorrectly checked the return value of `pci_scan_bus()`. It treated a non-NULL return (success) as an error and printed an error message and then likely crashed further down the line, and a NULL return (failure) as success, which would lead to further issues. Additionally, it was not returning an error code, which would prevent proper cleanup of the error.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect NULL check: The code had a reversed NULL check, leading to an error message being printed on success rather than failure.
- Lack of error handling: Upon failure to create a PCI bus, the function did not return an error code, preventing the caller from properly cleaning up resources which leads to further errors.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- System instability: The incorrect error check could lead to the system crashing.
- Resource leaks: Failure to handle errors properly can leave resources in an inconsistent state, which might lead to a resource leak.

**Attack vectors:**
- This vulnerability is not directly exploitable by external attackers.
- It can be triggered through a device driver, specifically a PCI endpoint driver that uses the `vpci_scan_bus()` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to have the ability to load/configure a device driver in the target system.

**Additional details:**
- The fix addresses the reversed NULL check and introduces proper error handling, which will also lead to cleanup of allocated resources.
- The vulnerability is reported by Smatch which is a static analysis tool.
- The bug fix has been backported to several stable kernel branches.
