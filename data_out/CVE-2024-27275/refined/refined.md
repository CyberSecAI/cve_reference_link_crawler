- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A user without sufficient privileges can configure a physical file trigger in Db2 for IBM i.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation vulnerability due to improper access control when configuring physical file triggers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A user without the necessary privileges can potentially gain elevated privileges through the exploitation of the vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:** A user exploits the ability to configure a physical file trigger in Db2 for IBM i.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be a user on the system but does not require administrative or high-level privileges before the exploit.
