Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `setSchedWifi` function of the Tenda AC7 router firmware.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when handling the `schedStartTime` and `schedEndTime` parameters passed to the `setSchedWifi` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution on the router, potentially allowing an attacker to gain full control of the device. This could further allow for network manipulation, data interception, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `setSchedWifi` function, which likely involves a web interface or an API call that allows the manipulation of the router's scheduled Wi-Fi settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to send crafted requests to the router that includes specially crafted `schedStartTime` and `schedEndTime` parameters. This likely requires network access to the router's management interface, which might be available through the local network. The specific position will depend on the router's configuration, such as whether the management interface is also accessible from the WAN.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable firmware version is specified as "Tenda AC7 V1.0 V15.03.06.44".
- The submission on VulDB references a GitHub link that likely contains further details about the vulnerability and potentially a proof of concept.
- The specific vulnerable function is `/goform/openSchedWifi setSchedWifi`.
- The overflow occurs in the handling of the `schedEndTime` parameter.
