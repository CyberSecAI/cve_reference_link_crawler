| I see [CVE-2024-43788](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4vvj-4cpr-p986 "CVE-2024-43788") was [patched](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/18700) in Webpack 5, and the CVE shows that Webpack 4 and below are affected, but are Webpack 4 and below actually affected? I don't see any code in Webpack 4 that looks like the patch that was applied to Webpack 5. |

| I'm not expecting for it to be backported, but can you confirm that it actually does affect Webpack 4 and below? If it does affect Webpack 4, I will be looking to create a patch for myself, since moving to Webpack 5 isn't an option for me. |

| I believe this is when path.publicPath is set to auto, so I don't think this needs to be patched in v4, but I'll CC [@alexander-akait](https://github.com/alexander-akait) anyways to have a clear answer. |

| webpack@4 doesn't have `CVE-2024-43788`, only webpack@5 affected  In that case, let's get the CVE updated. I have requested a change to the GitHub Advisory Database: [github/advisory-database#4750](https://github.com/github/advisory-database/pull/4750). |
