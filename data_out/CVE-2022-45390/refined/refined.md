The provided content is related to CVE-2022-45390.

**Vulnerability:** Missing permission check in loader.io Plugin allows enumerating credentials IDs.

**Root Cause:** The loader.io Plugin does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

**Weakness:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks on an HTTP endpoint.

**Impact:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can enumerate the IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. These IDs could potentially be used in other attacks to capture the credentials themselves.

**Attack Vectors:** Network access to the vulnerable Jenkins instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs Overall/Read permission within the Jenkins instance.
