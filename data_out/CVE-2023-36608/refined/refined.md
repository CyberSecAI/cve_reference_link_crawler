The provided content is related to CVE-2023-36608.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the insecure MD5 hashing algorithm to store passwords.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-327). The TBox RTUs use MD5 encryption for hashing passwords, which is considered insecure due to its susceptibility to collision attacks and other weaknesses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to the exposure of hashed passwords. This could potentially enable unauthorized access to the system or sensitive data after cracking the hash.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is network-based and can be exploited remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have low-level privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
