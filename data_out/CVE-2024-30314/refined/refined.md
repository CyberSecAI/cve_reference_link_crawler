- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** OS Command Injection (CWE-78). The application fails to properly neutralize special elements used in an OS command, leading to arbitrary command execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is not specifically detailed in this document, but is related to how the application handles OS commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** This document does not specify the required capabilities or position of the attacker other than they must be able to introduce the malicious command input to the vulnerable part of the application.

The document also notes that the vulnerability is also related to a Chromium Embedded Framework dependency.
