- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin "Responsive Pricing Table" fails to properly validate and escape user-supplied input when rendering pricing table options. Specifically, the "CSS classes", "Add custom code here", and "Button URL" fields are vulnerable. This allows the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser when viewing a page/post containing the vulnerable pricing table. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by injecting malicious JavaScript payloads into the "CSS classes", "Add custom code here", or "Button URL" fields of a pricing table and then having it displayed on a page/post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least author privileges to create or modify a pricing table. The attacker does not need to be directly logged into the admin panel. The XSS can trigger for any user who views the page/post containing the injected code.
