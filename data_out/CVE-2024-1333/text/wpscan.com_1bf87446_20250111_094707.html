## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Responsive Pricing Table < 5.1.11 - Author+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its Pricing Table options before outputting them back in a page/post where the related shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the author role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

- Create a new Pricing Table
- Fill it with valid information, except for the "CSS classes", "Add custom code here" and "Button URL " sections
- Payloads:
- CSS classes: " onmouseover='alert(/CSS/);'
- Custom Code: <script>alert(/CustomCode/);</script>
- Button URL: javascript:alert(/XSS/) (requires the Custom Code to be empty, and the '\_rpt\_open\_newwindow' post meta to be anything other than 'newwindow')
