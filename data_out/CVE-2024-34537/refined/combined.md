### Problem Description

Due to insufficient input validation, manipulated data saved in the bookmark toolbar of the backend user interface causes a general error state, blocking further access to the interface. Exploiting this vulnerability requires an administrator-level backend user account.

### Solution

Update to TYPO3 versions 10.4.46 ELTS, 11.5.40 LTS, 12.4.21 LTS, 13.3.1 that fix the problem described.

### Credits

Thanks to Hendrik Eichner who reported this issue and to TYPO3 core & security team members Oliver Hader and Benjamin Franzke who fixed the issue.

### General Advice

Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Guide](https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/CoreApiReference/Security/Index.html#security). Please subscribe to the [typo3-announce](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce) mailing list.

### General Note

All security-related code changes are tagged so you can easily look them up in our [review system](https://review.typo3.org/#/q/status:merged+project:Packages/TYPO3.CMS+topic:security,n,z).

# Denial of Service in TYPO3 Bookmark Toolbar

**TYPO3 through 12.4.6 allows, due to insufficient input validation, manipulated data saved in the bookmark toolbar of the backend user interface causes a general error state, blocking further access to the interface. Exploiting this vulnerability requires an administrator-level backend user account.**

### **Description**

The Typo3 backend allows saving bookmarks via the toolbar.

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/661e1a7d6410e21852cb939c/8ef3c496-05b9-45e0-afd9-70a8071b5f87/2024-02-21_18-01.frame.png)

The request to create a bookmark is not verified.

Typically, a JSON object containing the necessary data is sent to the server for the `arguments` parameter. The `routeIdentifier` parameter must contain one of several possible values (e.g., `record_edit` or `media_management`).

To carry out the DoS attack, the value of the `arguments` parameter (a valid example is shown in the following code block) must be set to an invalid value. An invalid value is any input that is not in JSON format or does not contain an `edit` attribute when `routeIdentifier=record_edit`.

`{"id":"2:\/formupload\/form_83e41043ea5be264fff30338878dae08a8231305\/"}`

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/661e1a7d6410e21852cb939c/162da823-7b84-43bb-b781-2d6edb747af7/2024-02-21_18-02.frame.png)

After modifying a database entry with the value `routeIdentifier=record_edit`, the Typo3 backend becomes unusable. Since admin users have the ability to define these bookmarks globally for all users, this results in the backend being inaccessible to everyone.

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/661e1a7d6410e21852cb939c/93337949-04ff-4f18-9a9d-72d1fdcb8247/2024-02-21_18-04_1.frame.png)

The incorrect database entry must be manually corrected to restore the application's functionality.

#### Assigned CVE

<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-34537>

#### Affected Component

<https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3> (typo3/cms-backend)

#### Attack Type

Remote

#### Impact Code Execution

False

#### **Attack vectors**

To exploit the vulnerability an attacker requires a valid user account in the Typo3 backend instance with the rights to create a bookmark of type *record\_edit*. After the attack no users will be able to access the Typo3 Backend until the malicious entry is fixed directly in the database.

Oct 8, 2024

## Package

composer

typo3/cms-backend
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

10.0.0-10.4.45, 11.0.0-11.5.39, 12.0.0-12.4.20, 13.0.0-13.3.0

## Patched versions

10.4.46, 11.5.40, 12.4.21, 13.3.1

## Description

### Problem

Due to insufficient input validation, manipulated data saved in the bookmark toolbar of the backend user interface causes a general error state, blocking further access to the interface. Exploiting this vulnerability requires an administrator-level backend user account.

### Solution

Update to TYPO3 versions 10.4.46 ELTS, 11.5.40 LTS, 12.4.21 LTS, 13.3.1 that fix the problem described.

### Credits

Thanks to Hendrik Eichner who reported this issue and to TYPO3 core & security team members Oliver Hader and Benjamin Franzke who fixed the issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
