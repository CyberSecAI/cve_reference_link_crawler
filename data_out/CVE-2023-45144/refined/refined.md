Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper escaping of the `identityOAuth` parameters within the `LoginUIExtension.vm` file when processing a GET request during OAuth login. This allows for the injection of XWiki syntax and Javascript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**  The primary vulnerability is XSS due to the injection of malicious JavaScript code within the unescaped URL parameters.
- **XWiki Syntax Injection:** Attackers can inject XWiki syntax which may lead to code execution through macros.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting a malicious groovy macro, it becomes possible to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** Sensitive data stored in the XWiki installation can be accessed.
- **Integrity:** Data within XWiki can be altered or deleted.
- **Availability:** The XWiki installation can be rendered unavailable.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability can be exploited from the login screen without requiring any user authentication, allowing an attacker to gain full control of the XWiki system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is carried out via a crafted GET request to the XWiki login page.
- Malicious XWiki syntax or javascript is included in the `identityOAuth` parameters of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability, so no privileges are required.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted GET request to the XWiki server.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.6 of the Identity OAuth extension.
- The specific fix was implemented in commit `d805d31`, particularly in the `LoginUIExtension.vm` file by properly escaping the input before rendering it on the page.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2023-45144 and GHSA-h2rm-29ch-wfmh.
- The severity of this vulnerability is considered "Critical".
