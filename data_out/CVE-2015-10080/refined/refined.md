The provided content relates to CVE-2015-10080.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application was not properly escaping user-controlled data before rendering it in HTML data tables. The developer mistakenly assumed that DataTables library would handle escaping by default.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of output escaping.
- Incorrect assumptions about the security of the used library.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page through user-controlled data displayed in the admin data tables.
- This could lead to various attacks like session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites, as well as arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious input can be injected via fields such as name, email, description, etc. in the admin interface.
- The attacker can craft input containing malicious Javascript that will be rendered when an admin views the data tables.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to insert malicious input into the data displayed in the admin interface data tables.
- This could be done through manipulating fields such as "first_name", "last_name", "use_description", "registration_source", etc.
- The attacker does not need to be an authenticated user on the admin interface, but could be a legitimate user that is able to add these malicious strings in fields available through the user-facing functionality or an internal user.
