- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate a parameter before using it in an `include()` function call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local File Inclusion (LFI). The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization when handling a parameter used in an include function.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include arbitrary local files on the server, which may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the vulnerable parameter `template` set to a path to a local file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
