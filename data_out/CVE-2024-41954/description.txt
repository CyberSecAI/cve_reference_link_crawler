FOG is a cloning/imaging/rescue suite/inventory management system. The application stores plaintext service account credentials in the "/opt/fog/.fogsettings" file. This file is by default readable by all users on the host. By exploiting these credentials, a malicious user could create new accounts for the web application and much more. The vulnerability is fixed in 1.5.10.41.
