Hash: SHA512
Advisory ID: SYSS-2022-010
Product: Executive Fingerprint Secure SSD
Manufacturer: Verbatim
Affected Version(s): GDMSFE01-INI3637-C VER1.1
Tested Version(s): GDMSFE01-INI3637-C VER1.1
Vulnerability Type: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky
Implementation (CWE-1240)
Risk Level: Low
Solution Status: Open
Manufacturer Notification: 2022-02-03
Solution Date: -
Public Disclosure: 2022-06-08
CVE Reference: CVE-2022-28382
Author of Advisory: Matthias Deeg (SySS GmbH)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Overview:
The Verbatim Executive Fingerprint Secure SSD is a USB drive with AES
256-bit hardware encryption and a built-in fingerprint sensor for
unlocking the device with previously registered fingerprints.
The manufacturer describes the product as follows:
"The AES 256-bit Hardware Encryption seamlessly encrypts all data on the
drive in real-time. The drive is compliant with GDPR requirements as
100% of the drive is securely encrypted. The built-in fingerprint
recognition system allows access for up to eight authorised users and
one administrator who can access the device via a password. The SSD
does not store passwords in the computer or system's volatile memory
making it far more secure than software encryption."[1]
Due to the use of an insecure encryption AES mode (Electronic Codebook),
an attacker may be able to extract information even from
encrypted data, for example by observing repeating byte patterns.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Vulnerability Details:
When analyzing the Verbatim Executive Fingerprint Secure SSD, Matthias
Deeg found out that the firmware of the USB-to-SATA bridge controller
INIC-3637EN uses AES-256 with the ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode.
This operation mode of block ciphers like AES encrypts identical
plaintext data, in this case blocks of 16 bytes, always to identical
ciphertext data.
For some data, for instance bitmap images, the lack of the cryptographic
property called diffusion concerning the ECB mode can leak sensitive
information even in encrypted data.
One famous example for this is an ECB-encrypted image of the TUX
penguin, which, for instance, is referenced in the Wikipedia article
about block cipher modes of operation[2] to illustrate this issue.
Thus, the use of the ECB operation mode can put the confidentiality of
specific information at risk, even in an encrypted form.
Additionally, in attack scenarios where an attacker has short-time
physical access to a Verbatim Executive Fingerprint Secure SSD, and
later returns it to its legitimate owner, the attacker may be able to
compromise the integrity of the stored data by exploiting the fact
that the same 16-byte plaintext blocks result in the same 16-byte
ciphertext blocks, by replacing specific encrypted 16-byte blocks with
other ones.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Proof of Concept (PoC):
The same 16 byte long plaintext pattern was written several times to an
unlocked Verbatim Executive Fingerprint Secure SSD.
When the SSD was then read using another SSD enclosure, the same 16
byte long ciphertext pattern could be observed for the corresponding
plaintext data.
