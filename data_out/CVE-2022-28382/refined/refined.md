{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of the Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode in the AES-256 hardware encryption implemented in the firmware of the USB-to-SATA bridge controller INIC-3637EN.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation (CWE-1240)",
      "The ECB mode of operation encrypts identical plaintext blocks to identical ciphertext blocks, which lacks diffusion."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker may be able to extract information from encrypted data by observing repeating byte patterns, especially in structured data like bitmap images. Additionally, an attacker with short-term physical access can potentially compromise the integrity of stored data by replacing specific encrypted 16-byte blocks with other ones, due to the deterministic nature of ECB encryption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Observing repeating byte patterns in the ciphertext to infer information about the plaintext.",
      "Replacing encrypted 16-byte blocks with other encrypted blocks to manipulate the stored data after short-term physical access."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires either the ability to analyze the encrypted data, or short-term physical access to the Verbatim storage device."

  ],
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was present in multiple Verbatim products using the same INIC-3637EN controller. The issue was addressed in the 'Store 'n' Go Secure Portable SSD' via a 'Security Update July 2022'. The other products were listed as 'Open' status, indicating a lack of patch at the time of the advisory. The vulnerability is considered 'Low' risk, but can lead to information disclosure and data integrity issues. The devices use AES 256-bit hardware encryption and a built-in keypad or fingerprint sensor for access control."
