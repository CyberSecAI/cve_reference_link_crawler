### Description

The WP-Recall – Registration, Profile, Commerce & More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation/account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 16.26.8. This is due to to plugin not properly verifying a user's identity during new order creation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to supply any email through the user\_email field and update the password for that user during new order creation. This requires the commerce addon to be enabled in order to exploit.
