  "CVE-2024-26917": {
    "description": "This commit reverts a previous fix for a potential deadlock in the FCoE driver. The reverted change introduced a different issue causing interrupts to be lost for FCoE devices. The root cause was the change of spin locks from 'bh' to 'irqsave'.",
    "affected_component": "FCoE (Fibre Channel over Ethernet) driver in the Linux kernel",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect use of spinlocks in the FCoE driver, specifically switching from 'spin_lock_bh' to 'spin_lock_irqsave'. This change introduced interrupt loss.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect locking mechanism leading to interrupt loss."
    ],
    "impact": "Loss of interrupts for FCoE devices, which can lead to device malfunction and potential data loss or system instability.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by the normal operation of FCoE devices when sending or receiving data. No specific malicious action is required to trigger the issue.",
    "required_capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities are needed. The vulnerability is triggered through normal device operations.",
        "additional_information": "The fix is a revert of a commit that attempted to address a deadlock. The correct solution involves using work queues, which are to be implemented in a separate commit."
