|  |  | # Change Log |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## [1.4.97] - 2024-02-29 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Added |
|  |  | - The `pdftk` option under `attachment` and `features` for filling in |
|  |  | `pdf template file` attachments using pdftk instead of pikepdf. |
|  |  | ### Changed |
|  |  | - During the Docker image build process, `pandoc` will run once, so |
|  |  | that the first user to assemble a document with `pandoc` will not |
|  |  | experience slowness due to LaTeX needing to generate files. |
|  |  | - Appearance streams will be generated when using `pdf template file`. |
|  |  | - Error messages related to problems in the source code will no longer |
|  |  | be displayed to the user unless the user is an administrator or |
|  |  | developer. If you want these error messages to appear to all users, |
|  |  | set `debug: True` and `development site is protected: True` in the |
|  |  | Configuration. The error messages will be available in |
|  |  | `docassemble.log`. |
|  |  | ### Fixed |
|  |  | - Fixed security issue identified by Riyush Ghimire, affecting |
|  |  | versions 1.4.53 to 1.4.96, that could cause contents of files in the |
|  |  | filesystem to be revealed. This is a high severity issue and |
|  |  | upgrading as soon as possible is recommended. |
|  |  | - Fixed security issue identified by Riyush Ghimire, affecting |
|  |  | versions up to 1.4.96, that allowed an open redirect URL to be formed. |
|  |  | - Fixed security issue identified by Riyush Ghimire, affecting |
|  |  | versions up to 1.4.96, that would allow HTML or JavaScript |
|  |  | injection. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## [1.4.96] - 2024-02-14 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Fixed |
