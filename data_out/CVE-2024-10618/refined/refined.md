Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `pda/reportshop/record_detail.php` file of Tongda OA software, versions v2017 to v11.10.
*   The `$repid` parameter in this file is not properly sanitized or processed, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can insert malicious SQL code into the `$repid` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** The provided exploit examples demonstrate the ability to extract information about the database. Specifically, the attacker can use the vulnerability to determine the name of the database.
*   **Potential for Further Database Compromise:** While the provided exploit only demonstrates database name extraction, SQL injection vulnerabilities can often be used to read, modify, or delete arbitrary data in the database.  This could lead to a complete compromise of the affected application and potentially the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out via a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `record_detail.php` endpoint.
*   **Malicious Parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `repid` parameter in the URL to include malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `repid` parameter in `pda/reportshop/record_detail.php` is vulnerable.
*   **No Authentication Required**: The exploit examples provided don't appear to require authentication. This suggests that the vulnerability is exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided content gives more detail than a typical CVE description, including:
* specific vulnerable versions
* vulnerable file
* vulnerable parameter
* an example exploit in the form of a crafted HTTP GET request
* the impact of the exploit, which in this case is database name disclosure.
