| Hi,  We‚Äôve encountered a potential issue in the **resteasy-netty4** library when handling bot requests that use HTTP smuggling techniques. In our case, we were able to reproduce the issue with an HTTP header containing an ASCII control character.  Here‚Äôs what happens:  The **Netty** `HttpObjectDecoder` transitions into the `BAD_MESSAGE` state when it processes one of these smuggling requests. The `RestEasyHttpRequestDecoder` then receives this result and responds with a `400 Bad Request`, which is expected behavior. However, the response includes a `Connection: keep-alive` header, so any subsequent request on that same connection reaches the `HttpObjectDecoder` while it's still in a bad state. This causes the request to be ignored, leading to client timeouts. This issue could pose a risk when using load balancers, as the connection in a bad state might be reused later for a legitimate client.  We‚Äôve experimented with two potential fixes that might be applied in the `RestEasyHttpRequestDecoder`:   1. Sending a `Connection: close` response header, ensuring the client closes the connection after receiving the `400 Bad Request`. 2. Calling `HttpObjectDecoder.reset()` to clear the bad state, allowing the decoder to process subsequent requests properly.   Find attached a minimal example to reproduce the problem. Just start the server and run the client, which will send one smuggling request, and then the next legitimate request will cause a timeout. [resteasy-netty-smuggler.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17281616/resteasy-netty-smuggler.zip)  We‚Äôd like to hear your thoughts on whether either of these solutions makes sense. If so, we‚Äôre happy to open a PR with the proposed fix.  Regards |

| Not yet. I've not had a chance to look into this unfortunately. I've had a CVE filed for it, <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9622>, but I've not had time to look for a fix.  [@txema-martinez-scopely](https://github.com/txema-martinez-scopely) It looks like I completely forgot to reply. If you've got a fix, please feel free to submit it. I've filed <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3553> for this.  I'll have a look this morning to see if there is a way to solve this as I need to do a release today for other reasons, but I can't guarantee a fix today. |

| Yes, I can try to open a PR with alternative solution 1 (Sending a `Connection: close` response header), which seems to me the most conservative approach |

| Excellent! Thank you [@txema-martinez-scopely](https://github.com/txema-martinez-scopely). I'm going to be a bit in and out the next couple of days so if I don't get to look at it this week, I will early next week. |

# RESTEasy

[![Github CI](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/actions)

RESTEasy is a JBoss.org project aimed at providing productivity frameworks for developing client and server RESTful
applications and services in Java. It is mainly a Jakarta RESTful Web Services implementation but you'll find some
other experimental code in the repository.

The project page can be found at <https://resteasy.dev>.

## Jakarta RESTful Web Services

RESTEasy is a JBoss project that provides various frameworks to help you build RESTful Web Services and RESTful Java
applications. It is a portable implementation of the Jakarta RESTful Web Services specification. The Jakarta RESTful Web
Services provides a Java API for RESTful Web Services over the HTTP protocol. Please note that the specification is now
under the [Jakarta EE Project](https://github.com/jakartaee). You can read the entire specification at
[Jakarta RESTful Web Services](https://github.com/jakartaee/rest).

## Getting started with RESTEasy

* Read a [book](https://resteasy.dev/books)
* Check out the [examples](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy-examples) in the repository.
* Read the [documentation](https://resteasy.dev/docs).
* View the [blogs](https://resteasy.dev/blogs).

## Documentation

To read the documentation you can [read it online](https://resteasy.dev/docs).

## Issues

Issues are kept in [JIRA](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY/).

## Build

Currently, RESTEasy requires JDK 11+.

If you want to build the project without running the tests, you need to pull down a clone of the RESTEasy repository and
run:

```
$ ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests=true
```

If you want to build the project with testings run, you may need to specify a profile to use, and may need to configure
the WildFly version you want to run the tests with. Here is an example:

```
$ SERVER_VERSION=27.0.0.Final ./mvnw clean -fae -Dserver.version=$SERVER_VERSION install
```

## Contribute

When an HTTP smuggling request with an ASCII control character is sent, it causes the Netty HttpObjectDecoder to transition into a BAD\_MESSAGE state. As a result, any subsequent legitimate requests on the same connection are ignored, leading to client timeouts, which may impact systems using load balancers and expose them to risk. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2317179#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-10-08 08:47:14 UTC  ``` The issue stems from the re-use of a connection that remains in a bad state after handling a smuggled request. While a 400 Bad Request is returned (expected), the Connection: keep-alive header allows the bad connection to persist, causing subsequent legitimate requests to fail. Possible fixes include closing the connection or resetting the decoder state.   ``` |  |
