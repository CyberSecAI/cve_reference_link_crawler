Flatsome đã được mọi người khén nhiều lắm rồi. Nếu bạn sử dụng Flatsome mà ko dùng pluguins này thì đúng là một thiếu sót. Đúng là như hổ thêm cánh, xứng đáng gọi plugin này là Flatsome Plus :)).
cảm ơn tác giá vì plugin bổ ích này.

### [Sản phẩm quá tuyệt vời](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/san-pham-qua-tuyet-voi/)

Đây là 1 plugin hoàn toàn miễn phí và luôn được cập nhật tức thời mỗi khi flatsome có phiên bản mới. Tôi nghĩ nếu như ai đánh giá sản phẩm này kém thì người đó đang thể hiện sự ghen ăn tức ỉa bởi vì bản thân họ vốn không có tạo được 1 plugin như này chính vì thế họ mới không muốn người khác biết đến nó

### Description

The UX Flat plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'button' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 4.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
