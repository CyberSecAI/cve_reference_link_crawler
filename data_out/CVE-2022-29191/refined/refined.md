{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `tf.raw_ops.GetSessionTensor` implementation does not validate that the input `handle` is a scalar, leading to a crash if it's not.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing input validation",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (crash)",
  "Attack vectors": "By providing a non-scalar tensor as input to `tf.raw_ops.GetSessionTensor`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to provide input to the `tf.raw_ops.GetSessionTensor` function"
