# JVN#83440451 Multiple Safie products vulnerable to improper server certificate verification

## Overview

Multiple Safie products are vulnerable to improper server certificate verification.

## Products Affected

* QBiC CLOUD CC-2L v1.1.30 and earlier
* Safie One v1.8.2 and earlier

## Description

Multiple Safie products are vulnerable to improper server certificate verification ([CWE-295](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html)).

The product can be operated via port 11029/TCP and Bluetooth, and its communications are AES encrypted. The product user can obtain the encryption key from the cloud server based on the device-specific information. The user who has obtained the device-specific information can directly operate the device (even if it is not owned by the user).

## Impact

A man-in-the-middle attack may allow an attacker to obtain and/or alter communications of the affected product, resulting in arbitrary OS command execution.

## Solution

**Update the Software**

Update the software to the latest version according to the information provided by the developer.

In addition to the update for the affected products, a security measure is deployed on the cloud server side on July 24, 2024.
