- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Brocade SANnav stores SNMPv3 authentication passwords in plaintext.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Storage of sensitive data (SNMPv3 authentication passwords) in cleartext.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A privileged user could retrieve the plaintext SNMP credentials by accessing the log files or the SANnav SupportSave capture if triggered after an SNMP configuration failure.
- **Attack vectors:** Access to log files or SANnav SupportSave.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a privileged user with knowledge and access to the log files, or able to trigger the conditions that lead to a SANnav SupportSave capture after SNMP configuration failure.
