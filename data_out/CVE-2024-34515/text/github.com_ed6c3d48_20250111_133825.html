| It seems that your test case includes some exceptional scenarios that cause the creation of the Image object to throw an error, preventing it from entering the copy function. I am a security researcher, not a developer, so I can only offer ideas for fixes. You can rely on the code snippet I've written to modify it to fit the test cases. |
