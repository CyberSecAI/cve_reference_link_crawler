Based on the provided information, the content is related to CVE-2022-49004.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The EFI page table is initially created as a copy of the kernel page table. With `VMAP_STACK` enabled, kernel stacks are allocated in the vmalloc area. If a stack is allocated in a new Page Global Directory (PGD) that was not present when the EFI page table was created (or not synced in a previous vmalloc fault), a trap will occur when the kernel switches to the EFI page table and accesses the vmalloc kernel stack. This results in a kernel panic.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the inconsistent synchronization between the kernel's main page table and the EFI page table. Specifically, the kernel mappings in the EFI page table are not updated when new PGDs are allocated in the vmalloc area which can occur when `VMAP_STACK` is enabled. This lack of synchronization leads to a situation where the EFI page table doesn't have valid mappings for vmalloc kernel stacks, causing a trap and kernel panic upon access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is a kernel panic. This can cause a denial of service, potentially crashing the system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves triggering the use of the EFI runtime services with `VMAP_STACK` enabled, such that a kernel stack is allocated in a new PGD in the vmalloc area that is not present in the efi page table. This will then cause a kernel trap when switching to the efi page table and accessing the vmalloc stack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to trigger the use of EFI runtime services after a kernel stack has been allocated in the vmalloc area. This likely requires some form of privileged access, or the ability to trigger a specific code path that uses efi services.
