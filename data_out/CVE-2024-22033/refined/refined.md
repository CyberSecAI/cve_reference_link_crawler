The content relates to CVE-2024-22033.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `obs-service-download_url` service was vulnerable to argument injection. Specifically, the `url` parameter was not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject additional arguments to the `wget` command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Argument injection vulnerability in the `obs-service-download_url` service.
- Lack of proper sanitization of the `url` parameter.
- Improper handling of spaces in the `url` parameter, which could be exploited to inject additional arguments to `wget`.
- Initial attempts to fix the vulnerability focused on blacklisting rather than whitelisting, which proved insufficient.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject arbitrary arguments into the `wget` command, potentially leading to arbitrary file writes and other malicious actions on the server or developer system where the service is running.
- Although the services on the SUSE server are running in containers, and therefore the risk is somewhat limited on their servers, the vulnerability also affects developer systems where services are executed.
- The impact was initially rated as high for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA:H), but later considered to be potentially lower (CIA:L) due to sandboxing on the server and local execution with user privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a crafted URL containing malicious arguments via the `<param name="url">` tag.
- The vulnerability could be exploited by injecting arguments using spaces within the URL parameter, which would then be passed to `wget`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to influence the `url` parameter passed to `obs-service-download_url`.
- The attacker can be an authenticated user within the system where the service is being executed as it's executed on developer systems as well.
