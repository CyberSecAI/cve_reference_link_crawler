| [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1227203#c2)  Adrian Schröter   2024-07-02 16:40:05 UTC  ``` Thanks for that report!  Please review my first attempt to solve this, need to think if there are further ways to inject a parameter tomorrow:   <https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-service-download_url/commit/54c08bf2d466ea5d55f77bb1185dab9018d9e5e8>  just for the record, the services on our server are running in addition in containers, so we should not have a risk on our server. But it is definitive a problem because services are also executed on developer systems. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1227203#c3)  Johannes Segitz   2024-07-03 07:15:11 UTC  ``` I'm giving a training today and tomorrow, so I can't look into this in detail. But I think this is not sufficient. Can you test your change with this change in the exploit:     <param name="url"> --output-document=/srv/obs/service/.wgetrc</param>  I assume the whitespace gets ignored upon execution.  In general don't blacklist but whitelist allowed entries. Otherwise it's very tricky to get this right ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1227203#c4)  Adrian Schröter   2024-07-03 07:28:48 UTC  ``` indeed .. I modifed the code now to ensure that url is handled as single argument in any case. so any spaces can not be used anymore to prefix or hand over multiple arguments.  <https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-service-download_url/commit/d330e267997689eb8d2bc473f8d8b6c9a6a201ae> ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1227203#c5)  Adrian Schröter   2024-07-03 07:29:53 UTC  ``` the whitelist would need to be always in sync with wget protocol support, so I'd like to avoid it. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1227203#c6)  Johannes Segitz   2024-07-10 14:07:20 UTC  ``` So I can get the exploit still working with the current version. I suggest you add a sanity check for the URL and restrict it to strings starting with /http|ftp/i ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1227203#c7)  Adrian Schröter   2024-07-10 15:08:53 UTC  ``` k, I missed to solve it for url argument as well, but is supposed to be solved in git now.  tagged as version 0.2.1 and ready to go out, when you give me the okay. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1227203#c8)  Johannes Segitz   2024-07-10 15:12:31 UTC  ``` After the recent version I can't get it working anymore  Please use CVE-2024-22033 for this ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1227203#c9)  Adrian Schröter   2024-07-11 13:28:17 UTC  ``` okay, releasing 0.2.1 now. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1227203#c10)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2024-07-11 14:05:02 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1227203) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1186878> Factory / obs-service-download_url <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1186879> Backports:SLE-15-SP5 / obs-service-download_url <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1186880> Backports:SLE-15-SP6 / obs-service-download_url ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1227203#c11)  Marcus Meissner   2024-07-11 15:16:50 UTC  ``` i rated it, but open for other input:  8	3.1	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1227203#c12)  Johannes Segitz   2024-07-12 08:30:05 UTC  ``` Could also see CIA as L due to the sandboxing on the server and the fact that it runs with user privileges in a local context. But both are fine ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1227203#c13)  Marcus Meissner   2024-07-15 13:05:19 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2024:0199-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
