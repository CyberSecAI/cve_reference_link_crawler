- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress MWW Disclaimer Buttons plugin <= 3.0.2 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user inputs, leading to an XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts (such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads) into a website. These scripts will be executed when users visit the site, potentially leading to user compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects malicious scripts into the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs administrative privileges to inject malicious scripts through the plugin's settings.
