## Description

Are you looking for beautiful Elementor templates for your site? Glad you have found this plugin.

We bring you well designed & responsive templates for your landing pages. [Check templates live here.](https://apollo13themes.com/rife-elementor-extensions/)

Current templates are:

* *Pile* ‚Äì (New!)nice looking Elementor template prepared especially for an Architecture Studio but, it also great for developers.
* *Loma* ‚Äì excellent template for use on a **personal website** where you can describe you **Resume** and your portfolio.
* *Shore* ‚Äì is a perfect template for presenting your company or product. It also works great as a **landing page** or one page!.
* *Ava* ‚Äì also works great when creating a description of your company, but you can also use it to prepare **About us page**.
* *Bold* ‚Äì Bold is another **universal Elementor template** that you can use for any purpose.

Additionally, a plugin has a special writing effect widget for Elementor. You can see it used in our templates.

Writing effect offers you to create titles that are half static, and half written as user scrolls to it. You can achieve with it very interesting effects, of animated text.

It can be found under name ‚ÄúWriting Effect Headline‚Äù in ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù Widgets in Elementor edit screen.

**This plugin requires Elementor page builder plugin to be active.**

I was so impressed with Apollo13 (I originally came across their amazing themes on Themeforest years ago) and their design skills and support that I upgraded to the amazing yearly Pro version (for unlimited theme and plugin use) but just the free version of their plugin here is a #winWIN 100! #RIFEROCKS!!

Works really well! although I do wish there was a feature to add specified times per line, as well as a flashing cursor instead of a solid black line.
