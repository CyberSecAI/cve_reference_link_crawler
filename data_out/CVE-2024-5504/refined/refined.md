Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2024-5504:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the Rife Elementor Extensions & Templates plugin's "Writing Effect Headline" widget. Specifically, the 'tag' attribute of the widget is not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to sanitize the 'tag' attribute allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts. This injected script is then stored in the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view a page containing the vulnerable widget.
*   **Website Compromise:** This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, data theft, and redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through the 'tag' attribute of the "Writing Effect Headline" widget.
*   An attacker injects a malicious script into the 'tag' attribute when creating or editing a page/post.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Contributor+ Access:** An attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to be able to create or edit pages and posts that utilize the vulnerable widget.

**Additional Details from the provided Content:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.2.1.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.2 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `writing-effect-headline.php` file of the plugin, specifically within the `content_template` function where the tag is rendered.
* The fix included using `elementor.helpers.validateHTMLTag` to sanitize the tag.
