Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization of the `indevice` parameter within the `/view/vpn/autovpn/sxh_vpnlic.php` file of the Ruijie RG-UAC device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The `indevice` parameter, received via a POST request, is directly concatenated into the `get_ip.addr_details` function without proper sanitization.
*   This controllable parameter is then passed to an `exec` function, leading to command execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the Ruijie RG-UAC device.
*   This can lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service, and other malicious activities depending on the attacker's objective.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to `/view/vpn/autovpn/sxh_vpnlic.php` with a malicious `indevice` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Ruijie RG-UAC device.
*   **No Authentication Mentioned:** The provided information does not specify whether authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   It is possible that this is an unauthenticated RCE, however this would require further verification.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerable software is identified as Ruijie RG-UAC version 1.0
*   The vulnerability was reported on github by user L1OudFd8cl09
*   The vulnerability was submitted to VulDB by user chazzhou
