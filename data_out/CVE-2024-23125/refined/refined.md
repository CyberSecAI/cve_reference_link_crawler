```
Root cause of vulnerability: A maliciously crafted SLDPRT file, when parsed by Autodesk applications via ODXSW_DLL.dll, can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stack-based buffer overflow

Impact of exploitation: A successful exploit can lead to a crash, sensitive data disclosure, or arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.

Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious SLDPRT file within an affected Autodesk application.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to create a malicious SLDPRT file and convince a user to open it.
