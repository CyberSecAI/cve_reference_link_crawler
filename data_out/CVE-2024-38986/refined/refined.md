- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `@75lb/deep-merge` NPM module relies on vulnerable merge methods from lodash to merge objects, which allows for prototype pollution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a prototype pollution issue, where an attacker can manipulate the prototype of an object by using special properties like `__proto__` and `constructor.prototype`. This can lead to the modification of built-in `Object.prototype`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to the alteration of the behavior of all objects inheriting from the affected prototype. This can result in denial of service, remote code execution, or cross-site scripting attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can inject malicious payloads containing `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` properties into the input data passed to the vulnerable merge function of the library.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to control the input data that is passed to the vulnerable merge function of the library.

The content also provides a PoC that demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability and states that version `1.1.2` has a fix.
