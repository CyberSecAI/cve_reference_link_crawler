Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28704:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **Improper Access Control**. Specifically, the Rakuten Casa device is configured by default to accept SSH connections from the WAN side.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Default SSH access:** The device allows SSH connections from the internet (WAN side) by default.
*   **Default Credentials:** The device is shipped with default credentials, which if left unchanged, allow unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote attacker, exploiting the default SSH configuration and default credentials, can log in with root privileges.
*   Successful login grants the attacker the ability to perform arbitrary operations on the Rakuten Casa device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability via the internet through the device's WAN interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to reach the Rakuten Casa device via the internet.
*   The attacker requires knowledge of the default credentials for the device, which are "admin" for both username and password.
*   The device must have its default SSH settings enabled, allowing connections from the WAN side.

**Summary:**
This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain full control of the Rakuten Casa device by exploiting the exposed SSH service on the WAN interface and the usage of default credentials, if those default credentials have not been changed by the user.
