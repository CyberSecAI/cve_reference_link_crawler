| Hello Session team  I will test your solution once implemented to verify that everything works correctly.  However, doing an analysis of the code, it seems to me that you should take into account step 4, which I will show you below:  Link: <https://labs.f-secure.com/blog/how-secure-is-your-android-keystore-authentication>  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51862990/171072006-b3fbb174-2eb9-4dd8-90cc-35cfa274023e.png) [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51862990/171076962-3907d869-1552-451b-ae5e-f4a431aa44bb.png)  I mention this, because it seems that the onAuthenticationSucceeded method still depends on a boolean.  If the cryptographic verification works well, it returns true. However, the correct thing would be that it will retrieve the encryption object from the parameter and USE this encryption object to decrypt some other crucial data, such as the session key **(by "session key" I do not mean the private key of the session app. I simply mean a unique identifier of the user's session)** or a secondary symmetric key that will be used to decrypt the application data.  In this way, an attacker could no longer simply hook into the process so that the function returns true, because now we are dealing with cryptographically sound processes, which if we do not have the corresponding key to decrypt the data, then we will not be able to enter the app.  If you want some guidance with this, I invite you to see the following project, which is an app that implements biometric authentication in a secure way: <https://github.com/FSecureLABS/android-keystore-audit/tree/master/keystorecrypto-app>  Finally, you can check this link where it is explained in even more detail how to solve this problem so that the fingerprint protections cannot be bypassed definitively: <https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/mobile-security-testing-guide/android-testing-guide/0x05f-testing-local-authentication#biometric-library>  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51862990/171075614-d64e41e4-c6dc-4812-9c9c-efc4c0788388.png)  **Remember not to reuse keys and not to leave them exposed in RAM for a long time !!**  Regards, [@Retr02332](https://github.com/Retr02332) |

| [@Retr02332](https://github.com/Retr02332)  I think the issue presented with that approach is that it would require refactoring the application's keystore which provides the ability to decrypt the key information for the user's profile to depend on the biometric-backed key. In the event that a user entrolls a new fingerprint, or turns off biometric security on their device, this key would no longer work and lock the user out of Session, requiring them to restore their account again. Currently the refactored AuthenticationCallback uses a signature and certificate mechanism, which generates a signature from the CryptoObject parameter (unlocked after biometric authentication), then verifies that signing random data with that key matches what is expected, otherwise preventing someone from opening the application. It prevents the original approach to attack the process returning a successful authentication without requiring a major refactor or depending on a key which may be erased external to the application process for crucial data.  Does this make sense to you and sync up with your understanding? |

| Hi [@hjubb](https://github.com/hjubb)  You may perform cryptographic procedures with the cryptobject object. However, the proposed check results in a boolean:  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51862990/171190505-525f8df3-7601-48d7-9f05-a3cdfca4bd9e.png)  With this, nothing would prevent an attacker from hooking into the process so that this function always returns true. This is why in this OWASP document we can see the following statement:  Link: <https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/mobile-security-testing-guide/android-testing-guide/0x05f-testing-local-authentication>  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51862990/171187485-7ed22665-dfcd-4dc3-89c2-f00449361a5f.png)  It is necessary to adopt the approach I have mentioned to avoid bypassing biometric authentication, even on rooted devices. This is because if the approach I mentioned to you is adopted, an attacker no matter how much he hooks into the process, would not be able to bypass authentication, since for the user's session to be unlocked a symmetric key must first be recovered with the help of the cryptobject after a successful biometric authentication.  As you see, it is no longer a matter of reimplementing a function in memory so that it returns true forever (the bypass), but we are now facing solid cryptographic process that if we do not have the keys that will help us decrypt the information needed to continue (keys that will be obtained after a successful biometric authentication with the help of the cryptobject), then we will not be able to enter the application.  Finally, you tell me that "it would require refactoring the application keystore that provides the ability to decrypt the user's profile key information to trust the biometric-backed key". This is true, but only if the user has configured biometric fingerprint authentication as the system protection method.  Regards, [@Retr02332](https://github.com/Retr02332) |

| [@hjubb](https://github.com/hjubb) The original problem was solved. That is, now a Cryptobject is used, so the validation of the fingerprint no longer depends on the result of the event handler.  However, please note the recommendations given to improve the patch. |

| Regarding the further recommendations, I am currently trying to understand in which context the signature verification boolean return statement - after using the crypto object which is only unlocked after biometric authentication by the KeyStore - would be an attack surface. I believe the `CryptoObject` returned via the biometric authentication callback will throw a security exception if it is used in a locked state before this check is performed, and I would assume the threat model of an unlocked device (is a rooted device required?) would have different opportunities to circumvent even the requirement of a fingerprint in the first place. Please let me know if I'm on the right track here or if I'm missing something and if you could elaborate on the requirements of the state of the device and OS (root, physically unlocked etc) to perform such a procedure. |

So could you approve this patch that you have made and then I could test the patch in a practical way.  In case I find the bypass in the way I raised you above, then I will send you a mail as I did with this finding.  Regards. |

| Hey [@Retr02332](https://github.com/Retr02332) at the moment the further points you have raised aren't practical to implement from an application perspective. It is not really practical to take into consideration an attack relying on full root control of an unlocked device which has been configured with appropriate screen locks or to completely re-architect the application in a way that would rely on such defences which would leave a user's application unusable by turning off or adding additional fingerprints on a device from the settings menu forcing them to re-sync their account. If there are further practical implementations we can look at discussing them and implementing them further but for now I think it is sufficient 👍 |
