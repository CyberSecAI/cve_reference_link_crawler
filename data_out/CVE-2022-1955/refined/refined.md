{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application's fingerprint lock can be bypassed due to the lack of adequate security controls to prevent dynamic code manipulation. The onAuthenticationSucceeded method is triggered when the system successfully authenticates a user. Most biometric authentication implementations rely on this method being called, without properly utilizing the CryptoObject.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Access Control",
       "Insufficient security controls to prevent dynamic code manipulation",
      "Reliance on the onAuthenticationSucceeded callback method without proper validation of the CryptoObject",
      "Failure to use the CryptoObject for encrypting/decrypting crucial data"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with physical access to the victim's device can bypass the application's fingerprint lock and access user data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Physical access to the victim's device",
       "Dynamic code manipulation using tools like Frida"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Physical access to the device, ability to install and use Frida, basic understanding of Android development and Java."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "patch_bypass": "The initial patch attempted to use a signature and certificate mechanism, verifying a signature from the CryptoObject. This was also bypassed by hooking into the BiometricSecretProvider.verifySignature method to always return true.",
    "recommendation": "The application should use the CryptoObject to decrypt a crucial piece of data, such as a session key or secondary symmetric key. This would prevent an attacker from bypassing authentication simply by hooking into the process and making the callback return true."
