- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of arguments passed to specific configuration commands within the Cisco Routed PON Controller software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root on the PON controller.
- **Attack vectors**: Authenticated, remote attacker with Administrator-level privileges on the PON Manager or direct access to the PON Manager MongoDB instance can exploit the vulnerability by including crafted input as the argument of an affected configuration command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker must have administrator-level privileges on the PON Manager or direct access to the PON Manager MongoDB instance.
