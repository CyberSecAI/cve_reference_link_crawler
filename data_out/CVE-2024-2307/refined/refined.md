Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2307

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A race condition exists in `osbuild-composer` when handling package repositories. Specifically, the `checkgpg` setting of third-party repositories can be unintentionally shared when an additional repository with GPG checking disabled is present. In certain situations, the insecure setting overrides the secure one.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Race condition during the configuration of package repositories' GPG verification settings.
- Improper handling of GPG verification settings leading to potential bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- GPG verification for package repositories can be disabled.
- This could allow a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, enabling the installation of untrusted code into the image being built.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to introduce a third-party repository with RPMs they want to install into the build and additionally add a repository with disabled GPG checking. The vulnerability occurs during the image building process using `osbuild-composer`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious package repository.
- The attacker does not need to be present on the target system, but rather be able to influence the build configuration.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in `osbuild-composer` version 94.
- Red Hat Security Advisories RHSA-2024:2119 and RHSA-2024:2961 were issued to fix the vulnerability in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 and 8 respectively.
- The fix involves a commit that addresses the shared `checkgpg` setting issue.

This information is more detailed than the typical CVE description which just states that a race condition may disable GPG verification.
