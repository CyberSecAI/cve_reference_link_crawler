- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Integer overflow or wraparound in the FortiOS SSLVPN memory allocator.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow leading to heap corruption. Specifically, a large allocation size is requested, causing the integer used to track size to wrap to a small value. Then a smaller buffer is allocated on the heap, and data is written beyond the allocated space.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Potentially arbitrary code execution due to heap corruption.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specifically crafted requests to SSLVPN service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely by sending malicious requests to the vulnerable SSLVPN service.
