Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The CODESYS OPC UA stack incorrectly calculates the required buffer size for received requests/responses.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
-  Incorrect calculation of buffer size (CWE-131).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A crash of the CODESYS runtime system during the subsequent initialization of the receive buffer with zero, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious OPC UA client sends a crafted request to a CODESYS product with an affected CODESYS OPC UA server.
- A CODESYS product with an affected CODESYS OPC UA client connects to a malicious OPC UA server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected CODESYS device.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects both the CODESYS OPC UA Server and Client implementations.
- A mitigation is available by limiting the maximum array length of the OPC UA stack, however, the recommended fix is to upgrade to a patched version.
- The vulnerability was reported by ABB Schweiz AG and coordinated by CERT@VDE.
