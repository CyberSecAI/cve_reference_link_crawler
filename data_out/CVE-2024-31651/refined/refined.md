- Root cause of vulnerability: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing and displaying it. Specifically, the "First Name" field allows arbitrary JavaScript code to be injected.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application is vulnerable to the injection of malicious JavaScript code through the "First Name" input field during user registration.
- Impact of exploitation: The injected JavaScript code can be executed by any user accessing the page, potentially leading to:
    - Account takeover (via session cookie theft)
    - Stealing sensitive data
    - Modifying webpage content
    - Redirection to malicious sites
- Attack vectors: The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious HTTP POST request to the `/cbpos/classes/Master.php?f=register` URL, injecting a JavaScript payload in the "First Name" parameter. The payload is stored in the database and executed when the user data is displayed.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and needs to be able to create a new user account. The attacker does not need any prior authentication.
