Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Vulnerability 1:** The issue stems from how GitLab handles inherited group membership and permissions when a user is removed from a group. Specifically, when a user has inherited "Allowed to push and merge" access on protected branches, removing them from the top-level group does not revoke the access to protected branches on the project.
*   **Vulnerability 2:** The vulnerability arises from inconsistent enforcement of deploy key permissions between public and private projects. While the documentation states that non-project members cannot push to protected branches using deploy keys, this is not enforced for public projects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inconsistent Permission Handling:** When a user has inherited access to a project through group membership, removing the user from the group does not revoke push and merge access to protected branches.
*   **Incorrect Enforcement of Documentation:** The documentation states that deploy keys cannot be used by non-project members to push to protected branches. However, this is not enforced for public projects.
*   **Lack of Access Control on Public Projects:** Public projects do not enforce the same deploy key access restrictions as private projects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Write Access:** A non-project member can gain or retain write access to protected branches of public projects using deploy keys.
*   **Code Manipulation:** An attacker can modify the project's code, including the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, potentially injecting malicious content and CI/CD variables exfiltration.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Hijacking:** While the attacker cannot directly trigger a pipeline, if a project member commits changes without inspecting `.gitlab-ci.yml` a pipeline could be triggered automatically, leading to exfiltration of CI/CD variables.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Project Membership Manipulation:** An attacker can be added to a group to inherit push access to a project, and then removed from the group.
*   **Deploy Key Abuse:** An attacker can exploit the ability to use deploy keys on public projects to push to protected branches even after losing direct membership.
*   **Malicious CI/CD Pipeline Injection:** An attacker could inject malicious content into the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file and exfiltrate environment variables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Initial Group Membership:** The attacker needs to be a maintainer of the top-level group to gain project access.
*   **Access to Project Settings:** The attacker needs to be able to modify protected branch settings within the project and add deploy keys.
*   **Ability to Commit Changes:** The attacker needs to be able to use git commands to push changes.

In summary, this report details a privilege escalation issue where non-project members can retain or gain write access to protected branches of public projects through inconsistent permission handling of group memberships and improper enforcement of deploy key restrictions.
