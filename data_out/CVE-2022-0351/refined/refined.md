{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper recursion limit during the parsing of nested parenthesis in expressions, leading to a stack overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack overflow",
      "Insufficient recursion limit"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can cause a denial-of-service (application crash) due to a stack overflow.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted input with deeply nested parenthesis"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to provide input to the vulnerable application (Vim)"
    ],
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in Vim's expression evaluation logic. Specifically, when parsing expressions containing many nested parentheses, the function `eval7()` recursively calls itself, and without a recursion limit it overflows the stack. The fix adds a check to the function that limits recursion to 1000 levels, avoiding the stack overflow."
