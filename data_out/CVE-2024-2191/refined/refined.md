- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The GitLab application fails to properly enforce visibility restrictions on merge request titles when viewing branch information. Specifically, when a project has "Merge Requests" visibility set to "Only Project Members," the titles of merge requests are still revealed in the tooltip when hovering over the merge request icon on the branches page, even to users who are not project members.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure vulnerability. The application does not correctly filter and restrict access to the merge request title information based on the defined visibility settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized users can view merge request titles that were intended to be private, potentially exposing sensitive information about ongoing development efforts, feature plans, or other confidential data.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can navigate to the public branches page of a GitLab project and hover over merge request icons to view the titles, even without being a project member.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs no specific privileges and can be an unauthenticated user. They only need the URL of the public project's branches page.
