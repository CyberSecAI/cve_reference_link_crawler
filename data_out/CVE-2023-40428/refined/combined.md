Selecting Don't Install will present the option the next time you
connect your iOS device.  The automatic update process may take up to
a week depending on the day that iTunes or the device checks for
updates. You may manually obtain the update via the Check for Updates
button within iTunes, or the Software Update on your device.  To
check that the iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad has been updated:  *
Navigate to Settings * Select General * Select About. The version
after applying this update will be "iOS 17 and iPadOS 17".
