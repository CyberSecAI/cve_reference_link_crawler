- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before being rendered in the application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a victim's browser, which may lead to complete compromise of the affected user's session or account.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, requiring the attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application that will be stored and later rendered to other users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A low-privileged attacker can exploit this vulnerability if they are able to store malicious scripts in the application. A user interaction is required, which is to visit the page where the malicious script is stored to trigger the vulnerability.
