- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce reuse.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core issue is the reuse of CSP nonces, which weakens the security provided by CSP by potentially allowing an attacker to bypass CSP protections.
- **Impact of exploitation:** If an XSS vector is found, the nonce reuse vulnerability would allow the attack to bypass CSP, leading to a successful compromise of user sessions and potentially allowing for unauthorized data access, modification, and possibly even denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network based, requiring the attacker to send a malicious request to the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires low privileges and no user interaction, also, a high level of complexity is required to successfully exploit the vulnerability. The attacker also needs to identify an XSS vector to leverage this vulnerability.
