# CSP Nonce Reuse Vulnerability

Moderate

[jomaxro](/jomaxro)
published
GHSA-9f52-624j-8ppq
Jul 11, 2023

## Package

Discourse
(Discourse)

## Affected versions

stable <= 3.0.4; beta <= 3.1.0.beta5; tests-passed <= 3.1.0.beta5

## Patched versions

stable >= 3.0.5; beta >= 3.1.0.beta6; tests-passed >= 3.1.0.beta6

## Description

### Impact

A CSP (Content Security Policy) nonce reuse vulnerability could allow XSS attacks to bypass CSP protection. There are no known XSS vectors at the moment, but should one be discovered, this vulnerability would allow the XSS attack to completely bypass CSP.

### Patches

The vulnerability is patched in the latest tests-passed, beta and stable branches.

### Workarounds

A workaround to prevent the vulnerability is to disable Google Tag Manager, i.e., unset the `gtm container id` setting.

### Severity

Moderate

6.8

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
