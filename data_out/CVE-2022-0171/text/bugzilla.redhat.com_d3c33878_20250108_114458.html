| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2038940#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2022-01-10 15:25:11 UTC  ``` The existing KVM SEV API has a vulnerability that allows a non-root (host) user-level application to crash the host kernel by creating a confidential guest VM instance in AMD CPU that supports SEV.  Upstream fix:  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=bb4ce2c65881a2b9bdcd384f54a260a12a89dd91>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2038940#c2)  juneau    2022-01-19 15:50:50 UTC  ``` OSD notaffected.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2038940#c3)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2022-05-12 15:27:32 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2084659](show_bug.cgi?id=2084659 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2022-0171 kernel: KVM: cache incoherence issue in SEV API may lead to kernel crash [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2038940#c4)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2022-05-13 08:33:27 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=2038940#c0): > Upstream fix: >  > <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/> > ?id=bb4ce2c65881a2b9bdcd384f54a260a12a89dd91  More specific commit: <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=683412ccf61294d727ead4a73d97397396e69a6b>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2038940#c5)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2022-05-13 08:40:18 UTC  ``` AMD SEV-ES support was introduced in upstream kernel v5.10:  <http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/2010.1/05072.html>  RHEL-6 and RHEL-7 kernels are not affected by this flaw as they did not include support for SEV-ES (not even SEV, FWIW).   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2038940#c7)  Justin M. Forbes    2022-06-29 16:20:24 UTC  ``` This was fixed for Fedora with the 5.18.4 stable kernel rebases.   ``` |  |
