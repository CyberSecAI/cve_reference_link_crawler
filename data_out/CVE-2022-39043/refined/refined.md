```
Root cause of vulnerability: The Juiker app stores debug logs containing sensitive information in the phone's external storage (e.g., SD card).

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Information Leakage. The debug logs containing sensitive data are stored in a location accessible without requiring special permissions.

Impact of exploitation: A local attacker can gain access to sensitive user information, such as the user's contacts within the Juiker app.

Attack vectors: Local access to the device's external storage.

Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs local access to the device where the vulnerable Juiker app is installed. No special permissions are required.
