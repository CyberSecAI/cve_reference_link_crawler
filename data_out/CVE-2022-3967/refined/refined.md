The provided content relates to a commit that fixes a Sed injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of input before being used in a `sed` command, potentially leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Sed injection vulnerability. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from how user-provided input is used within sed commands. If input isn't properly sanitized before being passed to sed, it can be manipulated to execute arbitrary commands on the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable script via the sed command.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker would need to be able to control or influence the input parameters that are passed to the `sed` command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to inject malicious code via the input values provided to the shell script. This could be through a variety of avenues, depending on how the script is invoked and where it obtains its inputs.

The commit introduces several changes to address this:

-   **`format_no_quotes()` function:** This function checks if a given input string contains single or double quotes and flags it as invalid if found. This prevents the injection of characters that might be interpreted as commands within the `sed` command.
-   **`is_no_new_line_format()` function:** This function checks if the input string contains newline characters and flags the input as invalid if found. This is done by checking if the input after being piped to `head -n1` is still the same, thereby checking for new lines.
-   **`is_format_valid()` function:** This function now calls the `format_no_quotes()` function for all arguments to prevent injection.
- These new functions are incorporated into the `is_format_valid` function and are used to validate certain parameters passed to the script, ensuring that the arguments do not contain quotes or newlines, preventing injection of malicious code.
