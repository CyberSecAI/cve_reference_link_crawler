| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2263139#c0)  TEJ RATHI    2024-02-07 07:18:17 UTC  ``` Since Vert.x 4.3.4 that leads to a memory leak when a TCP server is configured with TLS and SNI support: when such server processes an unknown SNI server name, that is a server name that would be assigned the default certificate instead of a server name mapped certificate, the SSL context will be cached in the server name map. This map should only contain server names for which the configuration provides a valid certificate. As a consequence, this can be exploited by client sending TLS client hello message with the server name extension indicating spurious server names and eventually trigger a JVM out of memory error.   This affects only TLS servers with SNI enabled <https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#_server_name_indication_sni>.  It affects the maven artifact io.vertx:vertx-core versions 4.3.4,4.3.5,4.3.6,4.3.7,4.3.8,4.4.0,4.4.1,4.4.2,4.4.3,4.4.4,4.4.5,4.4.6,4.4.7,4.5.0,4.5.1,4.5.2  <https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/pull/5101> [Master] <https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/pull/5100> [4.x] <https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/pull/5099> [4.3]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2263139#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-03 10:53:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Quarkus 3.2.11  Via RHSA-2024:1662 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1662](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1662)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2263139#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-18 11:43:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Migration Toolkit for Runtimes 1 on RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:1923 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1923](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1923)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2263139#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-29 02:26:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Cryostat 2 on RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:2088 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2088](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A2088)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=2263139#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-05-14 09:08:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHINT Service Registry 2.5.11 GA  Via RHSA-2024:2833 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2833](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A2833)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=2263139#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-05-30 20:25:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat AMQ Streams 2.7.0  Via RHSA-2024:3527 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3527](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3527)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=2263139#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-06-20 00:36:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    MTA-6.2-RHEL-9   MTA-6.2-RHEL-8  Via RHSA-2024:3989 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3989](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3989)   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=2263139#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-25 19:26:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Apache Camel 4.4.1 for Spring Boot  Via RHSA-2024:4884 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4884](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4884)   ``` |  |
