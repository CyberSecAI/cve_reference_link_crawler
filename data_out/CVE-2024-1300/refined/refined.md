  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A memory leak occurs in io.vertx:vertx-core when a TCP server is configured with TLS and SNI support. The SSL context is incorrectly cached in the server name map when processing unknown SNI server names, leading to memory exhaustion.",

      "Memory Leak",
      "Incorrect SSL Context Caching"

  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is present in vertx-core versions 4.3.4 to 4.5.2. The issue is triggered when the server uses TLS and SNI, and receives a client hello message with a server name that the server doesn't have a specific mapping to, but also isn't the default server name.  The incorrect caching of the SSL context for that unknown name causes the memory leak."
