Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.22.5 and 1.21.12, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 1 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* net/http: denial of service due to improper 100-continue handling

  The net/http HTTP/1.1 client mishandled the case where a server responds to a request with an "Expect: 100-continue" header with a non-informational (200 or higher) status. This mishandling could leave a client connection in an invalid state, where the next request sent on the connection will fail.

  An attacker sending a request to a net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy proxy can exploit this mishandling to cause a denial of service by sending "Expect: 100-continue" requests which elicit a non-informational response from the backend. Each such request leaves the proxy with an invalid connection, and causes one subsequent request using that connection to fail.

  Thanks to Geoff Franks for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2024-24791 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/67555>.

View the release notes for more information:

<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.22.5>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go website:

<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.22.5` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Than and Joedian for the Go team

I am having issues seeing the v1.22.5 and v1.21.12 Docker images on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang/tags?page=&page_size=&ordering=&name=1.22.5), are the images supposed to be pushed by now or is it normal to expect some delay?
Thank you,
Florent

The Go team doesn't maintain Docker images on DockerHub. See the "Maintained by" note at the top of <https://hub.docker.com/_/golang>. That page suggests reporting problems at <https://github.com/docker-library/golang/issues>. That said, it seems they've started to show up about 20 minutes after your post.
Thanks,Dmitri![Florent Poinsard's profile photo](//lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXkPQo0UG8RIdz0j5ULLd9vQzYFofc0VWDuA5_IsXeiteV1aGHA=s40-c)
