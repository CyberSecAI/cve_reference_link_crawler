{
  "CVE-2024-24791": {
    "root_cause": "The net/http HTTP/1.1 client mishandles the case where a server responds to a request with an \"Expect: 100-continue\" header with a non-informational (200 or higher) status.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "The client fails to send the request body after receiving a non-1xx response, which can leave the connection in an invalid state."
    ],
    "impact": "A client connection can be left in an invalid state, where the next request sent on the connection will fail, leading to Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker can send a request to a net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy proxy with an \"Expect: 100-continue\" header."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to a vulnerable server or proxy, specifically one using `net/http` and processing the `Expect: 100-continue` header.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability affects Go versions before 1.21.12 and from 1.22.0-0 before 1.22.5. The fix involves ensuring the client sends the request body or closes the connection when a non-1xx response is received. The issue is also tracked as Go issue #67555. NetApp products such as Astra Control Provisioner, Astra Trident, and Astra Trident Autosupport are affected."
