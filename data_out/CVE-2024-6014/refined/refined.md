Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause:**
*   The root cause of the SQL injection vulnerability is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `id` parameter in the `edithis.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code directly into database queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly uses user-supplied input in SQL queries without proper sanitization.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or filter the 'id' parameter, enabling attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized database access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Sensitive data leakage:** Attackers can access and extract sensitive data.
*   **Data tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data.
*   **System control:** Attackers may gain full control of the system.
*   **Service disruption:** Attackers can potentially cause service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malicious POST request to the `edithis.php` file.
*   **`id` parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is the `id` parameter within the POST data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit this vulnerability. They just need to craft the malicious SQL injection payload in the `id` parameter.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerability is located in the `edithis.php` file of the "Document Management System Open Source PHP" version 1.0.
* The `id` parameter is directly used in SQL queries without appropriate sanitization.
* The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability through a crafted POST request.
* The vulnerability is exploitable through time-based blind, boolean-based blind, and error-based SQL injection techniques.
* The attacker can use SQL injection tools like SQLMap to automate the exploitation.

**Mitigation:**
* Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
* Implement strict input validation and filtering.
* Minimize database user permissions.
* Regularly conduct security audits.
