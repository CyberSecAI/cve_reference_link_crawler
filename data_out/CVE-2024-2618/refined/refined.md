Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2618:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the Elementor Header & Footer Builder plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the `size` attribute within the "Page Title" and "Site Title" widgets was not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This means that the malicious script is saved within the database and executed whenever a user accesses the affected page.
*   **Improper Neutralization of Alternate XSS Syntax:** The plugin fails to properly neutralize alternate XSS syntax.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Web Script Injection:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
*   **Malicious Code Execution:** The injected scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the affected page. This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    *   Stealing sensitive information (cookies, session tokens).
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `size` attribute of the "Page Title" and "Site Title" widgets within the Elementor Header & Footer Builder plugin.
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into this attribute through the plugin's settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "Contributor" access level or higher to be able to modify the plugin's settings and inject the malicious code.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Elementor Header & Footer Builder plugin up to and including version 1.6.26.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 1.6.26.1.
*   The vulnerable code can be found in `class-page-title.php` and `class-site-title.php` files within the plugin.

The provided files highlight the vulnerable code and confirm the lack of proper sanitization for the `size` attribute which is used within the `<`{{{ headingSizeTag }}}>` tag in `content_template` function of both `class-page-title.php` (line 494) and `class-site-title.php` (line 478).
