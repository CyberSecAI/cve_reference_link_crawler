A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability due to a missing bounds check in the NI I/O Trace Tool may result in arbitrary code execution.  Successful exploitation requires an attacker to provide a user with a specially crafted nitrace file.

The NI I/O Trace tool is installed as part of the NI System Configuration utilities included with many NI software products.â€¯ Refer to the NI Security Advisory for identifying the version of NI IO Trace.exe installed. The NI I/O Trace tool was also previously released as NI Spy.
