The provided content relates to CVE-2024-36056.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within the `Hw64.sys` driver of Marvin Test Solutions' `HW.exe` software. Specifically, it is due to the improper handling of physical memory mapping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The driver allows unprivileged user-mode processes to arbitrarily map physical memory through the use of IOCTL code `0x9c406490`. This is achieved by calling functions `IoAllocateMdl`, `MmBuildMdlForNonPagedPool`, and `MmMapLockedPages` without proper checks.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to gain `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specific IOCTL codes to the vulnerable driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to execute code as an unprivileged user on the system with the vulnerable driver installed.
