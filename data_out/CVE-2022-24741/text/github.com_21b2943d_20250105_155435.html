### @fancycode **[fancycode](/fancycode)** commented [Dec 16, 2021](#issue-1081899772) • edited Loading

For most image formats, the header specifies the width/height. PHP allocates an image object from that size, even if the actual

image data is much smaller. This image object size is not limited by the limit configured in PHP.

The memory limit can be configured through config setting "preview\_max\_memory" and defaults to 128 MBytes which should be enough for most images without filling up all memory.
