### @fancycode **[fancycode](/fancycode)** commented [Dec 16, 2021](#issue-1081899772) • edited Loading

For most image formats, the header specifies the width/height. PHP allocates an image object from that size, even if the actual

image data is much smaller. This image object size is not limited by the limit configured in PHP.

The memory limit can be configured through config setting "preview\_max\_memory" and defaults to 128 MBytes which should be enough for most images without filling up all memory.

# High memory usage for generating preview of broken image

Low

[nickvergessen](/nickvergessen)
published
GHSA-jf3h-xf4q-mh89
Mar 9, 2022

## Package

Server
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

< 21.0.8 , < 22.2.4, < 23.0.1

## Patched versions

21.0.8 , 22.2.4, 23.0.1

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can cause a denial of service by uploading specially crafted files which will cause the server to allocate too much memory / CPU.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 21.0.8 , 22.2.4 or 23.0.1.

### Workarounds

Disable preview generation with the `'enable_previews'` config flag.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
