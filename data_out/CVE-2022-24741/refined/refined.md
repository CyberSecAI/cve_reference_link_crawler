Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-24741:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Nextcloud handles image previews. When generating a preview of an image, PHP allocates an image object based on the width and height specified in the image header. This allocation occurs even if the actual image data is smaller, and this allocated memory is not limited by PHP's configured memory limits. This can lead to excessive memory allocation when processing maliciously crafted image files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-789):** The application allocates memory for image processing based on the dimensions in the image header without properly validating these values or limiting the allocated memory size, which could be exploited to cause denial of service.
*  **Improper Input Validation (CWE-131):** The application does not sufficiently validate the image header data, making it vulnerable to crafted files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can upload specially crafted image files which causes the server to allocate excessive memory or CPU resources, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** Attackers can remotely exploit this by uploading malicious image files to the Nextcloud server.
*   **File Upload:** The vulnerability is triggered during image preview generation, which is initiated when files are uploaded via the web interface or API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** An attacker only needs a user account with the ability to upload files, making exploitation relatively easy.
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires some user interaction by uploading the crafted file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is resolved by implementing a limit on the allocated memory for previews, configurable through the `preview_max_memory` setting in `config.php`.
*   The fix was backported to older versions of Nextcloud that still received security updates.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by "fancycode".
*   The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score for this issue is 3.5, with a low severity rating.
*   The attack complexity is low.
