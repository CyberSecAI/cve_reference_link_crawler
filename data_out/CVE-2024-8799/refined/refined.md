- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Custom Banners plugin for WordPress uses `add_query_arg` without proper escaping on the URL, leading to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper sanitization of user input within URLs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages, potentially leading to malicious actions if a user interacts with the crafted link. This could include session hijacking, cookie theft, redirecting to malicious websites, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted URLs, which when clicked, execute malicious scripts in the user's browser. Attackers need to trick users into clicking a malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers do not need any prior authentication or specific privileges. They need to be able to craft malicious URLs and trick users into clicking them.
