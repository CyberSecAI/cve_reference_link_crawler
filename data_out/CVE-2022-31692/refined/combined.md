# CVE-2022-31692: Authorization rules can be bypassed via forward or include dispatcher types in Spring Security

HIGH | OCTOBER 31, 2022 | CVE-2022-31692
# Description

Spring Security, versions **5.7** prior to **5.7.5** and **5.6** prior to **5.6.9** could be susceptible to authorization rules bypass via forward or include dispatcher types.

Specifically, an application is vulnerable when all of the following are true:

* The application expects that Spring Security applies security to forward and include dispatcher types.
* The application uses the `AuthorizationFilter` either manually or via the `authorizeHttpRequests()` method.
* The application configures the `FilterChainProxy` to apply to forward and/or include requests (e.g. `spring.security.filter.dispatcher-types = request, error, async, forward, include`).
* The application may forward or include the request to a higher privilege-secured endpoint.
* The application configures Spring Security to apply to every dispatcher type via `authorizeHttpRequests().shouldFilterAllDispatcherTypes(true)`

An application is not vulnerable if any of the following is true:

* The application does not use `authorizeHttpRequests()` or the `AuthorizationFilter`.
* The application does not forward/include requests.
* The application does not need to configure Spring Security to apply to FORWARD and INCLUDE dispatcher types.

# Affected Spring Products and Versions

* Spring Security
  + 5.7.0 to 5.7.4
  + 5.6.0 to 5.6.8

# Mitigation

Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigations:

* 5.7.x users should upgrade to 5.7.5
* 5.6.x users should upgrade to 5.6.9
* Users who cannot change versions, should use `authorizeRequests().filterSecurityInterceptorOncePerRequest(false)` instead of `authorizeHttpRequests().shouldFilterAllDispatcherTypes(true)`
* Users with version < 5.7.0 which does not have `shouldFilterAllDispatcherTypes` available, should add an `ObjectPostProcessor`:
  ```
  authorizeHttpRequests().withObjectPostProcessor(new
  ObjectPostProcessor() {
    @Override
    public O postProcess(O filter) {
     filter.setObserveOncePerRequest(false);
     filter.setFilterAsyncDispatch(true);
     filter.setFilterErrorDispatch(true);
     return filter;
    }});
  ```

Note that in Spring Security 5, the default behavior is to not apply the filters more than once to a request, therefore you have to explicitly configure Spring Security to do that. In addition, the FilterChainProxy is also not configured to be invoked on forward and include dispatcher types, depending on you to do it yourself.

Releases that have fixed this issue include:

* Spring Security
  + 5.7.5
  + 5.6.9
