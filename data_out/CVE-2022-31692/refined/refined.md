Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31692:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Spring Security handles authorization rules when requests are forwarded or included, potentially bypassing intended security configurations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authorization bypass:** When `FilterChainProxy` is configured to apply to forward and/or include requests, and `AuthorizationFilter` is used, authorization rules can be bypassed in Spring Security versions prior to 5.7.5 and 5.6.9.
- The application incorrectly assumes that Spring Security applies security to forwarded and included requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to secured endpoints. An attacker can potentially bypass authorization checks to gain access to sensitive data, add or modify data, or cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker would need to initiate a request that is then forwarded or included to a higher-privilege secured endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger a forward or include request within the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs when all of the following conditions are true:
    - The application expects Spring Security to apply security to forward and include dispatcher types.
    - The application utilizes `AuthorizationFilter` or `authorizeHttpRequests()`.
    - The application configures the `FilterChainProxy` to handle forward or include requests.
    - The application forwards/includes requests to higher-privileged endpoints.
    - The application is using `authorizeHttpRequests().shouldFilterAllDispatcherTypes(true)`.
- Spring Security, by default, does not apply filters more than once per request, which is why specific configuration is needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Affected Products (from NetApp advisory):**
- Active IQ Unified Manager for Microsoft Windows
- Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Spring Security 5.7.5 or 5.6.9.
- Use `authorizeRequests().filterSecurityInterceptorOncePerRequest(false)` instead of `authorizeHttpRequests().shouldFilterAllDispatcherTypes(true)`.
- For versions < 5.7.0, use an `ObjectPostProcessor` to configure the filters.
