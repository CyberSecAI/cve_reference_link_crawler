| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-02-28 14:34:36 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1196135](show_bug.cgi?id=1196135 "RESOLVED FIXED")  Found this via traces in the changes file of amazon-ssm-agent. The agent implement in Golang creates sudoers.d rules during runtime in:  agent/session/utility/utility_unix.go:  ``` // createSudoersFileIfNotPresent will create the sudoers file if not present. func (u *SessionUtil) createSudoersFileIfNotPresent(log log.T) error {  	// Return if the file exists 	if _, err := os.Stat(sudoersFile); err == nil { 		log.Infof("File %s already exists", sudoersFile) 		_ = u.changeModeOfSudoersFile(log) 		return err 	}  	// Create a sudoers file for ssm-user 	file, err := os.Create(sudoersFile) 	if err != nil { 		log.Errorf("Failed to add %s to sudoers file: %v", appconfig.DefaultRunAsUserName, err) 		return err 	} 	defer file.Close()  	if _, err := file.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf("# User rules for %s\n", appconfig.DefaultRunAsUserName)); err != nil { 		return err 	} 	if _, err := file.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf("%s ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\n", appconfig.DefaultRunAsUserName)); err != nil { 		return err 	} ```  So basically a root replacement user is created here which doesn't sound too good an idea.  Interesting in the same source file is the following piece of code:  ``` // changeModeOfSudoersFile will change the sudoersFile mode to 0440 (read only). // This file is created with mode 0666 using os.Create() so needs to be updated to read only with chmod. func (u *SessionUtil) changeModeOfSudoersFile(log log.T) error { 	fileMode := os.FileMode(sudoersFileMode) 	if err := os.Chmod(sudoersFile, fileMode); err != nil { 		log.Errorf("Failed to change mode of %s to %d: %v", sudoersFile, sudoersFileMode, err) 		return err 	} 	log.Infof("Successfully changed mode of %s to %d", sudoersFile, sudoersFileMode) 	return nil } ```  So this file is created with mode 0666? Hopefuly the author only thought of the mode not yet modified by the process's umask, otherwise this would be a great race condition involving a local root exploit.  I looked at this package during runtime, but probably lacking the AWS environment it just pukes around and ends up in segmentation faults (yes!). So I can't really tell at the moment what the practical implications of this are. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c1)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-03-21 14:09:47 UTC  ``` Assigning to aosthof, since there is currently no dedicated maintainer for amazon-ssm-agent. Can you help sorting out this issue or find someone more suitable to to take care of it? ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c2)  Alexander Osthof   2022-03-23 09:28:47 UTC  ``` Hi Matthias, in fact we do have a maintainer set for amazon-ssm-agent which is the 'public-cloud-team' group in IBS. Is this what you were looking for? ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c3)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-03-23 10:15:22 UTC  ``` (In reply to aosthof@suse.com from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c2)) > Hi Matthias, in fact we do have a maintainer set for amazon-ssm-agent which is the 'public-cloud-team' group in IBS. Is this what you were looking for?  Ah I've only been looking in OBS since this is about Factory (at least for now). Does the public-cloud-team also have an associated email address in Bugzilla? IBS does not show one. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c4)  Alexander Osthof   2022-03-23 11:14:26 UTC  ``` Yes, it's public-cloud-maintainers@suse.de ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c5)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-03-24 09:17:44 UTC  ``` Okay, thanks for helping out, reassigning the bug accordingly. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c6)  Alexander Osthof   2022-03-29 11:49:33 UTC  ``` Sean, can you please check on an EC2 instance if the amazon-ssm-agent creates a sudoers file with mode 0666? Thank you! ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c7)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-03-29 12:05:30 UTC  ``` (In reply to aosthof@suse.com from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c6)) > Sean, can you please check on an EC2 instance if the amazon-ssm-agent creates a sudoers file with mode 0666? Thank you!  Note that you will probably have to use a debugger or strace to notice this. An strace of the agent when the code mentioned in [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c0) runs would be most helpful to see what is really going on. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c8)  Sean Marlow   2022-03-29 13:58:26 UTC  ``` The file is created in the case that a user does not already exist and cannot be created and a sudoers file does not already exist. Currently the code creates a file with default permissions (0x666):  ``` // Create a sudoers file for ssm-user file, err := os.Create(sudoersFile) ```  Then the file is written to and finally the permissions are change to (0x440) after writing. That means there's a window of time where the file exists and is writable by all.  I assume this should probably be something like:  ``` // Create a sudoers file for ssm-user file, err := os.OpenFile(sudoersFile, os.O_RDWR|os.O_CREATE, 0640) ```  That way the file is only writable by owner. Until the mode gets changed to readonly after writing. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c9)  Sean Marlow   2022-03-29 15:02:07 UTC  ``` I guess this could actually be:  ``` file, err := os.OpenFile(sudoersFile, os.O_WRONLY|os.O_CREATE, 0640) ``` ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c10)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-03-30 08:16:51 UTC  ``` Thank you for confirming this. Can you report this (preferably privately) to upstream or should I do it? ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c11)  Sean Marlow   2022-03-30 13:28:25 UTC  ``` Yeah, I can reach out. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c12)  Sean Marlow   2022-04-01 15:49:35 UTC  ``` Amazon security team is working on a fix which is expected to be released in mid-April. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c13)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-04-04 08:53:42 UTC  ``` (In reply to sean.marlow@suse.com from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c12)) > Amazon security team is working on a fix which is expected to be released in mid-April.  Super, thanks for taking care of this. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c14)  Sean Marlow   2022-04-06 13:28:17 UTC  ``` The patch has been released:  <https://github.com/aws/amazon-ssm-agent/commit/0fe8ae99b2ff25649c7b86d3bc05fc037400aca7>  Is in the latest version:  <https://github.com/aws/amazon-ssm-agent/releases/tag/3.1.1208.0> ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c15)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-04-06 13:45:23 UTC  ``` Can you ask upstream if they intend to assign a CVE to this? It's a possible local root escalation.  We should also backport the fix to any maintained codestreams of amazon-ssm-agent. I'll ask colleagues from my team to look post information what backports to make. ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c16)  Robert Schweikert   2022-04-06 13:47:17 UTC  ``` We'll do a version update instead of a backport. ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c17)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-04-06 13:49:27 UTC  ``` If they didn't already do this upstream they should also now remove the misleading comment:  ``` // This file is created with mode 0666 using os.Create() so needs to be updated to read only with chmod. ```  This should no longer be true. ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c18)  Sean Marlow   2022-04-06 14:00:35 UTC  ``` The comment still exists in code so I pinged AWS security about that and if there will be a CVE to reference. ``` [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c19)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-04-07 07:54:38 UTC  ``` Thinking some more about this it will not be a local root exploit on many distributions, because /etc/sudoers.d is often hardened to be not world-readable.  A quick look around different distributions shows that only Debian Linux has 755 permissions for /etc/sudoers.d and would be affected.  We should backport / update with the fix anyway, because creating a world-writable file in there is bad style and a security hazard in any case. ``` [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c20)  John Paul Adrian Glaubitz   2022-04-19 11:10:43 UTC  ``` (In reply to Robert Schweikert from [comment #16](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c16)) > We'll do a version update instead of a backport.  I have submitted the latest upstream version which includes the fix to Factory now:  > <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/970747>  Shall I also submit it to SLE? Do we need an ECO for that? ``` [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c21)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-04-19 12:29:24 UTC  ``` (In reply to adrian.glaubitz@suse.com from [comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c20)) > I have submitted the latest upstream version which includes the fix to Factory now:  Great, thanks!  > Shall I also submit it to SLE? Do we need an ECO for that?  I consider this important enough to update SLE. An ECO would not be needed, the bug reference is enough.  Is there a CVE available yet? Reference the CVE would be important for updating SLE.  I'll involve colleagues from reactive security to help with the maintenance process. ``` [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c22)  Marcus Meissner   2022-04-19 12:38:56 UTC  ``` I filed a CVE request with Mitre. ``` [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c23)  John Paul Adrian Glaubitz   2022-04-20 09:01:31 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marcus Meissner from [comment #22](show_bug.cgi?id=1196556#c22)) > I filed a CVE request with Mitre.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
