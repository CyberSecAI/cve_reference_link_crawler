Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-20090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a path traversal vulnerability in the web interfaces of networking devices manufactured by Arcadyan. This vulnerability stems from a list of folders that are incorrectly included in a "bypass list" for authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication by using directory traversal sequences (e.g., `..%2f`) in the URL, accessing files and directories that would normally require authentication.
*   **Improper Access Control:**  The vulnerability also highlights a failure to properly restrict access to sensitive resources via the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms, gaining unauthorized access to the web interface of the affected devices.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access sensitive information, including valid session tokens. These tokens can then be used to make further requests to alter device settings.
*   **Remote Code Execution (Potential):** While not a direct impact of this vulnerability, the provided content notes that combining this bypass with other vulnerabilities (such as CVE-2021-20091) could lead to remote code execution.
*   **Botnet Deployment:** Attackers are actively exploiting this vulnerability to deploy Mirai botnet variants.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker can initiate an attack over a network, likely via the Internet, against an exposed device.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack is performed using crafted HTTP requests that include path traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device's web interface, typically the IP address of the router or modem.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication, making it accessible to a wide range of attackers.
*   **Understanding of HTTP and Path Traversal:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how HTTP requests and path traversal techniques work to craft the necessary attack payloads.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects a wide range of devices from different vendors who utilize Arcadyan firmware.
*   Exploitation involves crafting HTTP requests with path traversal sequences, such as `http://<ip>/images/..%2findex.htm`.
*   The attacker might need to use proxy match/replace settings to properly load resources after bypassing authentication.
*   Some files require a CSRF token and a valid `Referer` header, which also needs to be manipulated when using path traversal.
*   The vulnerability is actively being exploited by threat actors.
*   Affected devices include models from ADB, Arcadyan, ASMAX, ASUS, Beeline, British Telecom, Buffalo, Deutsche Telekom, HughesNet, KPN, O2, Orange, Skinny, SparkNZ, Telecom (Argentina), TelMex, Telstra, Telus, Verizon, and Vodafone.
