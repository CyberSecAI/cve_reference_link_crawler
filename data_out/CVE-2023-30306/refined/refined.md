The provided content describes a vulnerability related to TCP hijacking in NAT-enabled Wi-Fi networks, which aligns with the description of CVE-2023-30306 as a placeholder for CVE description retrieval related to "TCP Side-Channel Attacks on NAT."

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   A side-channel vulnerability in the widely used NAT port preservation strategy.
*   Insufficient reverse path validation strategy in Wi-Fi routers.
*   Routers disabling TCP window tracking strategy.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **NAT Port Preservation Side Channel:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to infer if a client in the same network is communicating with a host on the Internet via TCP.
*   **Insufficient Reverse Path Validation:** Routers do not adequately validate the source of incoming packets.
*   **Disabled TCP Window Tracking:** Routers do not properly track TCP window information, making it easier to manipulate connections.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **TCP Connection Hijacking:** An attacker can intercept TCP packets from the server to the victim client and obtain current sequence and acknowledgment numbers.
*   **Forcible Connection Termination:** The attacker can forcibly close established TCP connections (e.g., SSH).
*   **Traffic Poisoning:** Injecting malicious content into the TCP stream (e.g., poisoning HTTP responses).
*   **Traffic Rerouting:** The attacker can reroute incoming traffic intended for the victim to the attacker's machine.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Download private files from FTP servers.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Off-Path Attacker:** The attacker does not need to be on the direct path between the client and server.
*   **Fake TCP Packets:** The attacker crafts and sends fake TCP packets to manipulate NAT mappings.
*   **Exploiting NAT Mapping:** The attack involves evicting original NAT mappings and creating new ones at the router.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be on the same Wi-Fi network as the victim client.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send packets to the victim's router and to the server.
*   The attacker needs to observe the traffic between the victim and the server to obtain TCP sequence numbers.

**Additional Details:**
*   The research tested 67 widely used routers from 30 vendors and found 52 to be vulnerable.
*   75 out of 93 real-world Wi-Fi networks tested (81%) were vulnerable.
*   Average time to terminate an SSH connection is 17.5 seconds, download private files from FTP is 19.4 seconds, inject HTTP responses is 54.5 seconds
*   Success rates: SSH termination (87.4%), FTP file download (82.6%), HTTP response injection (76.1%).
*   The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed to vendors, and positive feedback was received.
