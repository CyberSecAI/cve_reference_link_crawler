Package        : c-ares
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-31130 CVE-2023-32067
Debian Bug     :

Two vunerabilities were discovered in c-ares, an asynchronous name
resolver library:

CVE-2023-31130

    ares_inet_net_pton() is found to be vulnerable to a buffer underflow
    for certain ipv6 addresses, in particular "0::00:00:00/2" was found
    to cause an issue. c-ares only uses this function internally for
    configuration purposes, however external usage for other purposes may
    cause more severe issues.

CVE-2023-32067

    Target resolver may erroneously interprets a malformed UDP packet
    with a lenght of 0 as a graceful shutdown of the connection, which
    could cause a denial of service.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.17.1-1+deb11u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your c-ares packages.
