The provided content relates to a fix for a vulnerability in the AMD display driver.

**Root Cause:**

The functions `find_disp_cfg_idx_by_plane_id` and `find_disp_cfg_idx_by_stream_id` were returning -1 to indicate that a specific index was not found. However, -1 is not a valid array index and could lead to out-of-bounds access.

**Weaknesses:**

- The functions return -1 as an error code, which is then used as an array index, leading to out-of-bounds access or negative array access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Array overruns/out-of-bounds access, which could lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution if exploited further.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when `find_disp_cfg_idx_by_plane_id` or `find_disp_cfg_idx_by_stream_id` fail to find a valid index, causing -1 to be returned. It is unclear exactly what conditions cause a valid index to not be found.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker would likely need some means of triggering the failure of those two functions, which may be achieved through manipulation of display configuration or other related settings. It is unclear from this patch alone what those specific requirements are.

**Additional details:**
- The fix addresses Coverity reports of OVERRUN and NEGATIVE_RETURNS issues. The fix involves adding an `ASSERT(false)` to halt execution when these error conditions occur, alongside returning a positive number (`__DML2_WRAPPER_MAX_STREAMS_PLANES__`) that is within the bounds of array.
