Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2019-2975:

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an "Unexpected exception thrown during regular expression processing in Nashorn (Scripting, 8223518)". This means there's a flaw in how the Nashorn JavaScript engine (within the OpenJDK) handles regular expressions.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Improper handling of regular expressions within the Nashorn JavaScript engine. This suggests a flaw in the regex parsing or execution logic, leading to exceptions and potentially exploitable behavior.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**

*   The primary impact is a "denial of service (application crash)". When a crafted regex is processed, it can cause an unexpected exception, leading the Java application to crash.

**4. Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves supplying a specially crafted regular expression to the Nashorn JavaScript engine. This could happen in any scenario where untrusted input is processed with Nashorn.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to supply malicious input containing a crafted regular expression to a system that processes it using the vulnerable Nashorn component. The attacker doesn't necessarily need to be local to the vulnerable system.

**Additional notes from different sources:**

*   **Red Hat Advisory:** The Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2020:0046 and others) includes CVE-2019-2975 in a list of vulnerabilities fixed in java-1.8.0-ibm updates. This indicates the vulnerability affects IBM's version of Java SE 8 and is present in multiple RHEL versions. It also states that all running instances of the affected Java need to be restarted for the fix to take effect.
*   **Debian Advisory:** The Debian Security Advisory (DSA-4546-1 and DSA-4548-1) indicates the vulnerability was present in openjdk-11 and openjdk-8, leading to a denial of service. These advisories mention that an attacker can cause a crash due to the issue.
*   **Ubuntu Advisory:** The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-4223-1) states "It was discovered that the Nashorn JavaScript subcomponent in OpenJDK did not properly handle regular expressions in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash)."
*   **OpenSUSE Advisory:** The openSUSE advisory for java-1\_8\_0-openjdk and java-11-openjdk also mentions the "Unexpected exception in jjs" which points to the nashorn regex processing issue.
*   **Oracle Advisory:** The Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory for October 2019 lists CVE-2019-2975 as part of multiple security patches for Java SE, which indicates that the Oracle Java SE implementation, both Standard and Embedded editions, are vulnerable.
*   **NetApp Advisory:** NetApp's advisory acknowledges the CVE's impact on Java SE libraries used by multiple NetApp products including denial of service (DoS) or unauthorized access to sensitive data.

In summary, CVE-2019-2975 is a vulnerability affecting multiple Java implementations due to improper handling of regular expressions in Nashorn, potentially resulting in a denial of service. The vulnerability exists in OpenJDK as well as vendor-specific versions like those from IBM and Oracle, affecting multiple products like RHEL, Debian, Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, NetApp and Oracle. The attack vector is through maliciously crafted regular expressions supplied to the vulnerable component.
