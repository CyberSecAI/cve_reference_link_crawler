- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from the exposure of internal C++ types within JavaScript exceptions. These internal types, intended to be confined within the JavaScript engine, are exposed and not properly handled when exceptions are thrown.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper handling and hiding of internal C++ types within the JavaScript engine's exception handling process, leading to an exposed dangerous method or function. Specifically, the internal JavaScript exception types were exposed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) by issuing crafted database queries that cause unhandled JavaScript exceptions. This leads to a crash in the MongoDB server, preventing normal operations.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending specially crafted database queries that trigger the vulnerable exception handling within the JavaScript engine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a user authorized to perform database queries in order to exploit this vulnerability.
