In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soc: fsl: qbman: Always disable interrupts when taking cgr_lock

smp_call_function_single disables IRQs when executing the callback. To
prevent deadlocks, we must disable IRQs when taking cgr_lock elsewhere.
This is already done by qman_update_cgr and qman_delete_cgr; fix the
other lockers.
