Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35806:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2024-35806. All of the git commits and the Debian security advisory mention the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a missing interrupt disabling mechanism when acquiring the `cgr_lock` in certain functions within the `qbman` driver. The `smp_call_function_single` function disables interrupts during its execution. To avoid deadlocks due to interrupt context, the `cgr_lock` must always be acquired with interrupts disabled. The driver was not consistently disabling interrupts when acquiring `cgr_lock` in `qm_congestion_task` and `qman_create_cgr`, leading to potential deadlocks.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition/Deadlock:** The primary vulnerability is the possibility of a deadlock due to improper locking. Specifically, when functions acquire the `cgr_lock` without disabling interrupts, they can potentially deadlock with an interrupt context executing the `smp_call_function_single` call if it tries to acquire the same lock. This is because `smp_call_function_single` will disable IRQs during its execution, and if the lock is already taken in a different context without IRQs disabled, deadlock occurs.
*   **Inconsistent Locking:** The code had inconsistencies in how it managed locking with respect to interrupt disabling. While some functions correctly disabled interrupts when taking the `cgr_lock` (like `qman_update_cgr` and `qman_delete_cgr`), others did not.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a potential system-wide deadlock, leading to a denial-of-service condition. If the kernel gets stuck in a deadlock, the system may become unresponsive.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Internal Kernel Call Paths:** The vulnerability is triggered via internal kernel call paths within the `qbman` driver, specifically within the `qm_congestion_task` and `qman_create_cgr` functions.
*   **Interrupt Context:** The vulnerability is exposed when an interrupt occurs and the interrupt handler (which utilizes `smp_call_function_single`) tries to acquire `cgr_lock` which is already held by another function running in a different context and without IRQs disabled.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Kernel Access:** An attacker would likely need local access to the kernel, or they must be able to trigger the vulnerable code path, likely indirectly. The vulnerability is not directly exploitable remotely but can be triggered if the conditions for acquiring lock in different context occur.
*   **Ability to Trigger Code Paths:** An attacker does not necessarily need to write code to exploit this vulnerability if they can indirectly cause an interrupt to occur at a critical time that triggers the deadlock.

**Summary of Changes:**

The fix for this vulnerability involves changing the calls to `spin_lock` to `spin_lock_irq` and similarly `spin_unlock` to `spin_unlock_irq` in `qm_congestion_task` and `qman_create_cgr`. This ensures that interrupts are always disabled when acquiring and releasing the `cgr_lock`, preventing the deadlock scenario.

**Additional Notes:**

The provided Debian Security Advisory (DLA 3840-1) confirms this CVE as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in a security update for Debian 10 (buster). This advisory also lists several other CVEs that were addressed in the same update.
