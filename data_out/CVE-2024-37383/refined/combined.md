Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3835-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                       Guilhem Moulin

Package        : roundcube
Version        : 1.3.17+dfsg.1-1~deb10u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2024-37383 CVE-2024-37384
Debian Bug     : 1071474

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were discovered in Roundcube,
a skinnable AJAX based webmail solution for IMAP servers, which could
allow a remote attacker to load arbitrary JavaScript code and might lead
to privilege escalation or information disclosure.

CVE-2024-37383

    Valentin T. and Lutz Wolf of CrowdStrike discovered that Roundcube
    allows XSS via SVG animate attributes.

CVE-2024-37384

    Huy Nguyễn Phạm Nhật discovered that Roundcube allows XSS via list
    columns from user preferences.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.3.17+dfsg.1-1~deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your roundcube packages.

For the detailed security status of roundcube please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/roundcube>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
