Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of fixed codes for the keyless entry system in the Nissan Sylphy Classic 2021. This means that the same codes are transmitted every time the lock or unlock buttons on the key fob are pressed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Fixed Codes:** The primary weakness is the lack of rolling codes or any form of dynamic code generation. This makes the transmitted codes predictable and reusable.
- **Replay Attack:** The fixed nature of the codes makes the system susceptible to replay attacks, where an attacker can record the transmitted codes and replay them later to unlock the vehicle.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to unlock and potentially gain access to the vehicle without the legitimate key fob.
- **Vehicle Theft:** In a worst-case scenario, this could lead to vehicle theft.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Radio Frequency Interception:** The attack vector involves intercepting the radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted by the key fob when the lock or unlock buttons are pressed.
- **Replay:** The intercepted codes are then retransmitted to the vehicle to unlock it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **RF Signal Interception:** The attacker needs the capability to intercept the RF signals transmitted by the key fob. This can be done using readily available Software Defined Radio (SDR) equipment.
- **Code Replay:** The attacker needs the capability to retransmit the recorded codes. This can also be achieved using SDR equipment.
- **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within the range of the key fob and the vehicle to intercept and replay signals.

**Additional Notes:**
- The blog post references a similar vulnerability (CVE-2022-27254) found in Honda vehicles, indicating a pattern of fixed code vulnerabilities across different car manufacturers.
- The provided video demonstrates the attack on the Nissan Sylphy Classic 2021, confirming the practical exploitability of this issue.
