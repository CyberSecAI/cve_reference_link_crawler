### Threat Intelligence

EPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

#### Introduced: 22 May 2023

[CVE-2023-26130  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26130) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-93  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/93.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

Upgrade `yhirose/cpp-httplib` to version 0.12.4 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to CRLF Injection when untrusted user input is used to set the content-type header in the HTTP `.Patch`, `.Post`, `.Put` and `.Delete` requests. This can lead to logical errors and other misbehaviors.

**Note:** This issue is present due to an incomplete fix for [CVE-2020-11709](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-UNMANAGED-YHIROSECPPHTTPLIB-2366507).

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**
