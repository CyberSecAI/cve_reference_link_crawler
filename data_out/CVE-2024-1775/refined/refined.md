Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1775:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `error_description` parameter in the Nextend Social Login and Register plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Self-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin does not properly sanitize the `error_description` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. This XSS is self-based because the injected script is reflected back to the user who triggered the request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages, which can be executed if a user interacts with a crafted link.
- **Critical Impact Scenario (with specific conditions):**  With "Debug mode" enabled, a subscriber-level attacker can leverage a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack combined with social engineering to achieve critical impact. Specifically, they could trick a higher-level user (like an administrator) into clicking a crafted link. This could lead to administrator-level account creation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious link containing a script in the `error_description` parameter.
- The attacker then needs to trick a user into accessing the link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic Attack:** An attacker needs a subscriber-level account on the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Advanced Attack:** In addition to a subscriber account, the attacker needs to enable the "Debug mode" in the plugin's settings.
- The attacker must also use social engineering to trick a higher-level user into interacting with the malicious link, as well as leverage a cross-site request forgery to achieve administrator-level account creation

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of the Nextend Social Login and Register plugin up to and including 3.1.12.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.1.13 of the plugin.
- The provided changelog from the plugin's Trac indicates that the fix involves sanitizing error messages using a new `NSLSanitizedRequestErrorMessageException` class which sanitizes error messages using `sanitize_text_field()` before outputting them.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on March 1, 2024.
