So the fact that they have so many holes in their security is a cause for concern. You grandma isn't going to know a fishy link when she sees one, especially with this exploit where domain looks legitimate. A contributing factor is the hierarchical work culture in Korea. You boss gives you a deadline for a feature which is treated an non-negotiable so you cut corners to get it out. Your boss can't 'see' security vulnerabilities, but can see a UI. So you get told "good job" and then get given the next unachievable deadline. This all amounts to an app full of security holes, and until Kakao stock drops because of it, they're not going to address it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [lifthrasiir](user?id=lifthrasiir) [6 months ago](item?id=40795811)   | [parent](#40795287) | [next](#40795398) [–]  I actually don't use Kakaotalk (or LINE or Facebook, to be comprehensive) even though I'm a Korean. That does make me some kind of weirdo, but many enough services have an SMS fallback so I can live without it. On the security side though: I don't think it is a work culture at the play because major IT companies in South Korea---often referred as to the initialism 네카라쿠배, for Naver, Kakao, LINE, Coupang and Baemin operated by Woowa Bros---*are* known for much better work culture and higher compensation than the nation average [1]. It is probably more like that these apps are domestic and hadn't been scrutinized enough compared to globally popular apps. [1] But still lower than US or even some Korean startups in my experience. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [chabulhwi](user?id=chabulhwi) [6 months ago](item?id=40795911)   | [root](#40795287) | [parent](#40795811) | [next](#40801103) [–]  I'm also a Korean, and I've been getting on without KakaoTalk for two years.

I've never actually tried this, but I don't see why they wouldn't work on any phone browser, stock or otherwise. I haven't tried them all, obviously, but I'm thinking vehicle registration, voter registration and tax service (both personal and corporate). They have an SSO scheme, France Connect, which is used for multiple services, so I expect that if it worked for the ones I've used, it'll work for the others, too.

The difference seems to be that the government sector and the *chaebol* take up such a huge share of the "IT" market in SK, that there really isn't much space left for startup culture to make a difference.

Exactly. All that funding and the associated paperwork, not to mention the adverse incentives it brings to the table, help to turn the Korean startup ecosystem into yet another old-fashioned, government-controlled economic sector. We all call each other the same honorifics, make our offices cute and comfy, and try not to have a visible hierarchy. But at the end of the day, it's the government that tells you which projects will be funded and when you should submit screenshots of the deliverables. Angels? Yeah, they exist, but where do you think half of their money comes from?

If you've ever spent a few years at any decent-sized white collar company in the US (tech, finance, consulting) you know it's the same in the west. Especially FAANGs. All these mid-level engineers are just yes-men trying to suck up to their VPs to get in the next promo cycle. The western companies just have better marketing about "flat hierarchies" but it's all PR talk and lip service. Some PM or SVP drops some mandate and no one ever has the balls to question it, they just grumble and do it. The saddest part is that these tech bros actually believe the marketing they are fed about their company cultures, and it breeds this shallow superiority complex and so whenever something negative about Asian companies comes up, you get comments like this citing this 'go-to' rationale about hierarchy. It's actually kind of sad these guys don't have the self-awareness to critically examine what they are told vs. what reality is. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [awithrow](user?id=awithrow) [6 months ago](item?id=40802943)   | [root](#40795287) | [parent](#40801527) | [next](#40799680) [–]  I've spent many years at large companies including FAANGs.

The policies are protectionist not just against foreign entry but also against entry of new products into the market. The government picks technology winners. Unsurprisingly, the government doesn't do a great job of this.

Kakao (at least until they became dominant) acted more like an agent that sends additional customers to existing independent taxi drivers while Uber kept trying to find legal loopholes to bypass the taxi licensing system. S Korea is a civil law country, and its courts have no patience for actors whose entire legal strategy is to subvert the intent of the laws, and that was the end for Uber there. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [gleenn](user?id=gleenn) [6 months ago](item?id=40794601)   | [root](#40792323) | [parent](#40794541) | [next](#40793477) [–]  To be accurate, Uber didn't abide by laws in most countries it went up against. It was a little slimy but also the taxi systems of most places were very entrenched. I remember never enjoying riding taxis in San Francisco for years, the cars were gross and the drivers were grumpy and generally shady about having their "credit card readers being broken" so they didn't have to pay the fees. Uber and a bunch of companies did and end run around those very politically entrenched systems and I certainly am happy to have clean, friendly, safe, modern rides with good tech where reviews keep things in line and payment is easy and I can share my location easily and know I'm going to end up at the right place way better. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jorvi](user?id=jorvi) [6 months ago](item?id=40798608)   | [root](#40792323) | [parent](#40794601) | [next](#40795173) [–]  Yup.

Uber was shady, but that kind of shadiness and willingness to ignore laws is necessary to bring positive change in a highly corrupt society. It's a lot like Batman: when the police are completely ineffectual or corrupt and working for organized crime, you need a vigilante who ignores the laws that just protect the criminals. However, in better-run and not-so-corrupt societies like Korea, it's not necessary and probably downright harmful. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [burutthrow1234](user?id=burutthrow1234) [6 months ago](item?id=40795807)   | [root](#40792323) | [parent](#40795173) | [next](#40800760) [–]  > However, in better-run and not-so-corrupt societies like Korea, it's not necessary and probably downright harmful.

Then it became established and hard to remove. >Due to restrictions on the export of cryptography from the United States, standard 128-bit SSL encryption was unavailable in Korea. Web browsers were only available to Koreans with weakened 40-bit encryption. In the late 1990s, the Korea Internet & Security Agency developed its own 128-bit symmetric block cipher named SEED and used ActiveX to mount it in web browsers. This soon became a domestic standard, and the country's Financial Supervisory Service used the technology as a security screening standard. ActiveX spread rapidly in Korea. In 2000, export restrictions were lifted, allowing the use of full-strength SSL anywhere in the world. Most web browsers and national e-commerce systems adopted this technology, while Korea continued to use SEED and ActiveX.

Apps on the other hand strongly reflect the philosophy of usage, control, privacy etc, and the design aesthetic of their creators. Different countries/cultures have radically different philosophies, and old countries have aesthetics that go back thousands of years. Using apps from the creators of a different culture almost certainly causes significant friction with your own culture's philosophy and aesthetics. To give a related example. I don't know Korea, but many in the English speaking world are marginally know of Japanese TV shows - you know with the crazy antics. Imagine that you were forced to consume only that form of TV, and how jarring that would be compared to your own philosophical and aesthetic inclinations.

Or rather, most people of a country don't like platforms not dominated by their own primary language, and this is passively achieved by that tendency. Lots of Russian stuffs on the Internet come through Telegram, meanwhile China has Weibo and TikTok, Korea does its thing in KakaoTalk and Facebook/Insta, Japan uses LINE along Twitter/Insta instead, so on and so forth. Everyone could be on Facebook, but that isn't what is going on. The Interweb isn't so global, and English isn't the lingua franca of all communications.

I think some tiny amount of protectionism can be necessary to get a domestic industry started, when it is important for reasons beyond giving access to the best products like national security. Especially in edge cases like competing with foreign companies with the backing of their state government or an international market that has degenerated to a monopoly. But ultimately free trade makes better products and international consumers richer and is the desired end goal, not every nation rewriting the same tech stack and providing local flavors of software solving similar problems. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lmz](user?id=lmz) [6 months ago](item?id=40794017)   | [root](#40792323) | [parent](#40793898) | [next](#40795501) [–]  > not every nation rewriting the same tech stack and providing local flavors of software solving similar problems.

Why would I not make American monopoly beige if it works for America locally? But if the foreign company is already that color I have to differentiate somehow. I have to compete on whatever I know about the domestic market, and force the foreign companies to learn and adapt to reach parity with me. That whole process works in reverse too, where I have to reach parity with the large multinational company on all the features the domestic audience cares about. That last step is usually the first one to be missed when a government hands a monopoly on a tech vertical to a local company with protectionist policies. (And often they don’t just do it to insulate them from foreign competition, they will end up insulating them from domestic too as an artifact of the way these relationships reinforce themselves) So, the state should intervene to help level the playing field to reach fair competition. In practice though it rarely stops there and instead works to insulate the domestic company from any competition. Which results in inferior products. It is not diversity to have many people reinventing and maintaining essentially the same wheel. Exceptionally, this is necessary for national security purposes, but in the common case this is actually a poor deal for local consumers who prop up a worse product. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [shiroiushi](user?id=shiroiushi) [6 months ago](item?id=40795204)   | [root](#40792323) | [parent](#40794866) | [next](#40794516) [–]  This is rich, coming from someone in a country where everyone still uses SMS to chat with their friends and family.

There are lots of different messaging apps with very high market share in the US versus a WhatsApp monoculture. A lot of people using SMS are actually using iMessage, and historically one of the reasons it’s won is because US telecoms went to unlimited SMS messaging when competing with each other, whereas foreign monopoly telecoms charged prices per SMS making messaging apps on data more competitive. iMessage is a better experience and also degrades gracefully to sms for people who aren’t on the platform, unlike almost all other messaging apps where I have to make sure they have the app installed. Facebook messenger has like 50% market penetration with its own suite of features. Snapchat is next and offers a very different user experience.

Similarly, even though the messenger app does have integration with its payment platform (cleverly named KakaoPay), the service itself lives in a dedicated app. It's like Google on Android where you could access bunch of services with one central ID, which I presume is why their apps have so many access points: they need it for themselves. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [maeil](user?id=maeil) [6 months ago](item?id=40796916)   | [parent](#40796675) | [next](#40793191) [–]  This isn't accurate. > Similarly, even though the messenger app does have integration with its payment platform (cleverly named KakaoPay), the service itself lives in a dedicated app. Just like WeChat, KakaoPay is fully integrated in KakaoTalk to the extent that the large majority of users use KakaoPay only through KakaoTalk.

User sends message via client. Client fumbles the recipient id. Message ends up at the wrong recipient. Examples: incorrect recipient ID attached to contact in list where users selects recipient. Buggy selection of multiple targets in the selection UI due to incorrect touch event handling. Incorrect deletion of previously selected and then deselected recipient from recipient array of multitarget message. Or if working low level even a good old off by one error and reading out of bounds data for the recipient list (though that one hopefully should trigger a faulty send request due to other stuff no longer matching). There is endless examples. The server can't really safeguard against the client providing a legitimate send request even though the user intended to send it to another recipient. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ChrisClark](user?id=ChrisClark) [6 months ago](item?id=40792951)   | [root](#40791894) | [parent](#40792477) | [prev](#40792926) | [next](#40792780) [–]  <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27950763> Yeah, I don't know how they manage to get bugs like that, but it's happened | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [webappguy](user?id=webappguy) [6 months ago](item?id=40792780)   | [root](#40791894) | [parent](#40792477) | [prev](#40792951) | [next](#40793980) [–]  Curious to know more.

It's his once-a-lifetime bet, even bigger than SpaceX and Tesla *combined* - succeed in delivering a "one for everything" Asian-style app to the Western ecosystem and you have a money printer of unfathomable power. Had he not completely destroyed all trust in the brand Twitter/X, I'd think he'd have a serious chance of achieving that goal. The *really* interesting thing, IMO, is where Facebook went off the rails. They have the moat with literal billions of people using their apps already, they got real names, addresses, location data, in some cases (legacy Whatsapp users, people who ever ran ads) payment data, Facebook already has sort of a "shop" solution with Marketplace... but they don't seem to be attractive at all, or doing anything innovative.

The way those "superapps" grow the "apps" is middle management doing his personal projects on corporate microservice infrastructure and IC hire upper management succumbing to bureaucracy. Thanks to bureaucracy, some brand integrity is maintained, and that kind of makes money anyway as company side gigs. After it goes garbage in and out of translation, the whole company doings end up on BBC as Oriental wonder superapps. SoftBank subsidiary owns LINE. So do Masayoshi Son even know how many individual sub-apps there are or who's under who running what? I highly doubt it. And I also highly doubt a control freak like Musk can even bear that kind of situation; he'd personally dragged out a server rack out of an NTT datacenter without going through rituals and ceremonies, which made a web article by itself.

But they also don't have the shareholder/activist investor pressure that Western companies face. To achieve "superapp" size, you need to have either a strong leader personality driving the push by their sheer will and vision and especially with enough authority/financial power to overrule investors - people like Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg - or you need to be one of the Asian ultra-conglomerate/"chaebol" companies that have absurd amounts of money flowing through them that enterprising middle managers can divert. Unfortunately, with the exception of the visionaries I mentioned, corporate America and Europe just doesn't have many company founders with both clear visions and a backbone, and there's (partially "thanks" to de-conglomerisation trends of the 90s and later like with German giant Siemens) nothing at all left that comes even close to the diversification of revenue that Samsung has. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [its-summertime](user?id=its-summertime) [6 months ago](item?id=40793105)   | [root](#40791813) | [parent](#40792598) | [prev](#40793366) | [next](#40796958) [–]  Meta was probably against pushing super hard to avoid the kind of situation that X is now in. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jacobgkau](user?id=jacobgkau) [6 months ago](item?id=40794322)   | [root](#40791813) | [parent](#40793105) | [next](#40796958) [–]  How do you mean?

Not saying they can't go forwards now, just that they are being careful, to try and make a more solid, longer lasting brand. As opposed to the burn-everything approach of X.

Why is only Musk trying this? It's the incredibly obvious thing to do. Does Zuck find the idea boring? Is that why he rather do something flashy like "Metaverse"? It's the obvious model to go for and East-Asia has already made that clear since a decade ago. Even bloody MSN Messenger 15 years ago was more of a super app than WhatsApp. Now finally Musk says he's going to give it a go, but I reckon he'll struggle because X's penetration, as high as it is, is nowhere near WhatsApp. He's also extremely late in the game, so much that unless he starts buying up incumbents (maybe that's what he needs the $56 bn pay package for), the barriers are now incredibly high. When WeChat, KakaoTalk and Line started branching out, there was no huge incumbent in the areas they competed in. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [snaeker58](user?id=snaeker58) [6 months ago](item?id=40791842)   | [parent](#40791813) | [prev](#40792198) | [next](#40791824) [–]  I can see some executive being sneaky and saving 0.0001% of all their expenses. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [snaeker58](user?id=snaeker58) [6 months ago](item?id=40791824)   | [prev](#40791813) | [next](#40792032) [–]  Crazy that only Koreans are eligible for bounty rewards.

It's similar to how weapons designed to be used against people are regulated differently from tools that merely happen to be usable as weapons.

The vulnerability was patched. I assume hiding the details only helps the company save-face. In my last job we literally had "classes" teaching us how to deal with Asian colleagues (specifically in China, but SK has the same culture) who would try to hide things and save-face at literally any corner possible; I remember my old boss' example of "when walking down a street in Beijing, if you ask somebody directions to a street that they don't know, they will adamantly indicate that they know and it's *that way* (a random direction) in order to not say they don't know the true direction. I didn't personally buy the classes and saw it as a generalization and racist (unsurprising, given the manager leading this class is born and bred in Poland; not exactly known for its diversity or.. external knowledge of the world or Asia; also the majority of the team had never left the country before so had no other viewpoint or angle to base these classes on), but it just confirmed my "trust but verify" approach to things. The relevance of my story is that if I hacked or found some security issue with the Chinese colleagues, I was instructed to not in any circumstances communicate it in a way that may make them feel like it was an issue of theirs, that their code or infrastructure or whatever was hacked: it was \_our\_ fault for not telling them in advance that they can't do that specific action or whatever. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sunnybeetroot](user?id=sunnybeetroot) [6 months ago](item?id=40792658)   | [root](#40791907) | [parent](#40792091) | [next](#40792507) [–]  > I didn't personally buy the classes and saw it as a generalization and racist (unsurprising, given the manager leading this class is born and bred in Poland; not exactly known for its diversity or.. external knowledge of the world or Asia Did you call out a generalisation/racism only to then go on to make a generalist/racist remark about people from Poland? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mmsc](user?id=mmsc) [6 months ago](item?id=40792775)   | [root](#40791907) | [parent](#40792658) | [next](#40792507) [–]  "People from country X do not generally have knowledge of continent Y because nationally they take an insular approach" is not racism, it's an identification of a root-cause which for anybody that lives in Poland, is quite well known. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jacobgkau](user?id=jacobgkau) [6 months ago](item?id=40794444)   | [root](#40791907) | [parent](#40792775) | [next](#40792507) [–]  So basically, you're saying it's not racist if it's true?

Not really. The problem isn't making a claim, it's about how believable and how extreme the claim is.
