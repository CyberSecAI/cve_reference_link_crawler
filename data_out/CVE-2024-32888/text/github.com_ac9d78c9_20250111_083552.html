# SQL Injection via line comment generation

Critical

[bsharifi](/bsharifi)
published
GHSA-x3wm-hffr-chwm
May 14, 2024

## Package

maven

com.amazon.redshift:redshift-jdbc42
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<= 2.1.0.26

## Patched versions

2.1.0.28

## Description

### Impact

SQL injection is possible when using the non-default connection property `preferQueryMode=simple` in combination with application code which has a vulnerable SQL that negates a parameter value.

There is no vulnerability in the driver when using the default, extended query mode. Note that `preferQueryMode` is not a supported parameter in Redshift JDBC driver, and is inherited code from Postgres JDBC driver. Users who do not override default settings to utilize this unsupported query mode are not affected.

### Patch

This issue is patched in driver version 2.1.0.28.

### Workarounds

Do not use the connection property `preferQueryMode=simple`. (NOTE: If you do not explicitly specify a query mode, then you are using the default of extended query mode and are not affected by this issue.)

### References

Similar to finding in Postgres JDBC: [GHSA-24rp-q3w6-vc56](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-24rp-q3w6-vc56 "GHSA-24rp-q3w6-vc56")

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, we ask that you contact AWS Security via our [vulnerability reporting page](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting) or directly via email to aws-security@amazon.com. Please do not create a public GitHub issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
