### Description

The Form Maker by 10Web – Mobile-Friendly Drag & Drop Contact Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1.15.27 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
