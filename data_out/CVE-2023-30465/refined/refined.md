- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command (SQL injection).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability in the "orderType" parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames. Specifically, the username of the user with ID 1 can be extracted character by character.
- **Attack vectors**: Manipulating the "orderType" parameter in an SQL query.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable application, with the ability to manipulate the 'orderType' parameter.
