The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in OFCMS version 1.1.2.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization in the `add` method of `SystemDictController.java`. User-provided data, specifically the `dict_value`, is not filtered before being stored in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability: The application stores user-supplied input containing malicious JavaScript code without any sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code which is then executed in the browser of any user who visits the page containing the stored XSS payload. This allows for various malicious actions, including session hijacking, redirection, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the POST request to `/ofcms-admin/admin/system/dict/add.json?sqlid=system.dict.save`. The attacker sends a crafted request with a `dict_value` containing the XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker must be able to add/edit data dictionary entries in OFCMS.
