    "CVE-2024-1725": {
      "description": "A flaw was found in the kubevirt-csi component of OpenShift Virtualization's Hosted Control Plane (HCP). This issue could allow an authenticated attacker to gain access to the root HCP worker node's volume by creating a custom Persistent Volume that matches the name of a worker node.",
      "root_cause": "The `kubevirt-csi` component allows guest clusters to use the same storage as the infrastructure cluster. By crafting a PersistentVolume (PV) with a volumeHandle matching a worker node's root volume PVC, an attacker can trick kubevirt-csi into attaching the node's root volume to a pod within the guest cluster.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure handling of PersistentVolume creation by `kubevirt-csi`.",
        "Lack of proper validation of PV `volumeHandle` against node PVC names.",
          "Predictable naming scheme for worker node root volumes (node's name followed by '-rhcos')."
      ],
      "impact": "An authenticated attacker with the ability to create PVs within an HCP OCP-Virt guest cluster can gain unauthorized access to any HCP worker node's root volume. This can lead to data exfiltration, modification, or other malicious activities within the infrastructure.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker crafts a Persistent Volume with a volumeHandle that matches the name of a worker node's root volume PVC within an HCP OCP-Virt guest cluster.",
        "The `kubevirt-csi` component attaches the node's root volume to a pod in the guest cluster based on this crafted PV."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "Authenticated access to an HCP OCP-Virt guest cluster with the ability to create Persistent Volumes.  The ability to predict/know the name of a worker node's root volume PVC."
