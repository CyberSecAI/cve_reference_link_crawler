| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2265398#c0)  Nick Tait    2024-02-21 20:36:59 UTC  ``` A security issue has been discovered in the HCP OpenShift Virtualization provider that allows unauthorized users to gain access to HCP worker node root volumes.  The attack vector is a component called kubevirt-csi, which provides the ability for an HCO OCP-Virt guest cluster to be configured in a way that lets the guest cluster use the same underlying storage as the infrastructure cluster the VMs are running in. Through the use of kubevirt-csi and a well crafted PV within the HCP OCP-Virt guest cluster, a user who has the ability to create PVs can gain access to any node's root volume by crafting a PV volumeHandle that matches the name of a worker node VM's root volume PVC. That name is trivial to predict because it is the node's name followed by "-rhcos".  The result is the user can then get kubevirt-csi to attach any node's root volume to a pod workload within the guest cluster as a PVC.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2265398#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-02 19:33:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15  Via RHSA-2024:1559 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1559](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1559)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2265398#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-26 12:38:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14  Via RHSA-2024:1891 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1891](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1891)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2265398#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-05-02 16:37:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.13  Via RHSA-2024:2047 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2047](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A2047)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2265398#c9)  Martin Prpič    2024-06-11 15:34:52 UTC  ``` Upstream, this was addressed via commit:  <https://github.com/kubevirt/csi-driver/pull/103/commits/a61f36c42700f54352919318ed806d1ae2d716f4>   ``` |  |
