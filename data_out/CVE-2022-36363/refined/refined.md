- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected devices do not properly validate an offset value that can be defined in TCP packets when calling a method.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper validation of a specified index, position, or offset in input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can retrieve parts of the device's memory content.
- **Attack vectors**: Network based, sending specially crafted TCP packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send TCP packets to the device. No authentication is required.
