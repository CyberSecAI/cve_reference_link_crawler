SSA-955858: Multiple Vulnerabilities in LOGO! 8 BM Devices

| Publication Date: | 2022-10-11 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-10-08 |
| Current Version: | V1.3 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 9.8 |

SUMMARY

LOGO! 8 BM (incl. SIPLUS variants) contains multiple web-related vulnerabilities. These could allow an attacker to execute code remotely, put the device into a denial of service state or retrieve parts of the memory.

The vulnerabilities are related to the hardware of the product. Siemens has released new hardware versions with the LOGO! V8.4 BM and the SIPLUS LOGO! V8.4 BM product families for all affected devices in which several of those vulnerabilities are fixed. See the chapter "Additional Information" below for more details.

For more information please also refer to the related product support article: <https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109826554/>.

WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* Restrict access to port 135/tcp to trusted IP addresses only
* Only for versions < V8.3: Restrict access to port 10005/tcp to trusted IP addresses only
* Only for versions >= V8.3: Restrict access to port 8443/tcp to trusted IP addresses only

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.
Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Siemens LOGO! BM (Base Module) devices are used for basic small-scale automation tasks.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the same firmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-36361

Affected devices do not properly validate the structure of TCP packets in several methods. This could allow an attacker to cause buffer overflows, get control over the instruction counter and run custom code.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 9.8 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:T/RC:C |
| CWE | CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') |

Vulnerability CVE-2022-36362

Affected devices do not conduct certain validations when interacting with them. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to manipulate the devices IP address, which means the device would not be reachable and could only be recovered by power cycling the device.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.5 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:T/RC:C |
| CWE | CWE-20: Improper Input Validation |

Vulnerability CVE-2022-36363

Affected devices do not properly validate an offset value which can be defined in TCP packets when calling a method. This could allow an attacker to retrieve parts of the content of the memory.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 5.3 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:T/RC:C |
| CWE | CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input |

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to port 135/tcp to trusted IP addresses only
• Only for versions < V8.3: Restrict access to port 10005/tcp to trusted IP addresses only
• Only for versions >= V8.3: Restrict access to port 8443/tcp to trusted IP addresses only

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Siemens LOGO! BM (Base Module) devices are used for basic small-scale automation tasks.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same firmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory. Wherever
applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-36361

Affected devices do not properly validate the structure of TCP packets in several methods. This could
allow an attacker to cause buffer overflows, get control over the instruction counter and run custom
code.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

9.8
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:T/RC:C
CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (’Classic Buffer
Overflow’)

Vulnerability CVE-2022-36362

Affected devices do not conduct certain validations when interacting with them. This could allow an
unauthenticated remote attacker to manipulate the devices IP address, which means the device would
not be reachable and could only be recovered by power cycling the device.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

7.5
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:T/RC:C
CWE-20: Improper Input Validation

Vulnerability CVE-2022-36363

Affected devices do not properly validate an offset value which can be defined in TCP packets when
calling a method. This could allow an attacker to retrieve parts of the content of the memory.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

5.3
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:T/RC:C
CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset
in Input
