- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing capability check on the `ajax_zemanta_set_featured_image` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Missing authorization, allowing unauthorized access to functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access or higher can upload arbitrary attachment files (like jpg, png, txt, zip) and set them as featured images for posts. This could be used to deface the site or potentially for other malicious purposes by uploading dangerous files.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack; sending a crafted request to the vulnerable function via AJAX.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  Requires an authenticated attacker with at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site.
