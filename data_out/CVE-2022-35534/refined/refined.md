**Summary of Vulnerabilities**

The core vulnerability across all the described instances is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in various CGI scripts (`adm.cgi`, `firewall.cgi`, `login.cgi`, `nas.cgi`, `qos.cgi`, and `wireless.cgi`) on the WAVLINK routers. This allows an attacker to inject operating system commands into HTTP POST requests, which the router then executes. The affected models include WN572HP3, WN533A8, WN530H4, WN535G3, and WN531P3.

**Overall Impact**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to:

*   Full control of the affected device.
*   Potential for further network compromise.
*   The ability to use the router in botnet activities.
*   Theft of sensitive data handled by the router.
