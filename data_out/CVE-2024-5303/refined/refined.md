- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of PSD files, leading to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must entice the target to either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file containing a crafted PSD file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to deliver a malicious PSD file to the victim, and the victim must interact with it (open the file, visit malicious page).
