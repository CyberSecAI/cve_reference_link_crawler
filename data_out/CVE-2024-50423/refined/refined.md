- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control. The plugin fails to properly restrict access to certain functionalities, allowing unauthorized users to perform actions they should not be able to.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can execute higher-privileged actions. The specific impact varies depending on the affected function, but could lead to unauthorized modification of data, access to sensitive information, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the vulnerable function within the WordPress plugin, that is accessible to unprivileged users, and does not properly validate authorization, authentication or nonce tokens.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user with "Contributor" role or lower to exploit the vulnerability and execute higher-privileged actions.
