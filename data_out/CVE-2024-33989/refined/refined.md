The provided content is related to CVE-2024-33989.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the School Event Management System version 1.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The specific weakness is a reflected XSS vulnerability. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when generating the HTML output, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious JavaScript payload. This payload, when executed within the victim's browser, could allow the attacker to partially take over their browser session, potentially gaining access to sensitive data like cookies or other session information.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a specially crafted request that includes malicious JavaScript code within the `eventdate` and `events` parameters in the `/report/event_print.php` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious JavaScript payload and deliver it to an authenticated user who interacts with the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves, but needs to entice the victim to trigger the malicious code.
