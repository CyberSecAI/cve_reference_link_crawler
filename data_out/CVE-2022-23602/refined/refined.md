Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23602:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Nim's rst parser not properly sandboxing `include` and `code` directives. This allowed an attacker to embed local files into the parsed output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The rst parser, when processing `include` and `code` directives, was not restricting access to local files.
- **Lack of Sandboxing:** The parser did not prevent the inclusion of arbitrary local files, which could expose sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could read sensitive files on the server running the NimForum application.
- **Potential Secret Stealing:** By including configuration files, attackers could obtain secrets like database credentials or API keys.
- **Silent Exploitation:** The vulnerability could be exploited silently through the post "preview" feature of NimForum.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Creating a forum post or thread with malicious rst directives using `.. include::` or `.. code:: :file:`.
- Exploiting the "preview" feature of NimForum, which parses rst content and exposes the output to users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs a valid forum account to create posts or threads.
- No special privileges or prior knowledge of the system are needed beyond this access.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit `cb894c7` introduces `roSandboxDisabled` option that disables `raw`, `include` directives by default.
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was present in NimForum < 2.1.0 and docutils < 1.6.2.
- The fix involves introducing sandboxing to the rst parser, disabling potentially dangerous directives by default and providing a flag to enable it.
