Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-20512:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A hardcoded AES key exists within the Power Management Firmware (PMFW).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Hardcoded cryptographic key.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A privileged attacker can potentially gain access to the hardcoded AES key.
- This could lead to the leakage of internal debug information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have high privileges on the system to access the PMFW and extract the key.

**Summary:**
CVE-2023-20512 describes a low severity vulnerability where a hardcoded AES key in the AMD Power Management Firmware (PMFW) could be exposed to a local attacker with high privileges, potentially revealing internal debug information. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 1.9.
