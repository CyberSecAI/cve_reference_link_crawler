- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Arkhe Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject scripts, including redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, which will be executed when a user visits the site. This could result in various malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** Malicious scripts are injected into the website through the plugin's vulnerable input fields or settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts through the plugin which requires at least Contributor level access to the WordPress site.
