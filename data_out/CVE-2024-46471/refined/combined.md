# Membership Management System in PHP with Source Code

A fully functional project based on a membership management system that uses PHP Language with MySQL Database. The following PHP Mysql project contains all the essential features that can be used by second-year IT students for their college projects. It has several features that allow users to manage and track membership records. This system as well as the web application’s concept is all clear. It’s identical to real-world scenarios and well-implemented on it. To download a free membership management system project in PHP with source code files, please scroll down to the bottom of this post for the Download button.

#### About Membership Management System PHP Project

In particular, this PHP-based membership system offers an all-encompassing suite. It adeptly handles the flow of membership types, members, revenues, and streamlined membership card processes. With meticulous precision, the web application meticulously organizes and monitors every member and others. Alongside their membership and records, ensuring a comprehensive overview and smooth functionality (codeastro.com). The administrative interface offers extensive control, enabling detailed oversight of overall attributes, and facilitating an intuitive and enriching user experience. Notably, its focused approach emphasizes essential functionalities. This project encapsulates pivotal aspects of an online membership system, presenting a comprehensive project that underscores the fundamental features of an efficient online membership management system.

#### Admin Panel

An administrator has full control over the system. At the core of this PHP membership system project lies a robust admin panel. It serves as the centralized control hub, empowering administrators to manage all facets of the platform effortlessly. From overseeing memberships, revenues, types, and more to managing cards, this panel offers comprehensive control. Detailed reports and insights are readily accessible, providing administrators with invaluable data for informed decision-making (codeastro.com). Additionally, an integrated system setting ensures administrators can simply change their minor settings at any time. As well as update passwords and currency for the whole system. All features are accessible only from the admin panel, as a result, there will be only one system user.

#### Membership Types

One of the important sections of this project is related to types of membership. As mentioned earlier, only the system administrator is allowed to access the features of this membership management system project. And just like that, the system admin can add and manage types of membership. To add membership types, the administrator just has to provide two details. One is the name of the membership type and the other one is the total charge or amount for it(codeastro.com). The membership types can be added anything like basic, silver, bronze, premium, and so on with their respective amount. The amount section is linked to the selected membership type when adding members into the system or their renewals. In addition to that, the membership-type data tables help to search for records in a short amount of time.

#### Membership Management

After completing the membership type section, the admin user can now add members to the system. Which we term here as membership for the system. As the main part of this whole project, adding members to the system requires many information. Such as the name of the member, date of birth, address, contact information, gender, membership type, occupation, and attachment of the member photo(codeastro.com). The attachment of a member photo is not a mandatory thing, the user can simply skip it and submit the form. By default, the system will automatically attach a default photo for such members. After the addition of members, each member will be in expired status because the member needs to make payments for their membership type through the renewal section. Also, all the new members won’t be able to receive their membership cards.

#### Membership Renewal and Membership Card

Talking about the membership renewal section serves as the foundation of this whole project. The revenue part of things and activation of membership, all come under this. Once a member is added to the system, the admin has to renew his/her record through this section. The renewal section lists all the records of members with their membership expiry dates and the status of each. The admin can renew memberships of each. To renew the membership, the admin just has to select a type and total duration. The system automatically calculates the total amount according to the selected type and duration of it(codeastro.com). The membership card is only available for active members. The card contains details such as membership number, name, type, photo, and validity.

##### Report Section and Others

On the other hand, the admin user can filter and view reports on their records. There are a total of two reports, revenue and membership. The process for both is identical and simple. The user just has to provide a starting and ending date. In return, the system returns the list of records within that specific date range in the form of a table. Well, this applies to both revenue reports and membership. In terms of membership reports, the system shows details such as membership number, name, status, and type whereas in revenue, the system shows membership name, number, type, and amount(codeastro.com). Both of these reports are printable. Rest, the admin can change the name of the system along with its logo and currency through settings.

Together, these dynamic features improve user experiences, increase administrative control, and establish an interactive membership system environment for the PHP membership project. Last but not least, a clean and simple UI is presented with various color combinations for a greater user experience while using this Membership Management System Project in PHP. For its UI elements, a free open-source CSS framework; Bootstrap is on board. Presenting a new membership management system Project in PHP MySQL which includes an admin panel. That too contains all the essential features to follow up and is a knowledgeable resource for learning purposes.

            The issues you’re facing, such as the return type error and undefined properties, could be related to compatibility issues with different PHP versions. That project was tested successfully on PHP 5 and 7, indicating its compatibility with those versions. However, since we haven’t tested it on the latest PHP version, there might be some compatibility issues arising due to changes or updates in PHP.

   It is working smoothly with my Xampp PHP version 8.

   I’m a Newbie, hoping to be a real programmer someday.

   Please, Guide me to a basic PHP tutorial focusing on CRUD, the Student Management System, where a student can also log in and out and can only view his/her grades, subjects, profs, schedules, etc. and the admin or admins can have all authority to CRUD.

   My basic knowledge is HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP OOP, and a little bit of JQuery. Any links will do as long as it’s free.

   Thank you for this Sample, but I think it is too advanced for me.

       ID in the database is set to auto-increment, which means it automatically assigns the next available number when a new record is added. The gaps you’re seeing in the sequence (e.g. not in order from 1 to 10), it is due to records being deleted during our testing. The database retains the last assigned value, and when a new record is added, it takes the next available number, even if there are gaps. So, the order might not always be consecutive. If you need a strict sequential order, you may consider resetting the auto-increment field, but it’s generally not recommended, as it could lead to potential issues.

## 📁 Vulnerability: Directory Listing in /uploads folder

### 🌍 Associated CVE Details: [CVE-2024-46471](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46471)

### 🔍 Overview

A directory listing vulnerability has been discovered in the MembershipM-PHP web application. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view and potentially access sensitive files in the `/uploads` directory.

### 🛠️ Affected Component

* Application: MembershipM-PHP
* Vulnerable Path: `/uploads`

### 🔢 Steps to Reproduce

1. **Access the application's URL**

   Navigate to the MembershipM-PHP application in your web browser.

   [![Step 1: Accessing the application](/JonMoriSenpai/CVE-WriteUps/raw/main/CodeAstro%20-%20MembershipM-PHP/CVE-2024-46471/assets/1.0.png)](/JonMoriSenpai/CVE-WriteUps/blob/main/CodeAstro%20-%20MembershipM-PHP/CVE-2024-46471/assets/1.0.png)
2. **Append /uploads to the URL**

   Add `/uploads` to the end of the application's URL.
3. **View directory contents**

   The browser displays a list of all files and subdirectories within the `/uploads` folder.

   [![Step 3: Viewing directory contents](/JonMoriSenpai/CVE-WriteUps/raw/main/CodeAstro%20-%20MembershipM-PHP/CVE-2024-46471/assets/1.1.png)](/JonMoriSenpai/CVE-WriteUps/blob/main/CodeAstro%20-%20MembershipM-PHP/CVE-2024-46471/assets/1.1.png)
4. **Access sensitive files**

   Click on any listed file to download or view its contents directly in the browser.

   [![Step 4: Accessing sensitive files](/JonMoriSenpai/CVE-WriteUps/raw/main/CodeAstro%20-%20MembershipM-PHP/CVE-2024-46471/assets/1.2.png)](/JonMoriSenpai/CVE-WriteUps/blob/main/CodeAstro%20-%20MembershipM-PHP/CVE-2024-46471/assets/1.2.png)

## 🔐 Security Impact

This vulnerability can lead to several security risks:

1. **Data Exposure**: Sensitive user-uploaded files may be accessible to unauthorized users.
2. **Information Leakage**: File names and directory structure can reveal information about the application's architecture.
3. **Malware Distribution**: Attackers could potentially upload and distribute malicious files through this exposed directory.

## 💡 Solution

To mitigate this vulnerability, implement the following measures:

1. **Disable directory listing**:

   * For Apache, add the following line to your `.htaccess` file in the `/uploads` directory:
     ```
     Options -Indexes

     ```
   * For Nginx, add the following to your server block:
     ```
     autoindex off;

     ```
2. **Implement proper access controls**:

   * Use PHP to serve files from the `/uploads` directory instead of allowing direct access.
   * Validate user permissions before serving files.
3. **Use random file names**:

   * Rename uploaded files to random strings to prevent guessing of file names.
4. **Move the uploads directory**:

   * Place the `/uploads` directory outside of the web root to prevent direct URL access.

## 🏁 Conclusion

The directory listing vulnerability in MembershipM-PHP's `/uploads` folder poses a significant security risk. By implementing the suggested solutions, you can greatly enhance the security of your application and protect sensitive user data from unauthorized access.

Remember to regularly perform security audits and keep your application updated to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.
