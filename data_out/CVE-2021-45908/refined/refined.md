The provided content describes two stack-based buffer overflows in the `DecodeLZW` function of the `gif2apng` application, which are assigned CVE-2021-45908 and CVE-2021-45907.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient boundary checks in the `DecodeLZW` function while processing LZW encoded image data from a GIF file. Specifically, there are two identified overflow locations within the function's loops.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **For loop overflow:** The first overflow occurs in the `for` loop where the code iterates up to `clearcode`. A crafted GIF file can set a large `mincodesize` leading to a `clearcode` value greater than 4097, causing a write beyond the bounds of the `suffix` array (size 4097).
2.  **While loop overflow:** The second overflow occurs in the `while` loop which uses a `code` variable to index into the `suffix` and `prefix` arrays. By crafting the GIF data to create a loop within the `prefix` array (where `prefix[code]` results in the same `code` again), the `*pstr++` operation writes beyond the bounds of the `str` buffer (size 4097).

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities is a stack-based buffer overflow. The provided bug report mentions a segmentation fault/crash due to this overflow. While the report suggests that arbitrary code execution might not be directly achievable due to lack of control over the overwritten data, a crash is still possible.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves a maliciously crafted GIF file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted GIF file to the vulnerable `gif2apng` application, for example by tricking a user into processing the crafted GIF file.
