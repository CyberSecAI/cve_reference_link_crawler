([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 0.9.5

## Patched versions

0.9.5, 0.10.5

## Description

### Impact

Receiving unknown QUIC frames in a QUIC packet could result in a panic.

### Patches

The problem has been fixed in 0.9.5 and 0.10.5 maintenance releases.

### References

Fixed in [#1667](https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/pull/1667), backported in [#1668](https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/pull/1668) and [#1669](https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/pull/1669).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

### CVE ID
