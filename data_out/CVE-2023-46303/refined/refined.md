Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the way PANDOC and CALIBRE handle image source URLs within HTML files during document conversion. Specifically, they fail to properly sanitize or restrict the schemes allowed in the `<img>` tag's `src` attribute, as well as `<iframe>` tags, enabling Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The applications make requests to URLs specified in the `src` attribute of `<img>` tags (and `<iframe>` tags in Calibre), without proper validation of the URL scheme. This allows an attacker to force the server to make requests to internal resources or external services.
*   **Lack of URL Scheme Restriction:** The converters do not restrict the allowed URL schemes, allowing for file:// URLs, which can lead to the disclosure of local files. They also allow http:// URLs, potentially exposing internal services if the conversion process occurs on a server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local File Disclosure:** By using `file://` URLs, an attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, such as `/etc/passwd`.
*   **Internal Service Discovery and Exploitation:** An attacker could probe internal services by using `http://` URLs pointing to internal IP addresses and ports.
*   **External Service Interaction:** An attacker could make the server interact with external services by specifying `http://` URLs to external IP addresses, potentially causing the server to leak data or be exploited through interaction with vulnerable external services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HTML Files:** The primary attack vector is through a crafted HTML file containing malicious image tags (`<img>`) with `src` attributes using `file://` or `http://` URLs.
*   **Document Conversion:** The vulnerability is triggered during the conversion of the malicious HTML file to other formats (e.g., EPUB, ODT, DOCX, PPTX, FB2) using the `pandoc` or `ebook-convert` command line tools.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Malicious HTML Files:** An attacker must be able to provide a malicious HTML file as input to the PANDOC or CALIBRE conversion processes.
*   **Access to the vulnerable conversion tool:** The attacker must be able to trigger the conversion process by using either pandoc or ebook-convert.

**Additional Details from Content**
*   The vulnerability exists in both PANDOC and CALIBRE.
*   The vulnerability is not limited to EPUB conversion but also affects ODT, DOCX, PPTX and FB2 conversions, though the behaviour varies slightly between formats.
*   In CALIBRE, the `<iframe>` tag can also be used to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The content also includes specific examples of how to exploit the vulnerability including `file:///etc/passwd` and `http://ip-api.com/csv` being used as sources within the `<img>` tag.
