Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-31869:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Apache Airflow handles provider configurations when the `webserver.expose_config` is set to `"non-sensitive-only"`. Specifically, sensitive provider configurations are exposed through the UI configuration page. This occurs because Gunicorn workers do not fork and load the configuration properly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive configurations of Airflow providers via the web UI, despite the intention of `non-sensitive-only` setting to hide them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An authenticated user could view sensitive provider configuration information. The provided text specifies the celery provider as the only community provider that currently has sensitive configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the Airflow web UI. An authenticated user can access the "configuration" page and view sensitive data that should have been filtered out using the `"non-sensitive-only"` setting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Apache Airflow web UI.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Apache Airflow versions 2.7.0 through 2.8.4.
*   The fix was implemented in pull request #38795 and is included in Airflow 2.9.0.
*   A workaround is to set `expose_config` to `False`.
*   This is similar to CVE-2023-46288, but that vulnerability affected the API configuration, not the UI.
