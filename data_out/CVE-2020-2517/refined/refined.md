Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-2517:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Heap buffer overflow in the Oracle Database Gateway for ODBC. The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly handle overly long error messages returned by a malicious database gateway.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** A heap buffer is overflowed by an overly long error message, which can lead to corruption of adjacent memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to overwrite address pointers in the heap, ultimately leading to the ability to write arbitrary data to arbitrary memory locations.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** While not explicitly mentioned as the only outcome, code execution with the corrupted arrays can be used to gain higher privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Database Gateway:**  The attack involves querying a malicious database gateway that is set up to return an overly long error message.
*   **Network-Based Attack:** A malicious actor can perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the network between the Oracle database and a linked database gateway.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Create Procedure/Database Link Privileges:**  The attacker needs to have the `CREATE PROCEDURE` and `CREATE DATABASE LINK` privileges on the vulnerable Oracle database instance.
*  **Database User:** A malicious or compromised database user with the required privileges could initiate the attack.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Position:** Alternatively, an attacker with a presence on the network capable of performing MitM attacks between the Oracle database and a linked database gateway can execute the attack.
* **Heap Memory Spray:**  The attacker needs the ability to spray the Java heap with `int[1]` arrays before the attack.
* **Memory Address Prediction:**  The attacker needs to have an estimate of memory addresses occupied by the Java arrays.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit involves a multi-step process:
    1.  Heap spraying with Java `int[1]` arrays.
    2.  Triggering the heap overflow by querying a malicious database gateway with an overly long error message.
    3.  Corrupting an array's length via the overflow, extending its bounds, and encapsulating array access in a `try-catch` block.
    4.  Modifying the corrupted array to have a length of `0x40000000`.
    5.  Using the modified array as a "write-what-where" primitive to overwrite memory and potentially gain code execution.

**Additional Notes:**

* This vulnerability requires an attacker to have a deeper understanding of heap memory management and how to influence it through database interactions.
*   The provided information suggests this is the "harder" of the two vulnerabilities discussed in the context of database links, the easier being a SQL Injection vulnerability (CVE-2020-2510).
* The provided Oracle advisory document lists affected versions of the Oracle Database Server as 11.2.0.4, 12.1.0.2, 12.2.0.1, 18c, and 19c.
