- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when handling PDF files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can disclose sensitive information from the affected system. This can potentially be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a malicious PDF file or a malicious web page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to entice the victim to open a malicious PDF file or visit a malicious web page. User interaction is required for successful exploitation.
