- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control in the Intel Driver & Support Assistant (DSA) software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software lacks proper access control mechanisms, which allows an authenticated user to escalate their privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can escalate their privileges on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** Adjacent access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with adjacent access to the system. The attack also requires user interaction.
