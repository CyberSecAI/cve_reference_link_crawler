[Friends-Of-Presta Security Advisories](/)

[Cybersecurity Glossary](/glossary/)[About](/about/)

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: DO NOT REPORT VULNERABILITIES SOLELY TO THE AUTHOR OR MARKETPLACE.

We urge you to report any vulnerabilities directly to us. Our mission is to ensure the safety and security of the PrestaShop ecosystem. Unfortunately, many module developers may not always recognize or acknowledge the vulnerabilities in their code, whether due to lack of awareness, or inability to properly evaluate the associated risk, or other reasons.

Given the rise in professional cybercrime networks actively seeking out these vulnerabilities, it's crucial that any potential threats are promptly addressed and the community is informed. The most effective method to do this is by publishing a CVE, like the one provided below.

Should you discover any vulnerabilities, **please report them to us at: report[@]security-presta.org** or visit [https://security-presta.org](https://security-presta.org/) for more information.

Every vulnerability report helps make the community more secure, and we are profoundly grateful for any information shared with us.

# [CVE-2023-33663] Improper neutralization of a SQL parameter in aicustomfee from ai-dev module for PrestaShop

Aug 16, 2023

In the module “Customization fields fee for your store” (aicustomfee) for PrestaShop, an attacker can perform SQL injection up to 0.2.0. Release 0.2.1 fixed this security issue.

## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-33663](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-33663)
* **Published at**: 2023-08-16
* **Advisory source**: Friends-Of-Presta.org
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: aicustomfee
* **Impacted release**: < 0.2.1 (0.2.1 fixed issue)
* **Product author**: ai-dev / @ide-info
* **Weakness**: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.8)

## Description

Before 0.2.1, sensitives SQL calls in file `includes/ajax.php` can be executed with a trivial http call and exploited to forge a blind SQL injection throught the POST or GET submitted `data` and `product` variables.

## CVSS base metrics

* **Attack vector**: network
* **Attack complexity**: low
* **Privilege required**: none
* **User interaction**: none
* **Scope**: unchanged
* **Confidentiality**: high
* **Integrity**: high
* **Availability**: high

**Vector string**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Possible malicious usage

* Technical and personal data leaks
* Obtain admin access
* Remove all data of the linked PrestaShop
* Display sensitives tables to front-office to unlock potential admin’s ajax scripts of modules protected by token on the ecosystem

## Patch

```
--- a/modules/aicustomfee/includes/ajax.php
+++ b/modules/aicustomfee/includes/ajax.php
switch (Tools::getValue('action')) {
    case 'cloneCombination':
        if (!($data = Tools::getValue('data')) || !($combination = Tools::getValue('combination')) || !($product = Tools::getValue('product'))) {
            die();
        }

        $data = explode('|', $data);
+       $data = array_map('intval', $data);
        $result = Db::getInstance()->getRow(
            'SELECT COUNT(id_product_attribute) AS number, id_product_attribute FROM '._DB_PREFIX_.'product_attribute_combination WHERE id_attribute IN ('.implode(',', $data).') GROUP BY id_product_attribute HAVING number = '.count($data)
        );

--- a/modules/aicustomfee/includes/functions.php
+++ b/modules/aicustomfee/includes/functions.php
    public function createCombination($product, $old_combination, $data)
    {
        //    Add for Prestashop 1.5 version and above
        if ((float)Tools::substr(_PS_VERSION_, 0, 3) >= 1.5) {
            $shop_id = (int)Shop::getContextShopGroupID();
        }
+       $product = (int) $product;
+       $old_combination = (int) $old_combination;
+       $data = array_map('intval', $data);
        //    Get the product data
        $product_data = Db::getInstance()->getRow('SELECT * FROM '._DB_PREFIX_.'product WHERE id_product = '.$product);

```
## Other recommandations

* + To help improve the security of your PrestaShop installation, we recommend upgrading to the latest version. One of the benefits of upgrading is that it will disable the use of multiquery executions (separated by semicolons). However, please be aware that this **will not protect** your shop against SQL injection attacks that use the UNION clause to steal data. Additionally, it’s important to note that PrestaShop includes a function called pSQL, which includes a strip\_tags function. This helps protect your shop against [Stored XSS (also known as XSS T2) of Category 1](https://security.friendsofpresta.org/modules/2023/02/07/stored-xss.html). If a pSQL function is missing, it could potentially expose your project to critical Stored XSS vulnerabilities due to edge cases. Therefore, it’s crucial to ensure that all relevant functions are properly implemented and used consistently throughout your project.
* Change the default database prefix `ps_` by a new longer arbitrary prefix. Nevertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhats with DBA senior skills because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942’s rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against these set of rules.

### More info

You have **custom fields** in your shop and you would like some of them to be **invoiced**, in the case for example of an engraving, you want to invoice the latter according to the number of letter of the text that entered the customer? Prestashop does not natively do what you want, you have to **weight up your products** by adding combinations and hoping that the customer is **not mistaken** between the number of letters contained in the text entered and the choice of the number of letters in the **combination** he selected.

The product customization via **text fields** offered in the product allow you to allow your customers to send you a special data, but you can not **make money with** this data with this system that is confined to **collect data** and include them in the **cart** and other documents, which allows you to have access to this data but nothing to draw from it in the case where it serves you to carry out a task for which a price is necessary, if we take for example the case of an **engraving**, where the name for example is necessary and for which you would **charge each letter**.

The **price customization module** allows you to fill in the gap by allowing you to **set the amount to be added** for each letter entered by the customer, **including or not spaces**, fields customizable fields that can have its own rate, you get **paid customization** of your products according to your production costs, allowing you to adjust the **price according to** **information entered** by the customer, which is a more **logical system** than setting a price for the product without paying for this customization.

You can add spaces in the string to calculate final price or not.

Thus each personalization fields can be assigned a tariff, the latter being **added to the final price**.

Links to download the documentations of the module are available at the bottom of the page.
