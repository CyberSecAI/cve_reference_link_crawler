Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-33663:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `aicustomfee` module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the `data` and `product` variables submitted via POST or GET requests to the `includes/ajax.php` file are not adequately sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The module is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks because the `data` and `product` parameters are directly included in SQL queries without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
- **Data Leaks:** Sensitive technical and personal data can be extracted from the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers could gain administrative access to the PrestaShop installation.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can modify or delete data in the database.
- **Front-Office Exposure:** Attackers could display sensitive database tables to the front-office potentially exposing protected admin scripts, by forging SQL queries that return their results.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered through HTTP requests using either POST or GET methods.
- **Unsanitized Input:** The primary vector is through manipulation of the `data` and `product` variables, which are not sanitized before being used in the SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior privileges or access to the system.
- **No User Interaction:** The attack can be carried out without requiring any user interaction.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the PrestaShop instance.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `modules/aicustomfee/includes/ajax.php` and `modules/aicustomfee/includes/functions.php`
- The fix involves casting the `data`, `product`, and `old_combination` variables to integers to prevent injection.
- The advisory mentions that upgrading PrestaShop can disable multiquery executions, but this does not protect against SQL injection using UNION clauses.
- The advisory recommends using the `pSQL` function, that include a `strip_tags` function, to help protect against stored XSS and SQL injections (by helping with sanitization).
- The advisory recommends changing the default database prefix, but notes this doesn't protect against skilled attackers.
- The advisory suggests activating OWASP 942 rules in the Web Application Firewall (WAF) but with a caveat of needing to configure bypasses.
