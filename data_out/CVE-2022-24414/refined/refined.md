Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-24414:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the exposure of the authentication token in GET requests within Dell EMC CloudLink. These tokens are included as parameters in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Authentication tokens, which are meant to be kept secret, are being passed as URL parameters.
- **Logging of Tokens:** These request parameters, including the authentication tokens, can be logged in reverse proxies and server logs. This creates a vulnerability where attackers can potentially gain access to these logs and extract valid tokens.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers who obtain valid authentication tokens can potentially use them to gain unauthorized access to the CloudLink server.
- **Complete compromise:** Successful exploitation allows for full compromise of the affected system including confidentiality, integrity, and availability

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attack occurs over the network, as the tokens are transmitted in HTTP GET requests.
- **Log Analysis:** Attackers need to gain access to server logs or reverse proxy logs where the vulnerable URLs are recorded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Logs:** The attacker must have access to server logs or reverse proxy logs where the request URLs containing the exposed authentication tokens are recorded.
- **High Privileges:** The CVSS vector suggests that the attacker needs high privileges.

**Affected Products:**
- Dell EMC CloudLink versions 7.1.3 and all earlier versions are affected.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Dell EMC CloudLink version 7.1.3 or later, where this vulnerability is addressed by preventing token exposure in URLs.
- The provided document states tokens should not be used in request URLs to avoid attacks.
