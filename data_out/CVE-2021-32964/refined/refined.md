This document provides details about CVE-2021-32964, which is a path traversal vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The AGG Software Web Server plugin (webserver.dll) does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to traverse the file system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Path Traversal (CWE-23): Allows reading of arbitrary files on the file system.
  - Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79): This vulnerability, associated with CVE-2021-32962, is also mentioned in the document. It allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely.

**Impact of exploitation:**
  - Path Traversal: An attacker could read sensitive files from the system.
  - Cross-site Scripting: An attacker could achieve remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
  - Network access: Both vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.
  - Low attack complexity: Exploitation is considered to be of low complexity.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker does not require any special privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerabilities (No Authentication or User Interaction Required)

**Additional details:**
  - The affected versions of the Web Server plugin are v4.0.40.1014 and prior.
  - The vendor recommends updating to version 4.0.42 Build 512 or later to mitigate the vulnerabilities.
  - The CVSS v3 base score for the Path Traversal is 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).
  - The CVSS v3 base score for the XSS vulnerability (CVE-2021-32962) is 8.2 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N).
  - This vulnerability affects multiple critical infrastructure sectors and is deployed worldwide.
