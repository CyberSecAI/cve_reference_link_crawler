Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper use of `add_query_arg` function without proper escaping within the DK PDF plugin. This function is used to construct URLs, and without sanitization, it allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS due to the lack of output sanitization when constructing URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary web script injection: Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into pages.
- User compromise: If a user clicks on a crafted link containing malicious code, the code will be executed in their browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted URLs: Attackers create malicious URLs containing JavaScript code.
- Social engineering: Attackers trick users into clicking on the malicious links, such as through emails or other forms of communication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to get a victim to click a crafted link.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the DK PDF plugin up to and including 1.9.6.
- The issue was resolved in version 1.9.7.
- The vulnerable code is located within the `class-dkpdf-settings.php` file.
