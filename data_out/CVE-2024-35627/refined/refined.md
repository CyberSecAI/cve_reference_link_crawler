Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-35627:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. The "key" parameter's value in the URL is reflected in the response without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS vulnerability. The application doesn't encode or sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Compromise of user accounts and user data.
    - Forcing users to perform sensitive actions.
    - Stealing sensitive data.
    - Performing CORS attacks.
    - Defacement of the web application.
    - Broader compromise if other applications are hosted on the same domain.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is via a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code within the "key" parameter.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to click or visit the manipulated URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the injected JavaScript.
- They need to be able to get the victim to visit the crafted URL (e.g., via phishing).

**Affected Product:**
- TileServer GL

**Affected Versions:**
- <= 4.4.10

**Patched Versions:**
- 4.5.0

**Steps to reproduce:**
1.  Locate a vector data URL under the DATA section (e.g., http://<address>:8083/data/malaysia-vector/#0/0.00000/0.00000).
2.  Modify the URL to include the malicious "key" parameter (e.g., http://<address>:8083/data/malaysia-vector/?key='-alert(1)-').
