Package        : libspreadsheet-parseexcel-perl
Version        : 0.6500-1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-7101
Debian Bug     : 1059450

Le Dinh Hai discovered that libspreadsheet-parseexcel-perl, a Perl
module allowing information extraction from Excel spreadsheets,
improperly sanitizes directives in dynamically evaluated code.

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by using specially crafted
Number format strings within XLS and XLSX files, triggering the
execution of arbitrary code during the parsing process.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
0.6500-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libspreadsheet-parseexcel-perl packages.

For the detailed security status of libspreadsheet-parseexcel-perl please refer to
