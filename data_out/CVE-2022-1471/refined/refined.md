Here's the breakdown of the information related to CVE-2022-1471:

**CVE-2022-1471:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The `Constructor()` class in SnakeYAML does not restrict types that can be instantiated during deserialization of YAML content. This allows an attacker to provide malicious YAML payloads that can lead to remote code execution by instantiating arbitrary classes present in the application's classpath.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Unsafe deserialization of YAML due to the lack of type restrictions.  Specifically, `SnakeYaml's Constructor()` allows the instantiation of classes beyond those expected or intended by the application during deserialization.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploitation can lead to remote code execution (RCE), disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).  This can occur because the attacker can control which classes are instantiated during deserialization, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code present within the classloader.  Attackers can leverage existing classes in the classpath to build "gadget chains" and achieve RCE.

*  **Attack Vectors:** By providing a malicious YAML document that contains directives for instantiating specific classes. The YAML input is processed by the vulnerable `Constructor()` class in SnakeYAML.  In some cases, it's noted that untrusted input is not required as some existing classes in common Java libraries may be leveraged.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to supply malicious YAML data to an application using the vulnerable `Constructor()` class.  This often involves sending a crafted YAML file to the target application. The attacker does not need to have a high privilege level on the host to exploit the vulnerability. Some public exploits utilize JNDI to load and execute malicious classes from a remote server.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **NetApp Products:**  Multiple NetApp products are identified as affected by this vulnerability. Specifically:
    *   Active IQ Unified Manager for Linux
    *   Active IQ Unified Manager for Microsoft Windows
    *   Spot PC
    *  NetApp HCI Compute Node (Bootstrap OS) (Under Investigation)

*  **Kubernetes Java Client:** The Kubernetes Java client library was also found to be vulnerable.

*   **Apache Submarine:** Apache Submarine versions 0.7.0 before 0.8.0 were vulnerable through the  `YamlEntityProvider` entity provider which uses SnakeYAML for handling YAML requests. This was resolved by replacing to `jackson-dataformat-yaml`.

*   **SnakeYAML's Stance:** The maintainer of SnakeYAML initially argued that the issue is not a bug but an intended feature and a false positive due to improper use of security tooling. They claim that the default `Constructor()` is meant to allow instantiation of any class, and users should use `SafeConstructor` for untrusted input. This stance was later revised as the severity of the vulnerability became apparent.

*   **Mitigation:** Using SnakeYAML's `SafeConstructor` is recommended as a way to restrict deserialization and prevent the vulnerability. Another way is to use `SnakeYAML Engine` which does not create Java instances by default. The 1.34 version introduced a blacklist approach `ClassNameInspector`, however, this was found to be insufficient. The final fix for the vulnerability is to disable the processing of global YAML tags by default, as these tags are used to specify class instantiation, and allow developers to opt-out of this functionality if needed.

*   **Transitive Dependency Issues:** The vulnerability is difficult to remediate for some projects due to SnakeYAML being a transitive dependency, causing a need to update multiple libraries.

*   **"Low Quality Tooling" Debate:**  There is debate about the role of vulnerability scanning tools, with the SnakeYAML maintainer arguing that these tools produce "low quality" results by reporting false positives since applications may not be using the vulnerable code paths in the library.   Security researchers counter that the tools are accurately reporting a real vulnerability in the default configuration of SnakeYAML.

*   **Secure by Default:** Multiple parties recommend that SnakeYAML should be secure by default, using `SafeConstructor` or equivalent as default and making the user explicitly opt-out of the secure behavior if required.  This aligns with the concept of "secure by default", which aims to make secure configurations the easiest to use.

*   **Blacklisting vs Whitelisting:** There was discussion on how to fix the deserialization issue, with the SnakeYAML maintainer initially suggesting a blacklist of known dangerous classes. However, it is generally agreed that a whitelist approach or completely disabling the feature by default is the correct way to mitigate the vulnerability since blacklists are insufficient and create a constant game of "whack-a-mole".

*  **Context:** It was noted that the concept of "trusting the source" is different to every developer. Some sources might be deemed secure and others not. Data is considered "untrusted" if it is supplied by an unauthenticated or unauthorized user, or is untrusted by another measure of risk assessment.

*   **Version 1.34 and 2.0:**  SnakeYAML version 1.34 introduced a blacklist, while the more comprehensive fix which addresses the vulnerability is implemented in version 2.0, which removes the unsafe mechanism of instantiating arbitrary classes by default and provides an ability to allow only specific types to be instantiated.

*  **CVE Updates** It was noted that the CVE system is not always good at retroactively update information and that it may be better to request another CVE to encourage end users to upgrade to a new safe version.

*  **Vendor and Application Impact** The discussion also highlighted the impact that the vulnerability can have on various software vendors, and how the default insecure behavior of SnakeYaml has led to vulnerable use cases in popular projects.

*   **RedHat RestEasy:** The RestEasy JBoss framework was also found to be vulnerable when using SnakeYaml to parse requests with the content types of `text/yaml` `text/x-yaml` & `application/x-yaml`.

*  **Atlassian Products:** Atlassian also released a security advisory as some of their products also use SnakeYaml: https://confluence.atlassian.com/security/cve-2022-1471-snakeyaml-library-rce-vulnerability-in-multiple-products-1296171009.html
