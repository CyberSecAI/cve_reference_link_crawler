Subject: CVE-2023-46302: Apache Submarine: Fix CVE-2022-1471 SnakeYaml
 unsafe deserialization

Severity: critical

Affected versions:

- Apache Submarine 0.7.0 before 0.8.0

Description:

Apache Software Foundation Apache Submarine has a bug when serializing against yaml. The bug is caused by snakeyaml  <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1471> .

Apache Submarine uses JAXRS to define REST endpoints.  In order to
handle YAML requests (using application/yaml content-type), it defines
a YamlEntityProvider entity provider that will process all incoming
YAML requests.  In order to unmarshal the request, the readFrom method
is invoked, passing the entityStream containing the user-supplied data in `submarine-server/server-core/src/main/java/org/apache/submarine/server/utils/YamlUtils.java`.

We have now fixed this issue in the new version by replacing to `jackson-dataformat-yaml`.
This issue affects Apache Submarine: from 0.7.0 before 0.8.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 0.8.0, which fixes this issue.
If using the version smaller than 0.8.0  and not want to upgrade, you can try cherry-pick PR  <https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1054>  and rebuild the submart-server image to fix this.

This issue is being tracked as SUBMARINE-1371
