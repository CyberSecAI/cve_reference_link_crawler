- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the EN100 Ethernet module while parsing specially crafted HTTP packets to the `/txtrace` endpoint. The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating a specific argument in the HTTP request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is classified as CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer. This indicates that the software does not properly validate or restrict operations on memory buffers, leading to the possibility of memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to crash the affected application, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, using specially crafted HTTP packets sent to the `/txtrace` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction. They need to be able to send network traffic to the affected devices and manipulate the relevant HTTP request argument.

The advisory also provides mitigations like blocking access to ports 80/tcp and 443/tcp using a firewall, applying secure substation concept and Defense-in-Depth measures, and disabling the web service within the device configuration if not required.
