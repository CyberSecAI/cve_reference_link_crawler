- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `elasticsearch-certutil` CLI tool, when used with the `csr` option to create Certificate Signing Requests, generates and stores the associated private key on disk without encryption, even when a passphrase is provided using the `--pass` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Private key is stored unencrypted on disk.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the server can obtain the unencrypted private key, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other security compromises.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the server where the `elasticsearch-certutil` tool was used to generate a Certificate Signing Request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires local access with high privileges to the server where the tool was executed and the private key is stored. The CVSS score also notes that a high privileged user is required to conduct the attack.
