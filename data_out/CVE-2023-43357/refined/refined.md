- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Title" field within the "My Preferences - Manage Shortcuts" section of CMSmadesimple.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim user's browser session.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious script and injecting it into the "Title" field of a shortcut in the "My Preferences - Manage Shortcuts" section. The injected script will be executed when another user accesses the page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user with access to the CMSmadesimple administration panel to modify the shortcuts.
