The affected component is awk.c:3009, in evaluate function. Following is the reproduction process, and we put the poc file in the attachment. [1.] Environment Ubuntu 18.04, 64 bit BusyBox 1.36.1 Clang 6.0.0  [2.] Compilation 2.1 Modify the Makefile: HOSTCC=clang -fsanitize=address HOSTCXX=clang++ -fsanitize=address CC=clang CFLAGS=-fsanitize=address CPPFLAGS=-fsanitize=address LDFLAGS="-Wl,--allow-multiple-definition" 2.2 Modify the Config.in file, switch the following configs to y： DEBUG: y DEBUG_PESSIMIZE: y FEATURE_CLEAN_UP: y DEBUG_SANITIZE: y 2.3 Commands for compilation: export ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0 make defconfig make install  [3.] Reproduction export ASAN_OPTIONS="abort_on_error=1 symbolize=0"
