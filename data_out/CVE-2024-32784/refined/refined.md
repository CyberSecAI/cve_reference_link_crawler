- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute higher-privileged actions due to the broken access control. The specific impact varies on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by an unprivileged user accessing a vulnerable function without proper authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker only needs to be a subscriber-level user to exploit the vulnerability.
