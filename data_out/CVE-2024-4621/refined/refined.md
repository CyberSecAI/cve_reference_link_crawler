- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ArForms plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape certain settings, specifically within the Custom CSS field of a form.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with admin-level privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website. This code will execute whenever a user views the affected page/form, potentially leading to various malicious activities like session hijacking, defacement or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to access the form settings and inject the malicious payload into the Custom CSS field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have admin privileges to modify the plugin settings.
