## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# ArForms < 6.6 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Add or edit an existing form and in the Custom CSS, enter the payload:
`"p {color: red;}</style> <script>alert(2)</script><style>`
2. Save
3. Reload and see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
