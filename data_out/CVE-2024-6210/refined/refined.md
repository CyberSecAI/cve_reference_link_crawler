Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6210

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an information exposure flaw in the Duplicator plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the plugin was revealing the full server path to the installation directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The plugin exposes the full server path of the WordPress installation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Exposure:** Attackers can learn the exact file system path of the WordPress installation. This information can be used in reconnaissance or as a component in exploiting other vulnerabilities. The wordfence article notes that on its own, the information is of limited use.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress installation. No other special permissions or capabilities are required.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was present in Duplicator plugin versions up to and including 1.5.9.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.5.10.
*   The vulnerable code is located in `main.installer.php` (as referenced in the provided links).
* The fix included adding code to prevent direct access to the installer directory and the backup folders (`/installer/dup-installer`, `/backups-dup-lite`, `/wp-snapshots`).

**Summary**
The Duplicator WordPress plugin versions 1.5.9 and below suffer from a full path disclosure vulnerability. This allows unauthenticated attackers to learn the server's file path, which could help with reconnaissance or exploit other vulnerabilities, though it has limited use on its own.
