Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-52473:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a NULL pointer dereference in the error handling path of the `thermal_zone_device_register_with_trips()` function within the Linux kernel's thermal subsystem. Specifically, if the `device_register()` function fails, the `tz` variable is set to `NULL`, and subsequently, the code attempts to access `tz->tzp` within `kfree(tz->tzp)`, leading to the dereference of a null pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The primary weakness is the dereference of a NULL pointer. The code incorrectly assumes that 'tz' will always be a valid pointer when it is freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Crash/Denial of Service:** Exploiting this vulnerability will lead to a kernel crash and consequently a denial of service. This occurs because the kernel cannot access a memory location pointed to by a null address.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Triggering a failure of the `device_register()` function within the `thermal_zone_device_register_with_trips()` function. This could be achieved by providing malformed or invalid thermal zone configurations during thermal zone registration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence thermal zone registration, likely requiring some form of system access. This may be achieved through local access or by exploiting a different vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability existed because of a redundant `tz = NULL` assignment, which was added in commit adc8749b150c to avoid a potential double free. This assignment was made redundant after commit 4649620d9404 changed the behavior of `thermal_zone_device_unregister()`. The fix removes the `tz = NULL` assignment, thus preventing the null pointer dereference.

**Summary of changes:**
The fix involves removing the line `tz = NULL;` from the error handling path of  `thermal_zone_device_register_with_trips()`.
This line was located before the call `kfree(tz->tzp)`.
The vulnerability was introduced by commit adc8749b150c and made redundant by commit 4649620d9404.
The problematic code was found in `drivers/thermal/thermal_core.c` file.
