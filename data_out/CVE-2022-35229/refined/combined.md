### Description

**ID: ZBV-2022-04-1**

**CVE: CVE-2022-35229**

**Synopsis:** Reflected XSS in discovery page of Zabbix Frontend

**Description:** An authenticated user can create a link with reflected Javascript code inside it for the discovery page and send it to other users. The payload can be executed only with a known CSRF token value of the victim, which is changed periodically and is difficult to predict.

**Severity:** Low

**Known Attack Vectors:** Malicious code has access to all the same objects as the rest of the web page and can make arbitrary modifications to the contents of the page being displayed to a victim during social engineering attacks.

**Resolution:** To remediate this vulnerability, apply the updates listed in the 'Fixed Version' section to appropriate products.

**Workarounds:** The vulnerability can be exploited only by authenticated users. If an immediate update is not possible, review user access rights to your Zabbix Frontend, be attentive to browser warnings and always check any links you can receive via email or other means of communication, which lead to the discoveryconf.php page of Zabbix Frontend and contain suspicious parameters with special symbols. If you have clicked on the suspicious link, do not fill out the opened form.

Package        : zabbix
Version        : 1:4.0.4+dfsg-1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-15132 CVE-2020-15803 CVE-2021-27927 CVE-2022-24349
                 CVE-2022-24917 CVE-2022-24919 CVE-2022-35229 CVE-2022-35230
Debian Bug     : 935027 966146 1014992 1014994

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in zabbix,
a network monitoring solution, potentially allowing User Enumeration,
Cross-Site-Scripting or Cross-Site Request Forgery.

CVE-2019-15132

Zabbix through 4.4.0alpha1 allows User Enumeration. With login requests, it is
possible to enumerate application usernames based on the variability of server
responses (e.g., the "Login name or password is incorrect" and "No permissions
for system access" messages, or just blocking for a number of seconds). This
affects both api_jsonrpc.php and index.php.

CVE-2020-15803

Zabbix before 3.0.32rc1, 4.x before 4.0.22rc1, 4.1.x through 4.4.x
before 4.4.10rc1, and 5.x before 5.0.2rc1 allows stored XSS in the URL
Widget.

CVE-2021-27927

In Zabbix from 4.0.x before 4.0.28rc1, 5.0.0alpha1 before 5.0.10rc1,
5.2.x before 5.2.6rc1, and 5.4.0alpha1 before 5.4.0beta2, the
CControllerAuthenticationUpdate controller lacks a CSRF protection
mechanism. The code inside this controller calls diableSIDValidation
inside the init() method. An attacker doesn't have to know Zabbix user
login credentials, but has to know the correct Zabbix URL and contact
information of an existing user with sufficient privileges.

CVE-2022-24349

An authenticated user can create a link with reflected XSS payload for
actions’ pages, and send it to other users. Malicious code has access to
all the same objects as the rest of the web page and can make arbitrary
modifications to the contents of the page being displayed to a victim.
This attack can be implemented with the help of social engineering and
expiration of a number of factors - an attacker should have authorized
access to the Zabbix Frontend and allowed network connection between a
malicious server and victim’s computer, understand attacked
infrastructure, be recognized by the victim as a trustee and use trusted
communication channel.

CVE-2022-24917

An authenticated user can create a link with reflected Javascript code
inside it for services’ page and send it to other users. The payload can
be executed only with a known CSRF token value of the victim, which is
changed periodically and is difficult to predict. Malicious code has
access to all the same objects as the rest of the web page and can make
arbitrary modifications to the contents of the page being displayed to a
victim during social engineering attacks.

CVE-2022-24919

An authenticated user can create a link with reflected Javascript code
inside it for graphs’ page and send it to other users. The payload can
be executed only with a known CSRF token value of the victim, which is
changed periodically and is difficult to predict. Malicious code has
access to all the same objects as the rest of the web page and can make
arbitrary modifications to the contents of the page being displayed to a
victim during social engineering attacks.

CVE-2022-35229

An authenticated user can create a link with reflected Javascript code
inside it for the discovery page and send it to other users. The payload
can be executed only with a known CSRF token value of the victim, which
is changed periodically and is difficult to predict.

CVE-2022-35230

An authenticated user can create a link with reflected Javascript code
inside it for the graphs page and send it to other users. The payload
can be executed only with a known CSRF token value of the victim, which
is changed periodically and is difficult to predict.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:4.0.4+dfsg-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your zabbix packages.

                 CVE-2023-29456 CVE-2023-29457
Debian Bug     : 1026847

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in zabbix, a network
monitoring solution, potentially allowing to crash the server, information
disclosure or Cross-Site-Scripting attacks.

Important Notices:
To mitigate CVE-2019-17382, on existing installations, the guest account
needs to be manually disabled, for example by disabling the the "Guest
group" in the UI:
   Administration -> User groups -> Guests -> Untick Enabled

This update also fixes a regression with CVE-2022-35229, which broke the
possiblity to edit and add discovery rules in the UI.

CVE-2013-7484

    Zabbix before version 4.4.0alpha2 stores credentials in the "users"
    table with the password hash stored as a MD5 hash, which is a known
    insecure hashing method. Furthermore, no salt is used with the hash.

CVE-2019-17382 (Disputed, not seen by upstream as not a security issue)

    An issue was discovered in
    zabbix.php?action=dashboard.view&dashboardid=1 in Zabbix through
    4.4. An attacker can bypass the login page and access the dashboard
    page, and then create a Dashboard, Report, Screen, or Map without
    any Username/Password (i.e., anonymously). All created elements
    (Dashboard/Report/Screen/Map) are accessible by other users and by
    an admin.

CVE-2022-35229

    An authenticated user can create a link with reflected
    Javascript code inside it for the discovery page and send it to
    other users. The payload can be executed only with a known CSRF
    token value of the victim, which is changed periodically and is
    difficult to predict.

CVE-2022-43515

    Zabbix Frontend provides a feature that allows admins to
    maintain the installation and ensure that only certain IP addresses
    can access it. In this way, any user will not be able to access the
    Zabbix Frontend while it is being maintained and possible sensitive
    data will be prevented from being disclosed. An attacker can bypass
    this protection and access the instance using IP address not listed
    in the defined range.

CVE-2023-29450

    JavaScript pre-processing can be used by the attacker to gain
    access to the file system (read-only access on behalf of user
    "zabbix") on the Zabbix Server or Zabbix Proxy, potentially leading
    to unauthorized access to sensitive data.

CVE-2023-29451

    Specially crafted string can cause a buffer overrun in the JSON
    parser library leading to a crash of the Zabbix Server or a Zabbix
    Proxy.

CVE-2023-29454

    A Stored or persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
    was found on “Users” section in “Media” tab in “Send to” form field.
    When new media is created with malicious code included into field
    “Send to” then it will execute when editing the same media.

CVE-2023-29455

    A Reflected XSS attacks, also known as non-persistent attacks, was
    found where an attacker can pass malicious code as GET request to
    graph.php and system will save it and will execute when current
    graph page is opened.

CVE-2023-29456

    URL validation scheme receives input from a user and then parses
    it to identify its various components. The validation scheme can
    ensure that all URL components comply with internet standards.

CVE-2023-29457

    A Reflected XSS attacks, also known as non-persistent attacks, was
    found where XSS session cookies could be revealed, enabling a
    perpetrator to impersonate valid users and abuse their private
    accounts.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:4.0.4+dfsg-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your zabbix packages.
