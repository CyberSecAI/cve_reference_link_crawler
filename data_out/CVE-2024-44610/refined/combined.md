# CVE-2024-44610: PEAK PCAN-Ethernet Gateway FD DR Authenticated Root Exploit

## What is it?

This repository contains a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit that executed code as root on Peak Ethernet gateways. It requires that you know the credentials to the web interface.

## How to fix it?

The vendor has rapidly provided fixed firmware:

* [PCAN-Gateway FD Software Version 1.3.0](https://www.peak-system.com/PCAN-Gateway-FD-Software.540.0.html)
* [PCAN-Gateway Software Version 2.11.0](https://www.peak-system.com/PCAN-Gateway-Software.348.0.html)

## How to use it?

Compile the program using Golang and then run as follows:
`./PcanExploit -ip 192.168.1.10 -httpaddr 192.168.1.250 -user admin -pass admin [-fd]`

If the exploit was successful a bindshell will be started on the device as root. You can see two screenshots at the bottom of this page.

The options have the following meaning:

* ip: IP address of the gateway
* httpaddr: IP address of the interface on the local computer to which the gateway is connected
* user: Username
* pass: Password
* fd: Add this flag if the device is a CAN-FD gateway.

While the non-FD version is also vulnerable, this is of little practical importance since these devices don't implement signed firmware updates, and you could thus simply upload your own modified firmware.

## How does it work?

Two shell command injection vulnerabilities are used:

### Vulnerability 1: Command injection in device firmware update

It is possible to include a shell command in the filename of the update package that is uploaded to the web interface, for example:

*test';ping 1.1.1.1;'.raucb*

The command will be executed as the www-data user, which runs the webserver. The filename needs to have the right extension (tar or raucb depending on the device)

### Vulnerability 2: Command injection in /home/peak/updater

The binary internally runs system on the provided filename, as long as it exists. It can be exploited as follows:

sudo /home/peak/updater -f "a;ping 1.1.1.1;"

Since this binary can be ran via sudo it is possible to execute the command as root.

## Screenshots

# CVE-2024-44610 PEAK PCAN-Ethernet Gateway Root Exploit

The PEAK PCAN-Ethernet Gateway (FD) DR is vulnerable to an authenticated root exploit. This exploit allows an attacker to gain root access to the device.

To use the exploit it is required to know the credentials for the web interface.

The vendor has provided updated firmware images that resolve the issue:

* [PCAN-Ethernet Gateway FD Firmware Version 1.3.0](https://www.peak-system.com/PCAN-Ethernet-Gateway-FD.540.0.html)
* [PCAN-Ethernet Gateway Firmware Version 2.11.0](https://www.peak-system.com/PCAN-Ethernet-Gateway.348.0.html)

A proof of concept exploit is available [here](https://github.com/BertoldVdb/PcanExploit).
