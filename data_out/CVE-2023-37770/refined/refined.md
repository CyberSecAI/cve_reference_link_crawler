Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the stack-overflow vulnerability:

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a recursive function `streambinopShared` in `/faust/compiler/boxes/ppbox.cpp` which calls itself through `boxppShared::print` and the `operator<<` overload, leading to excessive stack usage when processing a deeply nested or complex expression.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Unbounded recursion:** The core issue is the lack of a mechanism to limit the recursion depth in the `streambinopShared` function when printing a complex expression tree. This function calls `boxppShared::print` which in turn can call `streambinopShared` again, leading to a cycle that consumes stack space.
    *   **Deeply nested expressions:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specific crafted input string with a deeply nested structure of operations, which causes the recursive calls to overflow the stack.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a stack overflow, leading to a crash of the `faust` compiler, effectively causing a denial of service. This prevents the compilation of a specially crafted faust program.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **Crafted input:** The attack vector is a specially crafted faust input file containing a deeply nested expression (`process =->>>>>>>>>...min~999;`).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **Ability to provide input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious faust program as input to the `faust` compiler.
