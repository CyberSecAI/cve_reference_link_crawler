- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can perform actions that require higher privileges. The specific impact varies depending on the context of the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by a function that lacks proper access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a "subscriber" (unprivileged user) to exploit this vulnerability.
