### Relevant Content:
The vulnerability is present in the `RevivePress â€“ Keep your Old Content Evergreen` plugin for WordPress, specifically in versions up to and including 1.5.6.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check in the `import_data` and `copy_data` functions. These functions are used for importing and exporting plugin settings via AJAX requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The `import_data` and `copy_data` functions lack proper authorization checks. Although they include a nonce verification (`$this->verify_nonce();`), they fail to verify if the user has the `manage_options` capability before allowing access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Settings Modification:**  Authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access or higher can overwrite plugin settings by sending crafted AJAX requests to the vulnerable functions.
- **Unauthorized Settings Viewing:** Attackers can view plugin settings via the `copy_data` function.

**Attack vectors:**
-   The attack vector is through AJAX requests to the `process_import_data` and `process_copy_data` actions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level access.
-  The attacker needs to be able to send AJAX requests to the vulnerable endpoints.

**Code Snippets:**

The vulnerable functions within the `Database.php` file include:

```php
public function copy_data() {
    // security check
    $this->verify_nonce();
    if ( ! current_user_can( 'manage_options' ) ) {
        $this->error( __( 'Error: Missing permission!', 'wp-auto-republish' ) );
    }
    $option = get_option( 'wpar_plugin_settings' );
    $this->success( array(
        'settings_data' => wp_json_encode( $option ),
    ) );
}

public function import_data() {
    // security check
    $this->verify_nonce();
    if ( ! current_user_can( 'manage_options' ) ) {
        $this->error( __( 'Error: Missing permission!', 'wp-auto-republish' ) );
    }
    if ( ! isset( $_REQUEST['settings_data'] ) ) {
        $this->error();
    }
    $data = wp_unslash( $_REQUEST['settings_data'] );
    // phpcs:ignore WordPress.Security.ValidatedSanitizedInput.InputNotSanitized
    $settings = (array) json_decode( $data );
    if ( ! empty( $settings ) && is_array( $settings ) ) {
        update_option( 'wpar_plugin_settings', $settings, false );
        // set temporary transient for admin notice
        set_transient( 'rvp_import_db_done', true );
    }
    $this->success();
}
```
The issue here is that the capability check is done *after* the nonce check, but before the actual logic is executed. This is a common error and leads to an authorization bypass.

**Remediation:**
The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.5.6.1 of the plugin. Users are advised to update to the latest version.
