Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-3407:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A double-free vulnerability exists in MuPDF during the linearization process of PDF documents. This occurs when a dictionary object is freed and then later freed again due to a logic error in the object handling during linearization. Specifically, it appears to be caused by parsing an illegal object from a broken file and assigning it to object 0, which is defined to be free.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double free: The core issue is that the same memory location is freed twice, leading to memory corruption.
- Improper object handling: The vulnerability arises from incorrect management of PDF objects during linearization and garbage collection processes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: The double free leads to heap corruption.
- Denial of service (DoS): The vulnerability can be triggered through a crafted PDF document, leading to program crashes and potentially denial of service.
- Potential unspecified impact: The vulnerability may have further, unspecified consequences. The bug report mentions that further exploitation may be possible, such as placing data of the same size in the freed chunk which could lead to more exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious PDF documents: The primary attack vector involves enticing a user to open a specially crafted PDF document.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF document that triggers the double-free condition in MuPDF. The attacker can be remote.
