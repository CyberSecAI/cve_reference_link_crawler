In the “pdf_new_dict” function source/pdf/pdf-object.c: 907 obj = Memento_label (fz_malloc (ctx, sizeof (pdf_obj_dict)), "pdf_obj (dict)"); In this line, memory allocated for dictionary (data type in a pdf file). 2. Then, in the process of garbage collection, duplicate objects (various entities of the pdf format) deleted, and they renumbered. The previously created dictionary object is deleted in the pdf_drop_dict (pdf-object.c: 1702)) function. source/pdf/pdf-object.c: 1702 fz_free (ctx, obj); 3. Valgrind detected a call to the field of size 2 bytes of the dictionary object, which deleted in the function fz_drop_imp16. include/mupdf/fitz/context.h: 702 if (* refs> 0) 4. After that, the dictionary object freed again, which leads to SIGABORT because the address of the freed chunk has already freed. 5. For further exploitation, it is necessary to place data of the same size in this chunk and select a situation with the dictionary, such that this will lead to exploitation. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=703366#c1)  Mishechkin Maxim    2021-01-22 10:41:54 UTC  ``` GDB with debug: [Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled] Using host libthread_db library "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libthread_db.so.1". warning: first object in xref is not free warning: object out of range (0 0 R); xref size 61 corrupted double-linked list  Program received signal SIGABRT, Aborted. __GI_raise (sig=sig@entry=6) at ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/raise.c:51 51      ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/raise.c: No such file or directory.
