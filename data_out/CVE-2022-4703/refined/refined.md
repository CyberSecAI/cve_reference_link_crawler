Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-4703:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control on the `wpr_reset_previous_import` AJAX action within the Royal Elementor Addons plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The AJAX action `wpr_reset_previous_import` does not verify the user's capabilities or use nonce checks before allowing access to the function. This allows any authenticated user, regardless of their role or permissions, to execute this action.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Loss of Availability:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can delete previously imported content, potentially resulting in site availability issues. This is because the deletion of imported content can disrupt the expected functionality of the site or render pages incomplete or broken.
*   **Data Loss:** An attacker could potentially cause a loss of data by deleting user content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is executed over the network via AJAX requests to the vulnerable function.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the target WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site. Even a low-privileged user like a subscriber can exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send AJAX requests to the WordPress site.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges or capabilities beyond being an authenticated user.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerable code can be found in the `/admin/templates-kit.php` file of the plugin (line 402 of the provided code).
* Wordfence has blocked 18 attacks targeting this vulnerability in the past 24 hours.
