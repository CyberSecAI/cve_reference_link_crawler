# Arbitrary code execution when compiling specifically crafted malicious code

Critical

@babel/traverse

## Description

### Impact

Using Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation, when using plugins that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel methods.

Known affected plugins are:

* `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`
* `@babel/preset-env` when using its [`useBuiltIns`](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#usebuiltins) option
* Any "polyfill provider" plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`, such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`

No other plugins under the `@babel/` namespace are impacted, but third-party plugins might be.

**Users that only compile trusted code are not impacted.**

### Patches

The vulnerability has been fixed in `@babel/traverse@7.23.2`.

Babel 6 does not receive security fixes anymore (see [Babel's security policy](https://github.com/babel/babel/security/policy)), hence there is no patch planned for `babel-traverse@6`.

### Workarounds

* Upgrade `@babel/traverse` to v7.23.2 or higher. You can do this by deleting it from your package manager's lockfile and re-installing the dependencies. `@babel/core` >=7.23.2 will automatically pull in a non-vulnerable version.
* If you cannot upgrade `@babel/traverse` and are using one of the affected packages mentioned above, upgrade them to their latest version to avoid triggering the vulnerable code path in affected `@babel/traverse` versions:
  + `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` v7.23.2
  + `@babel/preset-env` v7.23.2
  + `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider` v0.4.3
  + `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2` v0.4.6
  + `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3` v0.8.5
  + `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims` v0.10.0
  + `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator` v0.5.3

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
