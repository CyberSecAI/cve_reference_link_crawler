{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Missing SSL certificate validation",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The S3Browser application does not properly validate SSL certificates when communicating with S3 compatible storage. This lack of validation allows for man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful MitM attack could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information transmitted between S3Browser and the S3 compatible storage, such as files being read, written, or listed.",
  "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attack.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the S3Browser application and the S3 compatible storage. This typically requires the attacker to be on the same network or have the ability to reroute network traffic."
