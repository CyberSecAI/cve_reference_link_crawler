Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of input validation and sanitization of the `$_FILES` variable in the `add_room.php` file, specifically on line 8. This allows an attacker to control the file storage location by manipulating the uploaded file data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the unrestricted file upload, allowing attackers to upload arbitrary files without proper checks on file type, size, or content.
- **Lack of Input Validation:**  The application fails to validate and sanitize user-supplied input in the `$_FILES` variable.
- **Direct Use of User Input:** The application directly uses the file input to determine the storage location, without any prior checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **File Overwrite:** Attackers could overwrite existing files on the server.
- **File Injection:** Malicious files, such as PHP scripts, can be uploaded to the server.
- **Directory Traversal:** Exploitation could potentially lead to directory traversal attacks.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Uploading large or malicious files might cause a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The most significant impact is the possibility of RCE by uploading and executing malicious PHP scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `add_room.php` endpoint.
- **Multipart Form Data:** The request uses multipart/form-data to simulate a file upload.
- **Malicious Payload:** The malicious code is embedded within the uploaded file, disguised as an image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests with manipulated multipart/form-data.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the location of the `add_room.php` file.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates uploading a PHP file containing `<?php system("ipconfig"); ?>` as a payload to achieve RCE.
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the "Simple Online Hotel Reservation System in PHP Project With Source Code".
- The affected file is `add_room.php`.
