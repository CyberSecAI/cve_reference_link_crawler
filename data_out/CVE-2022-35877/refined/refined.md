{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `log` function uses `vsnprintf` to format log messages, and attacker-controlled configuration values are directly injected into the format string parameter of `log` without proper sanitization or validation in multiple instances within the `testWifiAP` XCMD handler.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Format string injection vulnerability",
    "Lack of input sanitization/validation",
    "Use of attacker-controlled data in format strings"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Memory corruption, information disclosure, and denial of service. The format string injection allows attackers to potentially leak stack memory and write arbitrary memory.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by modifying the Wi-Fi configuration values (e.g., SSID, WPA password, WEP key) via the mobile app, web app, or by using the setWifiAP XCMD or local web interface, then triggering the vulnerable testWifiAP XCMD.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to modify the Wi-Fi configuration parameters and send the crafted testWifiAP XCMD, which can be achieved through an unauthenticated UDP service on port 55050.",
   "Additional Details": "The vulnerability exists in multiple locations inside the `do_test_wifiap` function when handling various Wi-Fi configuration settings. The output of the format string injections is only visible to an attacker with physical access to the device's UART console."
