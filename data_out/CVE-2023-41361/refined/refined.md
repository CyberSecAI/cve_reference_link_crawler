{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) software version capability handling did not properly check the length of the received software version, potentially exceeding the maximum allowed size (BGP_MAX_SOFT_VERSION).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input validation, specifically a missing length check on the received software version in BGP messages. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the received version string is larger than expected.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could send a maliciously crafted BGP message with an oversized software version, leading to a denial of service (application crash).",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a malicious BGP packet with a software version capability exceeding the maximum allowed length.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send BGP messages to the vulnerable FRR instance. This typically means being a peer or having network access that allows sending BGP packets."
