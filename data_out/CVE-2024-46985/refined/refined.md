The content is related to CVE-2024-46985.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an XML external entity injection (XXE) in the static resource upload interface of DataEase.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XXE vulnerability: The application parses untrusted XML input without properly sanitizing external entity references. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XML code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Intranet detection: Attackers can use the XXE vulnerability to probe the internal network.
- File reading: Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server by exploiting the XXE vulnerability, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request to the `/de2api/staticResource/upload/1` endpoint with a malicious XML payload embedded within a multipart/form-data request.
- The malicious XML payload exploits an external DTD to load and execute external entities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker does not require prior authentication.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to host a malicious DTD file on a server accessible to the target.
