The provided content relates to CVE-2021-41168.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a weak hash function (SDBM) in the markdown parser's reference table implementation. This weak hash function, combined with the lack of duplicate key prevention and the incorrect key equality check, allows for hash collision denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Weak Hash Function:** The `hash_link_ref` function uses a case-insensitive version of the SDBM hash function, which is susceptible to predictable collisions.
2.  **Duplicate Entries:** The hash table implementation allows duplicate keys, which enables an attacker to create long linked lists with duplicate entries.
3.  **Incorrect Key Equality:** The hash table determines key equality based on hash values alone, rather than comparing the actual reference names. This can lead to retrieval of the wrong reference for a given name.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a denial-of-service (DoS). By inserting many colliding or duplicate entries, an attacker can significantly increase the time needed to retrieve references. This increased parsing time could overload a server that is processing markdown content, leading to reduced availability or complete service outage.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted markdown text containing a large number of reference definitions with either colliding hash values or duplicate reference names. By sending this crafted text to the markdown parser, an attacker can trigger the algorithmic complexity issues, resulting in DoS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to submit arbitrary markdown text that is processed by the vulnerable markdown parser, Snudown. No other special position or access is required. The attacker does not need to be authenticated in order to execute this attack.

The provided content also contains the fix that was implemented:
1. The SDBM hash function was replaced with SipHash, which is more secure and provides a keyed hash function to prevent collision attacks.
2. The `add_link_ref` function was updated to prevent duplicate entries from being added to the hash table.
3. The `find_link_ref` function was updated to compare reference labels in addition to comparing the hash values to ensure that correct references are being returned.
