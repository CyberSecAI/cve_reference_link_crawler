Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3604

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient escaping of user-supplied input and a lack of proper preparation within the existing SQL query within the 'osm\_map\_v3' shortcode. Specifically, the `tagged_filter` attribute of the shortcode is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which occurs due to improper handling of the `tagged_filter` parameter. This allows an attacker to insert arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can allow attackers to extract sensitive data from the WordPress database.
*   **Potential for Full Database Compromise:**  While the provided information focuses on information extraction, SQL injection vulnerabilities can be leveraged for more severe attacks, including complete database compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is network-based as it involves crafted HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
*   **Shortcode Manipulation:**  The attacker crafts a malicious `osm_map_v3` shortcode, injecting SQL code through the `tagged_filter` attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** Attackers need to be authenticated WordPress users with at least contributor-level access to inject the malicious shortcode via a post/page.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `tagged_filter` parameter within the `osm_map_v3` shortcode is vulnerable.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability is in the "OSM â€“ OpenStreetMap" WordPress plugin, specifically versions 6.0.3 and earlier.
*   **Patch:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 6.0.4 of the plugin.
*  **CVSS Score:** 9.9 (Critical)
*  **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
