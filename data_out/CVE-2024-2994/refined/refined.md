Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a stack-based buffer overflow in the `GetParentControlInfo` function of the Tenda FH1203 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Overflow:** The `strcpy` function is used to copy user-supplied data into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without proper bounds checking. The `mac` parameter from a POST request is copied into `s`.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The firmware does not validate or limit the length of the `mac` parameter provided by the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** A successful exploit could overwrite the return address on the stack, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the router.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwriting the stack might lead to unexpected behavior, causing the device to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/GetParentControlInfo` endpoint with an overly long `mac` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Tenda FH1203 router, either on the local network or through an exposed service.
- **HTTP Communication:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable firmware version is Tenda FH1203 V2.0.1.6.
- The `src` variable receives the `mac` parameter and `strcpy` copies it to `s`, where the overflow occurs if the length of mac exceeds the size of `s`.
- A Proof of Concept (POC) exploit is provided, demonstrating how to trigger the overflow using a Python script and the `requests` library by sending a POST request with a long "mac" value.
