**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `index` parameter within the `student_payment_details2.php` file of the "Complete Web-Based School Management System".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is an **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) injection**. This means that an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web application that will be executed in the browsers of other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to turn trusted websites into malicious ones.
