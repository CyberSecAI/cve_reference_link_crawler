Based on the provided information, all the commits are related to the same vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The frequency table arrays within the Qualcomm Global Clock Controller driver for IPQ9574 lack a terminating empty element.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** This missing terminator can lead to out-of-bounds access when functions such as `qcom_find_freq()` or `qcom_find_freq_floor()` traverse these tables. These functions might read beyond the allocated memory for the table if they do not encounter the terminator.

**Impact of exploitation:** An out-of-bounds read could potentially lead to information disclosure, a crash, or other undefined behavior.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered internally by the kernel when clock frequencies are being looked up using vulnerable helper functions. An attacker would need to find a way to trigger these lookups with a specific frequency that causes the code to read out of bounds.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would likely need some form of control or access to the system to trigger the vulnerable code path. This might involve exploiting another vulnerability to control clock parameters or by having the ability to load modules or drivers.
