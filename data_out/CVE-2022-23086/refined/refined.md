Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-23086:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `mpr`, `mps`, and `mpt` device drivers within the FreeBSD kernel. These drivers are responsible for handling communication with disk controllers.
- The drivers' implementation of `ioctl(2)` system calls for reading or writing configuration pages (`*_CFG_PAGE` ioctls) contains a heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Buffer Size Handling:** When handling `*_CFG_PAGE` ioctls, the drivers allocate a buffer based on a size provided by the caller. However, they copy a fixed-size header into this buffer.
- **Heap Overflow:** If the caller specifies a buffer size that is smaller than the fixed header size, the copy operation will overwrite heap memory beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Heap Overwrite:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary heap data.
- **Privilege Escalation:** This heap corruption can be leveraged to achieve privilege escalation, as the overwritten data could include important kernel structures.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory corruption could lead to system instability, crashes, or a denial of service.
- **Information Disclosure, Data Modification:** As stated in NetApp advisory, successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information or addition/modification of data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable locally by users with access to the device node of the affected drivers `/dev/mpr`, `/dev/mps` or `/dev/mpt`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privileged Access:**  The attacker needs to have either root privileges or be a member of the `operator` group to access the device nodes.

**Additional Notes:**
- The NetApp advisory confirms that their ONTAP 9 product incorporates the vulnerable FreeBSD kernel.
- The FreeBSD advisory provides detailed information on the vulnerability, including affected drivers and patch details.
- NetApp lists products that are not affected by this vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2022-23086 is a heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in FreeBSD's `mpr`, `mps`, and `mpt` disk controller drivers. It allows local attackers with sufficient privileges to overwrite heap memory, potentially leading to privilege escalation, denial of service, information disclosure or data manipulation.
