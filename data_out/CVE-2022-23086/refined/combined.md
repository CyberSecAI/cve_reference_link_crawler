-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512
=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-22:06.ioctl Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: mpr/mps/mpt driver ioctl heap out-of-bounds write
Category: core
Module: mpr, mps, mpt
Announced: 2022-04-06
Credits: Lucas Leong (@\_wmliang\_), Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2022-04-04 00:46:25 UTC (stable/13, 13.1-STABLE)
2022-04-04 16:24:36 UTC (releng/13.1, 13.1-RC1-p1)
2022-04-06 03:04:16 UTC (releng/13.0, 13.0-RELEASE-p11)
2022-04-04 00:47:44 UTC (stable/12, 12.3-STABLE)
2022-04-06 03:06:31 UTC (releng/12.3, 12.3-RELEASE-p5)
CVE Name: CVE-2022-23086
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
mpr(4), mps(4), and mpt(4) are disk controller drivers. They export an
ioctl(2) interface used by command-line utilities to query or set properties
on the device.
II. Problem Description
Handlers for \*\_CFG\_PAGE read / write ioctls in the mpr, mps, and mpt drivers
allocated a buffer of a caller-specified size, but copied to it a fixed size
header. Other heap content would be overwritten if the specified size was
too small.
III. Impact
Users with access to the mpr, mps or mpt device node may overwrite heap data,
potentially resulting in privilege escalation. Note that the device node is
only accessible to root and members of the operator group.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available. Systems that do not use mpr(4), mps(4) or
mpt(4) are not affected.
V. Solution
Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date,
and reboot.
Perform one of the following:
1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64, i386, or
(on FreeBSD 13 and later) arm64 platforms can be updated via the
freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
# shutdown -r +10min "Rebooting for a security update"
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-22:06/ioctl.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-22:06/ioctl.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ioctl.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile your kernel as described in
 and reboot the
system.
VI. Correction details
This issue is corrected by the corresponding Git commit hash or Subversion
revision number in the following stable and release branches:
Branch/path Hash Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/13/ 0b29e1b9f9df stable/13-n250225
releng/13.1/ aef190f298af releng/13.1-n250066
releng/13.0/ e724f3ce7970 releng/13.0-n244796
stable/12/ r371855
releng/12.3/ r371872
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
For FreeBSD 13 and later:
Run the following command to see which files were modified by a
particular commit:
# git show --stat
Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the hash:
To determine the commit count in a working tree (for comparison against
nNNNNNN in the table above), run:
# git rev-list --count --first-parent HEAD
For FreeBSD 12 and earlier:
Run the following command to see which files were modified by a particular
revision, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:
# svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base
Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:
