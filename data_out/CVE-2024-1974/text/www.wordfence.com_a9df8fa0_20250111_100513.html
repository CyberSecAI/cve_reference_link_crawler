The HT Mega – Absolute Addons For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.6 via the render function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access or higher, to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.
