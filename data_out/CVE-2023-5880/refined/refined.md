{
  "CVE-2023-5880": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Aladdin Connect device's web interface, used for configuration when the device is in Wi-Fi configuration mode, is vulnerable to XSS injection via broadcast SSID names.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the configuration page, leading to potential malicious actions such as data theft, session hijacking, or defacement. Additionally, a denial-of-service (DoS) attack can be achieved by injecting code that corrupts the web page, preventing legitimate configuration.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by broadcasting a malicious SSID name containing HTML or JavaScript code using a software-based Wi-Fi access point.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be within the 2.4 GHz band distance range during the limited configuration period when the device is in Wi-Fi configuration mode. The attacker also needs to be able to broadcast a Wi-Fi SSID. No user interaction is needed beyond the user accessing the webpage during configuration."
