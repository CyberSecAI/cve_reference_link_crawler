Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-31172:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-31172

**Vulnerability Description:** An Incomplete Filtering of Special Elements vulnerability exists in the Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories SEL-5030 acSELerator QuickSet Software. This could allow an attacker to embed instructions that could be executed by an authorized device operator.

**Affected Software:** SEL-5030 acSELerator QuickSet Software, versions up to and including 7.1.3.0

**Root Cause:** Incomplete filtering of special elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Incomplete filtering of special elements, which could allow the injection of malicious instructions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could embed instructions that could be executed by an authorized device operator. The specifics of the instructions and their impact aren't detailed in this content, but it indicates the potential for arbitrary code execution or manipulation of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered when an authorized device operator interacts with data or configuration containing the embedded instructions crafted by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious instructions that will later be processed by the software. The attacker needs to target data/configurations that are processed by the software.
*   The vulnerability involves an authorized device operator executing the injected instructions. Thus, the attacker would leverage the authorized operator to execute malicious instructions in the software environment.
