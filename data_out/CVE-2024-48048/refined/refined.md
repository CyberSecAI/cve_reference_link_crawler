- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Wsify Widget Plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions on the website while authenticated. The specific impact may vary case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can use a CSRF attack, tricking an authenticated user into unknowingly submitting a malicious request on the vulnerable website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to entice a user with administrative rights to perform an action on the vulnerable plugin while being logged in. This does not require any prior authentication.
