Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-20088

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `parseQueryString` function in MooTools More, specifically how it handles query string parameters. It iterates through the provided parameters, and uses the parameter keys to create nested objects. It does not sanitize the keys allowing an attacker to use `__proto__` or `constructor[prototype]` as a key, leading to prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is the ability to manipulate the prototype of JavaScript objects by injecting specific keys like `__proto__` or `constructor[prototype]`. This is due to the function directly assigning values to nested object structures using unsanitized keys.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `parseQueryString` function doesn't properly sanitize or validate the keys from the query string before using them to create object properties. This allows an attacker to inject malicious keys like `__proto__` or `constructor` which bypass normal object creation and target the prototype.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Property Modification:** An attacker can modify the prototype of all objects, potentially leading to unexpected behavior, denial of service, and possibly even remote code execution if specific conditions are met. By manipulating `__proto__`, the attacker can influence the properties and methods of all subsequently created objects in the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Query String:** The primary attack vector is through the URL query string. An attacker can craft a malicious URL with specific query parameters that exploit the `parseQueryString` function. For instance, injecting query parameters such as `?__proto__[test]=test` or `?constructor[prototype][test]=test` can manipulate object prototypes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to influence URL:** The attacker must be able to influence the URL that the vulnerable application processes, specifically the query string portion of the URL. The attacker could achieve this through sending crafted links via email or social media, or through other means of injecting URL parameters.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Code:** The attacker needs to know that the target application uses the vulnerable `parseQueryString` method to process query parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided code snippet shows the vulnerable code in the mootools-more library.
* The Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how a crafted URL can be used to exploit the vulnerability.
* The PoC code includes the required script includes to run the exploit
* The exploit uses the `__proto__` and `constructor[prototype]` keys to add a 'test' property to object prototypes.

This vulnerability allows for a client-side prototype pollution attack by manipulating query string parameters processed by `String.parseQueryString` in the `mootools-more` library.
