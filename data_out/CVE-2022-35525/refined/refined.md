In all cases, the attacker injects commands by using the format `xxx;command` in the respective vulnerable parameters of POST requests sent to the CGI scripts. The `xxx` part is likely a placeholder to maintain parameter format, with the actual commands injected after the semicolon.  Login is required for most of the vulnerabilities, except for the login page injection.
