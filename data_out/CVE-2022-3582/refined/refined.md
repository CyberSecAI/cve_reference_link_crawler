{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Simple Cold Storage Management System v1.0 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The application does not implement proper CSRF protection mechanisms, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the password change functionality.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can force a user to change their password by tricking them into submitting a crafted request. If the victim is an administrator, the attacker can compromise the entire web application. They can also potentially perform other state-changing actions like transferring funds or changing email addresses, depending on the application's functionality.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can use social engineering techniques, such as sending a malicious link via email or chat, to trick users into submitting a crafted request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page containing the crafted CSRF exploit."
