# Improper write access check using arbitrary page path

Moderate

[NGPixel](/NGPixel)
published
GHSA-3cv9-795v-6j7j
Feb 21, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<=2.5.275

## Patched versions

2.5.276

## Description

### Impact

An authenticated user with write access on a restricted set of paths can update a page outside the allowed paths by specifying a different target page ID while keeping the path intact. The access control incorrectly check the path access against the user-provided values instead of the actual path associated to the page ID.

### Patches

Commit [411802e](https://github.com/requarks/wiki/commit/411802ec2f654bb5ed1126c307575b81e2361c6b) fixes this vulnerability by checking access control on the path associated with the page ID instead of the user-provided value. When the path is different than the current value, a second access control check is then performed on the user-provided path before the move operation.
