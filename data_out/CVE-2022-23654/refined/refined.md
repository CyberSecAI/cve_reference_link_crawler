The provided content is related to CVE-2022-23654.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper access control check when updating a page. The system incorrectly verifies write access against user-provided path values instead of the actual path associated with the page ID.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper access control.
- Incorrect path validation during page updates.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An authenticated user with write access on a limited set of paths can modify pages outside their allowed paths. This is achieved by manipulating the target page ID while keeping the path intact.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with write access to a restricted path.
- The attacker needs to manipulate the page update request by providing a different target page ID, while keeping the path within the restricted set of allowed paths.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the system.
- The attacker must have write access to at least one page.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `411802e` by implementing a check on the path associated with the page ID instead of user-provided value.
- A secondary access control check on the user provided path is performed before the move operation if the path is different from the current one.
- The affected versions of the software are <=2.5.275 and the patched version is 2.5.276.
