- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Simply Schedule Appointments plugin has a REST endpoint that lacks authorization checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authorization in the REST endpoint `/wp-json/ssa/v1/users`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated users can retrieve WordPress user details, including names and email addresses.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a request to the vulnerable REST endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required. The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.
