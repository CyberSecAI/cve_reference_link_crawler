[5.6.2](/agronholm/cbor2/tree/5.6.2)

[`21e0deb`](/agronholm/cbor2/commit/21e0debcf8ddf9d6034a3bb0d01477f3b855e166)

* Fixed `__hash__()` of the C version of the `CBORTag` type crashing when there's a recursive reference cycle
* Fixed type annotation for the file object in `cbor2.dump()`, `cbor2.load()`, `CBOREncoder` and `CBORDecoder` to be `IO[bytes]` instead of `BytesIO`
* Worked around a [CPython bug](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99612) that caused a `SystemError` to be raised, or even a buffer overflow to occur when decoding a long text string that contained only ASCII characters
* Changed the return type annotations of `cbor2.load()` and `cbor2.load()` to return `Any` instead of `object` so as not to force users to make type casts
