{
  "cve": "CVE-2024-26134",
  "description": "A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the cbor2 library's decoder when handling long definite strings. This vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted CBOR binary with a long string, leading to a crash of the service using cbor2.",
  "affected_versions": ">5.5.1",
  "fixed_versions": "5.6.2",
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in how the cbor2 decoder handles the allocation of memory for long strings or byte strings. Specifically, the decoder doesn't properly chunk the reading of long strings, which can lead to excessive memory allocation, causing a crash.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Buffer Overflow",
     "Memory Error"
  ],
  "impact": "An attacker can crash a service using cbor2 to parse a CBOR binary by sending a long enough object, leading to a denial of service.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Sending a maliciously crafted CBOR binary containing an excessively long string or bytestring"
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send CBOR data to a service that uses the affected version of the cbor2 library."
