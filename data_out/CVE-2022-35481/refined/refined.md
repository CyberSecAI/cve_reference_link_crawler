The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in the `otfcc` project.  It includes details on heap buffer overflows, global heap buffer overflows, and segmentation faults (SEGV). It also includes the requested information for CVE-2022-33047.

**CVE-2022-33047**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Use-after-free
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A heap-use-after-free vulnerability exists.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: The program crashes due to an attempt to read freed memory.
*   **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious font file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted font file to be processed by `otfccbuild`.

The provided content contains much more detailed crash information than what would be expected from a CVE description. This includes:

*   A large number of sample files and crash logs demonstrating various heap buffer overflow vulnerabilities, SEGV faults and one heap-use-after-free.
*   AddressSanitizer output that includes the addresses where the errors occurred, the size of the reads/writes, the stack trace leading to the crash, and shadow bytes information to diagnose the root cause.
*   Specific commands to reproduce the crashes.
*   Links to sample files hosted on Google Drive.
*   Information about the `otfcc` project and the author.
