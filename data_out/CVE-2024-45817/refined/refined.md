- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Recursive call to `vlapic_error()` due to an illegal vector configuration for the error interrupt in the x86 APIC.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Recursion in `vlapic_error()` function.
    - Recursive lock acquisition attempt.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Deadlock of Xen, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors:** A buggy or malicious HVM or PVH guest can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to configure the error interrupt with an illegal vector within an HVM or PVH guest.
    - Must be running on an x86 system using Xen 4.5 or later.
