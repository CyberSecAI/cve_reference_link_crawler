Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-2901:

**1. Verification:**

The content clearly identifies CVE-2020-2901 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in the MySQL updates mentioned. This is confirmed by multiple sources:
- Fedora package announcements list CVE-2020-2901 in the list of fixed CVEs for `community-mysql` 8.0.20.
- The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-4350-1) also lists CVE-2020-2901 as a fixed issue for MySQL 8.0.
- NetApp advisory NTAP-20200416-0003 includes CVE-2020-2901 as part of multiple MySQL vulnerabilities addressed in their products.
- Oracle's Critical Patch Update Advisory also lists CVE-2020-2901 as a vulnerability affecting MySQL Server, Client, and Cluster.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The specific root cause of the vulnerability is not detailed in the provided content but is related to an issue within the MySQL server software.  The descriptions generally indicate issues related to the server's handling of data or queries.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability in MySQL is described as a flaw that can lead to potential security issues. It is part of a set of vulnerabilities that can lead to the following:
    - Unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server.
    - Unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all of the MySQL Server accessible data.
    - A hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could result in:
    - **Arbitrary code execution:** Gentoo advisory notes that the "worst of which could result in the arbitrary execution of code"
    - **Data breach:**  Unauthorized read or modification access to sensitive data
    - **Denial of Service:** Crashing or hanging the server
    - **Privilege Escalation:** Gentoo mentions "escalate privileges"

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is mainly through the MySQL protocol or other network-based protocols depending on the component.
- Both local and remote exploitation is possible. For example, the Gentoo advisory indicates local and remote exploitable vulnerabilities and the NetApp advisory mentions that the vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
- Oracle's advisory mentions both remote and local exploitation routes.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- For a remote attack, network access to the MySQL server is required.
- For some vulnerabilities, a valid user account with some privileges is needed. This includes for example the Oracle advisory which mentions a `create session` and `execute catalog` role is needed for certain exploitation.
- A local exploit typically requires the attacker to have some access to the system where MySQL is running.
