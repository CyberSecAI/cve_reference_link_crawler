### Summary of Vulnerability Information for CVE-2024-5188

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided content clearly relates to CVE-2024-5188. It describes a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Essential Addons for Elementor" plugin.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability stems from **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** within the `get_manual_calendar_events` function of the plugin. This function handles event data for the event calendar widget.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating calendar events, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be stored in the database.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Arbitrary Script Execution:** When a user views a page containing the compromised event calendar, the injected JavaScript code will execute within their browser.
   - **Potential Account Takeover:** Malicious scripts could be used to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions that can compromise the user's account or the website.
   - **Website Defacement:** Attackers can use stored XSS to modify content or perform actions on the website.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Plugin settings:** An authenticated user with Contributor access or higher can inject malicious code when creating or editing events in the calendar widget settings.
   - **Stored XSS:** The injected script is stored in the database and is executed each time a user views the affected page, making it persistent.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This level of access allows the user to create and edit content, which in this case, includes events for the calendar widget.
   - **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about the XSS vulnerability to exploit it.
