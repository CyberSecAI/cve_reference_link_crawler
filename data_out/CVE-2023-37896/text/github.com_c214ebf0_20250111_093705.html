### @Mzack9999 **[Mzack9999](/Mzack9999)** commented [Jul 13, 2023](#issue-1803648750) • edited by ehsandeep Loading

## Proposed changes

* Removed `-sandbox` option, now divided into two new options shared below.
* Added options to enable/disable file/network access.

```
   -lna, -restrict-local-network-access  blocks connections to the local / private network
   -lfa, -allow-local-file-access  allows file (payload) access anywhere on the system
```

* Fixed issue with payloads feature in sandbox mode.

## Checklist

* Pull request is created against the [dev](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/tree/dev) branch
* All checks passed (lint, unit/integration/regression tests etc.) with my changes
* I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
* I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)

Sorry, something went wrong.

```
if !(templatePathDir != "/" && strings.HasPrefix(pt, templatePathDir)) && !strings.HasPrefix(pt, templateDirectory)
```

above code is used to restrict access

* if payload file is not in template directory
* if payload file is not in directory where template is present

[@Mzack9999](https://github.com/Mzack9999) i am not sure but i think we need to test this in windows enviornment to verify if this is working properly since the root path here is `/` but root path is different for windows distro and also <https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1568>

| [@tarunKoyalwar](https://github.com/tarunKoyalwar) I think we need to add a function in utils package that given a path, perform cross-platform check from a list of allowed directories. Will create a ticket for that, meanwhile we can temporary merge this upon [@Ice3man543](https://github.com/Ice3man543) confirmation. |
