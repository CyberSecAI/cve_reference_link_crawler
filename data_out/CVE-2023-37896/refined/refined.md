Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-37896:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of file paths when loading payloads in sandbox mode within the Nuclei project. Specifically, relative paths were not being converted to absolute paths before security checks were performed. This allowed arbitrary file access when using the Nuclei Go SDK implementation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The core vulnerability is a path traversal issue, where an attacker could manipulate relative file paths to access files outside the intended directory when loading payloads, thus bypassing sandbox restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the file system. This results in a high confidentiality impact.
- **No Integrity or Availability Impact:** According to the information, the vulnerability does not lead to modification of data (integrity) or disrupt the availability of services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is **network-based**, implying an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the paths of payloads loaded by the Nuclei application, this only affects users using Nuclei as a Go SDK and running custom templates.
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the system to exploit the vulnerability.
- No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attack has a high complexity.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability only affects users using Nuclei as a Go SDK with custom templates. CLI users were not affected.
- The fix involved ensuring that all paths are absolute before the sandbox check is performed.
- The `-sandbox` option is deprecated, replaced by `-lfa` (allow local file access) and `-lna` (restrict local network access) options, providing more granular control over file and network access.
- The fix is available in version 2.9.9 and later.
