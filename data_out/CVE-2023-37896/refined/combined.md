```
if !(templatePathDir != "/" && strings.HasPrefix(pt, templatePathDir)) && !strings.HasPrefix(pt, templateDirectory)
```

above code is used to restrict access

* if payload file is not in template directory
* if payload file is not in directory where template is present

[@Mzack9999](https://github.com/Mzack9999) i am not sure but i think we need to test this in windows enviornment to verify if this is working properly since the root path here is `/` but root path is different for windows distro and also <https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1568>

| [@tarunKoyalwar](https://github.com/tarunKoyalwar) I think we need to add a function in utils package that given a path, perform cross-platform check from a list of allowed directories. Will create a ticket for that, meanwhile we can temporary merge this upon [@Ice3man543](https://github.com/Ice3man543) confirmation. |

# Nuclei < 2.9.9 - Sandbox restriction bypass

Moderate

[ehsandeep](/ehsandeep)
published
GHSA-2xx4-jj5v-6mff
Aug 4, 2023

## Package

gomod

github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 2.9.9

## Patched versions

2.9.9

## Description

## Overview

We have identified and addressed a security issue in the Nuclei project that affected users utilizing Nuclei as **Go code (SDK)** running **custom templates**. This issue did not affect CLI users. The problem was related to sanitization issues with payloads loading in `sandbox` mode.

## Details

In the previous versions, there was a potential risk with payloads loading in sandbox mode. The issue occurred due to relative paths not being converted to absolute paths before doing the check for `sandbox` flag allowing arbitrary files to be read on the filesystem in certain cases when using Nuclei from `Go` SDK implementation.

This issue has been fixed in the latest release, v2.9.9. We have also enabled sandbox by default for filesystem loading. This can be optionally disabled if required.

The `-sandbox` option has been **deprecated** and is now divided into two new options: `-lfa` (allow local file access) which is disabled by default and `-lna` (restrict local network access) which can be optionally disabled by user. The `-lfa` allows file (payload) access anywhere on the system (disabling sandbox effectively), and `-lna` blocks connections to the local/private network.

## Affected Versions

This issue affected all versions of Nuclei prior to v2.9.9.

## Patches

We recommend all users upgrade to the latest version, [v2.9.9](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/releases/tag/v2.9.9), which includes the security fix.

### References

## Acknowledgments

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
