Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a lack of proper permission checks in several admin panel endpoints of the Pimcore application. Specifically, the commit addresses missing permission checks in the following actions:

*   `getTreeAction` in `ClassController.php`: Missing permission check for listing data object classes.
*   `statisticsAction` in `IndexController.php`: Missing permission check for accessing system statistics.
*   `getAvailableSitesAction` in `SettingsController.php`: Missing permission check for retrieving available sites.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The vulnerability lies in the improper access control mechanisms for the listed actions. Without the permission checks, these actions would potentially expose sensitive information to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An unauthorized user could potentially access sensitive system information, such as data object classes, system statistics, and available sites. This information could potentially be used to aid further attacks on the system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** While not explicitly stated in the provided commit diff, the lack of proper access controls on administrative endpoints could be a stepping stone for other forms of exploitation, potentially leading to further privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** The attacker can directly make HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints without the necessary authorization. For example, `pimcore_admin_index_statistics` was specifically mentioned in `startup.js` and is targeted in the fix.
*   **Malicious manipulation of admin panel:** An attacker can gain access to functions/features that should be restricted to a user role.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the Pimcore instance:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Pimcore application instance.
*   **User Authentication Bypass:** The user likely needs to be authenticated. However, due to the missing checks, the privilege associated with the user does not matter.

**Additional Details from the Provided Content**

*   The commit message "Confidential information provided to user with no permissions" and the associated pull request number ([#15530](https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/pull/15530)) clearly indicate the nature of the vulnerability.
*   The code diffs show that the fix consists primarily of adding `$this->checkPermission()` calls to the vulnerable actions.
*   The commit modifies the javascript file `startup.js` to utilize the correct XMLHTTPRequest function to request data from `/admin/index/statistics`.
*   This is a missing access control issue, where the user is not being verified for proper authorization to access specific functions.

**Summary**

This commit addresses an access control vulnerability where an authenticated user, even without adequate permissions, can access sensitive information by directly calling specific admin panel endpoints. The fix involves adding necessary permission checks to these actions. This vulnerability can lead to information disclosure and could be exploited for further privilege escalation.
