{
  "CVE-2023-4303": {
    "description": "Fortify Plugin 22.1.38 and earlier does not escape the error message for a form validation method. This results in an HTML injection vulnerability.",
    "root_cause": "The Fortify Plugin does not properly sanitize the error message for a form validation method.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "HTML injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject arbitrary HTML into the error message displayed in the Jenkins UI. While the vulnerability is present, a security hardening in Jenkins 2.275 and LTS 2.263.2 prevents JavaScript execution, mitigating the impact to a simple HTML injection.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the error message in a form validation method. Since the vulnerability is exploitable through the Jenkins UI, it requires user interaction.",
     "required_capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities beyond being able to interact with the vulnerable form validation method are required."
