- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web application stores PBKDF2 derived keys of user passwords with a low iteration count.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of password hash with insufficient computational effort (CWE-916).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can retrieve stored password hashes and perform an offline cracking attack to recover plaintext passwords of other users.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs user profile access privileges.
