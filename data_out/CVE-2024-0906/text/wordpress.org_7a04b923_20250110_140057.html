### [Perfect Plugin](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/perfect-plugin-466/)

Does exactly what it says it does: restrict access to your entire site to only registered users. I was looking for a replacement to Absolute Privacy, which I had been using for a long time but has not been maintained in over two years. One thing to keep in mind (if you don’t read the Installation instructions) is right after you activate the plugin, you need to go to Settings → Reading and check the box to Enable Private Site.

Thanks!
I figured out that /wp-login (which is default for many users, right) doesn’t work to get me into the dashboard. I have to use /wp-admin.
You might want to explain that in the instructions somewhere.
