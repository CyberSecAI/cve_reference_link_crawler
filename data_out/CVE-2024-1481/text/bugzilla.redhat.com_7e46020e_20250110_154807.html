| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2262169#c0)  Robb Gatica    2024-01-31 21:51:33 UTC  ``` Summary: Specially crafted HTTP requests can read files in the DC server. And use keytab files for authorization for different kerberos principals.  Tested FreeIPA version: ipa-server-4.10.1  Details The "user" parameter in the HTTP URI "/sip/session/login_password" is inserted into the "run" function from the file "ipautil.py". Then it is passed as an argument to the "subprocess.Popen". As a result, the following list is passed: "args=['/usr/bin/kinit', '{user params}', '-c', /run/ipa/ccaches/kinit_13704', '-T', '/run/ipa/ccaches/armor_13704', '-C', '-E']". If instead of "{user params}" there is a string "-V", then it will be taken as an argument for "kinit". As a result, remote attackers can use options such as "-t", "-X", "-S" or "-I" for DOS, or use the keytab file from the system to log in under participants without a password.  PoC (attached screenshots): Simple request with "user=-H&password=0000000" With multiple parameters "user=-Vkt&password=0000000"  Impact Possible DOS, use keytab from system and read files on DC.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2262169#c10)  Robb Gatica    2024-02-20 15:09:45 UTC  ``` Created freeipa tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2265129](show_bug.cgi?id=2265129 "CLOSED ERRATA - TRIAGE CVE-2024-1481 freeipa: specially crafted HTTP requests potentially lead to DoS or data exposure [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=2262169#c16)  TEJ RATHI    2024-03-27 07:09:03 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 2271726](show_bug.cgi?id=2271726 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - freeipa: argument injection into the username field of the /ipa/session/login_password requests") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=2262169#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-30 09:39:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:2147 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2147](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A2147)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=2262169#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-05-22 09:40:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:3044 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3044](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3044)   ``` |  |
