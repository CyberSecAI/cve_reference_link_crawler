To return expected results, you can:

* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"
* **Did you search for an IBM acquired or sold product ?** If so, follow the appropriate link below to find the content you need.

# Security Bulletin: IBM Maximo Asset Management could allow a remote attacker to bypass authentication due to improper access controls (CVE-2023-32333)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM Maximo Asset Management could allow a remote attacker to bypass authentication due to improper access controls (CVE-2023-32333). This only impacts environments using native Maximo security when security options have been incorrectly applied to the MAXREG user.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2023-32333](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/255073)

## Affected Products and Versions

**Product versions affected:**

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| IBM Maximo Asset Management | 7.6.1.3 |

\* To determine the core product version, log in and view System Information. The core product version is the "Tivoli's process automation engine" version. Please consult the [Platform Matrix](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/1288432 "Platform Matrix") for a list of supported product combinations.

## Remediation/Fixes

The recommended solution is to download the appropriate Interim Fix or Fix Pack from Fix Central and apply for each affected product as soon as possible. Please see below for information on the fixes available for each product, version, and release. Follow the installation instructions in the ‘readme’ documentation provided with each fix pack or interim fix.

**For Maximo Asset Management 7.6:**

| VRM | Fix Pack, Feature Pack, or Interim Fix | Download |
| --- | --- | --- |

**Additional manual steps are required to ensure the issue is resolved.** See the **Workarounds and Mitigations** section.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Note: In the instructions below, the names for the Self-Registration and Everyone groups vary by installation. If you are unsure of the actual group name, look it up as follows:

* The **mxe.system.reguser** property determines the User Registration group name.
* The **ALLUSERGROUP** MAXVAR determines the Everyone group name.

Ensure that the following security privileges are correctly configured:

1. The MAXREG user must only belong to the User Registration group. To confirm:

1. Go to Users and open MAXREG.
2. On the Groups tab, remove all groups except the User Registration group.

Note: The Everyone group cannot be removed from the UI and must be deleted directly in the database if needed. This is only required if this group has been granted specific application access (which is not recommended).

2. The User Registration group must only have access to the applications SELFREG and FORGOTPSWD. To confirm:

1. On the Security Profile tab in the Users application, verify that MAXREG only has application access for Self Registration and Forgot Password.
2. If there are additional applications listed, revoke them from the User Registration group.

This can also be achieved by executing the following query to check for any incorrect permissions:

select \* from applicationauth where groupname = <user registration group> and app not in ('SELFREG','FORGOTPSWD')

If any are present, they can be revoked as follows:

delete from applicationauth where groupname = <user registration group> and app not in ('SELFREG','FORGOTPSWD')

## Disclaimer

According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.
