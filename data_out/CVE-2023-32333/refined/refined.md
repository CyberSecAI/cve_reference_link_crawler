- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access controls related to the MAXREG user in IBM Maximo Asset Management when using native Maximo security. Incorrect security options applied to the MAXREG user can lead to authentication bypass.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Improper access controls on the MAXREG user.
    - The MAXREG user belonging to groups beyond the User Registration group (specifically the 'Everyone' group), and having access to applications beyond 'SELFREG' and 'FORGOTPSWD'.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can bypass authentication, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote access through the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Remote attacker capabilities are sufficient
    - Attacker must target installations with native Maximo security that have incorrectly configured security options for the MAXREG user.
