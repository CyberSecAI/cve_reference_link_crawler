### Description

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-32050

**Title:** Some MongoDB Drivers may publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application

**Description**:

Some MongoDB Drivers may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when specific authentication-related commands are executed.

Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this sensitive information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default).

This issue affects the MongoDB C Driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.17.7, MongoDB PHP Driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.9.2, MongoDB Swift Driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.1.1, MongoDB Node.js Driver 3.6 prior to 3.6.10, MongoDB Node.js Driver 4.0 prior to 4.17.0 and MongoDB Node.js Driver 5.0 prior to 5.8.0. This issue also affects users of the MongoDB C++ Driver dependent on the C driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.17.7 (C++ driver prior to 3.7.0).

**CVSS Score:** 4.2

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

**CWE ID:** CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

### Description

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-32050

**Title:** Some MongoDB Drivers may publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application

**Description**:

Some MongoDB Drivers may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when specific authentication-related commands are executed.

Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this sensitive information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default).

This issue affects the MongoDB C Driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.17.7, MongoDB PHP Driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.9.2, MongoDB Swift Driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.1.1, MongoDB Node.js Driver 3.6 prior to 3.6.10, MongoDB Node.js Driver 4.0 prior to 4.17.0 and MongoDB Node.js Driver 5.0 prior to 5.8.0. This issue also affects users of the MongoDB C++ Driver dependent on the C driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.17.7 (C++ driver prior to 3.7.0).

**CVSS Score:** 4.2

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

**CWE ID:** CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

**Exact affected versions:**

MongoDB C Driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.17.7

MongoDB C++ Driver 3.0.0 prior to 3.7.0

MongoDB PHP Driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.9.2

MongoDB Swift Driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.1.1

MongoDB Node.js Driver 3.6 prior to  3.6.10

MongoDB Node.js Driver 4.0 prior to 4.17.0

MongoDB Node.js Driver 5.0 prior to 5.8.0

**Is fixed version available:**  Yes

**How the issue was discovered:** Internally

# Welcome to MongoDB's Issue Tracker

## I am a customer. Where do I create a Support case?

* MongoDB customers should always use the [Support Portal](https://support.mongodb.com) to obtain the fastest response and ensure privacy.
* MongoDB Cloud Manager or MongoDB Atlas customers should follow the Help link in Cloud Manager/ Atlas to create a ticket in the Support Portal.
* Please note: MongoDB Support no longer utilizes JIRA. Tickets opened via JIRA will not alert the Support Team and will not trigger any SLA timers.

##

## I am not a customer. Where should I ask general product or support questions?

MongoDB team members are active in community forums and you can also benefit from the experience of other MongoDB users. You should also consult our excellent [documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com).

* For general questions or community support use the [MongoDB Community](https://community.mongodb.com) forums.
* StackExchange also has several sites with MongoDB topics:
  + [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mongodb) (programming questions)
  + [DBA StackExchange](https://dba.stackexchange.com/tags/mongodb) (database administration questions)
  + [ServerFault](https://serverfault.com/questions/tagged/mongodb) (server and networking questions)

##

## How do I create a feature request?

All MongoDB users can share your ideas via the [MongoDB Feedback Engine](https://feedback.mongodb.com).

##

## Which JIRA project should I use to report bugs?

* To report potential bugs in the MongoDB database server, use [Core Server (SERVER)](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER).
* For language-specific drivers (Java, C++, etc.), create a ticket for the relevant [language driver](https://jira.mongodb.org/secure/BrowseProjects.jspa?selectedCategory=10001).
* To report a product security vulnerability, please [review this reference.](https://www.mongodb.com/.well-known/security.txt)
* Unless otherwise specified, comments and attachments in public projects will be visible to the public.

##

## How can I follow or upvote an existing issue in JIRA?

If an issue already exists:

* Vote for that issue to show your support. Voting provides a helpful signal to help prioritize issues in the product/development roadmap.
* Watch an issue to subscribe to any future updates such as comments or changes in status.

## Tips for creating issues

The more information you can provide, the easier it is for us to diagnose problems and provide support:

* Search to find if the issue you are reporting has been reported previously
* Include any statement or command that reproduces the issue you are experiencing
* Mention the specific version of the database, client, and driver you are using
* Include details about your environment, e.g. O/S, software platform, hardware, etc.

## Receive release announcements from MongoDB

[Sign up](https://www.mongodb.com/lp/newsletter/enterprise-release-announcements) to be added to our product release announcements mailing list. You'll receive notifications when new versions of MongoDB Enterprise Advanced, the [BI Connector](https://www.mongodb.com/products/bi-connector), [Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) and [Ops Manager](https://www.mongodb.com/products/ops-manager) become available.
