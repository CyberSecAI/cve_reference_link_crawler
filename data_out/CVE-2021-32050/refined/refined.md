  "CVE-2021-32050": {
    "description": "Some MongoDB Drivers may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when specific authentication-related commands are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this sensitive information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default).",
    "affected_versions": [
      "MongoDB C Driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.17.7",
      "MongoDB C++ Driver 3.0.0 prior to 3.7.0",

    "root_cause": "MongoDB drivers were not properly redacting sensitive information from command monitoring events.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200)"

    "impact": "Exposure of sensitive information, such as authentication credentials, by writing them to a log file if command listener feature is enabled.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered when specific authentication related commands are executed, and an application has enabled the command listener feature"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not need direct access to the affected system but would need to access logs or other locations where sensitive data might be written due to command monitoring.",
