Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-45896:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control enforcement in the web interface of Nokia Fastmile routers. Specifically, the server-side does not enforce authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Client-Side Authorization:** The authentication/authorization mechanism relies solely on client-side checks. The server does not validate the user's privileges.
*   **Lack of Server-Side Verification:**  The web application does not verify the user's "is\_ctc\_admin" status server-side before granting access to advanced functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker who has successfully logged into the router as a low-privilege user (e.g. "userAdmin") can elevate their privileges to a super-admin level, which grants access to additional functionality and configuration options that are normally restricted.
*   **Unauthorized Access:**  Gaining super-admin access allows the attacker to modify critical settings.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the router's web-based management interface.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker intercepts the HTTP response to the login request (`POST /login_web_app.cgi`) and modifies the "is\_ctc\_admin" variable's value.
    
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be on the same network as the router or have network access to the deviceâ€™s web interface.
*   **Low-Privilege Credentials:** The attacker must have valid login credentials for a low-privilege user account on the router.
*   **HTTP Interception:** The attacker must be capable of intercepting and modifying HTTP requests. This can be achieved using a web proxy or browser developer tools.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability affects Nokia Fastmile devices with firmware versions prior to 3TG00118ABAD52.
*   The `is_ctc_admin` variable is present in the response of the `/login_web_app.cgi` endpoint. By setting `is_ctc_admin` to 1, more UI elements are rendered in the web interface.
