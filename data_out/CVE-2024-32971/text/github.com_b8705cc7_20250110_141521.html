## üêõ Fixes

### Correct v1.44.0 regression in query plan cache ([PR #5028](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/5028))

Correct a critical regression that was introduced in [v1.44.0](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/4883) which could lead to execution of an incorrect query plan. This issue only affects Routers that use [distributed query plan caching](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/distributed-caching/#distributed-query-plan-caching), enabled via the `supergraph.query_planning.cache.redis.urls` configuration property.

By [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in [#5028](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/5028)

### Use entire schema when hashing an introspection query ([Issue #5006](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/5006))

Correct a *different* hashing bug which impacted introspection queries which was also introduced in [v1.44.0](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/4883). This other hashing bug failed to account for introspection queries, resulting in introspection results being misaligned to the current schema. This issue only affects Routers that use [distributed query plan caching](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/distributed-caching/#distributed-query-plan-caching), enabled via the `supergraph.query_planning.cache.redis.urls` configuration property.

This release fixes the hashing mechanism by adding the schema string to hashed data if an introspection field is encountered. As a result, the entire schema is taken into account and the correct introspection result is returned.

### Fix subgraph name mapping of Datadog exporter ([PR #5012](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/5012))

Previously in the router v1.45.0, subgraph name mapping didn't work correctly in the router's Datadog exporter. The exporter used the incorrect value `apollo.subgraph.name` for mapping attributes when it should have used the value `subgraph.name`. This issue has been fixed in this release.
