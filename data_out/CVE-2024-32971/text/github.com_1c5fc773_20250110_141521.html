|  |  | # [1.45.1] - 2024-04-26 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## 🐛 Fixes |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Correct v1.44.0 regression in query plan cache ([PR #5028](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/5028)) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Correct a critical regression that was introduced in [v1.44.0](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/4883) which could lead to execution of an incorrect query plan. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | By [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/5028 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Use entire schema when hashing an introspection query ([Issue #5006](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/5006)) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Correct a \_different\_ hashing bug which impacted introspection queries which was also introduced in [v1.44.0](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/4883). This other hashing bug failed to account for introspection queries, resulting in introspection results being misaligned to the current schema. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This release fixes the hashing mechanism by adding the schema string to hashed data if an introspection field is encountered. As a result, the entire schema is taken into account and the correct introspection result is returned. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/5007 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Fix subgraph name mapping of Datadog exporter ([PR #5012](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/5012)) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Previously in the router v1.45.0, subgraph name mapping didn't work correctly in the router's Datadog exporter. The exporter used the incorrect value `apollo.subgraph.name` for mapping attributes when it should have used the value `subgraph.name`. This issue has been fixed in this release. |
