# Distributed Caching for the GraphOS Router

Configure Redis-backed caching for query plans and APQ

---

   **This feature is only available with a GraphOS Enterprise plan.** You can test it out by signing up for a free [GraphOS trial](https://studio.apollographql.com/signup?&referrer=docs-content). To compare GraphOS feature support across all plan types, see the [pricing page](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing#graphos-router).

If you have multiple GraphOS Router instances, those instances can share a Redis-backed cache for their query plans and automatic persisted queries (APQ). This means that if *any* of your router instances caches a particular value, *all* of your instances can look up that value to significantly improve responsiveness. For more details on query plans and APQ, see the article on [in-memory caching](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/in-memory-caching).

## Prerequisites

To use this feature:

* You must have a Redis cluster (or single instance) that your router instances can communicate with.
* You must have a [GraphOS Enterprise plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/) and [connect your router to GraphOS](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/overview/#environment-variables).

## How it works

Whenever a router instance requires a query plan or APQ query string to resolve a client operation:

1. The router instance checks its own [in-memory cache](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/performance/caching/distributed#in-memory-caching) for the required value and uses it if found.
2. If *not* found, the router instance then checks the distributed Redis cache for the required value and uses it if found. It also then replicates the found value in its own in-memory cache.
3. If *not* found, the router instance *generates* the required query plan or requests the full operation string from the client for APQ.
4. The router instance stores the obtained value in both the distributed cache *and* its in-memory cache.

## Redis URL configuration

The distributed caching configuration must contain one or more URLs using different schemes depending on the expected deployment:

* `redis` - TCP connected to a centralized server.
* `rediss` - TLS connected to a centralized server.
* `redis-cluster` - TCP connected to a cluster.
* `rediss-cluster` - TLS connected to a cluster.
* `redis-sentinel` - TCP connected to a centralized server behind a sentinel layer.
* `rediss-sentinel` - TLS connected to a centralized server behind a sentinel layer.

The URLs must have the following format:

### One node

Text copy
```
1redis|rediss :// [[username:]password@] host [:port][/database]
```

Example: `redis://localhost:6379`

### Clustered

Text copy
```
1redis|rediss[-cluster] :// [[username:]password@] host [:port][?[node=host1:port1][&node=host2:port2][&node=hostN:portN]]
```

or, if configured with multiple URLs:

Text copy
```
1[
2  "redis|rediss[-cluster] :// [[username:]password@] host [:port]",
3  "redis|rediss[-cluster] :// [[username:]password@] host1 [:port1]",
4  "redis|rediss[-cluster] :// [[username:]password@] host2 [:port2]"
5]
```
### Sentinel

Text copy
```
1redis|rediss[-sentinel] :// [[username1:]password1@] host [:port][/database][?[node=host1:port1][&node=host2:port2][&node=hostN:portN]
2                            [&sentinelServiceName=myservice][&sentinelUsername=username2][&sentinelPassword=password2]]
```

or, if configured with multiple URLs:

Text copy
```
1[
2  "redis|rediss[-sentinel] :// [[username:]password@] host [:port][/database][?[&sentinelServiceName=myservice][&sentinelUsername=username2][&sentinelPassword=password2]]",
3  "redis|rediss[-sentinel] :// [[username1:]password1@] host [:port][/database][?[&sentinelServiceName=myservice][&sentinelUsername=username2][&sentinelPassword=password2]]"
4]
```
## Router configuration

**tip**In your router's YAML config file, **you should specify your Redis URLs via environment variables and [variable expansion](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/overview#variable-expansion)**. This prevents your Redis URLs from being committed to version control, which is especially dangerous if they include authentication information like a username and/or password.
### Distributed query plan caching

To enable distributed caching of query plans, add the following to your router's [YAML config file](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/overview/#yaml-config-file):

YAMLrouter.yaml copy
```
1supergraph:
2  query_planning:
3    cache:
4      redis:
5        urls: ["redis://..."]
```

The value of `urls` is a list of URLs for all Redis instances in your cluster.

All query plan cache entries will be prefixed with `plan.` within the distributed cache.

### Distributed APQ caching

To enable distributed caching of automatic persisted queries (APQ), add the following to your router's [YAML config file](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/overview/#yaml-config-file):

YAMLrouter.yaml copy
```
1apq:
2  router:
3    cache:
4      redis:
5        urls: ["redis://..."]
```

The value of `urls` is a list of URLs for all Redis instances in your cluster.

All APQ cache entries will be prefixed with `apq` followed by a null byte character (referenced by the escape sequence `\0` in most programming languages) within the distributed cache.

### Common Redis configuration

Redis configuration is done in the same way for APQ caching, query plan caching and [entity caching](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/entity-caching).

YAMLrouter.yaml copy
```
1supergraph:
2  query_planning:
3    cache:
4      redis:
5        urls: ["redis://..."]
6        username: admin/123 # Optional, can be part of the urls directly, mainly useful if you have special character like '/' in your password that doesn't work in url. This field takes precedence over the username in the URL
7        password: admin # Optional, can be part of the urls directly, mainly useful if you have special character like '/' in your password that doesn't work in url. This field takes precedence over the password in the URL
8        timeout: 2s # Optional, by default: 500ms
9        ttl: 24h # Optional
10        namespace: "prefix"  # Optional
11        #tls:
12        required_to_start: false # Optional, defaults to false
13        reset_ttl: true # Optional, defaults to true
14        pool_size: 4 # Optional, defaults to 1
```
#### Timeout

Connecting and sending commands to Redis are subject to a timeout, set by default to 500ms, that can be overriden.

#### TTL

The `ttl` option defines the default global expiration for Redis entries. For APQ caching, the default is no expiration, while for query plan caching, the default expiration is set to 30 days.

### Namespace

When using the same Redis instance for multiple purposes, the `namespace` option defines a prefix for all the keys defined by the router.

### TLS

For Redis TLS connections, you can set up a client certificate or override the root certificate authority by configuring `tls` in your router's [YAML config file](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/overview/#yaml-config-file). For example:

YAML copy
```
1apq:
2  router:
3    cache:
4      redis:
5        urls: [ "rediss://redis.example.com:6379" ]
6        tls:
7          certificate_authorities: ${file./path/to/ca.crt}
8          client_authentication:
9            certificate_chain: ${file./path/to/certificate_chain.pem}
10            key: ${file./path/to/key.pem}
```
### Required to start

When active, the `required_to_start` option will prevent the router from starting if it cannot connect to Redis. By default, the router will still start without a connection to Redis, which would result in only using the in-memory cache for APQ and query planning, and entity caching sending the requests to subgraphs undisturbed.

### Reset TTL

When this option is active, accessing a cache entry in Redis will reset its expiration.

### Pool size

The `pool_size` option defines the number of connections to Redis that the router will open. By default, the router will open a single connection to Redis. If there is a lot of traffic between router and Redis and/or there is some latency in thos requests, it is recommended to increase the pool size to reduce that latency.
