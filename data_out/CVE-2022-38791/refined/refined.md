Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-38791:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `compress_write()` function in MariaDB's `ds_compress.cc` file fails to release the `thd->data_mutex` lock when writing to the destination stream fails. This occurs specifically at line 246 and 256 in the code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Mutex Lock not released on failure:** The primary issue is the failure to release the mutex under error conditions within the `compress_write()` function, leading to a potential deadlock.
- **Improper Locking:** This vulnerability is a follow-up to a previous fix for a similar locking issue, indicating a potential pattern of improper lock management.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service because a thread may hold a mutex and never release it, blocking other threads.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a failure during the write process in the `compress_write()` function in the mariabackup tool. This could possibly be achieved through a specially crafted backup or by inducing errors during the backup process.
- The vulnerability exists in the `Backup` component of MariaDB server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would likely need to have the ability to trigger a backup operation on a MariaDB server.
- Access to the database server is required to trigger the vulnerability. This is categorized as `PR:L` (low privileges).
- Attacker would need to induce a failure during the writing of the compressed data.

**Additional notes:**
- This vulnerability was addressed in MariaDB versions 10.3.36, 10.4.26, 10.5.17, 10.6.9, 10.7.5, 10.8.4 and 10.9.2
- NetApp has issued an advisory (NTAP-20221104-0008) indicating that StorageGRID (formerly StorageGRID Webscale) products are affected by this vulnerability. All other NetApp products listed are not affected.
