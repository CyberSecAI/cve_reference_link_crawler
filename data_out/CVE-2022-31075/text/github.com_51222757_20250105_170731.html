# DoS when signing the CSR from EdgeCore

Moderate

[kevin-wangzefeng](/kevin-wangzefeng)
published
GHSA-x3px-2p95-f6jr
Jul 11, 2022

## Package

gomod

KubeEdge
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<=1.11.0, 1.10.1, 1.9.3

## Patched versions

1.11.1, 1.10.2, 1.9.4

## Description

### Impact

EdgeCore may be susceptible to a DoS attack on CloudHub if an attacker was to send a well-crafted HTTP request to `/edge.crt`.

If an attacker can send a well-crafted HTTP request to CloudHub, and that request has a very large body, that request could crash the HTTP service through a memory exhaustion vector. The request body is being read into memory, and a body that was larger than the available memory could lead to a successful attack.

Because the request would have to make it through authorization, only authorized users could perform this attack. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudHub will be in denial of service. It will be affected only when users enable the CloudHub module in the file `cloudcore.yaml` as below:

```
modules:
  ...
  cloudHub:
    enable: true

```
### Patches

This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, 1.9.4. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.

### Workarounds

Disable the CloudHub module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.

### References

NA

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

### CVE ID
