{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by reading the request body of `/edge.crt` into memory without any size limits, leading to potential memory exhaustion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory exhaustion vulnerability due to unbounded reading of request body.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (DoS) of the CloudHub component within KubeEdge, making it unavailable.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted HTTP request with a very large body to the `/edge.crt` endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be an authorized user with the ability to send HTTP requests to the CloudHub service."
