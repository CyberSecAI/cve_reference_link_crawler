Based on the provided content, this CVE relates to a memory leak in the `lvts_thermal` driver within the Linux kernel.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A memory leak occurs in the error handling path of the `lvts_calibration_read` function within `drivers/thermal/mediatek/lvts_thermal.c`. Specifically, if the `devm_krealloc()` function fails to reallocate memory for `lvts_td->calib`, the memory allocated to `efuse` is not freed, resulting in a memory leak.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the improper error handling logic within the `lvts_calibration_read` function. When memory allocation fails, the allocated 'efuse' memory is not released, leading to a memory leak.

- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact of this vulnerability is a memory leak. Repeated failures of memory allocation in the `lvts_calibration_read` function will lead to increased memory consumption, potentially causing system instability or denial of service if enough memory is leaked.

- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could trigger the memory leak by forcing the `devm_krealloc` to fail repeatedly by for example making many requests to the thermal driver, exhausting available memory resources.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need the ability to interact with the thermal driver and potentially trigger the `lvts_calibration_read` function in a way that leads to memory allocation failures. This might require a specific configuration or interface for the driver.
