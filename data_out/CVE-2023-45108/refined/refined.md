  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that would then submit the forged request to the vulnerable WordPress plugin.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in administrator user to visit a malicious site or click on a malicious link. The attacker does not need any authentication to the WordPress site."
