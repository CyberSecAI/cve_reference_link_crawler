Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Rich Reviews plugin for WordPress has insufficient access controls for modifying the plugin's options.
- There is a lack of sanitization on the values of those options.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Due to the lack of input sanitization and output escaping, unauthenticated users can inject arbitrary web scripts via POST body parameters, which are then stored in the database and executed when a user accesses the affected page.
- **Unauthenticated Plugin Option Updates:** The plugin allows unauthenticated users to modify plugin settings through the `update` POST parameter. This is because the check for this parameter is performed on every incoming request, regardless of permissions or path.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website, leading to:
    - Malvertising redirects and popup ads.
    - Website defacement.
    - Potentially other malicious activities.
- Attackers can change plugin settings, including:
    - Removing the need for review approval.
    - Defacing text elements.
- The injected code is executed when any user visits the compromised page.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST requests with the parameter `update`.
- The malicious payload is included within the POST parameters used for updating the plugin options.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No authentication is required. Any unauthenticated user can exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to send a crafted POST request to the WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild.
- The plugin was removed from the WordPress repository for security reasons.
- The vulnerability was being used in an ongoing malvertising campaign.
- The vulnerability is located in the `RichReviews` class which instantiates on every incoming request, exposing the option update functionality to any incoming request.
- The injected scripts load additional JavaScript from a third party domain `adsnet.work`.
- The vulnerability affects versions of the Rich Reviews plugin up to and including 1.7.4.
- A patched version 1.8.0 was released to address this vulnerability.
