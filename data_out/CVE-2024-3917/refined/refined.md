  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back into the page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in administrator's browser, potentially leading to actions such as data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload in a vulnerable parameter and tricking a logged-in administrator into opening it.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and persuade a logged-in administrator to click on it. No specific position needed besides being able to generate the link."
