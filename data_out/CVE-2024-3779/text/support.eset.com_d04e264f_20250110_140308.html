# [CA8688] Denial of Service Vulnerability in ESET products for Windows fixed

ESET Customer Advisory 2024-0010
July 12, 2024
Severity: Medium
### Summary

A report of a denial of service vulnerability was submitted to ESET by Ali Jammal of Deloitte Netherlands and Alaa Kachouh of Mastercard. The vulnerability, present shortly after product installation or upgrade, potentially allowed an attacker to render ESET’s security product inoperable, provided non-default preconditions were met. ESET mitigated this by preparing fixed versions of its security products.

### Details

On systems with an affected product installed, incorrect access permissions could, under specific conditions, allow an attacker to delete certain files required for the product to provide protection. This would cause the product to become inoperable after the next reboot.

The incorrect access permissions could only be misused during the product initialization phase, shortly after the product installation or manual upgrade to a higher version via an installation file, provided the installation file did not include all product modules. Once the product was installed and its modules were downloaded and initialized, it was not possible to delete the files anymore, as they were protected by the ESET Self-Defense feature. Additionally, upgrading the product to a higher version via the built-in automatic upgrade option did not expose the system to this vulnerability. Similarly, when using a full installation file containing the modules, there was no period after the installation when the files could be deleted, as the ESET Self-Defense feature started immediately. Moreover, the vulnerability could only be exploited if the product had initially been installed to a custom (non-default) path.

The reserved CVE ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2024-3779, the CVSS v3.1 score is 6.1 with the following CVSS vector: AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H

To the best of our knowledge, this vulnerability has not been exploited in the wild.

### Solution

ESET prepared fixed builds of its consumer, business and server security products for the Windows operating system and recommends upgrading to these or scheduling the upgrades in the near future. The fixed builds are available in the Download section of www.eset.com or via the ESET Repository.
