- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect access permissions on certain files during the product initialization phase, shortly after installation or manual upgrade, allowed deletion of these files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect file access permissions during a specific time window.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Deletion of critical files rendering the ESET security product inoperable after a reboot, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local, low-privileged access to the system during the product initialization phase shortly after install or manual upgrade, and the ESET product must be installed to a custom (non-default) path, using an install file that did not contain all modules. The vulnerability is not exploitable after modules are downloaded and initialized, or when using the automatic upgrade or full install package.
