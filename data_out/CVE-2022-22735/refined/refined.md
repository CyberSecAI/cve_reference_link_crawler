- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks authorization and CSRF checks in various AJAX actions. It also fails to properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLI) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization and missing authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with a malicious `action` parameter and an injection payload in the `idLink` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (subscriber or higher privilege) to trigger the vulnerable AJAX action. No CSRF protection is in place.
