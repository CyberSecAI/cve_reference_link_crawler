The provided content is related to CVE-2022-3378.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the affected product, Cscape, not properly validating user-supplied data within FNT files. Specifically, the software accesses an uninitialized pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Access of an uninitialized pointer (CWE-824) leading to an out-of-bounds memory write.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code within the current process, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a user opening a maliciously crafted FNT file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access and must trick a user into opening a malicious FNT file. No specific user privileges are required, but user interaction (opening the file) is necessary.
