The provided content is related to CVE-2022-3378.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from improper validation of user-supplied data when a user opens a maliciously crafted FNT file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Access of an uninitialized pointer. Specifically, the software accesses an uninitialized pointer, leading to an out-of-bounds memory write.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the current process.

**Attack vectors:** A local attacker must get a user to open a maliciously crafted FNT file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious FNT file to a user of the vulnerable software and convince them to open the file. This indicates that the attacker needs a local presence or the ability to trick the user to open a malicious file. The attack complexity is low and does not require any special privileges.
