This document does not contain information about CVE-2022-34538. It describes multiple vulnerabilities in DW Spectrum server software and MegaPix IP cameras.
The vulnerabilities are:
**DW Spectrum Server Software (ver 4.2.0.32842):**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The `/api/moduleInformation` API call exposes internal paths, IPs, OS version, and architecture.
    *   **Weakness:** Information Disclosure (CWE-200).
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive system information.
    *   **Attack vector:** Unauthenticated access to the API endpoint.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Network access to the server.

**MegaPix IP Camera (A7.2.2_20211029 Firmware):**
*   **Information Disclosure (Unauthenticated):**
    *   Web files like `plugin_info_list.xml`, `plugin/plugin_web.conf`, and `plugin/port.conf` reveal internal paths, scripts, and software versions.
        *   **Weakness:** Information Disclosure (CWE-201)
        *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive system information.
        *   **Attack vector:** Unauthenticated access to the mentioned URLs.
        *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Network access to the device.
    *   **Session Hijacking via Core Log:** A 500 error on `/cgi-bin/result?msubmenu=event&action` can be triggered, leading to the creation of a core file accessible at `/cgi-bin/core`. This core file contains session token information that can be used to log in to admin pages.
        *   **Weakness:** Information Disclosure and Session Hijacking (CWE-201).
        *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to administrative functions.
        *   **Attack vector:** Unauthenticated access to the mentioned URLs.
        *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Network access to the device.
*   **Command Injection (Authenticated):**
    *   `curltest.cgi`:  Command injection is possible through `test[]` parameters (e.g., `smtp_addr`, `smtp_port`, `sender`, `receiver`, `id`, and `pass`).
        *   **Weakness:** Command Injection (CWE-78).
        *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the device.
        *   **Attack vector:** Authenticated POST request to the `/cgi-bin/admin/curltest.cgi` endpoint with crafted parameters.
        *  **Required attacker capabilities:** Valid admin credentials and network access to the device.
    *   `addacph.cgi`: Command injection is possible through the `event`, `id`, `pluginname`, `name`, and `evt_id` parameters.
        *   **Weakness:** Command Injection (CWE-94).
        *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the device.
        *   **Attack vector:** Authenticated GET request to `/cgi-bin/admin/vca/bia/addacph.cgi` with crafted parameters.
        *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Valid admin credentials and network access to the device.
    *   `license_tok.cgi`: Command injection is possible through the POST parameters `guid`, `license_value`, and `plugin_info`.
        *   **Weakness:** Command Injection (CWE-94).
        *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the device.
        *   **Attack vector:** Authenticated POST request to `/cgi-bin/admin/vca/license/license_tok.cgi` with crafted parameters.
        *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Valid admin credentials and network access to the device.
*   **XSS vulnerability:**
    *   `bia_oneshot.cgi`: Persistent XSS is possible through the `blob` parameter by injecting HTML/script tags
        *   **Weakness:** Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79).
        *   **Impact:** Potential for session hijacking, cookie theft, or other client-side attacks.
        *   **Attack vector:** Authenticated GET request to `/cgi-bin/admin/vca/bia/bia_oneshot.cgi` with crafted blob parameter.
        *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Valid admin credentials and network access to the device.
