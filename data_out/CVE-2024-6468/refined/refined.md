- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of requests from unauthorized IP addresses when the `proxy_protocol_behavior` option is set to `deny_unauthorized`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Vault API server fails to handle unauthorized requests, resulting in an unhandled error that causes the server to shut down.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service. The Vault API server becomes unresponsive to all HTTP requests.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending requests from an IP address not listed in `proxy_protocol_authorized_addrs` when `proxy_protocol_behavior` is set to `deny_unauthorized`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Vault API server from an unauthorized IP address when `proxy_protocol_behavior` is set to `deny_unauthorized`.
