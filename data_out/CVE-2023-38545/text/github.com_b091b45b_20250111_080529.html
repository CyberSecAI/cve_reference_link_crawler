# CVE-2023-38545: Curl Vulnerability Proof of Concept

This repository contains a Proof of Concept (PoC) designed to test systems for the CVE-2023-38545 vulnerability. The vulnerability affects the curl utility, specifically versions between 7.69.0 and 8.3.1, and is related to the handling of HTTP redirects.

## Prerequisites

Required Software: curl

## Features

* SOCKS5 Proxy Server running on port 1080
* HTTP Server running on port 8000
* Automated script to test for the vulnerability

## Architecture

The PoC consists of two main components:

* SOCKS5 Proxy Server: Listens on port 1080 and forwards all incoming requests to the HTTP server.
* HTTP Server: Listens on port 8000 and is responsible for generating the payload that triggers the vulnerability.

## Usage Instructions

### (Optional) Step 1: Set up the Socks5 Proxy

*This step is optional if you already have a socks5 proxy you can use.*

Execute `setup_socks5.sh`

```
$ chmod +x setup_socks5.sh
$ ./setup_socks5.sh

```

This will install the required dependencies and set up the SOCKS5 proxy server on port 1080.

### Step 2: Set up the Python3 HTTP Server

Execute the following command to start the HTTP server:

```
$ python3 server.py

```

You can also run the server with debug logging

```
$ python3 server.py --debug

```

Upon successful execution, the HTTP server will be listening on port 8000.

### Step 3: Execute the Exploit Script

First, make the script executable:

```
$ chmod +x cve202338545.sh

```

The script can be configured to accept a socks5 proxy address with `--socks5-ip` and an http address with `--http-ip` and can output debug logs with `--DEBUG`

```
$ ./cve202338545.sh --socks5-ip <ip> --http-ip <ip> --DEBUG # specify both proxy and http server
$ ./cve202338545.sh --socks5-ip <ip> # specify only proxy server
$ ./cve202338545.sh --http-ip <ip> # specify only http server
$ ./cve202338545.sh # both proxy and http server will default to localhost
$ ./cve202338545.sh --DEBUG # both proxy and http server will default to localhost with debug on

```

This will initiate the exploit, and you should see output indicating whether the system is vulnerable, not vulnerable, or if the test was inconclusive.

### Step 4. Analyze Results

There are 4 response states:

* [\*] Vulnerable
* [\*] Inconclusive, likely not vulnerable
  + Triggered when the vulnerable version is identified but the vulnerability doesnt trigger on name resolution
* [\*] Likely Vulnerable, got an out of memory error
  + Triggered when the vulnerable version is identified and curl dies with an out of memory error
* [\*] Inconclusive, further investigation needed
  + Triggered by unexpected non-crash errors
* [\*] Not Vulnerable
  + Triggered when the vulnerable version is not identified

### (Optional) Step 5. Clean Up

*This step is only required if you used `setup_socks5.sh` from step 1.*

To clean up the SOCKS5 proxy server, execute the following command:

```
$ ./cleanup.sh

```
