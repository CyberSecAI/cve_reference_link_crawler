## CVE-2023-38545

# SOCKS5 heap buffer overflow

Project curl Security Advisory, October 11 2023 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-38545.html)

## VULNERABILITY

This flaw makes curl overflow a heap based buffer in the SOCKS5 proxy
handshake.

When curl is asked to pass along the hostname to the SOCKS5 proxy to
allow that to resolve the address instead of it getting done by curl
itself, the maximum length that hostname can be is 255 bytes.

If the hostname is detected to be longer than 255 bytes, curl
switches to local name resolving and instead passes on the resolved
address only to the proxy. Due to a bug, the local variable that means
"let the host resolve the name" could get the wrong value during a slow
SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention, copy the too long
hostname to the target buffer instead of copying just the resolved
address there.

## TERMINOLOGY

The curl library is known as libcurl and the command line tool that
uses the library is known as the curl tool. Either or both may be
referred to as just curl. The distinctive names are used in this
document when necessary.

## INFO

The hostname comes from the URL that curl has been told to operate
with.

The target buffer is the heap-based download buffer in libcurl that
is reused for SOCKS negotiation before the transfer has started. The
size of the buffer is 16kB by default, but can be set to different sizes
by the application. The curl tool sets it to 102400 bytes by default -
but it sets the buffer size to a smaller size if
`--limit-rate` is set lower than 102400 bytes per second.

libcurl provides the `[CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE.html)` option to change
the size of the download buffer.

libcurl accepts hostnames up to 65535 bytes in the URL.

If the used hostname is longer than the target buffer, there is a
`memcpy()` that overwrites the buffer into the heap. The URL
parser and possibly an IDN library (if curl is built with one) have to
accept the hostname, which somewhat limits the set of available byte
sequences that can be used in the copy.

For an overflow to happen it needs a slow enough SOCKS5 handshake to
trigger the local variable bug, and the client using a hostname longer
than the download buffer. Perhaps with a malicious HTTPS server doing a
redirect to an especially crafted URL.

Typical server latency is likely "slow" enough to trigger this bug
without an attacker needing to influence it by DoS or SOCKS server
control.

An overflow is only possible in applications that do not set
`[CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE.html)` or set it smaller than 65541. Since the
curl tool sets `[CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE.html)` to 100kB by default it is
not vulnerable unless rate limiting was set by the user to a rate
smaller than 65541 bytes/second.

The options that cause SOCKS5 with remote hostname to be used in
libcurl:

* `[CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE.html)` set to type
  `CURLPROXY_SOCKS5_HOSTNAME`, or:
* `[CURLOPT_PROXY](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY.html)` or `[CURLOPT_PRE_PROXY](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PRE_PROXY.html)` set to
  use the scheme `socks5h://`
* One of the proxy environment variables can be set to use the
  `socks5h://` scheme. For example `http_proxy`,
  `HTTPS_PROXY` or `ALL_PROXY`.

The options that cause SOCKS5 with remote hostname to be used in the
curl tool:

* `--socks5-hostname`, or:
* `--proxy` or `--preproxy` set to use the
  scheme `socks5h://`
* Environment variables as described in the libcurl section.

This bug was introduced when the SOCKS5 handshake code was converted
from a blocking function into a non-blocking state machine.

**The analysis in this section is specific to curl version
8.** Some older versions of curl version 7 have less restriction
on hostname length and/or a smaller SOCKS negotiation buffer size that
cannot be overridden by [CURLOPT\_BUFFERSIZE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE.html).

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2023-38545 to this issue.

CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow

Severity: High

HackerOne: <https://hackerone.com/reports/2187833>

## ADDITIONAL INFO

Since the posting of this advisory, security researcher [RyotaK](https://hackerone.com/ryotak?type=user) has [notified](https://github.com/curl/curl-www/pull/308) that even
if the buffer size is large enough to prevent heap overflow an attacker
can still use the integer overflow of hostname length in conjunction
with a crafted hostname longer than 255 characters to make the handshake
complete successfully.

In this scenario the crafted hostname contains a destination
hostname, port and arbitrary data. The SOCKS server successfully
connects to that host, sends the arbitrary data and then curl sends the
"expected" request data on that same connection. The impact is limited
because curl does not allow control characters and null in the
hostname.

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: libcurl [7.69.0](vuln-7.69.0.html) to and including [8.3.0](vuln-8.3.0.html)
* Not affected versions: libcurl < [7.69.0](vuln-7.69.0.html) and >= [8.4.0](vuln-8.4.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/4a4b63daaa>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

Starting in curl [8.4.0](vuln-8.4.0.html), curl no longer switches to local resolve mode
if the name is too long but is instead rightfully returning an
error.

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/fb4415d8aee6c1>

[Patch
collection for older versions](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-38545_patches.zip)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [8.4.0](vuln-8.4.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Do not use `CURLPROXY_SOCKS5_HOSTNAME` proxies with
curl

D - Do not set a proxy environment variable to socks5h://

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on September 30, 2023. We
contacted distros@openwall on October 3, 2023.

libcurl [8.4.0](vuln-8.4.0.html) was released on October 11 2023, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.
