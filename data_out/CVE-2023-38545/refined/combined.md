## CVE-2023-38545

# SOCKS5 heap buffer overflow

Project curl Security Advisory, October 11 2023 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-38545.html)

## VULNERABILITY

This flaw makes curl overflow a heap based buffer in the SOCKS5 proxy
handshake.

When curl is asked to pass along the hostname to the SOCKS5 proxy to
allow that to resolve the address instead of it getting done by curl
itself, the maximum length that hostname can be is 255 bytes.

If the hostname is detected to be longer than 255 bytes, curl
switches to local name resolving and instead passes on the resolved
address only to the proxy. Due to a bug, the local variable that means
"let the host resolve the name" could get the wrong value during a slow
SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention, copy the too long
hostname to the target buffer instead of copying just the resolved
address there.

## TERMINOLOGY

The curl library is known as libcurl and the command line tool that
uses the library is known as the curl tool. Either or both may be
referred to as just curl. The distinctive names are used in this
document when necessary.

## INFO

The hostname comes from the URL that curl has been told to operate
with.

The target buffer is the heap-based download buffer in libcurl that
is reused for SOCKS negotiation before the transfer has started. The
size of the buffer is 16kB by default, but can be set to different sizes
by the application. The curl tool sets it to 102400 bytes by default -
but it sets the buffer size to a smaller size if
`--limit-rate` is set lower than 102400 bytes per second.

libcurl provides the `[CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE.html)` option to change
the size of the download buffer.

libcurl accepts hostnames up to 65535 bytes in the URL.

If the used hostname is longer than the target buffer, there is a
`memcpy()` that overwrites the buffer into the heap. The URL
parser and possibly an IDN library (if curl is built with one) have to
accept the hostname, which somewhat limits the set of available byte
sequences that can be used in the copy.

For an overflow to happen it needs a slow enough SOCKS5 handshake to
trigger the local variable bug, and the client using a hostname longer
than the download buffer. Perhaps with a malicious HTTPS server doing a
redirect to an especially crafted URL.

Typical server latency is likely "slow" enough to trigger this bug
without an attacker needing to influence it by DoS or SOCKS server
control.

An overflow is only possible in applications that do not set
`[CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE.html)` or set it smaller than 65541. Since the
curl tool sets `[CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE.html)` to 100kB by default it is
not vulnerable unless rate limiting was set by the user to a rate
smaller than 65541 bytes/second.

The options that cause SOCKS5 with remote hostname to be used in
libcurl:

* `[CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE.html)` set to type
  `CURLPROXY_SOCKS5_HOSTNAME`, or:
* `[CURLOPT_PROXY](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY.html)` or `[CURLOPT_PRE_PROXY](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PRE_PROXY.html)` set to
  use the scheme `socks5h://`
* One of the proxy environment variables can be set to use the
  `socks5h://` scheme. For example `http_proxy`,
  `HTTPS_PROXY` or `ALL_PROXY`.

The options that cause SOCKS5 with remote hostname to be used in the
curl tool:

* `--socks5-hostname`, or:
* `--proxy` or `--preproxy` set to use the
  scheme `socks5h://`
* Environment variables as described in the libcurl section.

This bug was introduced when the SOCKS5 handshake code was converted
from a blocking function into a non-blocking state machine.

**The analysis in this section is specific to curl version
8.** Some older versions of curl version 7 have less restriction
on hostname length and/or a smaller SOCKS negotiation buffer size that
cannot be overridden by [CURLOPT\_BUFFERSIZE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE.html).

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2023-38545 to this issue.

CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow

Severity: High

HackerOne: <https://hackerone.com/reports/2187833>

## ADDITIONAL INFO

Since the posting of this advisory, security researcher [RyotaK](https://hackerone.com/ryotak?type=user) has [notified](https://github.com/curl/curl-www/pull/308) that even
if the buffer size is large enough to prevent heap overflow an attacker
can still use the integer overflow of hostname length in conjunction
with a crafted hostname longer than 255 characters to make the handshake
complete successfully.

In this scenario the crafted hostname contains a destination
hostname, port and arbitrary data. The SOCKS server successfully
connects to that host, sends the arbitrary data and then curl sends the
"expected" request data on that same connection. The impact is limited
because curl does not allow control characters and null in the
hostname.

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: libcurl [7.69.0](vuln-7.69.0.html) to and including [8.3.0](vuln-8.3.0.html)
* Not affected versions: libcurl < [7.69.0](vuln-7.69.0.html) and >= [8.4.0](vuln-8.4.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/4a4b63daaa>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

Starting in curl [8.4.0](vuln-8.4.0.html), curl no longer switches to local resolve mode
if the name is too long but is instead rightfully returning an
error.

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/fb4415d8aee6c1>

[Patch
collection for older versions](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-38545_patches.zip)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [8.4.0](vuln-8.4.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Do not use `CURLPROXY_SOCKS5_HOSTNAME` proxies with
curl

D - Do not set a proxy environment variable to socks5h://

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on September 30, 2023. We
contacted distros@openwall on October 3, 2023.

libcurl [8.4.0](vuln-8.4.0.html) was released on October 11 2023, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

# CVE-2023-38545: Curl Vulnerability Proof of Concept

This repository contains a Proof of Concept (PoC) designed to test systems for the CVE-2023-38545 vulnerability. The vulnerability affects the curl utility, specifically versions between 7.69.0 and 8.3.1, and is related to the handling of HTTP redirects.

## Prerequisites

Required Software: curl

## Features

* SOCKS5 Proxy Server running on port 1080
* HTTP Server running on port 8000
* Automated script to test for the vulnerability

## Architecture

The PoC consists of two main components:

* SOCKS5 Proxy Server: Listens on port 1080 and forwards all incoming requests to the HTTP server.
* HTTP Server: Listens on port 8000 and is responsible for generating the payload that triggers the vulnerability.

## Usage Instructions

### (Optional) Step 1: Set up the Socks5 Proxy

*This step is optional if you already have a socks5 proxy you can use.*

Execute `setup_socks5.sh`

```
$ chmod +x setup_socks5.sh
$ ./setup_socks5.sh

```

This will install the required dependencies and set up the SOCKS5 proxy server on port 1080.

### Step 2: Set up the Python3 HTTP Server

Execute the following command to start the HTTP server:

```
$ python3 server.py

```

You can also run the server with debug logging

```
$ python3 server.py --debug

```

Upon successful execution, the HTTP server will be listening on port 8000.

### Step 3: Execute the Exploit Script

First, make the script executable:

```
$ chmod +x cve202338545.sh

```

The script can be configured to accept a socks5 proxy address with `--socks5-ip` and an http address with `--http-ip` and can output debug logs with `--DEBUG`

```
$ ./cve202338545.sh --socks5-ip <ip> --http-ip <ip> --DEBUG # specify both proxy and http server
$ ./cve202338545.sh --socks5-ip <ip> # specify only proxy server
$ ./cve202338545.sh --http-ip <ip> # specify only http server
$ ./cve202338545.sh # both proxy and http server will default to localhost
$ ./cve202338545.sh --DEBUG # both proxy and http server will default to localhost with debug on

```

This will initiate the exploit, and you should see output indicating whether the system is vulnerable, not vulnerable, or if the test was inconclusive.

### Step 4. Analyze Results

There are 4 response states:

* [\*] Vulnerable
* [\*] Inconclusive, likely not vulnerable
  + Triggered when the vulnerable version is identified but the vulnerability doesnt trigger on name resolution
* [\*] Likely Vulnerable, got an out of memory error
  + Triggered when the vulnerable version is identified and curl dies with an out of memory error
* [\*] Inconclusive, further investigation needed
  + Triggered by unexpected non-crash errors
* [\*] Not Vulnerable
  + Triggered when the vulnerable version is not identified

### (Optional) Step 5. Clean Up

*This step is only required if you used `setup_socks5.sh` from step 1.*

To clean up the SOCKS5 proxy server, execute the following command:

```
$ ./cleanup.sh

```

# CVE-2023-38545 POC for the curl command line tool

*This POC is based on the earlier POC created by UTsweetyfish, shared in this repository: <https://github.com/UTsweetyfish/CVE-2023-38545>. Contrary to that POC, this one is for the commandline tool and not the libcurl library, and doesn't require Python and no compilation*

This POC is for the `curl` SOCKS5 heap buffer overflow, and shows how to overflow the receive buffer in the `curl` command line tool. By default, `curl` initializes the receive buffer with a size of 100k, which makes it unsusceptible to CVE-2023-38545. But the size of this buffer can be reduced by setting a rate limit (`--limit-rate`).

To run the POC, first set up a local SOCKS5 proxy using SSH (this requires a locally running SSH server):

```
ssh -fND 10801 localhost

```

Next, run the `poc.sh` scriptt (this requires Netcat (nc) to be installed):

```
./poc.sh

```

It might require several attempts to trigger the buffer overflow. If the overflow is triggered, the script will exit with an error code, and an error message indicating that the execution has been aborted. When the overflow failed, and curl was not impacted, then a message is shown indicating that a host with the name "AAAA...." could not be resolved.

# Discover The High Severity Heap buffer Overflow Vulnerability in cURL (CVE-2023-38545)

* Post author:[Gourav Shrivastava](https://www.secpod.com/blog/author/gourav-s/ "Posts by Gourav Shrivastava")
* Post published:October 13, 2023
* Reading time:10 mins read

The cURL development team has recently disclosed a high-severity heap buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2023-38545), which poses a substantial risk of enabling **remote code execution** in applications utilizing the impacted iterations of the cURL library.

**Note:** cURL is a highly popular open-source utility for data transfer in standalone applications and scripts. It comes in various forms, including standalone executables and libraries (static or dynamic), and is often pre-installed on major operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows.

## Vulnerability Details

This vulnerability leads to a heap buffer overflow within cURL during the SOCKS5 proxy handshake. When cURL transfers the hostname to the SOCKS5 proxy for address resolution, it enforces a 255-byte limit on the hostname length.Curl switches to local name resolution if the hostname exceeds this limit and transmits only the resolved address to the proxy. However, due to a bug, the local variable controlling the hostname resolution can be present incorrectly during a slow SOCKS5 handshake. Inadvertently the long hostname will copied to the target buffer, instead of just the resolved address due to CVE-2023-38545.

## Technical Details

The target buffer is a heap-based download buffer within the libcurl library, employed for SOCKS negotiation before the data transfer commences. This buffer is 16 kilobytes by default, although applications can customize it to different sizes. The curl tool, for instance, defaults to a buffer size of 102,400 bytes but reduces it if the user sets a lower data transfer rate using the –limit-rate option.

libcurl provides the CURLOPT\_BUFFERSIZE option, allowing adjustments to the download buffer’s size. It’s worth noting that libcurl accommodates hostnames in URLs up to 65,535 bytes.

When a hostname surpasses the capacity of the target buffer, a memcpy() operation occurs, overwriting the buffer in the heap. If included in the cURL build, the URL parser and potentially an Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) library must accept the hostname. This restriction limits the available byte sequences for copying.

For this overflow to transpire, it necessitates a SOCKS5 handshake to trigger the local variable bug, and the attacker must use a hostname longer than the download buffer. This scenario could arise with a malicious HTTPS server redirecting to a meticulously crafted URL as a result of CVE-2023-38545.

This vulnerability is only conceivable in applications that either do not specify CURLOPT\_BUFFERSIZE or set it to a value less than 65,541. As the cURL tool defaults to a 100-kilobyte CURLOPT\_BUFFERSIZE, it remains non vulnerable unless the user explicitly configures a lower data transfer rate of fewer than 65,541 bytes/second.

The circumstances that prompt the use of SOCKS5 with a remote hostname in libcurl include the following :

* `[CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE.html)` set to type `CURLPROXY_SOCKS5_HOSTNAME`, or:
* `[CURLOPT_PROXY](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY.html)` or `[CURLOPT_PRE_PROXY](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PRE_PROXY.html)` set to use the scheme `socks5h://`
* One of the proxy environment variables can be set to use the `socks5h://` scheme. For example `http_proxy`, `HTTPS_PROXY` or `ALL_PROXY`.

In the case of the cURL tool, SOCKS5 with a remote hostname is invoked when employing the –socks5-hostname option or by setting either –proxy or –preproxy to use the “socks5h://” scheme. The same effect can be achieved by configuring relevant environment variables as described in the libcurl section.

## Impact

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability by an unauthenticated user could lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.

## Who is most affected by this flaw?

This high-severity issue can disrupt numerous software projects, applications, and platforms. This flaw needs your immediate attention if cURL is anywhere in your stack.

* **REST API Clients**: if your application makes HTTP/HTTPS requests via cURL, it might compromise the data sent or received, posing a significant risk.
* **Package Managers:** Package managers employ cURL for remote package retrieval, and an exploit could manipulate these downloads, potentially resulting in various detrimental consequences, such as data exposure and remote code execution
* **Web Scraping Tools**: Many tools and libraries use cURL to retrieve web pages. This vulnerability could lead to exposure of sensitive information or RCE.
* **Data Transfer in Microservices:** if services communicate over HTTP/HTTPS, the flaw could be a critical weak link.
* **IoT Devices:** They often use cURL to interact with the web and the vulnerability can be used to compromise the devices
* **Deployment Scripts:** DevOps commonly employs automated deployment scripts using cURL to fetch software, configurations, and interact with internal REST APIs. Exploiting this flaw may jeopardize these processes.
* **CI/CD Pipelines**: CI/CD pipelines commonly rely on cURL commands for web interactions, and a successfully exploited vulnerability could disrupt the entire process.
* **Cloud Services Interactions**: If you employ cURL within a script to communicate with AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or other cloud service APIs, this vulnerability may lead to the exposure of sensitive data or access credentials.
* **VPN Software**: Certain VPN services employ libcurl for specific operations, and any exploitation could result in a breach of privacy or more severe consequences.

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: libcurl [7.69.0](https://curl.se/docs/vuln-7.69.0.html) to  [8.3.0](https://curl.se/docs/vuln-8.3.0.html)
* Not affected versions: libcurl < [7.69.0](https://curl.se/docs/vuln-7.69.0.html) and >= [8.4.0](https://curl.se/docs/vuln-8.4.0.html)

## Solution

CVE-2023-38545 vulnerability is patched in the cURL version [8.4.0](https://curl.se/docs/vuln-8.4.0.html). Updating to the latest version will mitigate the flaw. Following are the other things that can be proccesable:

* Do not use `CURLPROXY_SOCKS5_HOSTNAME` proxies with cURL
* Do not set a proxy environment variable to socks5h://

I haven't seen a reply to this come through so, for anyone that is interested, you are welcome to my build of Curl 8.4.0 until VSI releases one. It is available at <https://theberrymans.com/php_kits/curl-8_4_0.zip> (I really need to rename that directory).

A couple of notes:

1. This kit includes LDAP support so the VSI LDAP kit (either 2.5 or 2.6) needs to be installed.

2. If you are not already aware, you can place a file called cert.pem containing certificates for all of the CAs that you trust in SSL3$CERTS: and any program that calls X509\_STORE\_set\_default\_paths() will automatically load them. I use the same ones that Mozilla uses, which can be downloaded from <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html>

Example: curl -O <https://vmssoftware.com/docs/VSI_X86V921_RN.pdf>

$ curl -V

curl 8.4.0 (OpenVMS x86\_64) libcurl/8.4.0 OpenSSL/3.0.10 zlib/1.2.12 libidn2/2.3.4 libssh2/1.11.0 nghttp2/1.57.0 OpenLDAP/2.6.6

Hello Mark (long time, no type),

I realize this is not the correct area to be asking this question, but have you published a port of mariadb-5.5 for OpenVMS x86-64 ?

(IIRC, you previously told me why going above version 5 on OpenVMS was not possible at this time)
