  "CVE-2023-38545": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2023-38545",
      "Description": "This flaw makes curl overflow a heap based buffer in the SOCKS5 proxy handshake. When curl is asked to pass along the hostname to the SOCKS5 proxy to allow that to resolve the address instead of it getting done by curl itself, the maximum length that hostname can be is 255 bytes. If the hostname is detected to be longer than 255 bytes, curl switches to local name resolving and instead passes on the resolved address only to the proxy. Due to a bug, the local variable that means \"let the host resolve the name\" could get the wrong value during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention, copy the too long hostname to the target buffer instead of copying just the resolved address there.",
      "Source": "curl.se_c10afcd3_20250111_080528.html"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "A bug in the SOCKS5 handshake code when handling hostnames longer than 255 bytes. The code incorrectly copies the long hostname to a target buffer instead of the resolved address during a slow SOCKS5 handshake.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow",
         "Incorrect handling of hostname length",
         "Improper state management during SOCKS5 handshake"
      ],
      "Impact": "Heap-based buffer overflow, potentially leading to remote code execution.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "Network access via SOCKS5 proxy",
        "Malicious URL with hostname exceeding buffer size",
        "Slow SOCKS5 handshake to trigger the bug"
       ],
       "Attacker Capabilities": "Attacker needs to control or influence the target URL and SOCKS5 proxy. They may also need to influence the SOCKS5 handshake speed to trigger the vulnerability. Typically server latency is enough to trigger the bug"
    },
    "Affected Versions": {
      "libcurl": "7.69.0 to 8.3.0"
    },
      "Affected Products": [
        "Active IQ Unified Manager for Microsoft Windows",
        "Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere",
        "OnCommand Insight",
        "OnCommand Workflow Automation",
