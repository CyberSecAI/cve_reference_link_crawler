# GLib: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **202311-18**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in GLib.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/glib** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.74.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.74.4** |

### Background

GLib is a library providing a number of GNOME's core objects and functions.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in GLib. Please review the referenced CVEs for details.

### Impact

GVariant deserialization is vulnerable to an exponential blowup issue where a crafted GVariant can cause excessive processing, leading to denial of service.
GVariant deserialization fails to validate that the input conforms to the expected format, leading to denial of service.
GVariant deserialization is vulnerable to a slowdown issue where a crafted GVariant can cause excessive processing, leading to denial of service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GLib users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/glib-2.74.4"

```

# (CVE-2023-32665) GVariant deserialisation does not match spec for non-normal data

I've been writing an implementation of the GVariant serialisation format in Rust against the GVariant spec found here: <https://people.gnome.org/~desrt/gvariant-serialisation.pdf> . To test it I've been fuzzing my implementation and the GLib one and comparing outputs. I've come across a couple of cases where I don't think the GLib implementation matches the [GVariant spec](https://people.gnome.org/~desrt/gvariant-serialisation.pdf) when interpreting non-normal data.

Firstly strings:

The spec gives the example:

> #### String with Embedded Nul
>
> With type 's':
>
> ```
> 'f 'o 'o \0  'b 'a 'r \0
> ```
>
> has a value of `'foo'`.

because

> ### 2.7.3 Handling Non-Normal Serialised Data
>
> #### String with Embedded Nul
>
> If a string has a nul character as its final byte, but also contains another nul character before this final terminator, the value of the string is taken to be the part of the string that precedes the embedded nul. This means that obtaining a C pointer to a string is still a constant time operation.

Whereas the GLib implementation interprets it as an empty string.

Secondly non-fixed width arrays:

With typestring **aay** GLib interprets

```
01 00
```

as `[[], []]` whereas I think the spec requires `[[1], []]`. There are two items because `00` says that the start of the frame-offsets is at index 0. The first item is bytes `0..1` and the second item is bytes `1..0`.

So the first item gets the value `[1]`, even though it overlaps the framing offsets. Spec says:

> #### Child Values Overlapping Framing Offsets
>
> If the byte sequence of a child value overlaps the framing offsets of the container it resides within then this error is ignored. The child is given a value that corresponds to the normal deserialisation process performed on this byte sequence (including the bytes from the framing offsets) with the type of the child.

I think either the GLib implementation or the spec should be updated to resolve this inconsistency.

See my GVariant implementation here: <https://github.com/wmanley/gvariant-rs> and specifically the fuzzing bit here: <https://github.com/wmanley/gvariant-rs/blob/master/fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_target_1.rs>

Package        : glib2.0
Version        : 2.58.3-2+deb10u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-29499 CVE-2023-32611 CVE-2023-32665

Several security vulnerabilities were found in GLib, a general-purpose utility
library, used by projects such as GTK+, GIMP, and GNOME.

CVE-2023-29499

    GVariant deserialization fails to validate that the input conforms to the
    expected format, leading to denial of service.

CVE-2023-32611

    GVariant deserialization is vulnerable to a slowdown issue where a crafted
    GVariant can cause excessive processing, leading to denial of service.

CVE-2023-32665

    GVariant deserialization is vulnerable to an exponential blowup issue where
    a crafted GVariant can cause excessive processing, leading to denial of
    service.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.58.3-2+deb10u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your glib2.0 packages.

For the detailed security status of glib2.0 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/glib2.0>
