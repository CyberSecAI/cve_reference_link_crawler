- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of a limit on the length of hostnames in Checkmk. This allows users to create hostnames of arbitrary length. Since Checkmk stores information in files, and the file paths contain the hostname, exceeding the allowed path length can lead to various errors, potentially rendering parts of the GUI unusable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unbounded hostname length leading to excessively long file paths.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation can result in errors and potentially the inability to use parts of the Checkmk GUI.
- **Attack vectors:** Creating a host with an excessively long hostname.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have sufficient privileges to create a host in Checkmk (i.e., a user with "High" privileges).
