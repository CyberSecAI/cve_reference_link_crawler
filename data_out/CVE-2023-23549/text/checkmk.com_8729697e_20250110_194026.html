Prior to this Werk it was possible to create Hosts with arbitrary length.
Since Checkmk stores information in files which paths contain the hostname these path could exceed the allowed length leading to various errors to an extend that rendered the usage of parts of the GUI useless.

We found this vulnerability internally.

\* 2.2.0
\* 2.1.0
