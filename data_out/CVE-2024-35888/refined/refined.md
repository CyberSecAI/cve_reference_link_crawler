Vulnerability:
The vulnerability lies in the `ip6erspan_rcv()` and `erspan_rcv()` functions in the Linux kernel. These functions did not ensure that the `erspan_base_hdr` was present in the skb linear part (skb->head) before accessing the `@ver` field. This leads to a potential uninitialized value access.

Weaknesses:
- Missing check for `erspan_base_hdr` presence.
- Accessing a field (`ver`) from `erspan_base_hdr` without prior verification that the header is available in the `skb` data.

Impact of exploitation:
- The uninitialized value access can lead to unpredictable behavior, memory corruption, or crashes.
- The syzbot report indicates a KMSAN uninitialized value detection, which can lead to denial of service.

Attack vectors:
- Sending a crafted ERSPAN packet through a TUN interface could trigger this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability exists in the network stack, so any route that goes through the vulnerable code path can be used to exploit it.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets that will be processed by the vulnerable functions.
- This typically requires a user with the ability to create network sockets or configure network interfaces.
