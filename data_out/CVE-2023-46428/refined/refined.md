{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper filtering for ZIP archive uploads within the application's backend, specifically during the application upload functionality.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted file upload",
      "Inadequate input validation",
      "Lack of file type filtering",
      "Arbitrary file write via ZIP extraction",
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary code on the server. In this case, a PHP webshell is uploaded, leading to remote code execution (RCE). This allows the attacker to gain complete control of the web server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
       "Upload a malicious zip file containing webshell via the application's backend."
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have access to the application's admin panel, which provides functionality to upload application archives. This indicates a requirement for privileged access or the compromise of an administrator account."
