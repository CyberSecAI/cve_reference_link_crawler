- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Simple Org Chart plugin <= 2.3.4 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact will vary depending on the actions the plugin allows.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a CSRF attack, which typically involves tricking a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site, which then executes actions on the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user with administrative privileges into interacting with a crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target system.
