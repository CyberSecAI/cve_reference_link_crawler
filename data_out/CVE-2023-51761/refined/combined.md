## 4. MITIGATIONS

Emerson recommends end users update the affected products' firmware. For update information, contact Emerson Tech Support. Emerson recommends end users continue to use current cybersecurity industry best practices, and in the event such infrastructure is not implemented within an end user's network, the user should take action to ensure the affected product is connected to a well-protected network and not connected to the Internet. For more information, refer to the [Emerson Security](https://www.emerson.com/en-us/support/security-notifications) web page.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities have a high attack complexity.

Executive Summary
Security is an important part of the success of your business. Emerson maintains dedicated security staff
to continuously monitor and analyze potential security issues. We also engage third party experts to help
us design and maintain robust security features within our products. We are committed to reviewing
threats as they become known, issuing notifications when necessary, and providing mitigations and
solutions in a timely manner.

Emerson has been informed of vulnerabilities recently disclosed by an external researcher and verified by
internal testing. The four vulnerabilities allow for an unauthenticated user with network access to run
arbitrary commands in root context, to bypass authentication and acquire admin capabilities, get access
to sensitive information, and run arbitrary commands. Additional information regarding these
vulnerabilities can be found in CISA’s ICS Advisory: ICSA-24-030-01.

This notification is intended to inform end users that Emerson is aware of the vulnerability and has
updated software to address the issue. Emerson does not recommend connecting the Affected Products
directly to the Internet. It is important to note that if the Affected Product is isolated from the internet
as recommended and running on a well-protected network consistent with industry best
practices, the potential risk is lowered. Each user should consider their particular system configuration
and circumstances and determine the effect of this potential issue as it relates to their application and
take appropriate actions.

Risk Assessment
The vulnerability was initially discovered by Vera Mens of Claroty Research and is being disclosed as part
of Emerson’s commitment to our responsible disclosure to inform customers of known potential risks. The
potential risks related to the vulnerabilities discussed in this Cyber Security Notification are lowered if the
Affected Product is isolated from the internet and operating on a well-protected network consistent with
industry practice.
There is four CVE’s associated with this notification:

•  CVE-2023-46687 Preauth Command Injection via Command 0x23 (gunzip)
