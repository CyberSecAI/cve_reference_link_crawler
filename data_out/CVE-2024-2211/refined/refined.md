*   **Root Cause:** A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists within the Gophish Admin Panel.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The vulnerability is a stored XSS (CWE-79), where malicious JavaScript code can be injected and stored within the application.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can store a malicious JavaScript payload in the campaign menu. This payload is then executed when an administrator removes a campaign from the menu. This could potentially allow the attacker to perform actions such as session hijacking or other malicious activities within the admin's browser session.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript into the campaign menu via the Gophish Admin Panel.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have at least low privilege access (PR:L) to the Gophish Admin Panel to inject the malicious script. The attack also requires user interaction (UI:R), specifically an admin removing the campaign from the menu which triggers the stored script execution.
