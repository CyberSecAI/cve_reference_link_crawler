## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Quiz and Survey Master (QSM) < 9.1.1 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin fails to validate and escape certain Quiz fields before displaying them on a page or post where the Quiz is embedded, which could allows contributor and above roles to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

### Proof of Concept

1. Login with a Contributor role and go to the Quiz and Survey Master (QSM) plugin
2. Click on the Quizzes & Surveys and create/edit a quiz
3. Inject the following XSS payload in the "Results Page" > "redirect the user by entering the URL below" field: javascript:alert(document.domain)
4. Save the Results Page, and paste the Quizz shortcode into one of the posts/pages.
5. Whenever an unauthenticated user visits this page and submit a Quizz, the XSS will trigger
