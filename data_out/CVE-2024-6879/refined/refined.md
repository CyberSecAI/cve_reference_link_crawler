- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to validate and escape certain Quiz fields before displaying them on a page or post where the Quiz is embedded. Specifically, the "redirect the user by entering the URL below" field within the "Results Page" is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of a user's browser when they visit a page containing the vulnerable quiz. This allows an attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing other unauthorized actions within the affected website.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with Contributor or higher role can inject the malicious code via the quiz settings page, specifically the "redirect the user by entering the URL below" field. This injected code gets stored in the database and is executed when a user views a page where the vulnerable quiz is embedded.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least a Contributor role on the WordPress site. They need access to the Quiz and Survey Master (QSM) plugin settings to inject the malicious payload.
