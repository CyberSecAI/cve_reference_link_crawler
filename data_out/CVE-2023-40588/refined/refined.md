- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A malicious user can add a 2FA or security key with a carefully crafted name to their account.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the way the application handles 2FA or security key names, allowing a malicious user to craft a name that can cause a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The crafted 2FA/security key name can cause a denial of service (DoS) for other users.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, as a malicious user needs to interact with the application through the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a low level of privileges, i.e., have an account on the affected platform, and be able to add 2FA or security keys to it. No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
