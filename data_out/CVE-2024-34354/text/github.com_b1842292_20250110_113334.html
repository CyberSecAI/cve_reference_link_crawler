### References

PR details the issue: [#65](https://github.com/CriticalMoments/CMSaasStarter/pull/65)

Details:

* CMSaaSStarted followed the offical SvelteKit Supabase docs here: <https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-sveltekit>
* Unforunately the server side helper getSession was not validating the JWT token, which was caught and fixed in the docs here: [supabase/supabase#22381](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/pull/22381)
* There were a few improvements/cleanups since the fix, which we integrated as well, see change history here: <https://github.com/supabase/supabase/commits/master/apps/docs/content/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-sveltekit.mdx>

We're now back up to date with the supabase suggested format here: <https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-sveltekit>
