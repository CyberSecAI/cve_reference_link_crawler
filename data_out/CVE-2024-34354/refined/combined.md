### @scosman **[scosman](/scosman)** commented [May 9, 2024](#issue-2287807742)

Details:

* CMSaaSStarted followed the offical SvelteKit Supabase docs here: <https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-sveltekit>
* Unforunately the server side helper getSession was not validating the JWT token, which was caught and fixed in the docs here: [fix: better handling of getSession for sveltekit supabase/supabase#22381](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/pull/22381)
* There were a few improvements/cleanups since the fix, which we integrated as well, see change history here: <https://github.com/supabase/supabase/commits/master/apps/docs/content/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-sveltekit.mdx>

We're now back up to date with the supabase suggested format here: <https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-sveltekit>

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Thanks to [@activenode](https://github.com/activenode) for spotting this here: [#64](https://github.com/CriticalMoments/CMSaasStarter/pull/64)  Since it's a security issue I wanted to get this out ASAP so wrote up the PR instead of waiting. |

Details:

* CMSaaSStarted followed the offical SvelteKit Supabase docs here: <https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-sveltekit>

* There were a few improvements/cleanups since the fix, which we integrated as well, see change history here: <https://github.com/supabase/supabase/commits/master/apps/docs/content/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-sveltekit.mdx>
