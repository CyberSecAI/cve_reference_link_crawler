Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28965:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a DLL hijacking issue in the "instup.exe" and "wsc_proxy.exe" Avast processes. These processes attempt to load a non-existent DLL during the "REPAIR APP" function call.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **DLL Hijacking:** The vulnerable processes do not properly validate the DLL before loading it. This allows an attacker to place a malicious DLL in the expected location.
- **Lack of security checks:** There is an absence of security checks while loading the DLL, which enables the loading of unsigned or malicious DLLs.
- **Vulnerable processes are protected by Avast:** These vulnerable processes are part of Avast's protected components, which are normally shielded against tampering, but are vulnerable here.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Malicious code execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary malicious code within the context of the Avast process.
- **Self-Defense Bypass:**  Attackers can bypass the Avast "Self-Defense" protection mechanism, which is intended to prevent tampering of the antivirus itself.
- **Antivirus Deactivation:** The injected malicious code can terminate or disable the Avast antivirus.
- **Malware Staging:** The attacker can use the vulnerability as a staging point for further malware deployment.
- **Denial of Service (DOS):** The vulnerability can cause a denial of service to the affected system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers with administrative rights could potentially gain control of Avast protected processes.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to have local administrative privileges to drop the malicious DLL to the location where the vulnerable Avast processes will attempt to load it.
- The vulnerability is triggered by the "REPAIR APP" function in Avast.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrative access to the target system.
- The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in the location expected by vulnerable Avast process.
- The attacker must be able to trigger the "REPAIR APP" function call in Avast.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in Avast Premium Security version 21.11.2500 (build 21.11.6809.528).
- The vulnerability was patched in Avast Premium Security 22.2.
