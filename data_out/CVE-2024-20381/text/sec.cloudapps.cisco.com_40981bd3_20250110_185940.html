| | Cisco Security AdvisoryMultiple Cisco Products Web-Based Management Interface Privilege Escalation Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-nso-auth-bypass-QnTEesp  First Published: 2024 September 11 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2024 September 25 13:05 GMT  Version 1.2:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCwj26769](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwj26769)  [CSCwj31961](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwj31961)  [CSCwj32133](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwj32133)     CVE-2024-20381     CWE-285       CVSS Score: [Base 8.8](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2024-20381     CWE-285       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nso-auth-bypass-QnTEesp/csaf/cisco-sa-nso-auth-bypass-QnTEesp.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the JSON-RPC API feature in Cisco Crosswork Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) and ConfD that is used by the web-based management interfaces of Cisco Optical Site Manager and Cisco RV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to modify the configuration of an affected application or device.  This vulnerability is due to improper authorization checks on the API. An attacker with privileges sufficient to access the affected application or device could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to the JSON-RPC API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to make unauthorized modifications to the configuration of the affected application or device, including creating new user accounts or elevating their own privileges on an affected system.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nso-auth-bypass-QnTEesp>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products when using the initial default configuration with the web UI enabled:    + Crosswork NSO   + Optical Site Manager   + RV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers This vulnerability also affects ConfD if the JSON-RPC API feature is enabled.  For information about which Cisco and ConfD software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine the ConfD Configuration The JSON-RPC API feature is enabled in ConfD if the **webui** feature is enabled in the **confd.conf** configuration file, as shown in the following example:  ```        .        .        .     <webui>       <enabled>true</enabled>           <transport>         <tcp>           <enabled>true</enabled>           <ip>0.0.0.0</ip>           <port>8008</port>         </tcp>             <ssl>           <enabled>true</enabled>           <ip>0.0.0.0</ip>           <port>8888</port>         </ssl>       </transport>        .        .        .   </webui>        .        .        .   ```  For the application web server to process JSON-RPC requests, ConfD applications must have the Web UI feature enabled and be configured with a valid transport (either TCP or SSL) with a valid port.  **Note:** The XML tag is named **webui** even though ConfD does not provide its own web UI. The preceding example, which is from **examples.confd/json\_rpc/webui/README**, shows a **webui** implementation that enables the JSON-RPC API on ports 8008 and 8888. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Catalyst SD-WAN Controller, formerly SD-WAN vSmart   + Catalyst SD-WAN Manager, formerly SD-WAN vManage   + Catalyst SD-WAN Validator, formerly SD-WAN vBond Orchestrator   + Identity Services Engine (ISE)   + IOS XE SD-WAN Software   + SD-WAN vEdge Cloud Routers   + SD-WAN vEdge Routers  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Tail-f, a Cisco company, has released software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have a current license and have a valid support and maintenance agreement. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of their license agreement with Tail-f Systems AB. Security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license or additional software feature sets.  Customers who have a current license and have a valid support and maintenance agreement can download the fixed version of software from their existing Tail-f delivery server download account.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
