Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an unrestricted file upload in the `/marimar/admin/mod_room/controller.php` file within the Online Hotel Reservation System. The application uses a flawed method to check if an uploaded file is an image, relying solely on the file's size and a simple header check, allowing attackers to bypass the intended restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application fails to properly validate uploaded files, allowing the upload of arbitrary files, including malicious ones.
-   **Insufficient File Type Validation:** The image check is bypassed by simply prepending a GIF header ("GIF89a") to the malicious payload. This shows a lack of robust file type verification.
-   **Lack of Authentication:** The system doesn't require authentication for file uploads, as evidenced by the deletion of the cookie in the provided exploit example. This allows unauthenticated, remote attackers to exploit the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file (a webshell) disguised as an image, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server.
-   **Full System Compromise:** Successful RCE can lead to complete compromise of the web server and potentially the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Remote, unauthenticated HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/marimar/admin/mod_room/controller.php?action=add` endpoint.
-   **Multipart Form Data:** The malicious file is uploaded using multipart/form-data.
-   **Image Header Bypass:** The attacker prepends a valid GIF header (`GIF89a`) to the malicious PHP code to circumvent the file type check.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
-   **No Authentication Required:**  The attacker doesn't need any login credentials to upload malicious files, making exploitation easier.
-   **Ability to Forge HTTP Request:** The attacker needs the ability to send a crafted HTTP POST request, which is easily achievable through tools such as `curl` or a web browser.
