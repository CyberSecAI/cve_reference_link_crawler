{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2023-35836",
    "description": "Attackers within radio frequency range can obtain a cleartext copy of the device’s network configuration, including the Wi-Fi Pre-Shared Key (PSK), during setup and reconfiguration of the Pocket WiFi device. This means that an attacker could access the victim’s Wi-Fi network using the obtained PSK and therefore could perform attacks on machines and services that were otherwise not exposed.",
    "technical_details": {
      "root_cause": "The SolaX Pocket WiFi v3 device discloses its network configuration, including the Wi-Fi Pre-Shared Key (PSK), in cleartext during setup and reconfiguration.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (Wi-Fi PSK)",
        "Lack of encryption for network configuration data."
      ],
      "impact": "Compromise of the Wi-Fi network associated with the SolaX Pocket WiFi device. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the local network and potentially perform further attacks on other devices in the network.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Radio frequency range attack during setup and reconfiguration of the Pocket WiFi device."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be within radio frequency range of the SolaX Pocket WiFi device during setup or reconfiguration."
