| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2224368#c0)  Michael Kaplan    2023-07-20 14:50:26 UTC  ``` An Integer overflow in pcl/pl/plfont.c:418 in pl_glyph_name allows a local attacker to cause a denial of service via a rafted PCL file and tranforming it to PDF format   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2224368#c1)  Michael Kaplan    2023-07-20 14:57:00 UTC  ``` References:  <https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=706898> <https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=commitdiff;h=b7eb1d0174c>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2224368#c3)  TEJ RATHI    2023-07-25 07:05:58 UTC  ``` Created ghostscript tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2225381](show_bug.cgi?id=2225381 "CLOSED ERRATA - TRIAGE-CVE-2023-38560 ghostscript: Integer overflow in pcl/pl/plfont.c:418 in pl_glyph_name [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2224368#c4)  Michael J Gruber    2023-07-25 10:17:05 UTC  ``` (In reply to Michael Kaplan from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=2224368#c1)) > References: >  > <https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=70689> > <https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=706897> > <https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=commitdiff;h=b7eb1d0174c>  Strange fix that is:  If "a > b - 1" is a problem because a, b are unsigned then why not use "a + 1 > b"?  The fix relies implicitly on the fact that an "int" can fit a "u16", or else we get new problems ... (Can't comment on the original gs bug which is locked.)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2224368#c5)  Product Security DevOps Team    2023-08-01 19:02:48 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-38560>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2224368#c6)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2023-08-04 04:07:58 UTC  ``` Hi  The upstream bug reference should be <https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=706898>, can you please correct that here as well in the CVE record?
