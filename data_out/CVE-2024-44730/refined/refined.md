**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper server-side validation or involvement in chat message handling within the MiroTalk application.
*   Chat messages are directly exchanged between clients via WebRTC, meaning the server does not verify the sender's identity.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Message Manipulation:** An attacker can forge chat messages, impersonating other users by manipulating the sender's identity within the message content.
*   **Lack of Server-Side Validation:** The application's reliance on client-side identity verification without server-side validation is the core weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Impersonation:** Attackers can send messages as if they were coming from another user.
*   **Misinformation/Social Engineering:** The ability to spoof user identities can be used for spreading misinformation, creating confusion, or enabling social engineering attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **WebRTC Connection:** The attacker must be present in the meeting to establish a WebRTC connection with other participants, which is necessary to send the manipulated chat messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
