## Descriptions

### Sensitive parameter values captured in build metadata files by Parameterized Trigger Plugin

**SECURITY-2185
/
CVE-2022-27195**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`parameterized-trigger`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/parameterized-trigger)**

**Description:**

Parameterized Trigger Plugin 2.43 and earlier captures environment variables passed to builds triggered using Parameterized Trigger Plugin, including password parameter values, in their `build.xml` files.
These values are stored unencrypted and can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Parameterized Trigger Plugin 2.43.1 does not store captured environment variables in `build.xml` files.

|  | Existing `build.xml` files are not automatically updated to remove captured environment variables. They need to be manually cleaned up. To help with this, the plugin will report environment variables stored in `build.xml` as unloadable data in the Old Data Monitor, that allows discarding this data. Build records are only loaded from disk when needed however, so some builds stored in Jenkins may not immediately appear there. |
