### **[c01dkit](/c01dkit)** commented [Sep 16, 2022](#issue-1376009885)

| **Affected components：**  affected source code file: /tee/lib/libutee/tee\_api.c, affected functions: TEE\_Realloc  **Attack vector(s)**  To exploit the vulnerability, invoke the function TEE\_Realloc and pass a large number to the parameter "len".  **Suggested description of the vulnerability for use in the CVE**  Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value vulnerablity in TEE\_Realloc function in Samsung Electronics mTower v0.3.0 (and earlier) allows a trusted application to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) via invoking the function TEE\_Realloc with an excessive number of the parameter "len".  **Discoverer(s)/Credits**  SyzTrust  **Reference(s)**  <https://github.com/Samsung/mTower>   [mTower/tee/lib/libutee/tee\_api.c](https://github.com/Samsung/mTower/blob/efd36709306a9afcca5b4782499d01be0c7a02a5/tee/lib/libutee/tee_api.c#L319)  Line 319 in [efd3670](/Samsung/mTower/commit/efd36709306a9afcca5b4782499d01be0c7a02a5)   |  | void \*TEE\_Realloc(const void \*buffer, uint32\_t newSize) | | --- | --- |      **Additional information**  The function TEE\_Realloc does not check the size of chunk to realloc. Executing the statement "tee\_user\_mem\_realloc" with an excessive size value on a real IoT hardware (such as Numaker-PFM-M2351) will crash the trusted execution environment kernel and cause a Denial of Service (DoS).  *THANK YOU FOR CONTRIBUTIONS IN MTOWER TEE OS!* |
