Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-4697:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `heading_tag` parameter within the Cowidgets – Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input for the `heading_tag` parameter before rendering it in the HTML output. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary script execution: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into pages by manipulating the `heading_tag` parameter. When a user visits an affected page, the injected script executes, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Defacement of the site
  - Stealing sensitive information
  - Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the plugin's settings interface, where the `heading_tag` parameter can be modified.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated access: The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to modify the plugin settings and inject the malicious script.
- No user interaction required: Once the malicious script is injected, it will execute automatically when users visit pages containing the vulnerable widget.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Cowidgets – Elementor Addons plugin up to and including version 1.1.2.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.0 of the plugin.
- CVE-2024-35782 is likely a duplicate of this issue.

The provided code snippets show the `Site_Title` and `Page_Title` widget classes where the `heading_tag` parameter is used, but they do not contain the vulnerability themselves as they don't show how the value is sanitized. They show how the heading tag is defined and used in the template, which makes it clear how a malicious value could be included.
