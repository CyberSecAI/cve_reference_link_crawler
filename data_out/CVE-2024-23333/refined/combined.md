# Authenticated Remote Code Execution

High

[gruberroland](/gruberroland)
published
GHSA-fm9w-7m7v-wxqv
Mar 16, 2024

## Package

ldap-account-manager
(none)

## Affected versions

< 8.7

## Patched versions

8.7

## Description

### Impact

LAM's log configuration allows to specify arbitrary paths for log files. An attacker could exploit this by creating a PHP file and cause LAM to log some PHP code to this file. When the file is then accessed via web the code would be executed.

The issue is mitigated by the following:

* an attacker needs to know LAM's master configuration password to be able to change the main settings
* The webserver needs write access to a directory that is accessible via web. LAM itself does not provide any such directories.

### Patches

The issue has been fixed in 8.7.

### Workarounds

Limit access to LAM configuration pages to authorized users.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:H

### CVE ID
