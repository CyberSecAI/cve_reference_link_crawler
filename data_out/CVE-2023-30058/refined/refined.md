Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-30058

**Vulnerable Software:** novel-plus version 3.6.2

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `searchByPage` function. This occurs because user-supplied input in the `sort` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `sort` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database server.
- This can potentially lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- It could also lead to full database server compromise in some circumstances.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP GET request to the `/book/searchByPage` endpoint.
- The `sort` parameter within this request is used to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- No authentication or special privileges appear to be required, making it remotely exploitable.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided PoC demonstrates how to inject SQL code using the `sort` parameter.
- The PoC uses a `SLEEP(5)` function to demonstrate successful SQL injection by causing a delay in the response.
- SQLmap can be used to exploit the vulnerability further.
- The `last_index_update_time` is a sort parameter that is vulnerable
