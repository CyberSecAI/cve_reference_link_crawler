- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The default replacement message in FortiOS' Application Control block page reveals the private IP address and hostname of the FortiGate device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure. The system leaks private IP and hostname in the default block page message.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain knowledge of the internal network topology, including the private IP address and hostname of the FortiGate.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user accesses a blocked application or website that is blocked by the application control and receives the default block page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special capabilities are required. The attacker simply needs to trigger the application control block page, which can be achieved by visiting any blocked application.
