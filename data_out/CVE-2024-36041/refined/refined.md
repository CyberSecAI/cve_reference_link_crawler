{
  "CVE-2024-36041": {
    "root_cause": "KSmserver, KDE's XSMP manager, incorrectly allows connections via ICE based purely on the host, allowing all local connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect access control",
      "Insufficient authentication"
    ],
    "impact": "A well-crafted client could use the session restore feature to execute arbitrary code as the user on the next boot.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the machine"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Another user on the same machine can gain access to the session manager.",
     "additional_info": "The vulnerability allows a local user to access the session manager due to improper access control based solely on the host. This could lead to arbitrary code execution during the next boot by exploiting the session restore functionality."
