**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to:
- Arbitrary code execution: Due to the memory corruption, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code.
- Memory corruption

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious PDF document: A specially crafted PDF document containing malicious JavaScript code is used to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to trick a user into opening the malicious PDF file.
- No special privileges are required, as the vulnerability can be triggered from a user account.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious PDF files with Javascript code.
