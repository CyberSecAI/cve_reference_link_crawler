- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input within the FortiADC dashboard. Specifically, the "name" parameter is not sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can execute unauthorized code or commands within the victim's browser session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must be authenticated to access the FortiADC dashboard, then inject the malicious payload into the "name" parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the FortiADC dashboard and the ability to modify the dashboard settings to inject the malicious code.
