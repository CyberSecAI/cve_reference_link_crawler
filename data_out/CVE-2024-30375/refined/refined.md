- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the parsing of KSP files, specifically due to a lack of validation of the existence of an object before performing operations on it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-After-Free vulnerability. The application attempts to operate on an object that may have already been freed or is no longer valid.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. This could lead to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves the user opening a malicious KSP file or visiting a malicious webpage designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious KSP file or host a malicious webpage that can be accessed by the victim. The user must interact with the malicious file or page for the exploit to occur, i.e. by opening the file with Luxion KeyShot Viewer.
