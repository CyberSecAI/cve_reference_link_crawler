The provided content is related to a fix for a kernel warning, not a security vulnerability. Therefore, it is **UNRELATED** to a CVE.

The content describes a kernel warning that occurs when adding a monitor interface in the `mt76_connac_mcu_uni_add_dev` routine, which is part of the MediaTek mt76 wireless driver. The warning was triggered because the driver was not properly handling the `NL80211_IFTYPE_MONITOR` interface type. The fix involves adding a case for `NL80211_IFTYPE_MONITOR` in the switch statement within the `mt76_connac_mcu_uni_add_dev` function to correctly set the connection type. This resolves the warning but does not address any vulnerability.
