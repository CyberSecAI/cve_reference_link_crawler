 Guidelines:
1. First verify if the content relates to the CVE specified based on the official description
2. If the content does not relate to this CVE, respond with "UNRELATED"
3. If no useful vulnerability information is found, respond with "NOINFO" 
4. For relevant content, extract:
   - Root cause of vulnerability
   - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
   - Impact of exploitation
   - Attack vectors
   - Required attacker capabilities/position

Additional instructions:
- Preserve original technical details and descriptions
- Remove unrelated content
- Translate non-English content to English
- Note if the content provides more detail than the official CVE description

      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the AhsayCBS server's 'ShowAdvanced.do' endpoint.",
        "The attacker needs to modify the 'editConfigBean.xss' parameter, injecting malicious JVM options.",

      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated AhsayCBS administrator (system user) with the ability to modify the Runtime Options in the web interface.",
      "additional_info": "The provided content includes a full technical description of how to exploit the vulnerability, including the specific request parameters to modify, the payload to inject, and how to leverage JMX to achieve remote code execution. The content also provides a timeline of the vulnerability discovery, and the fix provided by the vendor, along with references. The steps necessary to exploit the vulnerability is clearly outlined, making this more useful than the standard CVE description."
