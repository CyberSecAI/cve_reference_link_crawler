Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the user registration API in Strapi not properly sanitizing input data, specifically when private fields are included in the registration request. The `sanitize.contentAPI.input` function does not filter out private fields as intended, allowing users to write to those fields during registration.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly sanitize input data before writing it to the database. The `sanitizeInput` function does not filter out private fields.
    *   **Lack of Access Control:** Private fields are intended to be inaccessible via the API during registration, but due to the lack of sanitization, this control is bypassed.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Attackers can write to fields intended to be private, potentially modifying sensitive information or user attributes that should not be directly accessible during registration.
    *   **Integrity Violation:** The ability to write to private fields violates data integrity.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **API Endpoint:** The attack vector is the user registration API endpoint.
    *   **POST Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request with data targeting the private fields during user registration.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **No Privileges Required:** No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
    *   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the API endpoint.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of `@strapi/plugin-users-permissions` and `@strapi/strapi` from `4.0.0` up to (but not including) `4.13.1`.
*   The provided code snippet shows how the reporter temporarily fixed the vulnerability by manually filtering out private fields.
*   The CVSS v3 base metrics provide a severity of **High (7.6)** with an attack vector of **Adjacent**, low attack complexity, no required privileges or user interaction, an unchanged scope, low confidentiality impact, high integrity impact, and low availability impact.
