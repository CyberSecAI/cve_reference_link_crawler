### Description

I marked some fields as private fields in user content-type, and tried to register as a new user via api, at the same time I added content to fill the private fields and sent a post request, and as you can see from the images below, I can write to the private fields.

[![register](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32245914/246987508-9337ffd5-c681-4f51-9a0b-2490b424ca1e.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32245914/246987508-9337ffd5-c681-4f51-9a0b-2490b424ca1e.png)

[![user](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32245914/246987564-9f440b3f-a7a3-4710-9b75-0854667fc35d.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32245914/246987564-9f440b3f-a7a3-4710-9b75-0854667fc35d.png)

[![private_field](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32245914/246987590-9c0ecefd-fd64-4221-b642-e730ea55d440.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32245914/246987590-9c0ecefd-fd64-4221-b642-e730ea55d440.png)

[![table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32245914/246987604-009e6808-5690-458e-aa87-57dda7d4589d.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32245914/246987604-009e6808-5690-458e-aa87-57dda7d4589d.png)

To prevent this, I went to the extension area and tried to extend the register method, for this I wanted to do it using the sanitizeInput function that I know in the source codes of the strap. But the sanitizeInput function did not filter out private fields.

```
  const { auth } = ctx.state;
  const data = ctx.request.body;
  const userSchema = strapi.getModel("plugin::users-permissions.user");

  sanitize.contentAPI.input(data, userSchema, { auth });
```

here's the solution I've temporarily kept to myself, code snippet

```
  const body = ctx.request.body;

  const { attributes } = strapi.getModel("plugin::users-permissions.user");

  const sanitizedData = _.omitBy(body, (data, key) => {
    const attribute = attributes[key];

    if (_.isNil(attribute)) {
      return false;
    }

    //? If you want, you can throw an error for fields that we did not expect.

    // if (_.isNil(attribute))
    //   throw new ApplicationError(`Unexpected value ${key}`);

    // if private value is true, we do not want to send it to the database.
    return attribute.private;
  });

  return sanitizedData;
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
