Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37677:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the shape inference implementation of the `tf.raw_ops.Dequantize` operation within TensorFlow. The code improperly handles the `axis` parameter, failing to validate that it is either -1 or greater than -1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of validation for the `axis` parameter in the `Dequantize` operation's shape inference code. The code assumes that `axis` will either be -1 or a non-negative integer. When `axis` takes other negative values (e.g. -10), the code attempts to access tensor dimensions with an out of bounds index.
- **Incorrect Rank Calculation:** The shape inference logic uses the `axis` to determine the rank of the `min_range` and `max_range` tensors (`minmax_rank`). Specifically, it sets `minmax_rank` to `0` when `axis` is `-1`, and to `1` otherwise. The code does not account for the case where axis is a negative number that is not -1.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger a denial-of-service condition. Specifically, providing an invalid `axis` value leads to an out-of-bounds access, resulting in a segmentation fault (segfault) and crash of the TensorFlow process. This can disrupt or halt services relying on the library.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious TensorFlow program that calls `tf.raw_ops.Dequantize` with an invalid `axis` argument.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply inputs to a TensorFlow program that uses the vulnerable `tf.raw_ops.Dequantize` operation.
- The attacker does not need elevated privileges, as the vulnerability is triggered within the application's normal execution context.
- The attacker can be local or remote, depending on how the TensorFlow model is being used.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided GitHub commit ([da857cfa0fde8f79ad0afdbc94e88b5d4bbec764](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/da857cfa0fde8f79ad0afdbc94e88b5d4bbec764)) shows the fix, which adds proper validation of the `axis` parameter.
- The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.6.0, but the fix was backported to versions 2.3.4, 2.4.3 and 2.5.1.
- The vulnerability was reported by Yakun Zhang of Baidu Security.
- The assigned severity is "Moderate".
