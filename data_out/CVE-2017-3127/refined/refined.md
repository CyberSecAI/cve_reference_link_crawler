Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-3127:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of the `scrintf` parameter during Firewall Policy creation in FortiOS. Specifically, the input is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. The unsanitized `scrintf` parameter allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript that will be stored in the system and executed when the relevant page is accessed by another user (e.g., an administrator).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a logged-in user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
   - Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information.
   - Modifying the web interface.
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
   - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker injects the malicious JavaScript via the `scrintf` parameter during the creation of a Firewall Policy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create firewall policies. This typically requires administrative privileges or the ability to influence an administrator to create a firewall policy with the malicious `scrintf` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Products:** FortiOS versions 5.2.0 to 5.2.10.
- **Solution:** Upgrade to FortiOS version 5.2.11.
- **Severity:** Low, as per Fortinet's assessment.
- **CVSSv3 Score:** 5.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).
- Fortinet thanks independent researcher Amir Morshedizadeh for reporting the vulnerability.
