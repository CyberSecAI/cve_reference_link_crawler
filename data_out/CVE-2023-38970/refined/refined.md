Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-38970 (Based on the content, though it's a placeholder, the provided information is relevant and thus, this is not UNRELATED.)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the Badaso application, specifically when adding or editing members. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This means the malicious script is saved within the application's database and executed when other users access the affected pages.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-provided input in the "name of the member" field, allowing for the injection of HTML/JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows arbitrary JavaScript code to be executed within the context of a user's browser session.
- **Data Compromise:** Attackers can potentially steal sensitive information, such as session cookies, personal data, or other user information.
- **Session Hijacking:** Stolen session cookies can be used to impersonate legitimate users.
- **Website Defacement:** The website could be altered or defaced by the attacker.
- **Other Malicious Activities:** The injected JavaScript can perform other malicious actions, depending on the attacker's goals.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the Badaso application.
- **Form Input:** The attacker injects malicious code via a form input field, specifically the "name of the member" parameter when adding or editing members.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have access to a Badaso account that has the permissions to add or edit members.
- **Access to Web Interface:** The attacker needs access to the web interface of the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable Version:** Badaso v2.9.7
- **Affected Pages:**
    - `https://badaso-demo.uatech.co.id/dashboard/general/borrowing/add`
    - `https://badaso-demo.uatech.co.id/dashboard/general/borrowing/1/edit`
    - `https://badaso-demo.uatech.co.id/dashboard/general/members/1/edit`
    - `https://badaso-demo.uatech.co.id/dashboard/general/members/add`
- **Payload Example:** The provided payload is:  `"' test <img src="" onerror="alert(2)">` This payload injects an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` event handler that executes JavaScript. When the browser attempts to load the image (which will fail), the `alert(2)` will be executed.
