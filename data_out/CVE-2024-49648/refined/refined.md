- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress SVG Captcha plugin, versions 1.0.11 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts, including redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads. These scripts execute when website visitors interact with the vulnerable areas of the site.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated user can perform this attack.
