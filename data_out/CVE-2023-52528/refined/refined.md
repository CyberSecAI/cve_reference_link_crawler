  "cveId": "CVE-2023-52528",
  "description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
  "related": true,
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The `usbnet_read_cmd()` function in the `smsc75xx` driver might read fewer bytes than requested, leading to uninitialized data being used.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The driver doesn't handle cases where `usbnet_read_cmd()` returns less data than requested, leading to uninitialized values.",
         "Uninitialized data is used in the `buf` variable within `__smsc75xx_read_reg`."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially cause unexpected behavior or system instability by triggering the uninitialized value access.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "By sending specific USB commands that cause the `usbnet_read_cmd()` to return less data than requested."
      ],
      "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to interact with a vulnerable USB device using the `smsc75xx` driver. This could be a malicious USB device or a user with control over the USB communication."
