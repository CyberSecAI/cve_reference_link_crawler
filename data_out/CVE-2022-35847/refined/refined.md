**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-1336:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in a template engine.
- Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI): This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into templates that are processed on the server side.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows a remote and authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Unauthorized Command Execution:** The attacker can also execute unauthorized commands on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the FortiSOAR management interface.
- **Crafted Payload:** The attacker injects a specially crafted payload into the vulnerable template engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the FortiSOAR management interface.
- The attacker must be able to send crafted payloads that will be processed by the vulnerable template engine.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects FortiSOAR version 7.2.0.
- The fix is to upgrade to FortiSOAR version 7.2.1 or above.
- The CVSS v3 score is 5.9 with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L/E:F/RL:U/RC:R which translates to Network, Low Attack Complexity, Low Privileges Required, No User Interaction, Unchanged Scope, Low Confidentiality Impact, Low Integrity Impact, Low Availability Impact, Functional Exploit, Unreported Remediation Level, and Reasonable Confidence.
