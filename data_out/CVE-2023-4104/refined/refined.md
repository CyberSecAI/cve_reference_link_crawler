Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-4104:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a combination of an invalid Polkit authentication check and the lack of authentication checks for several D-Bus methods in the Mozilla VPN client for Linux. The Polkit check was using `getpid()` instead of the D-Bus sender's process ID. This allowed any local user to interact with the VPN daemon's D-Bus interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Incorrect Polkit Implementation:**
    - The `PolkitHelper::checkAuthorization()` function was using the process ID of the VPN daemon itself for authentication instead of the process ID of the D-Bus sender. This effectively bypassed Polkit authentication, as the daemon runs as root and is thus always authorized.
2.  **Missing Authentication Checks:**
    - Several D-Bus methods lacked any Polkit authorization checks, including `deactivate()`, `getLogs()`, `cleanupLogs()`, `runningApps()`, `firewallApp()`, and `firewallClear()`. This allowed unauthorized users to control and gather information from the VPN daemon.
3.  **Information Leaks:**
    - The `getLogs()` method provided potentially sensitive log data, including debug logs and other users' activities. This data was also exposed publicly in `/var/log/mozillavpn.txt`.
    - The `runningApps()` method exposed information about other users' sessions and applications.
4.  **Lack of Multi-User Concept:**
    - The D-Bus implementation of Mozilla VPN on Linux lacked a proper multi-user concept, which made it difficult to restrict access to specific users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary VPN Configuration:** Any local user could configure arbitrary VPN settings, potentially redirecting network traffic, creating fake VPNs, or causing a denial of service.
- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized users could access log data, potentially revealing sensitive information about other users' activities and the system itself.
- **Tampering with VPN Settings:** Unauthorized users could clear logs, add or remove applications from split tunneling and deactivate the VPN connection.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Local users could exploit the lack of authentication by sending D-Bus messages to the vulnerable VPN daemon service, bypassing the Polkit controls and gaining control of the VPN settings and configurations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where the vulnerable Mozilla VPN client is installed. No special privileges are needed to exploit this, although the attacker needs to be able to send D-Bus messages.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability primarily affected Mozilla VPN on Linux, other platforms are not impacted.
- The fix involved two phases:
  - First, the faulty Polkit logic was removed entirely.
  - Second, new authorization checks were introduced, checking for `CAP_NET_ADMIN` or matching the activating user's UID.
- The initial fix was incomplete and did not fully address all information disclosure issues.
- The vendor was made aware of the issue by a third party, but did not fully adhere to coordinated disclosure policies and publicly disclosed information about the vulnerability before releasing a patch.
