## Description

It seems that we no longer require the use of `polkit` in the VPN client, the daemon acquires sufficient privileges when launched via systemd, and is granted `CAP_NET_ADMIN` as well during installation. As such, we can simply remove all the code related to polkit from the codebase.

The main idea behind polkit was to prevent other apps to use the dbus interface and play with the VPN connectivity.

Clearly this was buggy and did not work, but i wonder if we should still protect somehow the daemon asking the user if app X has permission granted.

Thoughts?

| [@bakulf](https://github.com/bakulf) I'm guessing this has never worked, because the `<allow_active>auth_admin</allow_active>` policy should have prompted the user with a password dialog when activating the VPN, and I don't think I have ever seen that behaviour out of the VPN client. |

| Okay, I think I understand why the polkit code does nothing. The call `polkit_unix_process_new_for_owner(getpid(), 0, -1)` means that we are checking the permissions of the daemon (not the entity that invoked the D-Bus method). Because the daemon starts as root, this means that the `allow_admin` permission will always be met.  For this to have had any effect, instead of `getpid()` we should have been using the PID of the D-Bus method's caller. |
