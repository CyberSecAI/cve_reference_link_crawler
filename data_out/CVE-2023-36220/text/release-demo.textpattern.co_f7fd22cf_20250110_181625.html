* Dive in and learn by doing? Please note:
  + When you write an article you assign it to a [section](//release-demo.textpattern.co/textpattern/index.php?event=section) of your site.
  + Sections use a [page](//release-demo.textpattern.co/textpattern/index.php?event=page) template and a [style](//release-demo.textpattern.co/textpattern/index.php?event=css) to define how site content appears in a browser.
  + Page templates typically use HTML and [Textpattern tags](https://docs.textpattern.com/tags/) (like this: `<txp:article />`) to build the output code.
  + Some Textpattern tags use [forms](//release-demo.textpattern.co/textpattern/index.php?event=form), reusable building blocks that provide extensive control and customization over your site construction.
  + Pages, styles and forms can be packaged into [themes](//release-demo.textpattern.co/textpattern/index.php?event=skin) and assigned to one or more sections.

Textpattern tags, their attributes and values are explained within the [Textpattern User Documentation](https://docs.textpattern.com/), where you will also find valuable examples, advice and tutorials.

There’s also a group of friendly, helpful Textpattern users and administrators at the [Textpattern support forum](https://forum.textpattern.com/).
