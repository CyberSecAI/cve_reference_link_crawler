- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The default value of the `http.header.version.verbosity` property in Liferay Portal and Liferay DXP is set to `full`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure. The `Liferay-Portal` response header exposes the full version of the application.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can easily identify the exact version of Liferay Portal or DXP running, which can help in identifying known vulnerabilities and potentially planning further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can send a request to the Liferay application and observe the `Liferay-Portal` header in the response.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any special privileges, they can be unauthenticated and remote.
