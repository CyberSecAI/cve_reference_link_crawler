The provided content does not describe a specific vulnerability and therefore is not related to CVE-2024-28754. Instead, it describes a new disclosure method coined "Carrot Disclosure" where only the output of an exploit is published, rather than the exploit itself, to encourage vendors to fix vulnerabilities. 

The content does describe vulnerabilities found in RaspAP, however, without specifics, therefore the following can be extracted based on the RaspAP examples provided:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The content implies multiple vulnerabilities exist in RaspAP, including unauthenticated arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation to root, and vulnerabilities leading to information disclosure. The provided examples include reading the `/etc/passwd` file, gaining access to wifi passwords, wireguard keys, and backdooring the system for a permanent MITM. The examples also imply a denial-of-service (bricking the system).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated arbitrary code execution
- Privilege escalation to root
- Information disclosure (sensitive files, wifi passwords, wireguard keys)
- Lack of authentication/authorization for some functionalities.
- Possible lack of proper input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Complete system compromise with arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, and sensitive data access.
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Denial of service (system bricking).

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access to the vulnerable RaspAP instance is required. The examples use an IP address.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Basic network connectivity to the vulnerable device. No prior authentication seems to be required for some of the vulnerabilities.

The vulnerabilities found in RaspAP seem to have led to the following changes:
*   More escaping of data in web requests
*   All ajax requests are now authenticated
*   General hardening.

It's important to note that while some details of the vulnerabilities in RaspAP are present, the content does not provide the actual exploits themselves.
