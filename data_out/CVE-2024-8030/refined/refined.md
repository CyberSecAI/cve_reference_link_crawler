Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8030

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's use of `unserialize()` on data from the `_ultimate_store_kit_wishlist` cookie without proper sanitization or validation. Specifically, the code used `unserialize()` on the cookie data, which allows an attacker to inject malicious PHP objects via a crafted cookie. The vulnerable code was located in `ultimate-store-kit/trunk/includes/helper.php`, where the cookie was being unserialized. The fix in version 2.0.4 was to change the unserialize function to `json_decode`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthenticated PHP Object Injection:** The primary weakness is the deserialization of untrusted data (`unserialize()`), which allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject arbitrary PHP objects into the application.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The plugin does not sanitize or validate the data from the cookie before passing it to `unserialize()`, making it susceptible to object injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** While the vulnerable plugin itself doesn't contain a POP chain (a sequence of method calls that can be triggered through object deserialization to achieve a desired effect), if other plugins or themes on the same WordPress site have a POP chain, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution, delete arbitrary files, or retrieve sensitive data.
- **Data Exposure:** Depending on the available POP chain, attackers could potentially access sensitive information stored on the server.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker may also be able to cause a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious PHP object, serializes it and sets it as the value of the `_ultimate_store_kit_wishlist` cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any special privileges on the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the targeted WordPress site.
