  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The issue results from the lack of proper initialization of memory prior to accessing it during the parsing of AR files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Uninitialized memory access",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by opening a malicious AR file or visiting a malicious page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious AR file or a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability. User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability, as the target must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page."
