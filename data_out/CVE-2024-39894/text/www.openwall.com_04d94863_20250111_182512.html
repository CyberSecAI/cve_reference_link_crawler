Thanks for all the work towards this release.

Just a paperwork question as I couldn't find the information anywhere,
was there any CVE assigned to the 2nd security issue?

I'm asking because I tried updating the alpine package[1], and given the
first issue is a slightly different problem on musl it probably needs a
different label than CVE-2024-6387 ; I'm honestly still not quite sure
how all this works after all these years but at the very least a search
on cve.mitre.org[2] didn't turn up anything, so I assume redhat (who
issued the first CVE) didn't process the second problem?

(although to be fair the non-safety is still a problem on alpine, so
that CVE might still apply, it's just no longer a free/malloc race with
syslog but something that hasn't been studied as extensively... labeling
is hard.)

Looking at other announces I assume CVE-2024-6387 is specific to this.

I couldn't find anything on this one.

Thanks,
