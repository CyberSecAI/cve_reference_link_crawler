Resque (pronounced like "rescue") is a Redis-backed library for creating background jobs, placing those jobs on multiple queues, and processing them later. resque-web in resque versions before 2.1.0 are vulnerable to reflected XSS through the current_queue parameter in the path of the queues endpoint. This issue has been patched in version 2.1.0.
