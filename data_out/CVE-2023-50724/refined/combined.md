`h` is only available in rails and resque does not depend on rails. This should do the trick:

Suggested change

|  | <h1>Pending jobs on <span class='hl'><%= h current\_queue %></span></h1> |
| --- | --- |
|  | <h1>Pending jobs on <span class='hl'><%= ERB::Util.html\_escape current\_queue %></span></h1> |

`h` is aliased as a helper over here:

<https://github.com/brianvans/resque/blob/70f14b12d495ac0727cfe69fbfa2209fe2c42a31/lib/resque/server.rb#L28-L30>

I noticed it was used in a few other views, so it made sense to use it here as well.

| `https://example.com/queues/<img src="x" onerror="alert(document.domain)">`  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1705144/56300524-1f09a500-6104-11e9-9c34-914f76b40073.png)  As shown in the image above, the application is vulnerable to Reflected Cross Site Scripting through pathname of the site. With Non-Persistent cross-site scripting, malicious code is executed by the victim’s browser, and the payload is not stored anywhere; instead, it is returned as part of the response HTML that the server sends. The vulnerability is typically a result of incoming requests not being sufficiently validated, which allows for the manipulation of a web application’s function and the activation of malicious scripts. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to send the link to the victim. When the victim loads the link, the cross-site scripting payload will execute.  **Recommended fix:** HTML ESCAPE: Ruby on Rails has a built-in XSS protection mechanism which automatically HTMLescapes all the data being transferred from Rails to HTML. Rails uses ERB::Util#html\_escape function toescape HTML entities. This particular function does the substitution based on the following hash (moreabout ERB::Util). `{ '&' => '&amp;', '>' => '&gt;', '<' => '&lt;', '"' => '&quot;', "'" => '&#39;' }` Here is anexample: `<b>Hello <%= params[:name] %></b>` If the above is attacked with ?name=<script>alert(1)</script>, the output will be as follows: ```  **Hello <script>alert(1)</script>gt;**  ` |

published
GHSA-r8xx-8vm8-x6wj
Dec 18, 2023

## Package

bundler

resque
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 2.1.0

## Patched versions

2.1.0

## Description

### Impact

resque-web in resque versions before 2.1.0 is vulnerable to reflected XSS through the current\_queue parameter in the path of the queues endpoint.

### Patches

v2.1.0

### Workarounds

No known workarounds at this time. It is recommended to not click on 3rd party or untrusted links to the resque-web interface until you have patched your application.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N
