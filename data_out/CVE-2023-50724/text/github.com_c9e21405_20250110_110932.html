`h` is only available in rails and resque does not depend on rails. This should do the trick:

Suggested change

|  | <h1>Pending jobs on <span class='hl'><%= h current\_queue %></span></h1> |
| --- | --- |
|  | <h1>Pending jobs on <span class='hl'><%= ERB::Util.html\_escape current\_queue %></span></h1> |

`h` is aliased as a helper over here:

<https://github.com/brianvans/resque/blob/70f14b12d495ac0727cfe69fbfa2209fe2c42a31/lib/resque/server.rb#L28-L30>

I noticed it was used in a few other views, so it made sense to use it here as well.
