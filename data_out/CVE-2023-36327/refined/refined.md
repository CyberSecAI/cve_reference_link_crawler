The provided content relates to CVE-2023-36327.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `bn_get_prime` function within the RELIC toolkit. Specifically, the function does not perform adequate input validation on the provided `pos` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The `bn_grow` function has an integer overflow vulnerability when reallocating memory.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `bn_get_prime` function does not validate if `pos` is a negative number, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Heap overflow:** The integer overflow in `bn_grow` can lead to heap corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Global buffer corruption:** Passing a negative value to `bn_get_prime` can lead to out-of-bounds reads and corruption of global buffers, leading to application instability or unexpected behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could trigger the overflow in `bn_grow` by calling functions like `bn_gen_prime` or `bn_rand` with large size arguments, eventually causing the memory allocation to overflow.
- An attacker could cause a global buffer corruption by calling the `bn_get_prime` with a negative integer value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to call the vulnerable functions with specific inputs to trigger the overflow or out-of-bounds access. This could be done either through direct access to the API or through an indirect interface that calls these vulnerable functions.
