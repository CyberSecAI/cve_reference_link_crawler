| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2223668#c0)  Zack Miele    2023-07-18 13:35:09 UTC  ``` An issue was discovered in frr from 8.3 when parsing certain babeld unicast hello messages that were intended to be ignored. Hello messages with the unicast flag set, the interval field set to 0, or any TLV that contains a sub-TLV with the Mandatory flag set could enter an infinite loop.  <https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/issues/11808>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2223668#c2)  Michal Ruprich    2023-07-19 14:13:46 UTC  ``` We do not ship babeld with our FRR package in RHEL. I am closing this bug report since it does not affect our package in RHEL.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2223668#c3)  Michal Ruprich    2023-07-19 14:15:02 UTC  ``` Sorry, accidentally closed a bug for Security response. Apologies. Opening the bug and closing the bug for FRR instead.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2223668#c4)  Product Security DevOps Team    2023-08-01 12:27:28 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-3748>   ``` |  |
