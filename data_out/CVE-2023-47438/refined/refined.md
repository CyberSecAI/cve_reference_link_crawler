```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability occurs when a low privilege user is able to get internal system path, file path and DB related information by manipulating the parameter from `project=admin` to `project=admin'` in the URL.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application discloses sensitive information (internal system paths, file paths, and database information) in error messages when a specific URL parameter is manipulated. This indicates insufficient input validation and improper error handling.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exposure of internal paths can provide attackers with insights into the application's directory structure, potentially facilitating further exploitation. The disclosure of error messages can also aid attackers in refining their attack strategies and identifying potential weaknesses.",
  "Attack vectors": "Manipulating the `project` parameter in the URL (e.g., changing `project=admin` to `project=admin'`).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A low-privilege user is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability by manipulating the URL."
