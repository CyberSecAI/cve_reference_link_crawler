The provided content relates to a null pointer dereference vulnerability in the AMD display driver within the Linux kernel. The vulnerability is present in the `dcn20_program_pipe` function within the `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/dc/hwss/dcn20/dcn20_hwseq.c` file.

**Root cause:**
The code accesses `pipe_ctx->plane_state` without properly checking if `plane_state` is not null before accessing its members (e.g., `pipe_ctx->plane_state->update_flags.bits.hdr_mult`). This could lead to a null pointer dereference if `pipe_ctx->plane_state` is NULL.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Null pointer dereference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- System crash, denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation of this vulnerability would likely occur through interactions with the AMD display driver, particularly through configuration or control interfaces. The specific conditions to trigger the null `plane_state` would have to be met

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to interact with the display driver.
