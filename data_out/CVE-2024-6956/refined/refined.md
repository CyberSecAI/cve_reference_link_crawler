Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `php/functions.php` file of the `itsourcecode University Management System 1.0`. Specifically, the `$stid` field is not filtered, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, present in the `/view_cgpa.php` page. The `VR` and `VN` parameters are vulnerable.
*   **CWE-89:** The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command), highlighting the lack of proper input handling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability can lead to the compromise of confidentiality (unauthorized access to sensitive data), integrity (modification of data), and availability (disruption of services).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, meaning an attacker doesn't need local access to the server.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerable parameters (`VR` and `VN`) are passed through HTTP POST requests.
*   **`view_cgpa.php`:** The specific vulnerable page is `/view_cgpa.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Payloads:** The attacker must be able to craft SQL injection payloads, either time-based blind or UNION query attacks.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user, logged in with an administrator account, and access the student account's backend.

**Additional details:**

*   **Proof-of-Concept:** A proof-of-concept exploit is publicly available.
*   **Exploit Payloads:** The provided payloads show how to conduct time-based blind injection and UNION query injection attacks.
    *   Time-based blind injection payload: `vr=123321' AND (SELECT 6610 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))DIfN) AND 'OIeq'='OIeq&vn=mirage`
    *   UNION query injection payload: `vr=123321' UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x7171706271,0x614b42746d4946444c726d734d695a52654d4a5676534344787557687076666b756f73726b727155,0x7176626271),NULL-- -&vn=mirage`
*   **Easy Exploitation:** The vulnerability is considered easy to exploit.
*   **Public Disclosure:** The vulnerability has been publicly disclosed.
*  **Vulnerable parameter:** $stid field is vulnerable, as it's not subjected to strict filtering.
