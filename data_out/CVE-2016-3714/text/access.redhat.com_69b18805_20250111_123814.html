# ImageTragick - ImageMagick Filtering Vulnerability - CVE-2016-3714

* Overview
* Impact
* Diagnose
* Resolve

A vulnerability was found in Imagemagick where insufficient filtering for filenames passed to a delegate's command allows remote code execution during the conversion of several file formats.

## Background Information

Imagemagick allows the processing of files with external libraries. This feature is called "delegate". It is implemented as a system() call with a command string ('command') from the config file delegates.xml with actual values for different parameters (input/output/filename, etc.). Because the %M parameter is insufficiently filtered, it is possible to inject shell commands. One of the default delegate commands uses the following to handle HTTPS requests:

```
"wget" -q -O "%o" "https:%M"

```

where %M is the actual link from the input. If wget or curl are installed, it is possible to pass the value "https://example.com" |ls "-la" and unexpectedly execute 'ls -la'.

## Take Action

All Red Hat customers using ImageMagick are strongly recommended to apply mitigations to their systems pending released security Errata. Recommended mitigations are found under the Resolve tab.

## Impacted Products

Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a security impact of
[Important.](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/)

The following Red Hat Product versions are impacted:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
* Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise

## Impact

Any customer using ImageMagick to process untrusted or third-party images is potentally impacted. Examples include auto-generated thumbnail code using ImageMagick or third party usage of ImageMagick to process images uploaded to your servers, which is often done using web applications that receive untrusted user input.

## Mitigation

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 & 7

As a workaround, the /etc/ImageMagick/policy.xml file can be edited to disable processing of MVG, HTTPS, HTTP, URL, FTP, EPHEMERAL, MSL, LABEL and TEXT commands within image files. In the <policymap> section, add the following lines:

```
<policymap>
...
<policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="EPHEMERAL" />
<policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="HTTPS" />
<policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="HTTP" />
<policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="URL" />
<policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="FTP" />
<policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="MVG" />
<policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="MSL" />
<policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="TEXT" />
<policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="LABEL" />
<policy domain="path" rights="none" pattern="@*" />
</policymap>

```
### Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5

In the following folders:

```
/usr/lib64/ImageMagick-6.2.8/modules-Q16/coders/ (64bit package)
or
/usr/lib/ImageMagick-6.2.8/modules-Q16/coders/ (32bit package)

```

Rename the following files, mvg.so, msl.so, label.so. Example:

```
$ mv mvg.so mvg.so.bak
$ mv msl.so msl.so.bak
$ mv label.so label.so.bak

```
### Additional Mitigation

Additionally, customers can modify third-party code using ImageMagick to verify the image's validity before passing it to ImageMagick to process.

## Updates for Affected Products

| Product | Package | Advisory/Update |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 | ImageMagick | Will Not Fix |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 | ImageMagick | [RHSA-2016-0726](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-0726.html) |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 | ImageMagick | [RHSA-2016-0726](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-0726.html) |
