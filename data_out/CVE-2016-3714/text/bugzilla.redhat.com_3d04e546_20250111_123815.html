| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1332492#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-05-03 10:48:34 UTC  ```  A vulnerability was found in ImageMagick. Insufficient filtering for filename passed to delegate's command allows remote code execution during conversion of several file formats.  ImageMagick allows to process files with external libraries. This feature is called 'delegate'. It is implemented as a system() with command string ('command') from the config file delegates.xml with actual value for different params (input/output filenames etc). Due to insufficient %M param filtering it is possible to conduct shell command injection. One of the default delegate's command is used to handle https requests:  "wget" -q -O "%o" "https:%M"  where %M is the actual link from the input. It is possible to pass the value like `<https://example.com>"|ls "-la` and execute unexpected 'ls -la'. (wget or curl should be installed).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1332492#c3)  Stefan Cornelius    2016-05-03 15:19:39 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Details can be found under the resolve tab at <https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/2296071>  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 ================================  As a workaround the /etc/ImageMagick/policy.xml file can be edited to disable processing of MVG, HTTPS, HTTP, URL, FTP, EPHEMERAL, MSL, LABEL, TEXT, SHOW, WIN and PLT commands within image files, simply add the following lines: <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="EPHEMERAL" /> <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="HTTPS" /> <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="HTTP" /> <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="URL" /> <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="FTP" /> <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="MVG" /> <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="MSL" /> <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="TEXT" /> <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="LABEL" /> <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="SHOW" /> <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="WIN" /> <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PLT" /> <policy domain="path" rights="none" pattern="@*" />  within the policy map stanza: <policymap> ... </policymap>   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 ==========================  In the following folders: /usr/lib64/ImageMagick-6.2.8/modules-Q16/coders/ (64bit package) or /usr/lib/ImageMagick-6.2.8/modules-Q16/coders/ (32bit package)  Rename the following files: * mvg.so to mvg.so.bak * msl.so to msl.so.bak * label.so to label.so.bak   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1332492#c4)  Stefan Cornelius    2016-05-03 15:24:14 UTC  ```  Created ImageMagick tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1332630](show_bug.cgi?id=1332630 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - CVE-2016-3714 ImageMagick: Insufficient shell characters filtering [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1332492#c5)  Stefan Cornelius    2016-05-03 15:24:22 UTC  ``` Public via: <https://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=29588#p132726>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1332492#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-05-09 18:04:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2016:0726 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-0726.html>   ``` |  |
