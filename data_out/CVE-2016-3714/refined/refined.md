Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-3714:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in insufficient sanitization of filenames passed to a delegate command within ImageMagick. This occurs when ImageMagick processes files using external libraries (delegates). Specifically, the `%M` parameter, which represents the input filename, is not properly filtered before being used in shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Shell Command Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary shell commands through specially crafted image files.
*   **Insecure Delegates:**  ImageMagick's reliance on external libraries through the `delegates.xml` configuration file makes it vulnerable if those delegate commands are not secured
*   **Bypass of File Type Checks:** ImageMagick attempts to determine file types by content rather than extension, which is bypassed with malicious SVG and MVG files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the user running ImageMagick, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers could make HTTP GET or FTP requests through specially crafted images (CVE-2016-3718)
*   **File Deletion:** Attackers can delete files on the server using the `ephemeral` protocol (CVE-2016-3715)
*   **File Moving:** Attackers can move files on the server using the `msl` pseudo-protocol (CVE-2016-3716)
*   **Local File Read:** Attackers can read the contents of local files using the `label` pseudo protocol. (CVE-2016-3717)

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially crafted image files:**  Attackers can embed malicious code into seemingly benign image files such as SVG, MVG, or MIFF.
*   **Unsanitized Filenames:** Attackers can inject shell commands through filenames processed by ImageMagick.
*   **HTTP/HTTPS Requests:** By abusing the wget or curl delegates, attackers could use ImageMagick to perform requests to attacker-controlled servers or resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide input to ImageMagick:** Attackers require the ability to supply crafted image files for processing through ImageMagick, either through direct file upload, file processing, or any other mechanism where ImageMagick is used to handle an image source.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable delegates:**  Attackers need to leverage delegates that make use of the %M parameter, such as `wget` or `curl`.
*   **Basic Shell Syntax:** Attackers require a basic understanding of shell syntax to craft successful command injections.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
*   **Policy.xml Mitigation:** A policy.xml file can be modified to disable vulnerable coders, like `EPHEMERAL`, `URL`, `HTTPS`, `MVG`, `MSL`, `TEXT`, `SHOW`, `WIN`, and `PLT`. Red Hat also suggests disabling the path policy `"@*"`.
*   **Specific File Processing:** Reading MVG, MSL and Text are made explicit by enforcing syntax such as `mvg:my_graph.mvg` and `text:myText.txt`
*   **Affected Software:** This vulnerability affects multiple versions of ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick and is present in several distributions including Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE, openSUSE, Gentoo, and others. It also impacts libraries and applications that depend on these.
*   **Incomplete Patches:** Initial patches were found to be insufficient, leading to further updates and mitigations.
*   **Active Exploitation:** The vulnerability was being actively exploited in the wild shortly after being disclosed

In summary, CVE-2016-3714 represents a significant security risk due to its ease of exploitation and the wide range of potential impacts. The vulnerability's root cause is insufficient input sanitization that allows arbitrary command execution.
