{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `/extension/gdata/authorized` endpoint includes the `state` GET parameter verbatim in a `<script>` tag in the output, without escaping.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
    "Lack of input validation for the 'state' parameter"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser. The attacker-provided code can do anything the user can do, including deleting projects, retrieving database passwords, or executing arbitrary Jython or Closure expressions if those extensions are present.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can craft a URL with malicious JavaScript in the `state` parameter and trick a user into navigating to it.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with malicious JavaScript and convince a user to visit it. No special privileges are needed."
