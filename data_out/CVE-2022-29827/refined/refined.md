Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-29827:

**Root Cause:** Use of a hard-coded cryptographic key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The software uses a hard-coded cryptographic key, which could allow unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, allowing unauthorized users to view or execute programs.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), and the attack complexity is high (AC:H). User interaction is not required (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable software. The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N) but requires high level of sophistication. The scope of the attack is changed, (S:C) where a vulnerable component impacts resources beyond its security scope

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects specific versions of Mitsubishi Electric FA Engineering Software, particularly GX Works3.
- The provided CVSS v3 base score is 6.8, with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)
- The vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities affecting Mitsubishi Electric software.

The document provides mitigation steps which include updating the software to the specified versions and ensuring malicious actors cannot access project files and security keys from untrusted networks or hosts.
