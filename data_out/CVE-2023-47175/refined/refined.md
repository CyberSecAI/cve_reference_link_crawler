Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2023-47175 vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the LuxCal Web Calendar application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** The application is susceptible to XSS attacks, where malicious scripts can be injected into the web pages viewed by users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within a user's web browser when they access the calendar application.
- This could result in a variety of malicious activities, including:
  - Stealing cookies/session information
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Defacing the website
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious scripts into input fields or parameters that are not properly sanitized by the application.
- When the application renders the page, these malicious scripts are executed in the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious input into the LuxCal Web Calendar application.
- The user must then interact with the page containing the malicious script.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into interacting with the crafted data.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specifically a stored XSS vulnerability, meaning the malicious script is stored on the server and executed when other users view the affected page.
- The application versions affected are prior to 5.2.4M (MySQL) and 5.2.4L (SQLite).
- The fix involves sanitizing and validating all input data.
