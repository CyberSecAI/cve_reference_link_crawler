- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution within the user's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N) and requires a low level of privilege (PR:L). The user interaction (UI) is required (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have low privileges and the ability to inject malicious scripts into the application, which would then be executed when a user interacts with the injected content.
