- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key for communication within FortiEDR.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Hard-coded cryptographic keys (CWE-321), leading to insecure key transport.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can impersonate and forge messages from other collectors within the network. This could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks. An attacker on the same network as the affected FortiEDR components can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the affected FortiEDR environment and have network access to the vulnerable components.
