…lization.

Deserialization of java runtime serialized objects has been identified as a security risk by
CodeQL team members [@atorralba](https://github.com/atorralba) (Tony Torralba) and [@joefarebrother](https://github.com/joefarebrother) (Joseph Farebrother).

All existing database objects that are serialized using this serialization format will need to
be converted to a safer format (Aerospike native types, protobuf, msgpack, json, xml ...) using
a previous client version.
