    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The Aerospike Java client deserializes Java objects received from the server without proper validation, leading to unsafe deserialization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unsafe deserialization of Java objects from server responses.",
        "Lack of validation of incoming data before deserialization."

     "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in the `Buffer.bytesToObject` method which is called when a `JBLOB` type is received. Also a similar sink exists in `Unpacker.unpackBlock`. The provided content includes a detailed explanation of how the vulnerability can be triggered using an `AsyncRead` command and a malicious server injecting a payload. The vulnerability was discovered using CodeQL."
