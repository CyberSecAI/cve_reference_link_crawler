{
  "CVE-2017-10357": {
    "Root cause": "Multiple classes in the JAXP, Serialization, Libraries, and JAX-WS components of OpenJDK did not limit the amount of memory allocated when creating object instances from the serialized form.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unbounded memory allocation during deserialization."
    ],
    "Impact": "A specially-crafted input could cause a Java application to use an excessive amount of memory when deserialized, potentially leading to a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "An attacker can provide a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized, triggers excessive memory allocation."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide input that will be deserialized by a vulnerable application."
  }
}
