Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetApp products incorporate the Oracle Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) software libraries. Java SE (JDK and JRE) versions through 6u161, 7u151, 8u144, and 9 are susceptible to multiple vulnerabilities that could lead to a takeover of Java, a partial denial of service (DoS) of Java, or to the unauthorized reading or modification of a subset or all of the data accessible to the Java process. This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available.

#### Impact

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to a takeover of Java, a partial denial of service (DoS) of Java, or to the unauthorized reading or modification of a subset or all of the data accessible to the Java process.
