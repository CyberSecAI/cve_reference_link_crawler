{
  "CVE-2023-0330": {
    "Description": "A DMA-MMIO reentrancy problem in the lsi53c895a device may lead to memory corruption bugs, such as stack overflow or use-after-free.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a DMA reentrancy issue in the lsi53c895a device. The DMA operation does not properly limit the addresses written to, allowing for reentrancy and leading to a stack overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "DMA-MMIO reentrancy",
      "Lack of proper address validation in DMA operations"
    ],
    "Impact": "A privileged local user can exploit this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, potentially leading to denial of service and/or memory corruption bugs.",
    "Attack vectors": "A carefully designed sequence of DMA writes can repeatedly trigger the vulnerability.",
        "Required capabilities": "A privileged local user with the ability to interact with the affected QEMU device can exploit this vulnerability."
