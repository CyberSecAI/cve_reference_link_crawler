Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-26390:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Baxter Spectrum Wireless Battery Modules (WBM) store network credentials and patient health information (PHI) in an unencrypted form.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data (CWE-311): The vulnerability stems from the lack of encryption for sensitive data, specifically network credentials and PHI, stored within the WBM.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with physical access to a device can potentially extract sensitive information. This includes patient health information (PHI) if auto-programming is used on the Spectrum IQ pumps and network credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Physical Access: The primary attack vector is physical access to the affected WBM devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have physical access to a WBM that has not had its data and settings erased. The attacker needs to be able to connect to the WBM to extract the unencrypted information.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected devices include:
  - Sigma Spectrum v6.x model 35700BAX
  - Sigma Spectrum v8.x model 35700BAX2
  - Baxter Spectrum IQ (v9.x) model 35700BAX3
  - Specific versions of Sigma Spectrum LVP and Baxter Spectrum IQ LVP Wireless Battery Modules.
- The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 4.2, with a vector string of AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.
- Mitigation involves erasing all data and settings from WBMs and pumps before decommissioning or transferring them to other facilities.
-  The advisory is an update to a previous one and also addresses CVE-2022-26392, CVE-2022-26393 and CVE-2022-26394.
