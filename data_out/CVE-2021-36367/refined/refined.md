Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36367:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises because PuTTY proceeds with establishing an SSH session even if it hasn't received a valid authentication response from the client.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Lack of proper authentication handling:** PuTTY doesn't strictly require a substantive authentication response before proceeding with the session setup. This allows a malicious server to bypass initial authentication phases.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Spoofed authentication prompts:** A malicious SSH server can exploit this weakness to present a spoofed authentication prompt at a later stage in the connection. This can trick the user into entering their credentials.
-   **Credential theft:** The attacker can then capture these credentials and use them for malicious purposes that the user did not intend.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks:** A malicious or compromised SSH server intercepts the client connection.
-   **Compromised server:**  An attacker controls a SSH server and can then exploit connecting clients.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   The attacker needs to be in a position to act as a malicious SSH server or control a compromised SSH server.
-   The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the client.
