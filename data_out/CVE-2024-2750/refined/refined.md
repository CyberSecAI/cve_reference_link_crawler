Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2750:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the URL attribute within the Button widget of the Exclusive Addons for Elementor plugin. This allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. Malicious scripts are injected through the button URL attribute and stored in the database. These scripts then execute when a user accesses a page containing the injected button.
*   **Improper Neutralization of Alternate XSS Syntax:** The plugin fails to properly neutralize or escape alternate XSS syntax, making it possible for attackers to inject malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts. These scripts can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions such as redirecting users to phishing pages, stealing cookies, modifying website content, or performing administrative actions on the WordPress site.
*   **Compromise of User Accounts:** Attackers could potentially compromise user accounts by stealing session cookies or other sensitive information if the injected script targets logged-in users.
*   **Website Defacement:** An attacker could deface the website by modifying its content using the injected scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Button Widget URL Attribute:** The attack vector is the 'URL' attribute of the Button widget within the Elementor page builder. An attacker can inject malicious scripts into this field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor access to the WordPress site. This allows them to create or edit content that includes the vulnerable Button widget.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects versions of the Exclusive Addons for Elementor plugin up to and including 2.6.9.3.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 2.6.9.4.
*   The fix involved escaping the URL using `_.escape()` function to prevent XSS attacks.
