The provided content is related to **CVE-2024-3196**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of user-controlled input within multiple SOAP endpoints, leading to OS command injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, the application constructs OS commands using client-provided data, and then executes these commands without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated OS Command Injection: Several SOAP endpoints are vulnerable to OS command injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary OS command execution as root user.
- Full compromise of the appliance.
- Potential to compromise all cluster members in a cluster setup.
- Privilege escalation.
- Unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted SOAP request to the vulnerable endpoints.
- Network access to port 5132 on a MailCleaner host is required for successful exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to port 5132 on a MailCleaner host.
- Ability to send SOAP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
