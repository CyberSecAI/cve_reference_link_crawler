## Package

jumpserver

## Affected versions

v3.0.0 - v3.6.4

## Patched versions

>= v3.6.5

## Description

### Impact

Logged-in users can access and modify the contents of any file on the system.

The affected versions:

v3.0.0 - v3.6.4

### Details

The user 'foo' click 'Job-Template' menu and create a playbook named 'test'. Get the playbook id from the detail page, like 'e0adabef-c38f-492d-bd92-832bacc3df5f'.

An attacker can exploit the directory traversal flaw using the provided URL to access and retrieve the contents of the file.

```
https://jumpserver-ip/api/v1/ops/playbook/e0adabef-c38f-492d-bd92-832bacc3df5f/file/?key=../../../../../../../etc/passwd

```

And It has a similar method to modify the file content.

### Patches

Update to safe versions:

v3 version: >= v3.6.5

### Workarounds

It is recommended to upgrade the safe versions.

After upgrade, visit the api like `https://jumpserver-ip/api/v1/ops/playbook/e0adabef-c38f-492d-bd92-832bacc3df5f/file/?key=../../../../../../../etc/passwd`, the expected response content below:

```
{ msg: "Invalid file path" }

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L
