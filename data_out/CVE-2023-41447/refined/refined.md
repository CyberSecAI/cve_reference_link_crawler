Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2023-41447
*   **Affected Product:** phpkobo AjaxNewsTicker
*   **Affected Version:** 1.05
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization of the `subcmd` parameter within the "edit news" functionality of the `index.php` component. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient input validation and sanitization.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious link with the payload in the `subcmd` parameter.
    *   The victim needs to click the crafted link, leading to the execution of the payload in the victim's browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a crafted link, but does not need any access to the application server or database. The attacker can be remote.
*   **Payload:** `<img src=0 onerror=alert(document.cookie)>` is provided as a sample payload which would trigger an alert box containing the victim's cookies.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
*   **Technical Details:** The PoC demonstrates that both GET and POST requests can be used to inject the malicious payload. The vulnerable parameter is within a JSON request parameter. The request body in POST is `requ={"cmd":"edit_inp","subcmd":"sett<img src=0 onerror=alert(document.cookie)>ings","id":"2515"}` and the query parameter in GET is `requ={"cmd":"edit_inp","subcmd":"sett<img src=0 onerror=alert(document.cookie)>ings","id":"2515"}`.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a reflected XSS in the AjaxNewsTicker v1.05 due to unsanitized user input in the `subcmd` parameter when editing news. An attacker can craft a link containing a malicious payload, and when a victim clicks it, the payload will execute in their browser.
