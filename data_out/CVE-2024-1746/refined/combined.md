## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Testimonial Slider < 2.3.8 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to "Testimonial > Shortcode"
2. Add a shortcode and go to "Styling" and in the "Parent Class" field add the payload `(123" asd='' onmouseover="alert(1)"')`
3. Save the settings
4. Add the shortcode to a new post/page and publish or preview to see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
