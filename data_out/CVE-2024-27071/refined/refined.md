The provided content relates to a fix for a potential NULL pointer dereference in the `hx8357` backlight driver in the Linux kernel.

**Root Cause:**
The `im` pins for the `hx8357` backlight are optional. The code in `hx8357_probe()` was not checking if `lcd->im_pins` was NULL before accessing its `ndescs` member.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** If the "im" pins are not provided (resulting in `lcd->im_pins` being NULL), the code would attempt to access `lcd->im_pins->ndescs`, causing a NULL pointer dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A NULL pointer dereference would lead to a kernel crash/panic, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `hx8357` backlight driver is loaded and the "im" pins are not specified in the device tree or board configuration. This is a local vulnerability, meaning an attacker would need the ability to load a driver module and configure the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to load kernel modules
- Ability to configure device tree or other system configuration to not specify the optional "im" pins when using the `hx8357` driver.

The fix adds a check to ensure that `lcd->im_pins` is not NULL before attempting to access its members.
