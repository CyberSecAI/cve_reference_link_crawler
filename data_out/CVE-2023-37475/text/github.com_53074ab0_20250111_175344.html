|  |  | One type can be [ConvertibleTo](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Conversions) another type if they have identical underlying types. |
|  |  | A non-native type is allowed be used if it can be convertible to \*time.Time\*, \*big.Rat\* or \*avro.LogicalDuration\* for the particular of \*LogicalTypes\*. |

|  |  | ##### Untrusted Input With Bytes and Strings |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | For security reasons, the configuration `Config.MaxByteSliceSize` restricts the maximum size of `bytes` and `string` types created |
|  |  | by the `Reader`. The default maximum size is `1MiB` and is configurable. This is required to stop untrusted input from consuming all memory and |
|  |  | crashing the application. Should this not be need, setting a negative number will disable the behaviour. |
