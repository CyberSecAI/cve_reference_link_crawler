### Relevant Content:
The provided content indicates a missing authorization vulnerability in the "Restaurant Menu and Food Ordering" plugin for WordPress, specifically in versions 2.4.16 and earlier.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of capability checks within the plugin's `class-installation-walkthrough.php` file on the 'add_section', 'add_menu', 'add_menu_item', and 'add_menu_page' AJAX actions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing authorization checks on AJAX actions related to menu creation, specifically in `add_section`, `add_menu`, `add_menu_item`, and `add_menu_page` functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Authenticated users, even with minimal subscriber-level access, could create menu sections, menus, food items, and new menu pages, potentially modifying the website's content without proper authorization.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is triggered by sending AJAX requests to the `wp_ajax_fdm_welcome_*` actions, specifically:
    - `wp_ajax_fdm_welcome_add_section`
    - `wp_ajax_fdm_welcome_add_menu_item`
    - `wp_ajax_fdm_welcome_create_menu`
    - `wp_ajax_fdm_welcome_add_menu_page`
- These AJAX calls can be made by any authenticated user, regardless of their role.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account on the vulnerable WordPress site with at least subscriber-level access.
- The attacker needs the nonce used to authenticate AJAX requests.
- The attacker doesn't need any special administrative privileges or positions to exploit the issue.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.4.17 by adding a capability check for `edit_posts`.
- The vulnerable code is present in the `class-installation-walkthrough.php` file of the plugin.
- Wordfence identified the vulnerability, and the fix can be seen in the changeset 3097599.
