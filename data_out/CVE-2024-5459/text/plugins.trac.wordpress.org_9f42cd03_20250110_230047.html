  | 38 |  | = Menu QR Code = |
  | 39 |  |  |
  | 40 |  | The plugin comes with the ability for you to generate a QR code that leads directly to your online menu. You can place these, for example, at the tables in your restaurant, so guests can scan them and gain easy and quick access to the menu page on your website. |
  |  | 38 | ### Restaurant Menu QR Code |
  |  | 39 |  |
  |  | 40 | The plugin comes with the ability for you to generate a QR code that leads directly to your online menu. You can place these, for example, at the tables in your restaurant, so guests can scan them and gain easy and quick access to the restaurant menu page on your website. |
  | 41 | 41 |  |
  | 42 | 42 | There are several great benefits to utilizing your online menu in your restaurant, including: |
  | 43 | 43 |  |
  | 44 |  | ~~\* Quick updates: You can instantaneously make changes to your~~ menu. No matter how small or big the change you need to make is, you won't need to reprint anything or explain it to every customer. |
  | 45 |  | ~~\* Save money and trees by avoiding the need to print your~~ menus. |
  | 46 |  | ~~\*~~ Creates a more contactless experience, no longer having menus shared between all customers. |
  | 47 |  |  |
  | 48 |  | = Menu Sections = |
  | 49 |  |  |
  | 50 |  | The plugin comes with the ability to create separate menu sections. This allows you to divide a menu into multiple parts, making it more clear for your customers. You can even include a note for a section (e.g. "All items in this section come with salad or fries."). Some examples of sections you can create are: |
  | 51 |  |  |
  | 52 |  | ~~\*~~ Appetizers |
  | 53 |  | ~~\*~~ Main Course |
  | 54 |  | ~~\*~~ Dessert Menu |
  | 55 |  | ~~\*~~ Kid's Menu |
  | 56 |  | ~~\*~~ Gluten Free Menu |
  | 57 |  | ~~\*~~ Weekly Specials |

  | 62 |  |  |
  | 63 |  | ~~\*~~ Breakfast |
  | 64 |  | ~~\*~~ Brunch |
  | 65 |  | ~~\*~~ Lunch |

  | 76 |  | Several additional features are included that will help ensure you're able to set your menu up easily and with all the options you need. They will also enable you to deliver the best and easiest drink and food menu experience for the visitors to your restaurant's website. These features include: |
  | 77 |  |  |
  | 78 |  | ~~\*~~ Extra Gutenberg blocks to display individual sections or items on a page (instead of just a whole menu). |
  | 79 |  | ~~\* Several extra patterns, so you can integrate~~ menus, sections and individual items directly into your block theme. |
  | 80 |  | ~~\*~~ Ability to add multiple prices for a single item. |
  | 81 |  | ~~\* Advanced template system for further layout customization of your~~ menu(s). |

  | 43 | 43 |  |
  | 44 |  | ~~\* Quick updates: You can instantaneously make changes to your~~ menu. No matter how small or big the change you need to make is, you won't need to reprint anything or explain it to every customer. |
