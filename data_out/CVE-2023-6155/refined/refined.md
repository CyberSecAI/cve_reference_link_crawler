- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ays_quiz_author_user_search` AJAX action in the Quiz Maker plugin lacks proper authorization checks, allowing unauthenticated users to trigger it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Inadequate authorization: The plugin fails to verify user authentication before allowing access to the `ays_quiz_author_user_search` AJAX action.
    - Sensitive data exposure: The AJAX action leaks user email addresses through the search functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can enumerate user email addresses by exploiting the vulnerable AJAX action.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted HTTP requests to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action=ays_quiz_author_user_search` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs no prior authentication to the WordPress site and can send requests from any network location.
