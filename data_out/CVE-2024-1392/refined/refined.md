Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-1392:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and output escaping in the 'button1\_icon' attribute of the Dual Button widget within the Elementor Addon Elements plugin. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious scripts are permanently saved within the database. These scripts are then executed whenever a user accesses the affected page.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to adequately sanitize user-provided input, specifically within the 'button1\_icon' field.
- **Missing Output Escaping:**  The plugin does not properly escape the output, allowing injected scripts to be rendered as active code in the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation enables attackers to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts in the context of a website, affecting all users who view the page.
- **Account Takeover, Data Theft, Defacement:** These injected scripts can be used for a wide range of malicious activities, including:
    -  Redirecting users to phishing pages
    -  Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information
    -  Modifying content on the website
    -  Gaining unauthorized access to the administrative backend
- **Widespread Impact:** Since the injected scripts are stored, any user who views the affected page becomes a target.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Plugin Widget Abuse:** The vulnerability is triggered by exploiting a specific plugin widget, the Dual Button widget.
- **'button1\_icon' attribute:** The malicious input is injected through the `button1_icon` attribute of the widget.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated Access:** Attackers must have an authenticated account with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This suggests a supply chain attack vector is possible.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided code snippets from `dual-button.php` show the structure of the plugin's code, particularly the rendering of the button and its icon, including the use of `Icons_Manager::render_icon` which is potentially related to how the injected code is rendered.
- The Wordfence content clarifies that the vulnerability is present in versions up to and including 1.12.12, and that version 1.13 is a patched version.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Medium" severity with a CVSS score of 6.4.
- The Wordfence writeup credits the researcher "RandomRoot" for discovering the vulnerability.
