The provided content is related to CVE-2021-47186.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing null check after calling `kmemdup` in the `tipc_aead_init` function within the TIPC (Transparent Inter-Process Communication) module. `kmemdup` can return a null pointer if memory allocation fails. If the return value is not checked for null, a subsequent dereference of the null pointer will occur in `tipc_crypto_key_xmit`, leading to a kernel panic.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing null pointer check.
- Potential for null pointer dereference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel panic (Denial of Service)

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by causing a memory allocation failure during the creation of a TIPC AEAD key, leading to kmemdup returning NULL, and subsequent null pointer dereference

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to trigger the allocation of a TIPC AEAD key in a way that causes `kmemdup` to fail and return NULL. This may require the ability to exhaust memory resources, or otherwise influence the TIPC AEAD key allocation.
