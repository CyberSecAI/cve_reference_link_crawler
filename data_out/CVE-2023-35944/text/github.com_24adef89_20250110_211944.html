# Incorrect handling of HTTP requests and responses with mixed case schemes in Envoy

High

[phlax](/phlax)
published

Jul 25, 2023

## Package

Envoy

## Affected versions

< 1.27.0

## Patched versions

1.26.4, 1.25.9, 1.24.10, 1.23.12

## Description

### Summary

Envoy allows mixed-case schemes in HTTP/2, however, some internal scheme checks in Envoy are case-sensitive, leading to incorrect handling of requests and responses with mixed case schemes.

### Affected component(s)

HTTP and some related HTTP filters, like http/cache, OAuth2, and ssl redirect checks.

### Details

Envoy allows mixed-case schemes in HTTP/2, however, some internal scheme checks are case-sensitive, which can lead to the rejection of requests with mixed-case schemes such as `htTp` or `htTps`, or the bypassing of some requests such as `https` in unencrypted connections.

With this fix, Envoy will now lowercase scheme values by default, and change the internal scheme checks that were case-sensitive to be case-insensitive.

### Attack vector(s)

A HTTP request with mixed case scheme

### PoC

For example, if a request with mixed scheme `htTp` is sent to the OAuth2 filter, it will fail the exact-match checks for `http`, and inform the remote endpoint the scheme is `https`, thus potentially bypassing OAuth2 checks specific to HTTP requests.

### Impact

Bypass some requests with mixed schemes.

### Mitigation

None

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
