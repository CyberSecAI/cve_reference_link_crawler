- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Envoy allows mixed-case schemes in HTTP/2, but some internal scheme checks are case-sensitive. This leads to incorrect handling of requests and responses with mixed-case schemes (e.g., `htTp`, `htTps`).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Case-sensitive scheme checks in various components (HTTP, cache, OAuth2, ssl redirect checks).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Bypassing of security checks (e.g., OAuth2), incorrect handling of requests, and potential for request manipulation. For example, a request with a mixed-case scheme like `htTp` might bypass OAuth2 checks meant for `http` by being identified as `https`, which leads to incorrect handling.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending HTTP requests with mixed-case schemes (e.g., `htTp`, `HtTpS`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to an Envoy instance and manipulate the scheme of the request URL. No special privileges or user interaction is required.
