Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in Daurnimator lua-http library allows Excessive Allocation and a denial of service (DoS) attack to be executed by sending a properly crafted request to the server. 
Such a request causes the program to enter an infinite loop. 

This issue affects lua-http: all versions before commit ddab283.
