Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3856-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                           Chris Lamb

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : python-html-sanitizer
Version        : 1.9.1-2+deb11u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2024-34078
Debian Bug     : 1070710

It was discovered that there was a sanitisation bypass issue in
python-html-sanitizer, a library used ensure that user-specified
content cannot inject HTML or JavaScript into a webpage.

If the default "keep_typographic_whitespace=False" value was set,
malicous users could have exploited the fact that some Unicode
characters normalise to chevrons, which allowed specially-crafted
HTML to escape sanitization.

For Debian 11 bullseye, this problem has been fixed in version
1.9.1-2+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-html-sanitizer packages.

For the detailed security status of python-html-sanitizer please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python-html-sanitizer>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# Arbitrary HTML present after sanitization because of unicode normalization

High

[matthiask](/matthiask)
published
GHSA-wvhx-q427-fgh3
May 5, 2024

## Package

pip

html-sanitizer
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<2.4.2

## Patched versions

2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

If using `keep_typographic_whitespace=False` (which is the default), the sanitizer normalizes unicode to the NFKC form at the end. Some unicode characters normalize to chevrons; this allows specially crafted HTML to escape sanitization.

### Patches

The problem has been fixed in 2.4.2.

### Workarounds

Set `keep_typographic_whitespace=True` explicitly, or normalize to NFKC yourself earlier.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-34078

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
