# Arbitrary HTML present after sanitization because of unicode normalization

High

[matthiask](/matthiask)
published
GHSA-wvhx-q427-fgh3
May 5, 2024

## Package

pip

html-sanitizer
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<2.4.2

## Patched versions

2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

If using `keep_typographic_whitespace=False` (which is the default), the sanitizer normalizes unicode to the NFKC form at the end. Some unicode characters normalize to chevrons; this allows specially crafted HTML to escape sanitization.

### Patches

The problem has been fixed in 2.4.2.

### Workarounds

Set `keep_typographic_whitespace=True` explicitly, or normalize to NFKC yourself earlier.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-34078

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
