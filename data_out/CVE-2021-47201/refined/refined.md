The provided content contains multiple commits that address the same vulnerability, and they all describe the same issue.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by incorrect order of function calls in `iavf_disable_vf()`. The `iavf_free_queues()` function clears `adapter->num_active_queues`, which is relied upon by `iavf_free_q_vectors()`. Calling `iavf_free_queues()` before `iavf_free_q_vectors()` leads to issues during resource cleanup.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect resource cleanup order.
- Potential use-after-free when accessing queues after they have been freed and their related vector data is accessed.
- Race conditions when the interface is disabled and later re-enabled during PF communication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel panic can occur when disabling the interface and then bringing it up after PF communication is restored.
- The system could become unstable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Disabling and re-enabling the network interface in a specific way.
- Requires interaction with the network subsystem.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Need to be able to control the network interface state.
- Requires administrative privileges or the ability to trigger the network interface disabling/enabling process.
