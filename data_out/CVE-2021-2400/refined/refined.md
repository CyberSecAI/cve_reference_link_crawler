{
  "CVE-2021-2400": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability exists within the SAXParser endpoint, which listens on TCP port 9502 by default. Due to the improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references, a crafted document specifying a URI causes the XML parser to access the URI and embed the contents back into the XML document for further processing. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose information in the context of the service account.",
    "Root cause": "Improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "XML External Entity (XXE) injection"
    ],
    "Impact": "Information disclosure in the context of the service account.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted XML documents with XXE references to the SAXParser endpoint over the network. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."
