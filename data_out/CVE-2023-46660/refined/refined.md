Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-46660:

**CVE-2023-46660**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** Zanata Plugin for Jenkins
*   **Affected Versions:** 0.6 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin uses a non-constant time comparison when checking if the provided and expected webhook token hashes are equal.
*   **Weakness:**  The use of non-constant time comparison for sensitive data such as webhook tokens.
*   **Impact:** This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods (timing attacks) to obtain a valid webhook token by observing the time it takes for the comparison to execute.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker would need to send multiple requests with varying tokens and analyze the response times.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication. However, they need to be able to send requests to the webhook endpoint.

**Additional Notes**
*   There is no fix available for this vulnerability as of the advisory publication date.
* The severity is rated as Low with a CVSS score of 3.1 AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
