| Stored XSS in Online Blood Bank Management System V1.0Affected Product Online Blood Bank Management System Vendor Homepage <https://itsourcecode.com/free-projects/php-project/online-blood-bank-management-system-in-php-with-source-code/> Affected files/Files used in the Attack /bloodbank/signup.php /bloodbank/register.php /admin/bloodbank/user.php Version 1.0 Vulnerable Software <https://itsourcecode.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blood-Bank-Management-System-in-Php-with-Source-Code-1.zip> Requirements Authentication: None is required to perform attack. Additional Items Escalation of Privileges/Account Takeover may possible via Cookie Stealing. A working payload is still being developed, but retrieving the cookie for the admin user may be possible via XSS and can be utilized by the low level user to escalate privileges. Problem Cross-Site Scripting (Stored) Root Cause A Stored Cross Site Scripting vulnerability was identified in the User Registration (signup.php) of the 'Online Blood Bank Management System' project, that affects both the 'register.php' and /admin/user.php application components. Malicious code can be injected within both the 'user' parameter due to improper sanitization, filtering, sanitization and implementation of other XSS prevention mechanisms. Impact Attackers can exploit this to achieve account takeover and obtain a session as the administrative user or other users of the application. Description In Version 1.0 of the Online Blood Bank Management application, A Stored Cross Site Scripting vulnerability was identified in the User Registration (signup.php) of the 'Online Blood Bank Management System' project, that affects both the 'register.php' and /admin/user.php application components. Malicious code can be injected within both the 'user' parameter due to improper sanitization, filtering, sanitization and implementation of other XSS prevention mechanisms.

Any input that fails validation requirements should be rejected; not sanitized. All user input should be HTML-encoded at any point where it is copied into an application’s response. Any HTML metacharacters (< > “ ‘ and = ) should be replaced with the corresponding HTML entities (< > etc.) In the case where the application’s intended functionality allows users to author content using restricted subsets of HTML tags and attributes, it would be necessary to parse user-supplied HTML to validate there is no dangerous syntax being used. |
