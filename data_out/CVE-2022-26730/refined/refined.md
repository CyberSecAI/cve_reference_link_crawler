- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A memory corruption issue existed in the processing of ICC profiles.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory corruption due to improper input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Processing a maliciously crafted image (ICC profile) may lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** By processing a specially crafted ICC profile image.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to have the ability to get a user to process a malicious image, or inject it into an application that automatically does so.
