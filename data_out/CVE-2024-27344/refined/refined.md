- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of PDF files within Kofax Power PDF. This lack of validation leads to a memory corruption condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory corruption vulnerability due to improper input validation during PDF parsing.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running Kofax Power PDF.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit this by enticing a user to open a specially crafted malicious PDF file or visit a malicious page that triggers the parsing of the malformed PDF.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PDF file to the victim and needs the victim to interact with it (open the file or visit the malicious page).
