- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of input validation and sanitization of the `id` GET parameter in multiple PHP web pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability due to unsanitized input being directly passed to `exec()` calls, which leads to privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the device as the `root` user, bypassing the firmware's restricted access to the `root` account.
- **Attack vectors:** Attacker needs to be authenticated to the web service to exploit the vulnerability. They can then manipulate the `id` GET parameter in vulnerable web pages to inject shell commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a web-authenticated user of the Aztech WMB250AC Wireless Mesh Router.
