The provided content is related to CVE-2022-3477.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The tagDiv Composer plugin's Facebook login feature does not properly implement authentication, allowing unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Authentication bypass: The plugin allows unauthenticated users to log in as any user if they know the user's email address, due to improper implementation of the Facebook login feature.
- Lack of proper session management: It appears that after the initial login, there is no robust session management in place to prevent unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Account takeover: An attacker can log in as any user, including administrators, by simply knowing their email address.
- Full control over the site: If the attacker takes over an administrator account, they can perform any administrative actions, leading to complete compromise of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attacker sends a POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action=td_ajax_fb_login_user` parameter and the target user's email address.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. They only need to be able to send an HTTP POST request to the target WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to know the email address of the user they want to impersonate.
