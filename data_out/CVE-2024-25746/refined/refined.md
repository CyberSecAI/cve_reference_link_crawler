- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the "add_white_node" function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The function reads a user-provided parameter "domain" without any length checks before passing it to a buffer, which allows for a stack buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute a denial of service attack or remote code execution (RCE) by sending crafted overflow data.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the page handling the "add_white_node" function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable device to exploit this issue.
