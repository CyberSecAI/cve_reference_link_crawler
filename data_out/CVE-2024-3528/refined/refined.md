Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `FirstRecord` parameter of the `units_view.php` file. Specifically, the application does not sanitize the input before using it in the web page's HTML.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: The application is susceptible to XSS attacks due to the failure to sanitize the `FirstRecord` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that can be executed in the context of the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact of a successful XSS attack can be significant. It allows attackers to:
    - Steal cookies and session tokens, potentially leading to account hijacking.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Display arbitrary content, such as phishing forms.
    - Download malware onto the user's system.
    - Deface the website.
    - Perform any action a user is authorized to do, within the context of the vulnerable web page.
- The attacker can harm both the users and the website's reputation.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects a malicious payload into the `FirstRecord` parameter of the `units_view.php` file. This parameter is likely part of a URL or form submission.
- Example payload from VulDB: `FirstRecord=1'"()&%<zzz><ScRiPt >alert(9432)</ScRiPt>`
- When a user accesses the page with the crafted payload in the `FirstRecord` parameter, the injected script is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL or form submission to include the malicious payload in the vulnerable `FirstRecord` parameter.
- No authentication is required, since the vulnerability is based on the lack of input sanitization before rendering it on the web page.
- The attacker can be remote and external to the system.
