###### SUMMARY

### OnCell G3150A-LTE Series Multiple Web Application Vulnerabilities and Security Enhancement

* Security Advisory ID: MPSA-234939
* Version: V1.0
* Release Date: Dec 29, 2023
* Reference:
  + [CVE-2004-2761 (MITRE)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2004-2761)
  + [CVE-2013-2566 (MITRE)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2013-2566)
  + [CVE-2016-2183 (Red Hat)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-2183)
  + [CVE-2023-6093 (Moxa)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6093)
  + [CVE-2023-6094 (Moxa)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6094)

The OnCell G3150A-LTE Series prior to version 1.3 is affected by multiple web application vulnerabilities: CVE-2004-2761, CVE-2013-2566, CVE-2016-2183, CVE-2023-6093, and CVE-2023-6094. These vulnerabilities are caused by applying weak cryptographic algorithms and cipher suites, and incorrectly restricts frame objects. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to unauthorized access and unexpected user interaction with the web application.

| Item | Vulnerability Type | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Cryptographic Issues (CWE-310)  CVE-2004-2761 | This vulnerability may make it easier for context-dependent attackers to conduct spoofing attacks. |
| 2 | Inadequate Encryption Strength (CWE-326)  CVE-2013-2566 | This vulnerability may make it easier for remote attackers to conduct plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of ciphertext in numerous sessions that use the same plaintext. |
| 3 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200)  CVE-2016-2183 | This vulnerability may make it easier for remote attackers to obtain cleartext data via a birthday attack against a long-duration encrypted session. |
| 4 | Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames (Clickjacking) (CWE-1021)  CVE-2023-6093 | This vulnerability may lead the attacker to trick the user into interacting with the application. |
| 5 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319)  CVE-2023-6094 | This vulnerability may lead the attacker to gain access to user accounts and access sensitive data used by the user accounts. |

**Vulnerability Scoring Details**

| **ID** | **CVSS** | **Vector** | **Severity** | **Remote Exploit without Auth?** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2004-2761 | 5.0 | AV:N/AC:L/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N | Medium | Yes |
| CVE-2013-2566 | 5.9 | AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N | Medium | Yes |
| CVE-2016-2183 | 7.5 | AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N | High | Yes |
| CVE-2023-6093 | 5.3 | AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N | Medium | Yes |
| CVE-2023-6094 | 5.3 | AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N | Medium | Yes |

| OnCell G3150A-LTE Series | Please contact Moxa Technical Support [for the security patch](/support/support/technical-support). |

**Mitigation**

Since Oncell G3150A-LTE has been phased out, we don’t have any plans to address CVE 2023-6093 and CVE-2023-6094. We recommend that users follow the mitigation measures below to deploy the product in an appropriate product security context.

Moxa recommends users to implement the following mitigations if necessary:

* Reduce network exposure by ensuring that all control system devices and systems are not accessible from the Internet.
* Place control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, isolating them from business networks.
* When remote access is necessary, employ secure methods such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). It is important to note that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be kept up to date with the latest available version. Remember that the security of a VPN depends on the security of its connected devices.

**Revision History:**

| VERSION | DESCRIPTION | RELEASE DATE |
