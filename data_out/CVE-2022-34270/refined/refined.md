{
  "CVE-2022-34270": {
    "Root cause": "The same Apache Axis service used for creating users via an authentication bypass can be used by regular users to create new users, including those with the Administrator role.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Privilege Escalation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated low-privileged user can escalate their privileges to that of an administrator, gaining full control over the application.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to be a low-privilege user who can access the vulnerable Apache Axis service.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must have valid user credentials to log into the application and obtain a session token, which can then be used to create a new admin user using the vulnerable Apache Axis service."
