This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of commands supplied by the user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to a device and submitting crafted input to the affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload spontaneously, resulting in a DoS condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ap-cli-dos-tc2EKEpu>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable software release:    + 6300 Series Embedded Services APs   + Aironet 1540 Series APs   + Aironet 1560 Series APs   + Aironet 1800 Series APs   + Aironet 2800 Series APs   + Aironet 3800 Series APs   + Aironet 4800 APs   + Catalyst 9100 APs   + Catalyst IW6300 Heavy Duty Series APs   + Integrated APs on 1100 Integrated Services Routers (ISRs) For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.
