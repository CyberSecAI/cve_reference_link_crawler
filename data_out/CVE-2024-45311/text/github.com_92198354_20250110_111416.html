# Denial of service in quinn-proto when using `Endpoint::retry()`

High

[djc](/djc)
published
GHSA-vr26-jcq5-fjj8
Sep 2, 2024

## Package

cargo

quinn-proto
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

0.11.0 - 0.11.6

## Patched versions

0.11.7

## Description

### Summary

As of quinn-proto 0.11, it is possible for a server to `accept()`, `retry()`, `refuse()`, or `ignore()` an `Incoming` connection. However, calling `retry()` on an unvalidated connection exposes the server to a likely panic in the following situations:

* Calling `refuse` or `ignore` on the resulting validated connection, if a duplicate initial packet is received
  + This issue can go undetected until a server's `refuse()`/`ignore()` code path is exercised, such as to stop a denial of service attack.
* Accepting when the initial packet for the resulting validated connection fails to decrypt or exhausts connection IDs, if a similar initial packet that successfully decrypts and doesn't exhaust connection IDs is received.
  + This issue can go undetected if clients are well-behaved.

The former situation was observed in a real application, while the latter is only theoretical.

### Details

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
