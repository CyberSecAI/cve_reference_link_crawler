- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses archives without properly validating the filenames within, making it vulnerable to path traversal via 'zip slip' attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') (CWE-22), specifically a 'zip slip' vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the target filesystem, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution and critical system impacts.
- **Attack vectors:** By providing tampered archives to be processed by the affected versions of Arc.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an administrator with the ability to provide tampered archives to the Arc application.
