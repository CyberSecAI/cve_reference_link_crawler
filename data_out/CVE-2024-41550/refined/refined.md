Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `view_invoice_items.php` file within the Supplier Management System v1.0.
- The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input passed via the `id` parameter in the URL, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** Specifically, the vulnerability is a SQL injection, where an attacker can insert arbitrary SQL queries into the database through the vulnerable parameter.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application lacks proper input sanitization or parameterized queries, which could prevent SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Leakage:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, including table names, column data, usernames, passwords, and other confidential information. In the example provided, the attacker extracts the database name.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** The attacker could potentially modify or delete sensitive data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database permissions, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `view_invoice_items.php` file.
- **URL parameter manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `id` URL parameter by injecting SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
- No special privileges are explicitly required to execute the attack since it's an injection vulnerability via the public interface
- Knowledge of SQL syntax is required to craft the malicious payloads.

**Technical Details:**

- **Vulnerable File:** `/Supply_Management_System/admin/view_invoice_items.php`
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id`
- **Example Payload:** `1' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--`
    - The `updatexml` function is used to trigger a specific error message that leaks the result of the `select database()` query.
    - The `--` comment ensures that the rest of the SQL query does not cause syntax errors.
- **Database Name (from Payload):** `sourcecodester_scm_new`
- The provided exploit payload demonstrates a method to exfiltrate the database name using `updatexml` error-based injection.
