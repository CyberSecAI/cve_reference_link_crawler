Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2020-36780.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a reference leak in the `sprd_i2c_master_xfer()` and `sprd_i2c_remove()` functions within the Spreadtrum I2C controller driver. Specifically, the `pm_runtime_get_sync()` function increments the power management (PM) reference count even when it fails. If the function returns an error after incrementing the counter, the reference is never decremented, leading to a resource leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A resource leak vulnerability exists due to incorrect handling of the PM reference count by using `pm_runtime_get_sync()` without corresponding `pm_runtime_put()` when it fails.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact of this vulnerability is a resource leak, specifically a PM reference count leak. Repeated calls to affected functions in error conditions could lead to resource exhaustion, potentially affecting the system's power management capabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through normal I2C operations that might trigger the error condition in `sprd_i2c_master_xfer()` or device removal that will trigger the error condition in `sprd_i2c_remove()`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would require the ability to interact with the I2C device to trigger the vulnerable code path. This could be through normal system operation or by controlling I2C transfers. The attacker needs to cause errors within the mentioned functions in order to cause the leak to occur, implying a need to control the target device via I2C.

**Additional details:**
- The fix replaces `pm_runtime_get_sync()` with `pm_runtime_resume_and_get()` to properly balance the PM usage counter.
- The fix was introduced in commit `3a4f326463117cee3adcb72999ca34a9aaafda93`.
- This issue was reported by "Hulk Robot" from Huawei.
