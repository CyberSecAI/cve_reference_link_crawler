Based on the provided text, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-20826:

**CVE-2024-20826: Implicit intent hijacking vulnerability in UPHelper library**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the use of implicit intents in the UPHelper library.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The UPHelper library uses implicit intents, which can be intercepted by malicious applications, allowing them to access sensitive information. This is an "implicit intent hijacking" vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Local attackers can exploit this vulnerability to access sensitive information.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device. The malicious application intercepts implicit intents sent by the vulnerable UPHelper library.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target device.
*  **Resolution:** The patch changes implicit intents to explicit intents, preventing hijacking.
