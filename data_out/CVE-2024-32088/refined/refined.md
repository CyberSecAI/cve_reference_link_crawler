  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress Coming Soon Page, Under Construction & Maintenance Mode by SeedProd plugin does not properly implement CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, will perform actions on the user's behalf.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into interacting with the malicious crafted request.  No special privileges on the target system are required, only knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint."
