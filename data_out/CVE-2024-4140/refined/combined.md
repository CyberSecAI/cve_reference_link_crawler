```
This is annoying!  It bugs me that making a mere 100,000 parts should lead
to excessive consumption of memory… but really, nobody does that for
a good reason.

This makes top-level (non-recursive) Email::MIME->new set a localized
part counter to 0 and increment before it makes new subpart objects.
If the counter exceeds the max, it will die early.

It would be better to work, but this is better than eating all memory and
crashing, right?

Put together with help from Marc Bradshaw.

Test forthcoming.

### **[carnil](/carnil)** commented [May 9, 2020](#issue-615111080)

| Hi,  We have the following bug reported to the Debian package of Email-MIME, c.f. <https://bugs.debian.org/960062>  ------8<-----------8<-----------8<-----------8<-----------8<-----  ``` Package: libemail-mime-perl Version: 1.946-1 Severity: important Tags: upstream  Messages with too many tiny MIME parts can OOM on split().  Messages with many nested MIME parts can also fail on deep recursion (Email::MIME->new calls ->subparts, ->subparts calls ->new, ad infinitum).  Smallish messages can generate these, since the a boundary only needs to be 4 bytes "--a\n" and the header+body of each part can just be 4 bytes "x:y\n\n", too.  Perl takes 42 bytes to represent a 4 byte string on 64-bit:  	use Devel::Size; say Devel::Size::total_size("--\n\n")  This affects many other MIME parsers, too.    ```  ------8<-----------8<-----------8<-----------8<-----------8<-----  Thanks for considering, Salvatore Bonaccorso, Debian Perl Group |

| Thanks, I had received a similar notice a few weeks ago and today set aside a little time to do something. I don't care for the fix that's now in master, but it puts a limit on things. I will make a release of this in the future and, if possible, make more systemic fixes. |

| [@rjbs](https://github.com/rjbs) Can you confirm that this got fixed/mitigated in this version?  ```         1.947 2020-05-09 14:30:06-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)         - add $Email::MIME::MAX_DEPTH and refuse to parse deeper than that many           parts; current default: 10  ```  As an Ubuntu "main" inclusion reviewer, I'm considering this package to enter Ubuntu's "main" component of the archive (5-10 years of support by the Ubuntu team). But this DoS issue could be a blocker for main inclusion. |

| Hi [@rjbs](https://github.com/rjbs)  I believe only part of this issue was resolved, namely, the deeply nested parts. Below is a proof of concept script which creates a ~40MB message with 10M tiny mime parts. On my test system (Ubuntu 23.10), it consumes the entire RAM (4GB) and SWAP (4GB) and is killed by OOM.  ``` use Email::MIME;  $asd = <<EOT; MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: multipart/alternative;     boundary=a  EOT $asd .= "--a\n" x 10000000; $asd .= "a--\n";  my $email = Email::MIME->new($asd); ```  The MIME parser uses around 1GB of RAM per 2MB of email message size. |

| The patch in [#80](https://github.com/rjbs/Email-MIME/pull/80) doesn't make me very happy, but solves this problem by dying early. Any thoughts before I ship it? (I'm going to look for a max number that seems safe. 100 was picked arbitrarily.) |

### @rjbs **[rjbs](/rjbs)** commented [Apr 23, 2024](#issue-2257679469)

This is annoying! It bugs me that making a mere 100,000 parts should lead to excessive consumption of memory… but really, nobody does that for a good reason.

This makes top-level (non-recursive) Email::MIME->new set a localized part counter to 0 and increment before it makes new subpart objects. If the counter exceeds the max, it will die early.

It would be better to work, but this is better than eating all memory and crashing, right?

Put together with help from Marc Bradshaw.

Test forthcoming.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2024-032e16360b
2024-05-25 01:04:07.908630
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : perl-Email-MIME
Product : Fedora 40
Version : 1.954
Release : 1.fc40
URL : <https://metacpan.org/release/Email-MIME>
Summary : Easy MIME message parsing
Description :
This is an extension of the Email::Simple module, to handle MIME
encoded messages. It takes a message as a string, splits it up
into its constituent parts, and allows you access to various
parts of the message. Headers are decoded from MIME encoding.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update, to the latest upstream release, addresses an excessive memory use
issue (CVE-2024-4140), which can cause denial of service when parsing multi-part
MIME messages; the fix is the new $MAX\_PARTS configuration, which limits how
many parts will be considered for parsing, defaulting to 100.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog:

\* Thu May 16 2024 Paul Howarth paul@city-fan.org - 1.954-1
- Update to 1.954 (rhbz#2280644)
- Fix for CVE-2024-4140: An excessive memory use issue (CWE-770) exists in
Email-MIME before version 1.954, which can cause denial of service when
parsing multipart MIME messages; the fix is the new $MAX\_PARTS
configuration, which limits how many parts we will consider parsing
(the default $MAX\_PARTS is 100)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
References:

[ 1 ] Bug #2280644 - Upgrade perl-Email-MIME to 1.954
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2280644>

This update can be installed with the "dnf" update program. Use
su -c 'dnf upgrade --advisory FEDORA-2024-032e16360b' at the command
line. For more information, refer to the dnf documentation available at

Subject: libemail-mime-perl: DoS on excessive or deeply nested parts
Date: Fri, 08 May 2020 21:58:27 +0000
```
Package: libemail-mime-perl
Version: 1.946-1
Severity: important
Tags: upstream

Messages with too many tiny MIME parts can OOM on split().

Messages with many nested MIME parts can also fail on deep
recursion (Email::MIME->new calls ->subparts, ->subparts calls
->new, ad infinitum).

Smallish messages can generate these, since the a boundary
only needs to be 4 bytes "--a\n" and the header+body of
each part can just be 4 bytes "x:y\n\n", too.

Perl takes 42 bytes to represent a 4 byte string on 64-bit:

	use Devel::Size; say Devel::Size::total_size("--\n\n")

This affects many other MIME parsers, too.

```

Hi,

I'm working on this package on Ubuntu, to promote it from universe to main.
I saw this bug, and it could be a blocker for that process. Reading the
changes files,
the following entry seems to be related (per the comments on
upstream's issue [1] too):

         1.947 2020-05-09 14:30:06-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
        - add $Email::MIME::MAX_DEPTH and refuse to parse deeper than that
many
          parts; current default: 10

Do you know, as maintainers, if this bug is fixed with that?  One of the
reviewers already asked upstream [1] to see if we can get a confirmation
from there.

Any clue is highly appreciated... thanks in advance.

Miriam (mirespace)

This has been answered in the upstream ticket now:
<https://github.com/msimerson/mail-dmarc/issues/216#issuecomment-1945033737>

Hence closing the bug (at the first version after 1.947 which was
uploaded to the Debian archive.)

As per
<https://github.com/rjbs/Email-MIME/issues/66#issuecomment-2024085120>
I'm reopening this issue. Let's consider it only as fixed once the
changes provided by rjbs are merged as well? Is that okay for you
Gregor?

Regards,
Salvatore

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2024-38fb541a75
2024-05-25 01:10:58.525326
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : perl-Email-MIME
Product : Fedora 39
Version : 1.954
Release : 1.fc39
URL : <https://metacpan.org/release/Email-MIME>
Summary : Easy MIME message parsing
Description :
This is an extension of the Email::Simple module, to handle MIME
encoded messages. It takes a message as a string, splits it up
into its constituent parts, and allows you access to various
parts of the message. Headers are decoded from MIME encoding.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update, to the latest upstream release, addresses an excessive memory use
issue (CVE-2024-4140), which can cause denial of service when parsing multi-part
MIME messages; the fix is the new $MAX\_PARTS configuration, which limits how
many parts will be considered for parsing, defaulting to 100.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog:

\* Thu May 16 2024 Paul Howarth paul@city-fan.org - 1.954-1
- Update to 1.954 (rhbz#2280644)
- Fix for CVE-2024-4140: An excessive memory use issue (CWE-770) exists in
Email-MIME before version 1.954, which can cause denial of service when
parsing multipart MIME messages; the fix is the new $MAX\_PARTS
configuration, which limits how many parts we will consider parsing
(the default $MAX\_PARTS is 100)
