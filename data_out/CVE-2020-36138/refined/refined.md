Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36138:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a logic error in the TIFF decoder within FFmpeg. Specifically, when decoding tiled TIFF images, the code was not correctly handling the presence of strip-related data, which led to a NULL pointer dereference and crash.  The issue was introduced by commit `da5b3d002862d1e105002a6dc1567e6551860896` and further exacerbated by  `33b6752a708f9afc2a99a86ff28a42803e52bc28`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** When a tiled TIFF image was processed with strip-related data, the initialization of the `stripdata` variable was skipped. Later, the code would try to dereference this uninitialized pointer, resulting in a crash.
- **Logic Error:** The core issue is a flaw in the conditional logic for handling tiled and striped TIFF images, which were not mutually exclusive within the code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Application Crash:** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability was a denial-of-service condition caused by the application crashing due to the NULL pointer dereference.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious TIFF File:** The vulnerability could be triggered by providing a specially crafted TIFF file to FFmpeg for processing. This file would need to contain characteristics that create a combination of tiled and strip data, which would then lead to the NULL pointer dereference in the code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to supply a crafted TIFF file to an application using the vulnerable FFmpeg library. No special privileges are necessary to exploit this flaw. The attacker would need to have the ability to provide an input file to the vulnerable application/library.

**Additional details:**
- The fix introduces a check to disallow both tiled and striped TIFFs, except for DNG files which have their own separate code path.
- The issue was found by a fuzzer, indicating it may not be a scenario that would be common in the wild, but is still exploitable given the correct TIFF input.
- A proof-of-concept (poc1) file that triggers the crash was provided in the ticket.
- The vulnerability is triggered in the `decode_frame` function within `libavcodec/tiff.c`
- The crash occurs due to a read memory access at address `0x000000000001` within the `bytestream_get_be32` function.
- The fix was implemented by checking if the input is a DNG image before erroring out.
