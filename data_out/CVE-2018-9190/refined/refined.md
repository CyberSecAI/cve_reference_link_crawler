- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A null pointer dereference exists in the NDIS Miniport drivers of FortiClient for Windows.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Null pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploitation leads to a denial of service (BSOD - Blue Screen of Death).
- **Attack vectors:**  An unprivileged local user can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have local access to the system where FortiClient is installed. They do not need administrative privileges.
