## Description

### Reporting channel

Bugcrowd

### Impact

It is possible to redirect the execution flow of the ClickHouse server process from an unauthenticated vector by sending a specially crafted request to the ClickHouse server native interface. This redirection is limited to what is available within a 256-byte range of memory at the time of execution, and no known remote code execution (RCE) code has been produced or exploited.

### Patches

For OSS users, fix has been backported to all current supported version listed in [security.md](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/SECURITY.md): v23.8.15.35-lts, v24.5.1.1763, v24.4.2.141-stable, v24.3.4.147-lts, v24.6.1.4423-stable

For ClickHouse Cloud users, all services are updated to the minimum patched version 24.2.

### Workarounds

ClickHouse recommends locking down native interface to trusted IP addresses only until the system is patched.
