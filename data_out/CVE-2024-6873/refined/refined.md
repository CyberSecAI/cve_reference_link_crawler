- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A specially crafted request sent to the ClickHouse server native interface can redirect the execution flow of the ClickHouse server process. This redirection is limited to a 256-byte memory range.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability allows for the redirection of the execution flow.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  The redirection is limited to what is available within a 256-byte range of memory at the time of execution. It can lead to undefined behavior which may lead to Remote Code Execution. There are no known RCE exploits developed so far.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted request to the ClickHouse server's native interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the native interface, which is an unauthenticated vector.
