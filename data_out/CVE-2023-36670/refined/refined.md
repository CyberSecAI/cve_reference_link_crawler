Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-36670:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a command injection flaw found in the Kratos NGC Indoor Unit (IDU).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The system allows the injection of arbitrary commands. This could be due to improper sanitization or validation of user-supplied inputs when executing system-level commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** The command injection vulnerability can be exploited remotely, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remotely Exploitable:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Kratos NGC IDU to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable Kratos NGC IDU over the network.
*   **No Specific Credentials Mentioned:** The advisory does not specify if any particular user account or authentication is needed for exploitation, implying that the vulnerability might be exploitable without authentication or with default credentials.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Product:** Kratos NGC Indoor Unit (NGC-IDU) version 9.1.0.4 is specifically mentioned as vulnerable.
*   **End-of-Life:** The affected version of the NGC IDU is end-of-life as of August 1st, 2023.
*   **Solution:** The recommended solution is to upgrade to the latest NGC IDU product which is the NGC2-IDU SW & HW Accessories, since the vulnerable version is EOL and not patched.
*  **Mitigation:**  Kratos suggests using good physical security of the ODU by locking the unit enclosure to prevent unauthorized access. The IDU should be installed on a trusted network, and access should be limited to authorized hosts using iptables/firewall.
*   **Credit:** The vulnerability was discovered by Paul Noalhyt from Red Balloon Security.

**Summary:**

CVE-2023-36670 is a high-severity vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the Kratos NGC Indoor Unit (IDU), specifically version 9.1.0.4. The product is EOL and it is recommended to upgrade to NGC2-IDU SW & HW Accessories.
