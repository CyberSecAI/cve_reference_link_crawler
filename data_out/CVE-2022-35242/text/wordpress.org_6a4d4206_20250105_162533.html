Totally love it. When are you launching Windows Mobile app? Some of my sales persons are using Nokia Lumia phones and we really need them.
By the way, we upgraded at 59sec PRO and we are very happy as well.

Best feature on wordpres for a guy that wants to make some sales. Indeed, is ideal for companies with several sales agents, but even for small sites, like mine, is GREAT. üôÇ You should promote yourself more!

I used 59sec lite for an ecommerce site I did for a client of mine. Even if it helps less when it comes to ecommerce for leads, it‚Äôs very usefull to answer questions that leads to purchase. I like it.
