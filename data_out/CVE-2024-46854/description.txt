In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dpaa: Pad packets to ETH_ZLEN

When sending packets under 60 bytes, up to three bytes of the buffer
following the data may be leaked. Avoid this by extending all packets to
ETH_ZLEN, ensuring nothing is leaked in the padding. This bug can be
reproduced by running

	$ ping -s 11 destination
