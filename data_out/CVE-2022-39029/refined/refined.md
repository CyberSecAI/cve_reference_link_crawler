- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authorization in the database query function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from inadequate authorization controls on the database query feature.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker, after logging in with a regular user account, can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to administrator's account credentials. This would lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, and control over the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attack through the application's database query function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires a valid regular user account to log in to the application remotely.
