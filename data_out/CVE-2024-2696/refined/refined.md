- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings, which will be executed when a user views the affected pages. This could lead to various malicious activities, like session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's settings page, specifically the "Swift Framework > Instagram Auth" and "Swift Framework > Google Maps Auth" settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator privileges to access and modify the plugin settings.
