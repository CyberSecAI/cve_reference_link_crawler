## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Swift Framework < 2024.04.30 - Admin+ Stored XSS via Settings

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

The fields in the "Swift Framework > Instagram Auth" and "Swift Framework > Google Maps Auth" on vulnerable to XSS.
1. Add the payload `"><script>alert(1)</script>` and save.
2. Reload the page and see the XSS.
