This vulnerability exists because UTD improperly handles certain packets as those packets egress an SD-WAN IPsec tunnel. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic through an SD-WAN IPsec tunnel that is configured on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.  **Note**: SD-WAN tunnels that are configured with Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) are not affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-utd-dos-hDATqxs>  This advisory is part of the September 2024 release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: September 2024 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75169).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software in controller mode, have UTD installed and enabled, and have SD-WAN tunnels configured to use IPsec:    + 1000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)   + Catalyst 8000v Edge Software   + Catalyst 8200 Series Edge Platforms   + Catalyst 8300 Series Edge Platforms   + Catalyst 8500L Edge Platforms   + Catalyst IR8300 Rugged Series Routers **Note:** UTD is not installed on these devices by default. If the UTD file is not installed, the device is not vulnerable.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine Whether Cisco IOS XE Software is in Controller Mode To determine whether the device is in controller mode or autonomous mode, use the **show platform software device-mode** command. If the output includes **Device Operating-mode**: **Controller-Managed**, the device is in controller mode, as shown in the following example:  ```   Router# show platform software device-mode   Device Operating-mode: Controller-Managed      Device-mode bootup status:    5/24 23:07:35 System is green      Router#      ``` Determine Whether UTD is Enabled To determine whether UTD is enabled on a device, use the **show utd engine standard status** command. If the output shows a **Yes** under **Running**, UTD is enabled, as shown in the following example. If there is no output, the device is not affected. For more information, see the [Install and Uninstall UTD Engine in SD-WAN with CLI](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/sd-wan/218339-install-and-uninstall-utd-engine-in-sd-w.html) guide.  ```   Router# show utd engine standard status Engine version       : 1.0.19_SV2.9.16.1_XE17.3Profile              : Cloud-LowSystem memory        :             Usage  : 6.00 %             Status : GreenNumber of engines    : 1   ```   ```   Engine        Running    Health     Reason    ===========================================Engine(#1):   Yes        Green      None=======================================================...   ``` Determine Whether an SD-WAN Tunnel is Configured to Use IPsec To determine whether an SD-WAN tunnel is configured to use IPsec, use the **show sdwan bfd sessions | include ipsec** command. If there is output, the device has an SD-WAN tunnel configured with IPsec. If there is no output, the device is not affected. The following example shows the output on a device that has an SD-WAN tunnel configured with IPsec:  ```   Router# show sdwan bfd sessions | include ipsec172.16.255.13 300 up mpls mpls 192.168.0.1 192.168.1.1 12366 ipsec 7 1000 0:00:02:50 0Router#   ```    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable    Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Catalyst SD-WAN Controller Software, formerly SD-WAN vSmart Controller Software   + Catalyst SD-WAN Manager Software, formerly SD-WAN vManage Software   + Catalyst SD-WAN Validator Software, formerly SD-WAN vBond Orchestrator Software   + Catalyst SD-WAN vEdge Cloud Routers   + Catalyst SD-WAN vEdge Series Routers   + IOS Software   + IOS XR Software   + Meraki products   + NX-OS Software  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, in environments where the UTD feature is not needed, customers can remove or disable the UTD feature to close the attack vector. For more information, see the [Install and Uninstall UTD Engine in SD-WAN with CLI](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/sd-wan/218339-install-and-uninstall-utd-engine-in-sd-w.html) guide.  While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads.
