- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because the Unified Threat Defense (UTD) component of Cisco IOS XE Software in controller mode improperly handles certain packets as they egress an SD-WAN IPsec tunnel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of specific packets by the UTD component when egressing an SD-WAN IPsec tunnel.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic through an SD-WAN IPsec tunnel configured on an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted traffic through an SD-WAN IPsec tunnel. They do not need authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
