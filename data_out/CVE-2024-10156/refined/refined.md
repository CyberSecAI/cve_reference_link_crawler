Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10156

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw found in the PHPGurukul Boat Booking System version 1.0.
*   It is located in the `/admin/index.php` file, specifically on the Sign In page.
*   The `username` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-89, which involves improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands.

**Root Cause:**

The application constructs an SQL query using the `username` parameter directly without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `username` input field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization/parameterization, making the application susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in the database, including user credentials, personal information, and other confidential details.
*   **Integrity:** The attacker could modify or delete data within the database, leading to data corruption or loss of data integrity.
*   **Availability:** The attacker could disrupt the normal operation of the application by causing errors or by making the database unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the login page located at `/admin/index.php`.
*   An attacker can manipulate the `username` parameter via a crafted input using HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the application.
*   No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker can be positioned remotely.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The provided GitHub link shows the usage of `sqlmap` to automate the exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability, demonstrating the ease of exploitation.
*   The attacker can intercept the login request, modify the `username` parameter with malicious SQL code, and then send the request.
*   The exploitation demonstrated through `sqlmap` can be used to extract database information, including usernames and password hashes.

**Summary**

The vulnerability is a critical SQL injection flaw in the login functionality of the PHPGurukul Boat Booking System. Due to the lack of proper input sanitization, it allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries leading to data breaches and system compromise.
