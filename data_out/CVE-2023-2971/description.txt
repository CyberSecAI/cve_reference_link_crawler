Improper path handling in Typora before 1.7.0-dev on Windows and Linux allows a crafted webpage to access local files and exfiltrate them to remote web servers via "typora://app/typemark/". This vulnerability can be exploited if a user opens a malicious markdown file in Typora, or copies text from a malicious webpage and paste it into Typora.
