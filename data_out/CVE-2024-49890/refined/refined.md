The provided content relates to the following CVE: CVE-2024-49890

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a potential null pointer dereference in the `init_overdrive_limits` function within the AMD GPU driver. The `fw_info` pointer, which is supposed to hold firmware information, can be null in some cases, leading to a crash when trying to access its members.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary weakness is the lack of a check to ensure that `fw_info` is not null before accessing its members (e.g., `fw_info->ucTableFormatRevision`). If `smu_atom_get_data_table` fails to retrieve the table, `fw_info` becomes a null pointer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** A null pointer dereference would cause the system to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered within the kernel driver related to AMD GPU power management when firmware information is missing or cannot be accessed.
- A local attacker could potentially trigger this by manipulating the system in a way that prevents the retrieval of the firmware data table, possibly through loading a corrupted firmware or by some other means which causes `smu_atom_get_data_table` to return null.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to manipulate the system such that the call to `smu_atom_get_data_table` returns a NULL pointer. This could potentially involve a local user with some control over the system or its firmware.

**Additional Details:**
The fix introduces a `PP_ASSERT_WITH_CODE` macro to check if `fw_info` is NULL. If it is, the function will return `-EINVAL` preventing the null dereference and system crash. This patch resolves the Coverity warning related to the null pointer dereference.
