- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The user account deactivation mechanism in ZITADEL did not correctly handle service accounts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Deactivated service accounts could still request tokens, allowing unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to applications and resources due to the ability of deactivated service accounts to obtain tokens.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks, exploiting the vulnerability through token requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs low privileges to exploit the vulnerability. No user interaction is required.
