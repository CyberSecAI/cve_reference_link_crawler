**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution by uploading malicious PHP files.
- Complete compromise of the affected web server
- Full access to the web server and all of the data it controls

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack through front-end forms with asset upload fields.
- Uploading a specially crafted PHP file that is disguised to bypass initial mime type checks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to have the ability to access and interact with front-end forms that have an asset upload field.
