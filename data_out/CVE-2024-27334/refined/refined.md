  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the parsing of JPG files within Kofax Power PDF. Specifically, the issue arises from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data when processing JPG files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information. Additionally, it can potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious JPG file or visiting a malicious page containing a malicious JPG file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious JPG file and have the target user open it or visit a page containing it. User interaction is required."
