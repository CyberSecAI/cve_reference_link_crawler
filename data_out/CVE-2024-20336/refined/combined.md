In order to exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials for the device.  For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sb-wap-multi-85G83CRB>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected all Cisco Small Business 100, 300, and 500 Series Wireless APs and firmware releases.  See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2024-20335: Cisco Small Business 100, 300, and 500 Series Wireless APs Command Injection Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 100, 300, and 500 Series Wireless APs could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform command injection attacks against an affected device. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials for the device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the *root* user on the underlying operating system.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwi78254](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwi78254), [CSCwi78271](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwi78271), [CSCwi78277](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwi78277), [CSCwi83948](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwi83948)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20335Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 6.5CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N  **CVE-2024-20336: Cisco Small Business 100, 300, and 500 Series Wireless APs Buffer Overflow Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based user interface of Cisco Small Business 100, 300, and 500 Series Wireless APs could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform buffer overflow attacks against an affected device. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials for the device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input.
