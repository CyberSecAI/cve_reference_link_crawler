Prevent int underflow when parsing exponents

```
When parsing negative exponents, the current implementation takes
precautions for |exp| to not underflow int.

But that is not sufficient: later on [1], |exp + expFrac| is also
stored to an int - so we must ensure that the sum stays within int
representable values.

Update the exp clamping logic to take expFrac into account.

Prevent int underflow when parsing exponents

```
When parsing negative exponents, the current implementation takes
precautions for |exp| to not underflow int.

But that is not sufficient: later on [1], |exp + expFrac| is also
stored to an int - so we must ensure that the sum stays within int
representable values.

Update the exp clamping logic to take expFrac into account.
