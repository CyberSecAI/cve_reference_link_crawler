Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the direct inclusion of the `page_id` GET parameter into the SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which arises from the lack of proper input validation. The code directly incorporates the user-supplied `page_id` parameter into the SQL query, allowing for manipulation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database by manipulating the `page_id` parameter. In the example provided, an attacker uses `extractvalue` to extract the database name, which confirms the vulnerability. This can lead to:
    - Data theft (accessing sensitive user data, etc.)
    - Data modification (changing or deleting data)
    - Data deletion
    - Potential complete compromise of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**

-   The attack vector is through a GET request to the `artical_edit.php` script by manipulating the `page_id` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application, specifically `artical_edit.php`, and the ability to craft SQL injection payloads. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
