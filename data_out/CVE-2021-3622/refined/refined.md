  "vulnerability_data": {
    "CVE-2021-3622": {
      "status": "relevant",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a recursive call to the `_get_children()` function in the `hivex` library when processing a specially crafted Windows Registry hive file. The `ri` records in the hive can be nested arbitrarily, and a deeply nested structure can cause the function to recurse excessively, leading to a stack overflow.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Unrestricted recursion"
        ],
        "impact": "A stack overflow leading to a crash of the program utilizing the library, causing denial of service.",
        "attack_vectors": "An attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted Windows Registry (hive) file with deeply nested `ri` records to the `hivex` library for processing.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted hive file to the application using the vulnerable `hivex` library."
      },
        "additional_info": {
        "patch_info": "The fix involves limiting recursion depth in `_get_children()` function. A depth of 32 is set and if this limit is exceeded, the program will return an error instead of crashing." ,
        "real_world_impact": "Analysis of real world registry hives showed no depth exceeding 1, therefore, the fix is unlikely to affect real hives.",
        "severity": "The vulnerability was considered low severity as it only caused a crash in hivex and would not result in a crash in libguestfs, and user can always retry the operation",
        "affected_components": "The vulnerability exists within the `lib/node.c` file of the hivex library."
