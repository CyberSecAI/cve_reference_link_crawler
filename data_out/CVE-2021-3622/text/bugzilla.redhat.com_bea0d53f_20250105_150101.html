| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1975489#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-06-23 19:19:37 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in libhivex. A stack overflow occurs as the children of each listed node grows. This causes the _get_children function to continue calling until it eventually overflows the stack and causes the program to crash.  References:  <https://github.com/libguestfs/hivex/commit/771728218dac2fbf6997a7e53225e75a4c6b7255> <https://listman.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2021-August/msg00002.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1975489#c5)  Richard W.M.

Jones    2021-07-08 17:51:27 UTC  ``` So even without ASAN, the code recursively calls _get_children and it would cause a stack overflow.  Probably ASAN makes the stack frames a bit larger causing the error to happen with a smaller hive.  It appears to be a security issue similar in severity to the last one that was reported ([bug 1949687](show_bug.cgi?id=1949687 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-3504 hivex: Buffer overflow when provided invalid node key length")).   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1975489#c8)  Richard W.M. Jones    2021-07-08 18:08:44 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1799738](attachment.cgi?id=1799738&action=diff "0001-lib-node.c-Limit-recursion-in-ri-records-CVE-2021-36.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1799738&action=edit "0001-lib-node.c-Limit-recursion-in-ri-records-CVE-2021-36.patch") 0001-lib-node.c-Limit-recursion-in-ri-records-CVE-2021-36.patch  With this patch you will see an error like this instead of a crash:  \> ls hivex: _get_children: returning EINVAL because: ri-record nested to depth >= 32 ls: Invalid argument   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1975489#c9)  Richard W.M. Jones    2021-07-08 20:22:40 UTC  ``` FWIW I ran an instrumented version of hivex over a small collection of real registry hives that I keep, and none of them had depth > 1. So in my opinion this patch is unlikely to affect any real hives that we would encounter.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1975489#c11)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-07-09 08:50:36 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1975489#c7): > So even without ASAN, the code recursively calls _get_children > and it would cause a stack overflow.

Thanks for your comments and testing, Richard. I'd keep this flaw low severity, as it doesn't seem to have any direct impact on confidentiality/integrity, and only partial unavailability for the same reasons as the last one (i.e., the user can always retry the operation && a crash in hivex would not result in a crash in libguestfs).   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1975489#c17)  Richard W.M.
