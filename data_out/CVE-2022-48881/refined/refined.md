The provided content relates to a fix for a reference count leak in the `amd_pmc_probe` function within the Linux kernel. This commit is identified by the commit ID `ccb32e2be14271a60e9ba89c6d5660cc9998773c` in the upstream Linux kernel repository and was backported to stable branches with the commit ID `3944162821295993ec89992dec98ab6be6306cc0`.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability and the fix:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The function `pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot()` acquires a reference to a PCI device.
- The caller (`amd_pmc_probe` function) is expected to release this reference using `pci_dev_put()` when it no longer needs the device.
- The original code did not call `pci_dev_put()` on error paths within `amd_pmc_probe`, leading to a reference leak. Specifically, if `amd_pmc_s2d_init()` returned an error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**
- Reference count leak of a PCI device object.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Repeated errors in the `amd_pmc_s2d_init` function can cause the reference count to leak, leading to a memory leak.
- Over time, this could result in memory exhaustion or other undefined behavior due to resource leaks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The issue is triggered when `amd_pmc_s2d_init` fails. Therefore, there isn't a direct attack vector in the sense that an attacker actively exploits a vulnerability. However, if a condition leads to errors in `amd_pmc_s2d_init` this issue would be triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No specific attacker capabilities or positions are required beyond running a Linux system on AMD hardware with the affected drivers. It is more about a specific configuration or failure causing the code to take a specific execution path.

**Fix:**
- The fix adds a call to `pci_dev_put()` in the error path using `goto err_pci_dev_put` to ensure the PCI device reference is released correctly when an error occurs in `amd_pmc_s2d_init()`. This prevents the memory leak.
