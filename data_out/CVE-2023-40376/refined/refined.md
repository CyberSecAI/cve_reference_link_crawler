- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authentication controls in IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate authentication mechanisms allow authenticated users to make unauthorized changes to environment templates.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can modify environment templates, potentially leading to unauthorized configuration changes, system instability, or security breaches.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated user with access to UCD.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a valid, authenticated user of IBM UrbanCode Deploy.
