- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A DLL hijacking vulnerability exists in Siemens Software Center (SSC) due to an uncontrolled search path element. The application loads DLLs from directories where a local attacker can place malicious DLLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is classified as CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element, indicating that the software does not properly control the directories searched for DLL files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker places a malicious DLL in one of the directories on the DLL search path that is used by the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the machine where Siemens Software Center is installed. They need the ability to place files in directories where the application searches for DLLs.
