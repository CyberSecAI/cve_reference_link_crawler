- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. This is a classic OS Command Injection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The FortiSandbox software fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing OS commands. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands into the operating system.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable via the command line interface (CLI).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs a super-admin profile and CLI access to the affected FortiSandbox system.
