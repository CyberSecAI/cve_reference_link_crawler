Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Dell Alienware Command Center (AWCC) software contains a deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability. Specifically, the application's .NET Remoting server is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The AWCC software improperly handles deserialization of data, allowing a malicious user to inject specially crafted data. This vulnerability lies within the .NET Remoting server.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A local malicious user can send crafted requests to the .NET Remoting server to execute arbitrary code on the system. This implies complete control over the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack is local, meaning the attacker needs to have access to the system where AWCC is installed.
*   **.NET Remoting Server:** The attack vector involves sending specially crafted requests to the .NET Remoting server component of the AWCC software.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the target system with the vulnerable Alienware Command Center software installed.
*   **Malicious User:** The attacker must be a malicious user capable of sending specially crafted requests to the vulnerable service.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects versions of Alienware Command Center prior to 5.5.51.0.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.8, with the vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
*   **Remediation:** Dell has released version 5.5.51.0 or later of the Alienware Command Center to address this vulnerability.
*   **Acknowledgement:** Dell acknowledges Matt Hand for reporting the issue.
