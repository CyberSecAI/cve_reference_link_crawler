There are several ways to pass dag\_ids in the request - via args via kwargs, or via form requests or via json. If you pass several of those, they should all be the same.

Subject: CVE-2023-48291: Apache Airflow: Improper access control to DAG
 resources

Severity: moderate

Affected versions:

- Apache Airflow before 2.8.0

Description:

Apache Airflow, in versions prior to 2.8.0, contains a security vulnerability that allows an authenticated user with limited access to some DAGs, to craft a request that could give the user write access to various DAG resources for DAGs that the user had no access to, thus, enabling the user to clear DAGs they shouldn't.

This is a missing fix for CVE-2023-42792 in Apache Airflow 2.7.2

Users of Apache Airflow are strongly advised to upgrade to version 2.8.0 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability.
