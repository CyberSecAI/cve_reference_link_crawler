Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35237:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of authorization checks within the MIT IdentiBot Discord bot. Specifically, the bot did not verify if a server was authorized before allowing users to execute slash and user commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The core weakness is the absence of proper server authorization checks before executing commands like `/kerbid` and `/resetnick` and their corresponding user commands.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve sensitive information about other users who have verified their affiliation with MIT through IdentiBot.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers could use the vulnerability to reveal the full name and potentially other information of MIT-affiliated users who have verified with IdentiBot.
*   **Privacy Violation:** Unauthorized access to user information can lead to privacy violations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Discord Server Invitation:** An attacker could add a vulnerable instance of IdentiBot to any Discord server they control.
*   **Command Execution:** The attacker could then execute the vulnerable commands (e.g., `/kerbid`) within their server targeting any user that has verified with the bot.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Discord User Account:** The attacker needs a Discord account.
*   **Ability to Add Bot to Server:** The attacker needs the ability to add a Discord bot to a server they control.
*   **Knowledge of Bot Commands:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable bot commands (e.g., `/kerbid`).

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability is present in instances of IdentiBot that are tied to "public" Discord applications, where users other than the API access registrant can add it to servers.
* The fix was implemented by adding an authorization check to the bot commands before allowing execution.
* The fix is implemented in commit `48e3e5e7ead6777fa75d57c7711c8e55b501c24e` and is present in versions after this commit.
