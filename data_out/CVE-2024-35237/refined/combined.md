## Package

IdentiBot Bot Interaction Subsystem

## Affected versions

edge (commits up to 7e7d7094)

## Patched versions

edge (commits beginning with 48e3e5e7)

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability impacts all users who have performed verification with an instance of MIT IdentiBot that meets the following conditions:

* The instance of IdentiBot is tied to a "public" Discord application—i.e., users other than the API access registrant can add it to servers; *and*
* The instance has not yet been patched.

### Patches

The latest version of MIT IdentiBot contains a patch for this vulnerability (implemented in [48e3e5e](https://github.com/ZelnickB/mit-identibot/commit/48e3e5e7ead6777fa75d57c7711c8e55b501c24e)).

### Workarounds

There is no way to prevent exploitation of the vulnerability without the patch. **To prevent exploitation of the vulnerability, all vulnerable instances of IdentiBot should be taken offline until they have been updated.**

### Detailed Description

IdentiBot does not check that a server is authorized before allowing members to execute slash and user commands in that server. As a result, any user can join IdentiBot to their server and then use commands (e.g., `/kerbid`) to reveal the full name and other information about a Discord user who has verified their affiliation with MIT using IdentiBot.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
