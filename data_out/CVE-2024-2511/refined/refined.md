Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2511:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how OpenSSL handles session caching in TLSv1.3 when the `SSL_OP_NO_TICKET` option is enabled and early data is not used. Specifically:
1.  When a new session object is created for each ticket sent in TLSv1.3, it duplicates the original session.
2. If `SSL_OP_NO_TICKET` is used, the new session is added to the cache.
3. If early data is not used, multiple threads can resume the same session concurrently.
4. If a thread encounters an issue, the original session may be marked as not resumable.
5. The "not resumable" status is incorrectly copied to the new session object, which is then still added to the session cache.
6. Another bug sets the `session_id_length` to 0 for sessions marked as "not resumable" even when they are in the cache.
7. Sessions with a `session_id_length` of 0 cannot be removed from the cache, leading to unbounded cache growth.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Session Duplication:** The "not resumable" flag is copied during session duplication, which should not occur.
*   **Incorrect `session_id_length` Handling:** Setting `session_id_length` to 0 for "not resumable" sessions prevents their removal from the cache.
*   **Unbounded Session Cache Growth:** The combination of the above flaws leads to the session cache growing indefinitely, consuming memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious client can trigger unbounded memory growth by exploiting the flawed session handling, leading to a denial of service by exhausting server resources. This can happen intentionally or due to normal operation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A malicious client establishing TLSv1.3 connections with a server configured with `SSL_OP_NO_TICKET` (and early data not used). The client can trigger the creation of many "not resumable" session objects to fill the cache.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a TLS client capable of initiating TLSv1.3 connections with a vulnerable server.
*   The server must be configured with `SSL_OP_NO_TICKET` and not use early data.

**Additional Notes**

* The vulnerability only affects TLS servers and not clients.
*  The FIPS modules and OpenSSL 1.0.2 are not affected.
*  OpenSSL versions 3.2, 3.1, 3.0 and 1.1.1 are vulnerable.
* The fix involves preventing the caching of non-resumable sessions and ensuring the `session_id_length` is correctly managed.
*  The issue has been fixed in OpenSSL versions 3.2.2, 3.1.6, 3.0.14 and 1.1.1y
