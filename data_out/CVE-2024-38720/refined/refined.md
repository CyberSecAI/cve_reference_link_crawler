- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The EazyDocs plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to inject scripts that can redirect users, display advertisements, or execute other malicious HTML payloads on the affected website.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts into the website, which are then executed when other users visit the site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to have Contributor level privileges.
