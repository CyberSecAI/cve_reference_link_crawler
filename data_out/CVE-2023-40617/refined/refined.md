- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `file` parameter of the `displayPDF.php` script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the web browser of a user. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or phishing.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL with a script payload in the `file` parameter, an attacker can trick a user into visiting the link and triggering the XSS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL. They do not need to be on the same network.
