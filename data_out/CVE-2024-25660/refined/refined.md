- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WebDAV service in Infinera TNMS 19.10.3 operates with unnecessary privileges, allowing low-privileged users to perform unauthorized file operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - The WebDAV service is exposed by default on a specific endpoint.
    - The service is protected by Basic Authentication, but even users with minimal privileges can access it.
    - Once logged in, a user can perform any type of file operation.
    - The web-based interface of the WebDAV service runs on the same web server as TNMS.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can perform unauthorized file operations, potentially including:
    - Downloading malware onto the system.
    - Sending credentials to the attacker by deceiving a victim to interact with malicious HTML.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attacker leverages the WebDAV service's web-based interface, which runs on the same server as TNMS.
    - The attacker can upload malicious HTML pages.
    - The attacker deceives a victim to interact with the malicious HTML pages which can lead to unauthorized actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to have a user account with minimal privileges on TNMS.
    - The attacker must be able to access the WebDAV service over the network.
