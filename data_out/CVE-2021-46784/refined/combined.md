# SQUID-2021:7 Denial of Service in Gopher Processing

Critical

[yadij](/yadij)
published
GHSA-f5cp-6rh3-284w
Jun 17, 2022

## Package

Squid
(Squid)

## Affected versions

2.0-4.17, 5.0.1-5.5

## Patched versions

5.6

## Description

### Problem Description:

Due to improper buffer management Squid is vulnerable to a Denial of Service

attack when processing Gopher server responses.

---

### Severity:

This problem allows a remote server to perform Denial of Service when processing

Gopher responses.

CVSS Score of 9.8

<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:C/CR:X/IR:X/AR:H/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:N/MUI:X/MS:U/MC:X/MI:X/MA:H&version=3.1>

---

### Updated Packages:

#### This bug is fixed by Squid version 5.6.

In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable

releases can be found in our patch archives:

#### Squid 4:

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/SQUID-2021_7.patch>

#### Squid 5:

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v5/SQUID-2021_7.patch>

If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer

to the package vendor for availability information on updated

packages.

---

### Determining if your version is vulnerable:

All Squid-3.x up to and including 3.5.28 are vulnerable.

All Squid-4.x up to and including 4.17 are vulnerable.

All Squid-5.x up to and including 5.5 are vulnerable.

---

### Workaround:

Deny access to gopher:// resources by adding the following lines to the top of

squid.conf:

```
acl gopher proto gopher
http_access deny gopher

```

Please be mindful that removing port 70 from the Safe\_ports ACL definition is not

sufficient. A malicious actor may easily operate gopher servers on other ports.

---

### Contact details for the Squid project:

For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions

of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary

package vendor.

If you install and build Squid from the original Squid sources

then the squid-users@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list is your

primary support point. For subscription details see

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html>.

For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest STABLE release

the squid bugzilla database should be used

<http://bugs.squid-cache.org/>.

For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the

squid-bugs@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list. It's a closed

list (though anyone can post) and security related bug reports

are treated in confidence until the impact has been established.

---

### Credits:

This vulnerability was discovered and fixed by Joshua Rogers of Opera Software.

### Revision history:

2021-02-20 23:38:06 UTC Initial Report

2022-04-18 13:42:36 UTC Patch Released

Subject: Re: Squid Caching Proxy Security Audit: 55
 Vulnerabilities, 35 0days.

Hi Amos, oss-security,

I've added GHSA-543m-w2m2-g255 and CVE-2021-46784 for 'Cache Poisoning by
Large Stored Response Headers (With Bonus XSS)' and 'Assertion in Gopher
Response Handling' respectively: GHSA-543m-w2m2-g255 and CVE-2021-46784

However, for "Gopher Assertion Crash", GHSA-f5cp-6rh3-284w does not apply.
"Gopher Assertion Crash" concerns an assertion "assertion failed:
store.cc:832: "store_status == STORE_PENDING"" while GHSA-f5cp-6rh3-284w
concerns an assertion: "assertion failed: String.cc:172: "canGrowBy(len)""

To the best of my knowledge the former (without a current GHSA or CVE) is
unfixed.

Cheers,
Josh
