Hi all,

I've updated the page with the following IDs which may be used for tracking:

strlen(NULL) Crash Using Digest Authentication
        GHSA-254c-93q9-cp53

Assertion Due to 0 ESI 'when' Checking
        GHSA-4g88-277m-q89r

Assertion Using ESI's When Directive
        GHSA-4g88-277m-q89r

Stack Buffer Overflow in Digest Authentication
        GHSA-phqj-m8gv-cq4g

Buffer Underflow in ESI
        GHSA-wgvf-q977-9xjg

Cheers,
Josh
