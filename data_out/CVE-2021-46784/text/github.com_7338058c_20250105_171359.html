Critical

[yadij](/yadij)
published
GHSA-f5cp-6rh3-284w
Jun 17, 2022

## Package

Squid
(Squid)

## Affected versions

2.0-4.17, 5.0.1-5.5

## Patched versions

5.6

## Description

### Problem Description:

Due to improper buffer management Squid is vulnerable to a Denial of Service

attack when processing Gopher server responses.

---

### Severity:

This problem allows a remote server to perform Denial of Service when processing

Gopher responses.

CVSS Score of 9.8

<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:C/CR:X/IR:X/AR:H/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:N/MUI:X/MS:U/MC:X/MI:X/MA:H&version=3.1>

---

### Updated Packages:

#### This bug is fixed by Squid version 5.6.

In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable

releases can be found in our patch archives:

#### Squid 4:

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/SQUID-2021_7.patch>

#### Squid 5:

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v5/SQUID-2021_7.patch>

If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer

to the package vendor for availability information on updated

packages.

---

### Determining if your version is vulnerable:

All Squid-3.x up to and including 3.5.28 are vulnerable.

All Squid-4.x up to and including 4.17 are vulnerable.

All Squid-5.x up to and including 5.5 are vulnerable.

---

### Workaround:

Deny access to gopher:// resources by adding the following lines to the top of

squid.conf:

```
acl gopher proto gopher
http_access deny gopher

```

Please be mindful that removing port 70 from the Safe\_ports ACL definition is not

sufficient. A malicious actor may easily operate gopher servers on other ports.

---

### Contact details for the Squid project:

For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions

of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary
