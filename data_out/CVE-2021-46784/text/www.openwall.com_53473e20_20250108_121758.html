 Vulnerabilities, 35 0days.

Hi Amos, oss-security,

I've added GHSA-543m-w2m2-g255 and CVE-2021-46784 for 'Cache Poisoning by
Large Stored Response Headers (With Bonus XSS)' and 'Assertion in Gopher
Response Handling' respectively: GHSA-543m-w2m2-g255 and CVE-2021-46784

However, for "Gopher Assertion Crash", GHSA-f5cp-6rh3-284w does not apply.
"Gopher Assertion Crash" concerns an assertion "assertion failed:
store.cc:832: "store_status == STORE_PENDING"" while GHSA-f5cp-6rh3-284w
concerns an assertion: "assertion failed: String.cc:172: "canGrowBy(len)""

To the best of my knowledge the former (without a current GHSA or CVE) is
unfixed.

Cheers,
Josh
