```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses `sprintf` to format strings based on user-supplied parameters without proper bounds checking on the size of the user-supplied input, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-120)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary command execution on the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted network packet containing a sequence of commands to the vulnerable `DetranCLI` interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device and must have the credentials to access the `DetranCLI` interface."
