The provided content describes a vulnerability in Pagekit version 1.0.18, which can lead to remote code execution.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `downloadAction` and `updateAction` functions within `app/installer/src/Controller/UpdateController.php`. The `downloadAction` retrieves a file from a remote location, and the `updateAction` reads the downloaded file and calls the `SelfUpdater` function which includes a `requirements.php` file from the downloaded file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unvalidated remote file inclusion: The application fetches and includes a file from a remote source without proper sanitization or validation.
- Lack of integrity checks on the downloaded file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can craft a malicious zip file containing a modified `requirements.php` file with arbitrary PHP code, which will then be executed on the server, allowing for complete control of the system.
- Shell Access: The attacker could obtain shell access through the remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to send a POST request to the `/index.php/admin/system/update/download` endpoint with a URL pointing to the malicious zip file, followed by a POST request to the `/index.php/admin/system/update/update` endpoint to trigger the vulnerable code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and host a malicious zip file.
- The attacker needs to know the URL to the vulnerable endpoints.
- The attacker needs to know a valid CSRF token, possibly through a previous page visit.
