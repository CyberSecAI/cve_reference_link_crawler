*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper handling or validation of the `CI_JOB_TOKEN` leading to unauthorized session token generation.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a victim's GitLab session, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, and other malicious activities.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to possess a victim's `CI_JOB_TOKEN`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker must have a valid `CI_JOB_TOKEN` belonging to a victim user. User interaction is required.

**Summary:**
This vulnerability allows for the compromise of a user's session by leveraging a CI job token. An attacker in possession of a valid token can perform actions as the compromised user.
