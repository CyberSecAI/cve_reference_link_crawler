Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the handling of Doc objects within PDF-XChange Editor.
- Specific actions performed via JavaScript can trigger an out-of-bounds read, where the software attempts to read memory beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software reads memory outside the bounds of an allocated object.
- Information Disclosure: The out-of-bounds read can expose sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker can gain access to potentially sensitive information present in the memory of the application.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: Although the advisory does not mention arbitrary code execution directly, it states that an attacker could combine this vulnerability with others to potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attackers.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file or webpage.
- User interaction is required: the target must open the malicious PDF file or visit a malicious webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft malicious PDF files or webpages containing malicious JavaScript.
- No special privileges are required, but user interaction is a must.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in PDF-XChange Editor V9 (9.5.368) and V10 (10.0.1).
