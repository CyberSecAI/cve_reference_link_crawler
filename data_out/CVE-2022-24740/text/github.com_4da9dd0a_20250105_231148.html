# Sudden swap of user auth tokens

Moderate

[sneridagh](/sneridagh)
published
GHSA-cfhh-xgwq-5r67
Mar 14, 2022

## Package

npm

volto
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>14.0.0-alpha.5

## Patched versions

15.0.0-alpha.0

## Description

### Impact

Due to the usage of an outdated version of the react-cookie library, under the circumstances of given a server high load, it is possible that a user could get his/her auth cookie replaced with the auth cookie from another user, effectively giving him full access to the other users account and privileges. A proven exploit for this vulnerability does not exist, since the exact requisites for it to happen have not been fully clarified, and the attempts to reproduce it under testing conditions have been unsuccessful, but it still can happen randomly and unintentionally in the wild.

### Patches

The patch and fix is present in Volto 15.0.0-alpha.0 (or later). See PR: [#3051](https://github.com/plone/volto/pull/3051).

We recommend upgrading to the final release of Volto 15 as soon as possible if running an affected version.

See the upgrade guide <https://6-dev-docs.plone.org/volto/upgrade-guide/index.html#upgrading-to-volto-15-x-x>

### Workarounds

It is possible to create a fix by manually upgrading the react-cookie package to 4.1.1 and then overriding all Volto components that use this library as in [#3051](https://github.com/plone/volto/pull/3051). As this is substantial work, an update to the Volto 15 is recommended. The upgrade steps for going from Volto 14 to Volto 15 are quite easy and do not involve any complexity. Please take a look at the upgrade guide: <https://6-dev-docs.plone.org/volto/upgrade-guide/index.html#upgrading-to-volto-15-x-x>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
