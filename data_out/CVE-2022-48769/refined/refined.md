Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2022-48769.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the use of EFI v2.0 runtime services, specifically `QueryVariableInfo()`, on Apple x86 machines which were designed for EFI v1.10. The issue is that recent Macbook Pro machines crash when using variable services at runtime, specifically when `QueryVariableInfo()` is called. It was determined Apple machines did not implement the EFI v2.0 runtime services properly, even though they expose the upgraded EFI version number.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

The vulnerability lies in the Linux kernel's assumption that all systems reporting an EFI revision greater than v1.10 properly implement the v2.0 runtime services. In the case of Apple x86 machines, this is not true, leading to crashes when the kernel calls EFI v2.0 functions like `QueryVariableInfo()`. This leads to buggy firmware causing crashes when interacting with newer services.

**Impact of exploitation:**

The impact of this vulnerability is a system crash on Apple x86 machines when the Linux kernel attempts to use EFI v2.0 runtime services. This prevents the system from being used until a reboot.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector is the use of the Linux kernel EFI runtime services on Apple x86 machines. No specific attacker action is required, as the issue is triggered automatically during normal OS operation when variable services at runtime are called.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

No attacker is needed to trigger the bug, any user running a vulnerable linux kernel on an affected Apple x86 machine would experience the crash when the kernel attempts to use `QueryVariableInfo()`.
