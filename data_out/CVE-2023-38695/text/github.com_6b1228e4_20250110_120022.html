# Fix for insecure snapshot file names

Moderate

[simonsmith](/simonsmith)
published
GHSA-vxjg-hchx-cc4g
Jul 31, 2023

## Package

npm

@simonsmith/cypress-image-snapshot
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 8.0.1

## Patched versions

8.0.2

## Description

### Impact

It's possible for a user to pass a relative file path for the snapshot name and reach outside of the project directory into the machine running the test. Example:

```
  cy.get('h1').matchImageSnapshot('../../../ignore-relative-dirs')
```

The above will create an `ignore-relative-dirs.png` three levels up

### Patches

Fixed in `8.0.2`

### Workarounds

Validate all the existing uses of `matchImageSnapshot` to ensure correct use of the filename argument. Example:

```
    // snapshot name will be the test title
    cy.matchImageSnapshot();

    // snapshot name will be the name passed in
    cy.matchImageSnapshot('login');
```
