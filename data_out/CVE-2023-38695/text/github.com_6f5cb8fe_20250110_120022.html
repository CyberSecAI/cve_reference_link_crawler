| It seems that snapshot names are not sanitized .  I test something like :  ``` it('test / test name', () => {   cy.matchImageSnapshot() })  ```  and so it create a folder `test` , and a file  `test name` .  Can you please sanitize file names ? It seems ([here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/discussions/16005)) that cypress [use the library](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/packages/server/lib/screenshots.js#L9) [sanitize-filename](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-filename) . ( or better, use a hash as filename, so less names collision risk . And your are sure there is no strange chars )  also, I'm pretty sure it can destroy a system ... what happen if I name my test with path traversal ? something like : `../../../etc/password` .   ---   I tested it . And we can write any files on a developper computer .  ( not exactly with the same name I say before ... but I'll not tell it here ... in private if you want )  Please fix this, and create a [repository-security-advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories/publishing-a-repository-security-advisory) to tell people to update to a safe version |
