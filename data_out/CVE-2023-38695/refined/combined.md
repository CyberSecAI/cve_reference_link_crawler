This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

fix: sanitise snapshot filenames

```
Prevents potential for tests to create directories/images outside of the repository
root. Makes use of the Cypress screenshot path which has already been
sanitised

Fixes [#15](https://github.com/simonsmith/cypress-image-snapshot/issues/15)

| It seems that snapshot names are not sanitized .  I test something like :  ``` it('test / test name', () => {   cy.matchImageSnapshot() })  ```  and so it create a folder `test` , and a file  `test name` .  Can you please sanitize file names ? It seems ([here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/discussions/16005)) that cypress [use the library](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/packages/server/lib/screenshots.js#L9) [sanitize-filename](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-filename) . ( or better, use a hash as filename, so less names collision risk . And your are sure there is no strange chars )  also, I'm pretty sure it can destroy a system ... what happen if I name my test with path traversal ? something like : `../../../etc/password` .   ---   I tested it . And we can write any files on a developper computer .  ( not exactly with the same name I say before ... but I'll not tell it here ... in private if you want )  Please fix this, and create a [repository-security-advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories/publishing-a-repository-security-advisory) to tell people to update to a safe version |

# Fix for insecure snapshot file names

Moderate

[simonsmith](/simonsmith)
published
GHSA-vxjg-hchx-cc4g
Jul 31, 2023

## Package

npm

@simonsmith/cypress-image-snapshot
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 8.0.1

## Patched versions

8.0.2

## Description

### Impact

It's possible for a user to pass a relative file path for the snapshot name and reach outside of the project directory into the machine running the test. Example:

```
  cy.get('h1').matchImageSnapshot('../../../ignore-relative-dirs')
```

The above will create an `ignore-relative-dirs.png` three levels up

### Patches

Fixed in `8.0.2`

### Workarounds

Validate all the existing uses of `matchImageSnapshot` to ensure correct use of the filename argument. Example:

```
    // snapshot name will be the test title
    cy.matchImageSnapshot();

    // snapshot name will be the name passed in
    cy.matchImageSnapshot('login');
```
### References

[#15](https://github.com/simonsmith/cypress-image-snapshot/issues/15)
