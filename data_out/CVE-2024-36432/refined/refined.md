```
Root cause of vulnerability: Improper input validation in the Supermicro BIOS may allow arbitrary memory write which can be potentially exploited.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Arbitrary memory write

Impact of exploitation:  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to potentially hijack the control flow, allowing attackers with the kernel level privileges to escalate their privileges and potentially execute arbitrary code.

Attack vectors: The vulnerability resides in the BIOS firmware.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker would need to have the ability to manipulate the vulnerable input within the BIOS. The attacker would also need kernel level privileges to perform further escalation.
