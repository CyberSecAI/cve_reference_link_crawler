{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of SVG files during upload. The plugin uses a custom font functionality that allows users to upload custom fonts, and this feature doesn't properly sanitize the uploaded SVG files which enables injection of malicious scripts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
	   "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to execution of arbitrary web scripts in pages, whenever a user accesses an injected page. This can potentially lead to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "File upload functionality within the plugin settings"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Authenticated attacker with contributor level access or higher."
