## FAQ

### How to make icons animated?

Go to Settings>Fuse Social from the left side admin menu bar, then click on the Settings tab. Then click on Animation on hover, a text box will appear and then enter the value in seconds, like enter 0.5, and it will give the delay of 0.5 seconds in Animation.

### Don’t want shadow in icons?

In settings, simply check ” Don’t use shadow in icons.” by default, it’s unchecked.

Paid for this plugin over a month ago. Never got an email or license code. Have Emailed them on three separate occasions with zero response. Worthless…

I needed some time to figure out that it is this plugin that breaks the icon preview in the Avada 7 live editor. For development, I’m disabling the plugin now, but this issue should be fixed soon.

Plugin is loading icons from external resources. Using own svg files doesn’t give the same options to configure them.

Worked perfectly for what was required.
Free Version Works Very Well.
PRO version is 4mb so you might have to increase your upload capacity.
Would Recommend.
