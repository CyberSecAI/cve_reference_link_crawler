Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Detection Engine Search API in Kibana does not properly enforce Document-level Security (DLS) or Field-level Security (FLS) when querying the `.alerts-security.alerts-{space_id}` indices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is a broken access control mechanism, specifically the failure to apply DLS/FLS rules during API queries. This allows users to bypass access restrictions intended to limit visibility to certain documents or fields within documents.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Users with roles configured with DLS or FLS, who are authorized to use the Detection Engine Search API, can gain unauthorized access to documents and fields they should not be able to see. This could lead to exposure of sensitive security alert data.
*   The impact is primarily on confidentiality, as attackers could read information they should not have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Access:** The vulnerability is triggered by making requests to the Detection Engine Search API.
*   **Direct API calls:** API users are able to access the vulnerable route directly.
*   **Kibana UI:** Users using the KPI or group by feature on the alerts page are also affected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated Kibana user who is authorized to call the Detection Engine Search API.
*   **Role with DLS/FLS:** The user needs to have a role that has DLS or FLS configured for the `.alerts-security.alerts-{space_id}` indices.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Kibana 8.x versions prior to 8.12.1.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to Kibana version 8.12.1 or later, which contains the fix for this vulnerability.

**Severity:**
*   CVSSv3: 6.5 (Medium) - AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
