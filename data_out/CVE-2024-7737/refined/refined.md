Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-7737:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-7737

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Product:** 3DSwym in 3DSwymer

**Affected Versions:** From Release **3D**EXPERIENCE R2022x through Release **3D**EXPERIENCE R2024x

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser session. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing sensitive information
    - Defacing the application
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites

**Attack vectors:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a field or parameter within the 3DSwym application. This code is then stored and executed when a user views the affected content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application to inject the malicious script. This likely requires an account with sufficient permissions to post or edit content where the XSS vulnerability exists.
