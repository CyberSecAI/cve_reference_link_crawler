# Make the `/file` secure against file traversal attacks and SSRF

High

GHSA-6qm2-wpxq-7qh2
Dec 20, 2023

## Package

pip

gradio
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 4.11.0

## Patched versions

4.11.0

## Description

Older versions of `gradio` contained a vulnerability in the `/file` route which made them susceptible to file traversal attacks in which an attacker could access arbitrary files on a machine running a Gradio app with a public URL (e.g. if the demo was created with `share=True`, or on Hugging Face Spaces) if they knew the path of files to look for.

This was not possible through regular URLs passed into a browser, but it was possible through the use of programmatic tools such as `curl` with the `--pass-as-is` flag.

Furthermore, the `/file` route in Gradio apps also contained a vulnerability that made it possible to use it for SSRF attacks.

Both of these vulnerabilities have been fixed in `gradio==4.11.0`

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
