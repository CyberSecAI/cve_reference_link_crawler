        "content": "This document discusses the Nokia Service Router Operating System (SR OS), which is vulnerable to BGP route attribute parsing issues. The document describes the SR OS, its features, and its model-driven management capabilities. While it does not directly describe the vulnerability, it mentions the availability of updates and features to address the issue such as ‘error-handling update-fault-tolerance’."

It mentions a vulnerability related to BGP attribute handling that can cause BGP sessions to terminate, effectively creating a denial-of-service condition. The thread references the blog post, vendor responses, and mentions a patch from OpenBSD."

        "content": "This blog post details grave flaws in BGP error handling, stemming from how different routers interpret and handle corrupted or unknown BGP route attributes. Specifically, it mentions that Juniper, Nokia SR-OS, FRR (and its derivatives), and Extreme Networks routers are vulnerable when they receive a malformed BGP attribute. The vulnerability occurs because these routers, upon encountering a malformed attribute (often an unrecognized or corrupted one) shut down their BGP session instead of properly handling the malformed attribute by treating it as a route withdrawal according to RFC7606. This session shutdown can lead to network disruptions. The author created a fuzzer to identify these issues. It also includes vendor responses and workarounds to the mentioned vulnerabilities."

    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is the improper handling of malformed or unknown BGP route attributes. Instead of gracefully ignoring or treating them as a route withdrawal as per RFC 7606, some routers terminate the entire BGP session when encountering such attributes.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
         "Lack of adherence to RFC 7606",
        "Denial of service through session termination."
      ],
      "impact": "The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial of service. An attacker could craft a BGP update with a malformed attribute. This attribute could be propagated across networks that do not understand it. When it reaches a vulnerable device, the BGP session is terminated. This may cause loss of connectivity for users on the affected network.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafting and injecting malicious BGP updates into a network.",
        "Exploiting the propagation of BGP attributes across multiple networks.",
         "Targeting specific routers with a malformed update using transitive bit set attribute for propagation."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to inject BGP updates into the network, which typically means they need to have some sort of peering relationship with a network that is connected to the target. An attacker could be a rogue ISP or have compromised an existing network device."
