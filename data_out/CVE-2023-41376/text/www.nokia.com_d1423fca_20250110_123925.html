# Service Router Operating System (SR OS)

Rely on exceptional IP network performance with our proven router software

The Nokia Service Router Operating System (SR OS) is built to power the most demanding, dynamic and reliable Ethernet and IP/MPLS networks. This robust and scalable OS provides the foundation for our comprehensive portfolio of physical and virtualized routers. It has been proven in more than 2300 service provider, enterprise and webscale networks worldwide. SR OS supports a consistent, simplified and highly reliable IP network operating environment.

## Benefits and features

#### Unmatched capabilities, scale and performance

SR OS supports the industry’s most comprehensive suite of IP, MPLS and segment routing features.

Deployed in the field for more than a decade, it offers high-availability features such as non-stop routing and provides deterministic and scalable control plane performance through a 64-bit symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) architecture.

The SMP architecture uses a multi-thread software approach that provides the ability to concurrently schedule and run tasks on different processor cores. It unleashes the power and performance of multi-core processing to deliver unmatched scale and routing performance.

Multiple instance IS-IS and OSPF Segment Routing support the shortest path tunnel, SR-TE LSP, and static and BGP SR policy. The implementation provides LFA, remote LFA, and Topology-Independent LFA (TI-LFA) protection for all types of tunnels. PCEP allows the SR-TE LSP to be delegated to the Nokia NSP or a third-party PCE function.

#### Automation and model-driven management

Evolution towards automation and network programmability is driving the need for [model-driven management](https://www.nokia.com/networks/model-driven-management/). It is a critical enabler for increasing operational efficiency, simplification of repetitive tasks, and the resulting reduction in errors and costs of operating a network. Our [SR OS model-driven management capabilities](https://onestore.nokia.com/asset/207070) address this need with a comprehensive set of configuration and state data models designed for automation. The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) interface, gRPC Network Management Interface (gNMI) and model-driven command line interface (MD-CLI) leverage YANG models to provide a set of model-driven management interfaces with a common human- and machine-readable configuration and state syntax.

SR OS supports standards-based carrier SDN controllers and orchestration software through open APIs and protocols such as Border Gateway Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS) and Path Computation Element Communications Protocol (PCEP).

Our SR OS-based IP routing platforms use advanced push-based telemetry models to stream flow-level data and insights in near-real time. Big data analytics applications such as [Nokia Deepfield](https://www.nokia.com/networks/ip-networks/deepfield/) can convert this information into actionable intelligence. SDN control applications such as the [Nokia Network Services Platform (NSP)](https://www.nokia.com/networks/ip-networks/network-services-platform/) can use this intelligence for network flow optimization, defense and troubleshooting.

#### Exceptional services

To boost top-line revenues, service providers need the ability to deliver an ever-expanding portfolio of non-stop, value-added and differentiated services. SR OS addresses this need with unparalleled routing capabilities, including [extensive EVPN functionality](/networks/ethernet-vpn/) for IP-based mobile, residential and enterprise services. These capabilities include:

* [Broadband edge](/networks/broadband-edge/) and subscriber management; wireline [broadband network gateway (BNG)](/networks/ip-networks/multi-access-gateway/) and fixed-wireless access gateway (4G/LTE SPGW, 5G SMF/UPF)
* Provider Edge (PE) and cloud data center interconnect (DCI) gateway features for Carrier Ethernet and IP-based connectivity and cloud services
* Wi-Fi gateway, network address translation (NAT) and application awareness features for value-added services
* Highly scalable IP MPLS protocol support
* IPSec gateway features for secure mobile backhaul

#### High availability by design

Reliability is critical in high-performance IP networks. When network connections and traffic flows run at multi-gigabit speeds, a small disruption can impact thousands of end users and lead to customer dissatisfaction and contractual penalties. It can also jeopardize critical infrastructure operations, causing interruptions that could drive up costs or put people’s lives at risk.

We built SR OS to meet the reliability demands of a highly-available IP/MPLS environment. Its real-time, modular and fault-tolerant design provides clear separation of the control and forwarding planes as well as non-stop routing capabilities. These capabilities ensure that routing and related protocols are not affected if the control plane fails.

The advanced high-availability features of SR OS enable resilient IP network architectures. With in-service software upgrades (ISSU), network operators can update software on a live system without a network-impacting system reboot. The SR OS features also include multi-chassis link aggregation, multi-chassis automatic protection switching, multi-chassis ring protection and MPLS fast reroute.

#### One operating system for maximum efficiency

SR OS addresses the challenges presented by multiple networks, routing platforms and operating systems. It is supported on all Nokia IP router products, which include access and aggregation, IP edge and IP core hardware platforms, as well as virtualized IP software products. By using one operating system for all of our IP routers, we help service providers, enterprises and webscale companies ensure consistent and reliable operations and management across IP networks.
