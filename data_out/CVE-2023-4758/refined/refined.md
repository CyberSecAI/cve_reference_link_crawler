        "Maliciously crafted AVI file with specific header values"

      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to supply a crafted AVI file.",
	  "additional_details": "The vulnerability is located in the `avi_parse_input_file` function within the `src/media_tools/avilib.c` file. The code calculates the size of a memory allocation using a value from the AVI header (`bih.bi_size`). This value is retrieved from a 4 byte field, which is then converted to an unsigned long. An integer overflow can occur if the value from the header is sufficiently large. Due to the integer overflow, a small amount of memory is allocated, while the code still attempts to copy a much larger amount of data (of size `bih.bi_size`, which is not updated after the integer overflow) into the allocated memory, resulting in a heap buffer overflow. This vulnerability is present both when handling `BITMAPINFOHEADER`, and when processing `avisuperindex_chunk`."
