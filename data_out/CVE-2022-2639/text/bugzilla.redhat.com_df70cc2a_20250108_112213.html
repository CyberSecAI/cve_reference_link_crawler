| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2084479#c0)  TEJ RATHI    2022-05-12 08:43:51 UTC  ``` An OOB access flaw was discovered in reserve_sfa_size(). Given a sufficiently large number of actions, while copying and reserving memory for a new action of a new flow, if next_offset is greater than MAX_ACTIONS_BUFSIZE, the function reserve_sfa_size() does not return -EMSGSIZE as expected, but it allocates MAX_ACTIONS_BUFSIZE bytes increasing actions_len by req_size. This can then lead to an OOB write access, especially when further actions need to be copied.
