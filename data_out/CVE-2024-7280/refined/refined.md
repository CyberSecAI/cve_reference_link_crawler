Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the "Lot Reservation Management System".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the `/admin/view_reserved.php` URI is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Escalation of Privileges: Successful exploitation can lead to an escalation of privileges, potentially allowing an attacker to gain administrative control over the system by manipulating database records. The attacker can gain access to sensitive information stored in the database, including user credentials and other data, modify or delete data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability can be exploited via an HTTP GET request to the `/admin/view_reserved.php` endpoint.
- Parameter Manipulation: The `id` parameter within the URL is used as an injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
- HTTP Knowledge: The attacker should have knowledge of HTTP requests and parameter manipulation.
- SQL Knowledge: The attacker needs SQL knowledge to craft malicious queries.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information includes a `sqlmap` command and an example HTTP request, which can be used to confirm and exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the "Lot Reservation Management System," which is available on SourceCodester.

This analysis is based on the provided information and it appears to align with the nature of a SQL Injection vulnerability.
