  "CVE-2024-0030": {
    "description": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in `btif_to_bta_response` and `attp_build_value_cmd1`. The size of `p_src->attr_value.value` depends on `p_src->attr_value.len`. When copying `p_src->attr_value.value` to `p_dest->attr_value.value`, it always copies `GATT_MAX_ATTR_LEN` bytes. This can result in an out-of-bounds read in `p_src->attr_value.value`. Additionally, since `p_dest->attr_value.len` does not map the actual length of `p_dest->attr_value.value`, this can cause an out-of-bounds read in `attp_build_value_cmd`.",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect size handling during data copying operations in Bluetooth interface functions.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read in `btif_to_bta_response` when copying attribute values.",
      "Out-of-bounds read in `attp_build_value_cmd` due to inconsistent length mapping."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker may be able to read sensitive data from the device's memory.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is present in the Bluetooth stack, so a nearby attacker with the ability to interact with the vulnerable Bluetooth functions may be able to trigger this vulnerability.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range and able to send crafted Bluetooth requests to the vulnerable device."
