### Description

The Freemius SDK, as used by hundreds of WordPress plugin and theme developers, was vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery and Information disclosure due to missing capability checks and nonce protection on the \_get\_debug\_log, \_get\_db\_option, and the \_set\_db\_option functions in versions up to, and including 2.4.2. Any WordPress plugin or theme running a version of Freemius less than 2.4.3 is vulnerable.

Wordfence blocked **165 attacks** targeting this vulnerability in the past 24 hours.

# Managing Security Issues in an Open Source Ecosystem — Freemius SDK Security Disclosure

Running a startup is a rollercoaster. And like any good rollercoaster, there’ll be peaks, troughs, and curves that throw you for a loop along the way. During the last two weeks, we’ve been riding downhill, strategizing and executing the development and distribution of a security patch for our WordPress SDK. What was supposed to be a smooth and discrete ‘ride’ turned into an unexpectedly bumpy one. For the sake of transparency, here’s everything you need to know about the latest security vulnerability in our WordPress SDK.

On February 9th, we received a report about potential security issues in our [WordPress SDK](https://github.com/Freemius/wordpress-sdk). After careful inspection of the code, we quickly confirmed that *some* of the issues were indeed valid and immediately followed up with the reporter to ask them to hold off on a public disclosure for 30 days. This would give our team enough time to patch it, distribute the patched release to all developers using our SDK, and give their users and customers enough time to update.

## The Planning

We learned a bunch of lessons from our [first security incident](/blog/sdk-security-vulnerability/) three years back. So before jumping right into patching the SDK, we had a strategy meeting to assess the severity of the issues and to plan ahead and coordinate how we were going to tackle it while minimizing exposure in the process.

Here’s the plan we came up with:

* Have all the reported issues reviewed by two different team members to make sure we weren’t missing anything.
* Unlike last time when we rushed to patch the SDK right on our public GitHub repo, this time we decided to create a private fork of the repository and patch it privately.
* Contain the exposure to only relevant people by only notifying developers who are *actively* using the SDK in their plugins and themes.
* As it’s the same reporter we dealt with last time, we learned it’s better to get into a ‘silent mode’ and keep interactions to a minimum — they disclosed the previous incident shortly after our patch without our knowledge and without following [Responsible Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) practices.
* Finally, push the patch to the public GitHub repo and publicly disclose the incident on March 9th under the assumption that the patch would have already propagated as several weeks should be enough for everyone involved to update.

We felt great about the plan! And established a squad of four team members for its execution.

## Execution

Everything was going as planned! The SDK was privately patched, we emailed only relevant developers about the issue along with the patched SDK, and also targeted the same group of developers by adding a special message in the Developer Dashboard.

![Developer Dashboard Security Update Message](https://freemius.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/developer-dashboard-security-update-message.png)

And then to our surprise, it happened again 🤦‍♂️

## The Unexpected (Ahead of Time) Disclosure

On Monday we received an email about a new ‘freemius’ search result picked up by Google Alerts. To our surprise, we discovered that almost immediately after developers started to patch their plugins/themes on WordPress.org, the reporter went ahead and publicly disclosed the incident in detail, without even letting us know (I intentionally don’t link to it — they don’t deserve the backlink).

Unlike last time, we didn’t even try to ask the reporter to remove the article as we’ve learned it’s a waste of time and our request can only backfire on us. Instead, we politely tried to understand the reasoning behind the unexpected disclosure to assess if/how we could avoid it in the future.

Here’s their justification:

*We noticed the fixes right away once plugin developers starting releasing updates. We are not the only ones that do that type of monitoring, so trying to cover up that you are making security fixes like this doesn’t work.*

Obviously, we agree that once updates are released onto WordPress.org the code is publicly available. But, it’s very different from publicly handing out the ‘recipe’ of the security issues to potential attackers, and that’s the point we simply can’t agree on with the reporter.

## Was There a Better Way to Manage This? 🤔

Because developers don’t have a private communication channel with their free WordPress.org users, they can’t notify them about security issues. Based on the reporter’s approach, they believe that reporting a vulnerability as soon as a patch is released — without giving any buffer time for users to update — is legit and the way to go.

We strongly feel that this approach once again does not follow responsible disclosure practices and hope that other WP security-related outlets don’t follow the same route. I believe the real reason behind rushing a public disclosure was about publishing a scoop before others, and not about caring for users.

This brings me to a question — as long as there are security ~~researchers~~ trolls out there, how the hack can developers with products on WordPress.org (or other public repositories that don’t offer a private communication channel with their users) distribute patched releases without exposing users who don’t immediately update?!

Thinking retrospectively, we could have slightly improved the process by splitting the notifications into two batches. First, only notify developers with paid products to go ahead and patch their paid releases, as those do have their customers’ emails. Next, and only in the second batch after a few days, message developers to update their free version on wp.org.

But even with those slight changes the moment the first plugin gets patched on wp.org the threat of an unexpected early disclosure is real. The only option I can think of is to somehow coordinate everyone to patch their products on the same day, but I’m not sure how realistic this is as we are talking about a lot of developers from all over the world.

Now that we’ve published the disclosure, let’s get down to the actual security issues and the involved risks.

## What Are the Potential Risks of the Security Issues?

After conducting a thorough security review of the reported issues, we discovered that all of the valid ones are minor, except for one that I’ll cover in detail below.

But before I get there, let’s start with reassurance.

The reported security issues are **not** weakening the security of WordPress websites. Meaning, **even if a website is running a non-patched SDK version, it does not make the site more vulnerable to attacks.**

> Even if a website is running a non-patched SDK version, it does not make the site more vulnerable to attacks.

The most ‘interesting’ reported issue allows WP logged-in users to turn the SDK’s debug mode on, which activates logging and can *potentially* expose some Freemius-related sensitive variables — like an opted-in email address and API keys.

If the option to register on a WordPress site is disabled, assuming there are no hackers among the website’s existing users, there’s nothing to worry about.

Even if there is an option to register, if there was no opt-in nor license activation — i.e., a free plugin/theme that uses Freemius and an admin skipped the opt-in — there’s also nothing to worry about.

If an option for users to register is active and a license was activated (or an admin did opt-in), the API keys of the user can be obtained by an attacker, which will potentially allow them to access the license owner’s information on Freemius. While obviously this is not good, there’s no risk of obtaining credit card numbers since those never get sent to our servers. Probably the most sensitive information a hacker can get is the license keys and invoices associated with the account.

Having said that, it’s not trivial to reverse engineer how to use the keys to access the API as those endpoints are currently not documented. Second, if an attacker is after license keys it’s much easier to strip the licensing restriction from Freemius-powered products anyway. Also, to leverage the vulnerability, an attacker would need to attack a site per account. So realistically, unless an attacker is targeting a specific WordPress site, the potential gain doesn’t seem to be worth the effort, and therefore we assess that the chance someone can coordinate an attack at scale to abuse this weakness is extremely slim.

Don’t get me wrong, it is a security vulnerability and if a site is not running a patched release, updating to the latest version is important and we urge you to do so.

## How to Check If a Website Is Running a Patched Version of the SDK?

Our WordPress SDK comes with a special mechanism to automatically use the newest SDK available on the site. So when a website actively uses multiple plugins/themes with Freemius, it’s sufficient enough that only one of them uses the patched SDK.

To verify a website is already on a patched version, an admin would need to open the SDK’s debug page by navigating to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=freemius`, and there, making sure that the *Active* SDK version is either `2.4.3` or `2.5.0.1` like here:

![Freemius Active WordPress SDK Version](https://freemius.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/freemius-active-wordpress-sdk-version.png)

## Recap

Security issues are an inevitable part of the software world and they can happen to anyone, whether you’re an indie plugin developer, theme designer, team of twenty, or Microsoft. What’s more important is how we deal with the situation and what we learn in the process to come out of it better and stronger.

What we’ve learned at Freemius is that when it happens, we need to keep calm, assess the risks, and strategize a recovery plan while minimizing the exposure. We need to execute it in a timely manner and make sure that we are there for you (our partners) to provide the help you’d need to navigate the patching process.

On behalf of the whole Freemius team, we are truly sorry for the inconvenience and will be here to offer support, advice, or any other help related to the issue. And for our new users, we know how important the first impression is, and this is definitely not a good one. I hope that you’ll give Freemius another chance, and with time, see (and experience) the [amazing features](/wordpress/features-comparison/) we offer for your WordPress plugins and themes.

  This security issue is so remote and such a small attack vector, with needing to be logged in and then target a paid plugin, but I appreciate you squashing the bugs and pushing it out in a way that limits the exposure, no real need to publish specifics other than a security fix is available.

  The security "troll" (as you mentioned them) is no longer following his own "reasonable" disclosure policy, per that page - all because he feels that the free WP Repo Support Forums should be a place to openly discuss security issues. In defiance, because his posts are heavily moderated and often deleted, he is protesting with irresponsible (or using his term, unreasonable) full disclosures, and that makes him feel better somehow, all while damaging his brand and hurting the WordPress security community. I've had my own issues with the forum moderators... but understand their bigger picture concerns, and act accordingly.

  The Plugins Team is awesome, and they are very helpful with reporting security issues, contacting plugin authors if need be, and taking down plugins that have serious security issues... they have a whole page dedicated to their process: https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/plugin-security/reporting-plugin-security-issues/

  To try and stomp your feet and continue to be unreasonable and irresponsible to so many and so often (as seen in the many rambling angry posts), no matter how security-conscious they may be, is worthy of the troll label, and I hope they find the character and honor they need to act respectfully and responsibly towards the community they seem to really care about. Reminds me of The Grinch movie, sadly.

  Hi, we have been using a WordPress plugin "Kioken Blocks" which was using Freemius and this plugin is now marked as not available.

  We used it at many places so we can not just delete it.

  Instead, we downloaded its code from their official website and replaced the older version of Freemius in that code with the latest version downloaded from GitHub.

  But when we scan our website with Wordfence scanner, it still shows the critical security error "unauthorised Ajax calls via freemius".

  If we check our website using /wp-admin/admin.php?page=freemius it shows

  Version 2.5.5

  Is there something that can be done to clear this security error on our end?

  Please guide

  Thanks in advance

## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Unauthorised AJAX Calls via Freemius

### Description

The plugins and themes use an insecure version of the Freemius Framework, which is lacking CSRF and/or authorisation in some of its AJAX actions. As a result, any authenticated users, such as subscriber could access the debug logs. Unauthenticated attackers could also make a logged in admin toggle the debug mode via a CSRF attack.

### Proof of Concept

To access debug logs, as any authenticated user: https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=fs\_get\_debug\_log

COLLECTED BY

Organization: [Archive Team](https://archive.org/details/archiveteam)

![](http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg) Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.

History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.

The main site for Archive Team is at [archiveteam.org](http://www.archiveteam.org) and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.

This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php), providing a path back to lost websites and work.

Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.

**The Archive Team Panic Downloads** are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

# Our Security Review of WordPress Plugin Found Freemius Library Still Contained Vulnerabilities 3 Years After Major Security Incident

Three years ago, the Freemius library, which is a monetization library widely used in WordPress plugins, fixed [a serious vulnerability only after a hacker had identified it and started exploiting it](https://web.archive.org/web/20220225174410/https%3A//www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2019/02/26/hackers-are-probably-already-exploiting-this-authenticated-option-update-vulnerability-just-fixed-in-freemius/). The situation surrounding that [was quite a mess](https://web.archive.org/web/20220225174410/https%3A//www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2019/02/27/a-legal-threat-and-an-attempted-cover-up-of-the-exploitation-of-the-freemius-authenticated-option-update-vulnerability/). It would be reasonable to think that the developer of the library and the developer of the plugins, especially security plugins, using the library would have made sure to get the security of the library reviewed after that to address any other security issues, but that turns out not to be the case.

What makes that more striking is that the developer claimed after that went down [that](https://web.archive.org/web/20220225174410/https%3A//freemius.com/blog/sdk-security-vulnerability/):

> security is top priority for us

And that:

> Even though we have a very strong security background, we conduct thorough code reviews and work with an experienced security researcher from the HackerOne community, yet this vulnerability still slipped through the cracks. 😔

As part of [our main service](https://web.archive.org/web/20220225174410/https%3A//www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/product/subscription/), we do [security reviews of WordPress plugins selected by our customers](https://web.archive.org/web/20220225174410/https%3A//www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/wordpress-plugin-security-reviews/). Earlier this month we did a review of a plugin with 100,000+ installs that contains the Freemius library. We found that the plugin and the Freemius library contained vulnerabilities and other security issues. It is hard to believe “thorough code reviews” could have been done of Fremius, as we did less than that and found multiple security vulnerabilities. The most serious vulnerability we found in Freemius is directly connected with the code that was the cause of the previously exploited vulnerability, but somehow wasn’t secured at the time.

The developer of the plugin promptly communicated with us and provided us with their fixes so that we could confirm the issues were addressed. By comparison, with the Freemius library, we only received an initial acknowledgement that the issues would be addressed, but nothing more.

Following the bad practices from three years ago the developer again has failed to make the fixed version of the library widely available, while a new version that partially addresses the issues we found has been released, it again isn’t available through the library’s GitJub project. With the [latest update to that being put out on January 3](https://web.archive.org/web/20220225174410/https%3A//github.com/Freemius/wordpress-sdk/commits/master).

Elsewhere though it is clear that the library has had security changes made, as for example, the plugin [Featured Images in RSS for Mailchimp & More](https://web.archive.org/web/20220225174410/https%3A//wordpress.org/plugins/featured-images-for-rss-feeds/), which has 30,000+ installs, had this changelog for a new version released on late on Wednesday:

> Updated Freemius SDK with improvements and security fixes, bump WP compatibility to v5.9.1.

The [changes made](https://web.archive.org/web/20220225174410/https%3A//plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2684111/) are clearly based on the issues we notified Freemius of. Since this is now public, we can go ahead with detailing the issues.

While the vulnerabilities were addressed, some of the insecurity we found still hasn’t been addressed in Freemius.

## Plugins With Over 5 Million Installs Impacted

Checking for usage of the Freemius library using a search of WP Directory [indicates that over 800 plugins in WordPress’ plugin directory contain the library](https://web.archive.org/web/20220225174410/https%3A//wpdirectory.net/search/01FWPVWA7BC5DYGZHNSZQ9QMN5) and that the 100 most popular of those have over 5.3 million installs. Among the most popular are five security realted plugins:

* [WP Activity Log](https://web.archive.org/web/20220225174410/https%3A//wordpress.org/plugins/wp-security-audit-log/) – 100,000 installs
* [WP fail2ban](https://web.archive.org/web/20220225174410/https%3A//wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fail2ban/) – 70,000 installs
* [WP Encryption](https://web.archive.org/web/20220225174410/https%3A//wordpress.org/plugins/wp-letsencrypt-ssl/) – 50,000 installs
* [SSL Zen](https://web.archive.org/web/20220225174410/https%3A//wordpress.org/plugins/ssl-zen/) – 30,000 installs
* [Security Ninja](https://web.archive.org/web/20220225174410/https%3A//wordpress.org/plugins/security-ninja/) – 9,000 installs

The two most popular of those, WP Activity Log  and WP fail2ban, as well as SSL Zen, have yet to be updated to include the new version of Freemius

## Authenticated Information Disclosure

What looks to be the most serious vulnerability we identified is that anyone logged in to WordPress has had access to the library’s debug log, despite it only being intended to be accessed by users with the Administrator role. The severity of that access would depend on if sensitive information got stored in the log.

What makes the lack of security on that stick out is that function being used, \_get\_debug\_log, is registered two lines up from the function that was at the root of the exploited vulnerability, \_set\_db\_option:

| ``` 3430 3431 3432 3433 3434  ``` | ``` self::add_ajax_action_static( 'get_debug_log', array( 'Freemius', '_get_debug_log' ) );   self::add_ajax_action_static( 'get_db_option', array( 'Freemius', '_get_db_option' ) );   self::add_ajax_action_static( 'set_db_option', array( 'Freemius', '_set_db_option' ) ); ``` |
| --- | --- |

self::add\_ajax\_action\_static( 'get\_debug\_log', array( 'Freemius', '\_get\_debug\_log' ) );
self::add\_ajax\_action\_static( 'get\_db\_option', array( 'Freemius', '\_get\_db\_option' ) );
self::add\_ajax\_action\_static( 'set\_db\_option', array( 'Freemius', '\_set\_db\_option' ) );

That has been addressed by adding a capabilities check to the code (as well as a nonce check):

| ``` 3575 3576 3577 3578 3579 3580  ``` | ``` static function _get_debug_log() { 	check_admin_referer( 'fs_get_debug_log' );   	if ( ! is_super_admin() ) { 		return; 	} ``` |
| --- | --- |

static function \_get\_debug\_log() {
check\_admin\_referer( 'fs\_get\_debug\_log' );
if ( ! is\_super\_admin() ) {
return;
}

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

The functionality that enables the library’s debug mode was also insecure, as it lacked protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF). So an attacker could have previously caused a logged in Administrator to enable that without intending it.

That was addressed by adding a nonce check:

| ``` 3522 3523  ``` | ``` static function _toggle_debug_mode() { 	check_admin_referer( 'fs_toggle_debug_mode' ); ``` |
| --- | --- |

static function \_toggle\_debug\_mode() {
check\_admin\_referer( 'fs\_toggle\_debug\_mode' );

## More Functionality Similarly Impacted

Both capabilities checks and nonces are basic security in a WordPress plugin, so their being missing in those locations is hard to square with the developer of the library’s security claims mentioned above.

Several other functions we notified the developer of also had capabilities checks and nonce checks added. Those were the function dismiss\_notice\_ajax\_callback() in the file /includes/managers/class-fs-admin-notice-manager.php, as well as the functions \_retry\_connectivity\_test() and \_email\_about\_firewall\_issue() in the file /includes/class-freemius.php.

## Sanitizing and Validation Still Probably Lacking

Another issue that we noticed is that in a lot of places, the library is bringing in user input without sanitizing or validating it, which, if done, would improve security. A lot of that can be seen by looking at instance of usage of the function fs\_request\_get(), which brings in user input, in the code.

Unfortunately, the new version of the library only makes a change in that in regards to two of the functions previously mentioned in this post. Elsewhere, the code hasn’t been changed to address that.

## Lack of Protection Against Direct Access to PHP Files

Most of the plugin’s .php files that didn’t appear to be intended to be directly accessed contained protection against direct access, but a few were missing that. We didn’t see anything that could be exploited in the files without the restriction in place, but restricting access to them would ensure that there isn’t any issue with that.

The issue was mostly addressed by adding the protection to all but one of the files missing it. The remaining file being /includes/fs-essential-functions.php.
