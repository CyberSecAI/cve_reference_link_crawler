The RSS Aggregator â€“ RSS Import, News Feeds, Feed to Post, and Autoblogging plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'wprss_activate_feed_source' and 'wprss_pause_feed_source' functions in all versions up to, and including, 4.23.11. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to activate or pause existing RSS feeds.
