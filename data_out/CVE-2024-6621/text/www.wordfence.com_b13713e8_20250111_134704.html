### Description

The RSS Aggregator – RSS Import, News Feeds, Feed to Post, and Autoblogging plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'wprss\_activate\_feed\_source' and 'wprss\_pause\_feed\_source' functions in all versions up to, and including, 4.23.11. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to activate or pause existing RSS feeds.
