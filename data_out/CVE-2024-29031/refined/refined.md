Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the `order` query parameter in the `/api/system/meshsync/resources` endpoint. This parameter is directly used in the construction of SQL queries, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly incorporates user-provided input (`order` parameter) into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** Attackers can use stacked SQL queries and the `ATTACH DATABASE` command to write arbitrary files to the server's file system.
- **Data Access and Modification:** Attackers can access and modify sensitive data within the database, potentially including:
    - Performance profiles, which may contain session cookies.
    - Meshery application data.
    - Kubernetes configurations added to the system.
- **Information Disclosure:** Through blind SQL injection techniques, attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious HTTP GET requests to the `/api/system/meshsync/resources` endpoint with specially crafted `order` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Meshery instance to send malicious requests.
- **Authentication (Potentially):** Although the vulnerability can be exploited without authentication if not configured, exploiting it for sensitive data access might require a valid session cookie. For testing purposes, `Cookie: meshery-provider=None` can be used for local authentication.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `GetMeshSyncResources` function in `server/handlers/meshsync_handler.go`.
- The `order` query parameter is extracted from the request URL and directly used in the `result.Order(order)` function call without any validation.
- The vulnerability was patched by implementing sanitization using the `SanitizeOrderInput` function, as referenced in the pull request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by the GitHub Security Lab (GHSL) and assigned the identifier GHSL-2023-249.
- The vulnerability was patched in commit `8e995ce` which is part of pull request #10207.
- The vulnerability affects Meshery versions up to v0.6.181 and was tested on v0.7.1.
- The proof of concept demonstrates how to write an arbitrary file and inject database entries using SQL injection.
