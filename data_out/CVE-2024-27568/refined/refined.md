The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in LBT T300-T390 routers.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a stack overflow in the `setupEC20Apn` function due to an overly long `apn_name_3g` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow in the `setupEC20Apn` function.
- The `apn_name_3g` variable is not properly validated before being used.
- The `apn_name_3g` variable is retrieved from NVRAM using `NVRAM_GET` and can be manipulated by modifying the request parameters of the `wan_3g.asp` page, bypassing front-end JavaScript validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  A successful exploit allows an attacker to overwrite the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the router.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/apply.cgi` endpoint.
- The request includes a long `apn_name_3g` parameter that overflows the buffer in the `setupEC20Apn` function.
- The attacker must be able to access the web interface to send the crafted HTTP POST request

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface (e.g., be on the same network).
-  The attacker needs to know the URL to send the POST request and the parameter to exploit.
- Authentication is required as the `Authorization` header is present in the provided PoC.
