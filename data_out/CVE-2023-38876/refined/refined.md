- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `selector` parameter within the `/reset-password` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser by injecting a malicious payload. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL with a specific payload in the `selector` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can remotely exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to click the malicious URL.
