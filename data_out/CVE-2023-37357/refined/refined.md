```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the parsing of PDF files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated object.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds read"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious PDF file that, when parsed by the vulnerable software, triggers the out-of-bounds read.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to entice a user to open a specially crafted malicious PDF file. User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability."
