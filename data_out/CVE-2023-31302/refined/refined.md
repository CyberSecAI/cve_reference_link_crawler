The provided content is related to CVE-2023-31302.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, the `Teller` field in the Cash Point & Transport Optimizer (CPTO) software version 6.3.8.6 does not sanitize user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). Specifically, a reflected XSS vulnerability is present.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the `Teller` field which will then be executed in the browser when the `Select` button is clicked. This could lead to various impacts such as session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities, depending on the attacker's payload.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `Teller` input field in the CPTO software. By injecting a malicious script, an attacker can exploit the lack of input sanitization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to input data into the `Teller` field. This likely implies the attacker has some level of access to the CPTO application, or can manipulate the request to include a malicious payload in the Teller field.
