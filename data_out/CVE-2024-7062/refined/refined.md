- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `Nimble Commander` application's privileged helper tool (`info.filesmanager.Files.PrivilegedIOHelperV2`) does not properly validate the client connecting to it via XPC. Specifically, it fails to verify the client's version or code signing flags, allowing a vulnerable older version of the application to be used for code injection and privilege escalation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Insufficient client validation: The server only checks the client's bundle ID, team ID, and path, but does not check the code signing flags (e.g., hardened runtime) or client version.
    - Use of an older, vulnerable version of the client: An older version of the client, which is not signed with "Hardened Runtime," can be used to inject malicious code.
    - Lack of proper authentication: While the server does check for an "auth" boolean in the initial message, the lack of proper client validation allows a malicious client to bypass this check.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Local Privilege Escalation: An attacker can execute arbitrary system-level commands as the `root` user.
    - Unauthorized file manipulation: An attacker can change file permissions, ownership, and other file attributes.
    - Process manipulation: An attacker can terminate processes.
    - Arbitrary code execution as root.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Local access to the system with Nimble Commander installed.
    - Using a vulnerable version of the Nimble Commander application to inject malicious code and connect to the privileged helper tool via XPC.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to install and execute applications on the target macOS system.
    - Access to an older, vulnerable version of Nimble Commander application (1.1.2 or similar).
    - Ability to create a malicious dynamic library (`DYLIB`) for code injection.
    - Basic understanding of XPC and code signing on macOS.
