{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary in Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD routers uses `sprintf` to format command parameters into a stack buffer. The size of the parameters is not checked against the buffer size, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the command parsing logic of `DetranCLI` binary.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a specially crafted network packet with a vulnerable `DetranCLI` command.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device. No specific authentication requirement is mentioned, but it is implied that the attacker needs to be able to reach the CLI interface."
