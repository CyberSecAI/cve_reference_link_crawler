{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `php_ap_memstr` function's partial match handling when parsing multipart form data. When a prefix of the boundary string is found within the buffer, and its length falls between 5KiB and the boundary string length, the function incorrectly identifies it as the boundary, leading to data loss.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-1286: Improper Handling of a Partial Match in a String Search"
    ],
    "impact": "The primary impact is data integrity violation. Due to the parsing bug, legitimate data in multipart form submissions might not be processed correctly, leading to data loss or corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, through specially crafted HTTP POST requests with malicious multipart form data.  An attacker can manipulate the boundary and inject a prefix within the valid range to cause the parsing logic to fail.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to craft and send HTTP POST requests with multipart form data to a vulnerable PHP application.  The attacker can control the boundary parameter and embed a prefix of the boundary that is within the size constraints."
