Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3823-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                       Guilhem Moulin

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : less
Version        : 487-0.1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-48624 CVE-2024-32487
Debian Bug     : 1064293 1068938

Security vulnerabilities were found in less, a pager program similar to
more, which could result in arbitrary command execution when processing
files with crafted names.

CVE-2022-48624

    It was discovered that LESSCLOSE handling in less did not quote
    shell metacharacters.

CVE-2024-32487

    It was discovered that filenames containing a newline character
    could result in arbitrary command execution during input
    preprocessor invocation.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
487-0.1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your less packages.

For the detailed security status of less please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/less>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

2. [Prevent bin\_file() -> is\_utf8\_well\_formed() buffer overrun (](/gwsw/less/commit/99510e60dbe5840ef681c9b9f53abe500282647a)[#271](https://github.com/gwsw/less/pull/271)[)](/gwsw/less/commit/99510e60dbe5840ef681c9b9f53abe500282647a)
    …

   ```
   When supplied with a file of random data >256 bytes, read()
   would return a full buffer of data[256] to bin_file().
   That function loops through the buffer, but calls is_utf8_well_formed()
   with the full length of the buffer.  When looping on the last byte of the
   buffer, is_uft8_well_formed() reads past the end.

   This commit fixes bin_file() to only inspect the remaining bytes in the
   buffer.

   Found and tested with CheriBSD on an Arm Morello platform running with strong
   memory safety
   ```
