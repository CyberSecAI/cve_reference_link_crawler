Security vulnerabilities were found in less, a pager program similar to
more, which could result in arbitrary command execution when processing
files with crafted names.

CVE-2022-48624

    It was discovered that LESSCLOSE handling in less did not quote
    shell metacharacters.

CVE-2024-32487

    It was discovered that filenames containing a newline character
    could result in arbitrary command execution during input
    preprocessor invocation.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version

We recommend that you upgrade your less packages.
