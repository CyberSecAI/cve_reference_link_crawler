2. [Prevent bin\_file() -> is\_utf8\_well\_formed() buffer overrun (](/gwsw/less/commit/99510e60dbe5840ef681c9b9f53abe500282647a)[#271](https://github.com/gwsw/less/pull/271)[)](/gwsw/less/commit/99510e60dbe5840ef681c9b9f53abe500282647a)
    …

   ```
   When supplied with a file of random data >256 bytes, read()
   would return a full buffer of data[256] to bin_file().
   That function loops through the buffer, but calls is_utf8_well_formed()
   with the full length of the buffer.  When looping on the last byte of the
   buffer, is_uft8_well_formed() reads past the end.

   This commit fixes bin_file() to only inspect the remaining bytes in the
   buffer.

   Found and tested with CheriBSD on an Arm Morello platform running with strong
   memory safety
   ```
