[v6.3.0](/inex/IXP-Manager/tree/v6.3.0)

[`93b8dc4`](/inex/IXP-Manager/commit/93b8dc48b6199c0fd55035be109d126da193c7fa)

A commercial IT consultancy provider uses IXP Manager in one of their solutions. They had their overall solution reviewed by an internationally respected cyber security and risk assessor. This review included IXP Manager and the commercial IT consultancy responsibly disclosed all of the issues and advice related to IXP Manager.

These have been addressed in this release and are itemised below. We recommend all IXPs that use IXP Manager upgrade to this new version.

We thank the IT consultancy, and those within it that we have been dealing with, for sharing the findings with us.

## Release Summary

```
$  git --no-pager diff --shortstat v6.2.0 release-v6
 87 files changed, 3025 insertions(+), 2513 deletions(-)

```
## Upgrade Instructions

The [official upgrade instructions can be found here](https://docs.ixpmanager.org/install/upgrading/).

This release does include some minor database migrations - please follow the instructions above.

### Post-Upgrade Instructions

We use [Laravel's mail system](https://docs.ixpmanager.org/usage/email/) and so we need to keep in sync with their defaults. A recent change means that when sending email via SMTP, tls no longer the default. See [#752](https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/issues/752) for a discussion.

**If using SMTP**, ensure you test emails via [the test tool here](https://docs.ixpmanager.org/usage/email/#testing-smtp).

Not used and was the framework default so not an issue here, just best practice. Came up as an issue in a security audit and we note this has been removed from Laravel for the same reason: [laravel/laravel@4bc502b](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/commit/4bc502bba6b7bcbc8007c061621266fe8f989e07)
