The provided content relates to CVE-2024-36532.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Insecure permissions in kruise v1.6.2 allow attackers to access sensitive data and escalate privileges by obtaining the service account's token.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect Access Control leading to unauthorized access to secrets.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Directly compromise all Secrets components in k8s.
-  Further compromise other components in the cluster.
-  Potentially take over the entire Kubernetes cluster.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  An attacker gains control of a worker node.
2. The attacker uses a pod running on that node (e.g., "hwameistor-local-disk-manager" with `update/patch` verb for `nodes` resource) to force kruise’s pod to run on the malicious node.
3. The attacker steals the service account's token from the compromised pod.
4. The attacker uses the stolen token to authenticate with the API server, gaining privileges associated with the ServiceAccount.
5. The attacker uses those privileges to access all secrets in the cluster.
6. The attacker uses the sensitive information within secrets to escalate privileges further and explore other sensitive resources, potentially achieving full cluster takeover.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to compromise a worker node in the Kubernetes cluster.
- The attacker needs to be able to leverage a pod with certain privileges (like `update/patch` on `nodes` resource) to force kruise’s pod to run on the compromised node.
