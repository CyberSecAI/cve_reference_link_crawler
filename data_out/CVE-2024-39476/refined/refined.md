{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The raid5d() function in the Linux kernel's RAID5 implementation has a deadlock issue due to a circular dependency involving the MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING flag and the reconfig_mutex.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Deadlock due to circular dependency",
      "Inefficient busy-waiting loop"
    ],
    "impact": "The raid5d() daemon thread can enter a deadlock state, leading to 100% CPU usage on one core and preventing I/O operations from being processed, resulting in a system hang. The 'lvconvert-raid-takeover.sh' LVM2 test has been observed to trigger this hang.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the 'reconfig_mutex' is held by another context while the raid5d() thread attempts to clear the MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING flag, leading to a deadlock.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trigger a condition where another context holds the 'reconfig_mutex' while raid5d attempts to process I/O and update the superblock. This is typically related to LVM operations like raid conversion or takeover."
  },
    "fixes": [
        "The fix skips issuing IO if MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING is still set after md_check_recovery(). The daemon thread is woken up when reconfig_mutex is released, preventing the deadlock."
