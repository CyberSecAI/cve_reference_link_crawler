In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: megaraid_sas: Fix resource leak in case of probe failure

The driver doesn't clean up all the allocated resources properly when
scsi_add_host(), megasas_start_aen() function fails during the PCI device
probe.

Clean up all those resources.
