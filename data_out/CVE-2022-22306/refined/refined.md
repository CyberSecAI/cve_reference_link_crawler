- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper certificate validation when establishing secure connections to external endpoints.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**  CWE-295, improper certificate validation
- **Impact of exploitation:** A network-adjacent attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, potentially leading to information disclosure and unauthorized modification of data transmitted between the FortiGate and some peers.
- **Attack vectors:** Network adjacent, unauthenticated attacker performing man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network adjacent position to the target, and ability to intercept and modify network traffic.
