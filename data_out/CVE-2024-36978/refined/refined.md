Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36978:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect calculation within the `multiq_tune()` function in the Linux kernel's `sch_multiq.c` module. This function is responsible for tuning the multi-queue (multiq) queuing discipline.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-Bounds (OOB) Write:** The code calculates the size of a memory allocation using `q->bands` before updating `q->bands` to `qopt->bands`.  The `kmalloc` call should be using the new `qopt->bands` value in its calculation rather than the old `q->bands`. This discrepancy can lead to allocating a buffer smaller than what is needed and result in an out-of-bounds write when the buffer is used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An out-of-bounds write can cause memory corruption and lead to various consequences, including:
   - System instability
    - Kernel crashes
   - Potential for privilege escalation if exploited with malicious intent.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered within the `multiq_tune()` function, likely when a user space process or system component attempts to tune or configure the multiq queuing discipline via a netlink interface using the `TCA_OPTIONS` attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need the capability to interact with the network traffic control subsystem through the netlink interface, specifically the multiq queuing discipline. This may require:
    -  Local access with network administration privileges or a compromised system with such privileges.
    -   In some cases, the ability to create custom network configurations or manipulate network queues from a local environment might be enough.
 
**Additional Notes:**
- The patch modifies the `kmalloc` calculation to use `qopt->bands` instead of `q->bands`, resolving the out-of-bounds write issue.
- This issue is related to a previous fix, `c2999f7fb05b` which addressed a locking issue, and the fix for this vulnerability prevents further bugs introduced in that code.
- Multiple commits with identical fix were applied to different branches.
