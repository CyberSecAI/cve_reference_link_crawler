**Detail**

* CVE-2022-27624

  + Severity: Critical
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 10.0
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
  + A vulnerability regarding improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer is found in the packet decryption functionality of Out-of-Band (OOB) Management. This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via unspecified vectors. The following models with Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) versions before 7.1.1-42962-2 may be affected: DS3622xs+, FS3410, and HD6500.
* CVE-2022-27625

  + Severity: Critical
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 10.0
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
  + A vulnerability regarding improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer is found in the message processing functionality of Out-of-Band (OOB) Management. This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via unspecified vectors. The following models with Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) versions before 7.1.1-42962-2 may be affected: DS3622xs+, FS3410, and HD6500.
* CVE-2022-27626

  + Severity: Critical
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 10.0
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
  + A vulnerability regarding concurrent execution using shared resource with improper synchronization ('Race Condition') is found in the session processing functionality of Out-of-Band (OOB) Management. This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via unspecified vectors. The following models with Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) versions before 7.1.1-42962-2 may be affected: DS3622xs+, FS3410, and HD6500.
* CVE-2022-3576

  + Severity: Moderate
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 5.3
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
  + A vulnerability regarding out-of-bounds read is found in the session processing functionality of Out-of-Band (OOB) Management. This allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via unspecified vectors. The following models with Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) versions before 7.1.1-42962-2 may be affected: DS3622xs+, FS3410, and HD6500.
