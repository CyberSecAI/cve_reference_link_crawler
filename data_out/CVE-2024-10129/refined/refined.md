{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A second-order SQL injection vulnerability exists due to unsanitized user input being stored in the database and later used in SQL queries without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Second-order SQL Injection. The 'fkey' parameter in 'includes/create_share.php' allows injection of malicious SQL statements, which are then stored in the database. The stored 'fkey' value is then used in SQL queries in 'views/user_shares.php', causing the second order injection.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unauthorized data access and manipulation could result from successful exploitation.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the ‘fkey’ parameter in ‘includes/create_share.php’. Later, the code stored in the database is executed in an SQL query in 'views/user_shares.php'.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A regular user of the Shudong-Share application can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the 'fkey' parameter."
