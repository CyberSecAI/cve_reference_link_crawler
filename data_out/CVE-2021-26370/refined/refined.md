{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper validation of destination address in SVC_LOAD_FW_IMAGE_BY_INSTANCE and SVC_LOAD_BINARY_BY_ATTRIB",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient validation of destination address leads to potential memory corruption.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can overwrite arbitrary bootloader memory with SPI ROM contents, resulting in a loss of integrity and availability.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious UApp or ABL can trigger the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to run a malicious UApp or ABL."
