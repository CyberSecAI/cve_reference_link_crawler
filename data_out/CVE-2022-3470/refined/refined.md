Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The application constructs SQL queries using user-supplied input without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `sc` parameter in the `getstatecity.php` file is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application directly incorporates user-provided input (`sc` parameter) into SQL queries, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Confidentiality:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Integrity:** An attacker could modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Availability:** An attacker could potentially cause a denial of service by manipulating database queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `sc` parameter within an HTTP request to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application server.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in the `getstatecity.php` file of the SourceCodester Human Resource Management System.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit is publicly available.
*   The vulnerability can be discovered using Google hacking with `inurl:getstatecity.php`.
*   No known countermeasures or mitigations are listed other than replacing the application.
