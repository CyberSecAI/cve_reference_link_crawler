Based on the provided commit log, here's a breakdown of the security fix:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The commit message "Fixed security exploit" and the changes in `controllers/exam.php` indicate a SQL injection vulnerability. Specifically, the original code used `$_REQUEST['quiz']` directly in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allowed a malicious user to inject arbitrary SQL code via the `quiz` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability lies in the direct use of user-supplied input (`$_REQUEST['quiz']`) within SQL queries without sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** A successful SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database. This could include exam questions, user data, and other information stored by the plugin.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database configuration and the exploited user's permissions, an attacker might gain elevated access to the database server and its resources.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker could use SQL injection to inject queries that could cause performance problems or crashes, leading to a denial-of-service situation for the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET/POST Parameter Manipulation:** An attacker could craft a malicious HTTP GET or POST request with a modified `quiz` parameter containing SQL injection payloads.
- **Direct Request:** The vulnerability could be triggered directly by crafting a request that includes the "delete" action and a malicious "quiz" parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the WordPress website running the vulnerable Watu plugin.
- No authentication may be needed depending on the specific implementation of the plugin, as the vulnerability is within a part of the plugin that handles the deletion of quizzes, likely from the admin panel.

**Technical Details:**

- **Vulnerable Code:** In the original `controllers/exam.php`, the lines using `$wpdb->get_results` were vulnerable:
   ```php
   $wpdb->get_results("DELETE FROM ".WATU_EXAMS." WHERE ID='$_REQUEST[quiz]'");
   $wpdb->get_results("DELETE FROM ".WATU_ANSWERS." WHERE question_id IN (SELECT ID FROM ".WATU_QUESTIONS." WHERE exam_id='$_REQUEST[quiz]')");
   $wpdb->get_results("DELETE FROM ".WATU_QUESTIONS." WHERE exam_id='$_REQUEST[quiz]'");
   ```
- **Fixed Code:** The fix implemented parameterized queries using `$wpdb->prepare` to prevent SQL injection:
   ```php
    $wpdb->get_results($wpdb->prepare("DELETE FROM ".WATU_EXAMS." WHERE ID=%d", $_REQUEST['quiz']));
    $wpdb->get_results($wpdb->prepare("DELETE FROM ".WATU_ANSWERS." WHERE question_id IN (SELECT ID FROM ".WATU_QUESTIONS." WHERE exam_id=%d", $_REQUEST['quiz']));
    $wpdb->get_results($wpdb->prepare("DELETE FROM ".WATU_QUESTIONS." WHERE exam_id=%d", $_REQUEST['quiz']));
   ```
    This change uses the prepare function with the placeholder %d to pass the quiz ID as a parameter, rather than directly concatenating the user input into the SQL query.

**Additional Notes:**
- Other changes in this commit appear to be minor bug fixes, code clean up and an update to the plugin version.
- The change in `controllers/show_exam.php` replaces `@$_POST['start_time']` with `$_POST['start_time']`, which seems to fix a PHP error suppression.
- The `readme.txt` includes "- Fixed security exploit"
- The commit touches `script.js` to fix an issue with ajax submits.
- The change to `views/show_exam.html.php` seems to have added an additional hidden start time field to the exam form.
- The `watu.php` file changes the version number from `2.6.7` to `2.6.8` and updates a script version number from `2.3.2` to `2.3.3`

This commit provides a good example of how SQL injection can be exploited and how parameterized queries can be used to prevent such vulnerabilities.
