```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The underscore-99xp library is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to an inefficient regular expression used in the `deepValueSearch` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A specially crafted input can cause the regular expression engine to perform excessive backtracking, leading to high CPU usage and potentially causing the application to become unresponsive.",
  "Attack vectors": "By providing a specially crafted string as input to the `deepValueSearch` function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to influence the input passed to the `deepValueSearch` function. No other special capabilities are mentioned."
