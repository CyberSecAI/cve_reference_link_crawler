| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1213708#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2023-07-27 09:29:51 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1213340](show_bug.cgi?id=1213340 "RESOLVED FIXED")  The opensuse-welcome dialog is a small Qt program containing not even 500 lines of code. It uses some advanced Qt features like QML scripts, though, which help in setting up the dialog's features.  One peculiarity is that only in an XFCE environment (`$XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` set to xfce), a "customise" button is shown which allows to select between different XFCE desktop layout presets.  Understanding the setup of this XFCE specific customise button is not all that simple. There are QML tag attributes "data-de" which relate to specific desktop environments. There is a XfceLayouter registered in QML and in src/main.cpp.  In any case the C++ class found in panellayouter.h and panellayouter.cpp is dealing with the actual logic that is executed once the user clicks on any of the XFCE desktop layout presets, to configure it.  In `PanelLayouter::applyLayout()` the fixed path /tmp/layout is used to store a complex configuration file which is fed to the XFCE via D-Bus. To complicate things further, a Python script embedded into panellayouter.cpp is used to take advantage of the XFCE4 Python module found in /usr/share/xfce4-panel-profiles/xfce4-panel-profiles/panelconfig.py. This module offers facilities to feed a desktop layout configuration tarball to XFCE via D-Bus.  The use of the fixed path in /tmp/layout is problematic security wise in multiple ways. The following code is used in `PanelLayouter::applyLayout()`:  ```     if (QFile::exists("/tmp/layout"))         QFile::remove("/tmp/layout");      QFile layout(path);     layout.copy("/tmp/layout");      QProcess::startDetached("/usr/bin/python3", {"-c", m_script}); ```  This results in the following system call sequence, provided /tmp/layout does not yet exist:  ``` access("/tmp/layout", F_OK)             = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) openat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp", O_RDWR|O_CLOEXEC|O_TMPFILE, 0600) = 55 linkat(AT_FDCWD, "/proc/self/fd/55", AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/layout", AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW) = 0 chmod("/tmp/layout", 0444)              = 0 ```  This of course poses various attack vectors involving symlink attacks. If the Linux kernel's symlink protection is off, other users can place symlinks here to confuse the existence check or to overwrite arbitrary locations (the `linkat()` call explicitly specifies `AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW`). By default on openSUSE we do have symlink protection, luckily.  What happens if /tmp/layout already exists as a regular file, though? The code above does not perform any error checks and C++ exceptions are not used either. This means a failing `Qfile::remove()` or a failing `QFile.copy()` are not noticed and are not terminating the program logic. The result of this will be, if /tmp/layout is already existing and readable, that attacker controlled data is used in the embedded Python script.  When looking at the logic found in /usr/share/xfce4-panel-profiles/xfce4-panel-profiles/panelconfig.py we can see that a tarball is expected as input containing complex configuration files. Among other the script copies any `*.rc` files found in the tarball into the user's home directory. The script does have quite some evaluation logic, but it is sloppy enough to allow to construct a crafted tarball that causes an arbitrary file in the user's home directory to be overwritten by attacker controlled data.  The attached `hack_welcome.py` script is a PoC I wrote that demonstrates this. The impact is arbitrary code execution in the context of the victim user that runs XFCE and clicks customize in opensuse-welcome and chooses one of the layouts. Currently the only limitation is that the name of the victim's user account needs to be known. I suspect there are further attack vectors to make this even simpler. Refer to the PoC inline documentation for more. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1213708#c1)  Matthias Gerstner   2023-07-27 09:34:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 868450](attachment.cgi?id=868450 "PoC program") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=868450&action=edit "PoC program") PoC program ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1213708#c4)  Johannes Segitz   2023-07-28 09:59:25 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2023-32184 for this ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1213708#c5)  Matthias Gerstner   2023-07-31 11:34:43 UTC  ``` There are only openSUSE community maintainers for this package and even them don't seem to be much involved into the package. I will attempt a fix myself, shouldn't be too hard.  Doing this privately will be difficult, I guess I will communicate openly that there is a CVE fixed by this, but not publish this bug here with the details before updates are available. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1213708#c6)  Matthias Gerstner   2023-08-01 11:37:35 UTC  ``` I just create the GitHub PR# to address this:  <https://github.com/openSUSE/openSUSE-welcome/pull/32>  Turns out this is even weirder than what it looked like at first. I thought the layout tarballs are actually coming from the xfce4-panel-profiles package, installed in /usr/share/xfce4-panel-profiles/layouts.  Instead a couple of layout tarballs are embedded into opensuse-welcome as "application resources". This is probably also the reason why this stunt with the /tmp/layout fixed path was introduced in the first place. It was used as a vehicle to write the embedded tarballs to disk. The Qt libraries transparently handle special paths starting with a colon as application resource paths.  In my PR# I am now using a QTemporaryFile to write out the application resource. The embedded Python script is now an external file that needs to be packaged. This should make things clearer and more importantly fix the security issue. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1213708#c8)  Johannes Segitz   2023-08-11 13:47:01 UTC  ``` submitted in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1103483>, removing embargoed tag, but I'll leave the bug private for now ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1213708#c9)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2023-08-11 14:25:02 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1213708) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1103493> Factory / opensuse-welcome <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1103495> Backports:SLE-15-SP5 / opensuse-welcome ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1213708#c10)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2023-08-14 09:35:04 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1213708) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1103813> Backports:SLE-15-SP5 / opensuse-welcome <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1103814> Backports:SLE-15-SP4 / opensuse-welcome ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1213708#c11)  Marcus Meissner   2023-08-14 19:05:34 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2023:0219-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
