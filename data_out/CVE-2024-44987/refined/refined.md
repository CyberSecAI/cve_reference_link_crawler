### Summary
This set of patches addresses a use-after-free vulnerability in the `ip6_send_skb()` function within the Linux kernel's IPv6 networking stack. The root cause is that after `ip6_local_out()` returns, the `rt` (route) pointer is dereferenced without holding an RCU read lock, potentially leading to a use-after-free if the route object is freed in another thread.

### Vulnerability Details:
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises because the `rt` pointer, which is obtained from `skb_dst(skb)`, is dereferenced after `ip6_local_out()` returns, without holding an RCU read lock.  The route object can be freed asynchronously.
*   **Weakness:** The code lacks proper synchronization (RCU read lock) when accessing the `rt` pointer after `ip6_local_out()`.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can trigger a use-after-free (UAF), potentially leading to a kernel crash or arbitrary code execution if the freed memory is reallocated.
*   **Attack Vector:**  The vulnerability can be triggered through the `rawv6_sendmsg` function (as indicated in the call trace of the syzbot report) which calls `ip6_send_skb`.

### Patch Details
The fix involves adding `rcu_read_lock()` before calling `ip6_local_out()`, and `rcu_read_unlock()` after. This ensures that the `rt` pointer remains valid throughout its usage in `ip6_send_skb()`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**
An attacker needs the ability to send crafted IPv6 packets to trigger the vulnerable code path. This could potentially be achieved by a local user with appropriate network privileges or by a remote attacker if the system is exposed to a network. The Syzkaller report indicates the vulnerability can be triggered via the `sendmsg` syscall.

### Notes
The provided content includes multiple commits that address the same vulnerability, likely backports to various stable kernel branches. The core fix is consistent across all of them: taking an RCU read lock before the call to `ip6_local_out` and releasing it afterwards.
