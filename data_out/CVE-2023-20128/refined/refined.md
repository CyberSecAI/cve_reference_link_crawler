- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the *root* user on the underlying Linux operating system of the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending malicious input to the vulnerable web-based management interface of the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have valid *Administrator* credentials on the affected device to exploit these vulnerabilities. The attack is remote.
