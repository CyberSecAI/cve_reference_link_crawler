- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An exposed dangerous method (`setShutdown`) within the Voltronic Power ViewPower application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application exposes a method that can be leveraged to escalate privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can escalate privileges to SYSTEM level and execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
