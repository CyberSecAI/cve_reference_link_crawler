### Description

The Revision Manager TMC plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary email sending due to a missing capability check on the \_a\_ajaxQuickEmailTestCallback() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.19. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to send emails with arbitrary content to any individual through the vulnerable web server.
