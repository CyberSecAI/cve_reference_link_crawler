- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient session expiration. The API access token does not expire after a renewal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could reuse an unexpired API access token to gain unauthorized privileges on the FortiEDR Central Manager, potentially executing unauthorized code or commands.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to obtain a valid API access token, possibly through other hypothetical attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to obtain a valid, unexpired user API access token, which implies they have already compromised the system in some way to obtain the token before it is renewed, or somehow obtained it from a user or other compromised system.
