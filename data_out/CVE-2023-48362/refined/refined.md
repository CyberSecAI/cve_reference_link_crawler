- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an XXE (XML External Entity) injection flaw in the XML format plugin of Apache Drill.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The XML parser in Apache Drill is processing external entities without proper sanitization, enabling XXE attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the server's file system or execute commands on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers can provide a malicious XML file to be processed by the vulnerable Apache Drill instance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide or inject a crafted XML file to be processed by Apache Drill. This implies having some interaction with the Apache Drill instance either directly or indirectly (through user input/data or some interface).
