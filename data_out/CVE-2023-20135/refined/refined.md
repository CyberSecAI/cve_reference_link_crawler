- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Time-of-check, time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition during install query of an ISO image while an install operation using the same ISO image is in progress.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: TOCTOU race condition during image verification checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attacker modifying an ISO image and initiating parallel install requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Authenticated local access to the system.
