Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36453:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Type:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Location:** `session_login.cgi`
*   **CWE:** CWE-79

**Affected Versions:**

*   Webmin versions prior to 1.970
*   Usermin versions prior to 1.820

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `session_login.cgi` script not properly sanitizing user-supplied input before rendering it in the web page. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the web browser of a user who accesses the vulnerable application. This could lead to various malicious actions, including session hijacking, data theft, and defacement.

**Attack Vector:**

*   The vulnerability is exploited remotely (AV:N).
*   The attack requires a user interaction (UI:R), which means the attacker needs to trick a user to click a malicious link or visit a compromised page.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable with low complexity (AC:L).
*   No authentication is required (PR:N), meaning any user can be targeted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the `session_login.cgi` script or its related parameters. This is typically achieved by crafting a malicious URL that includes the payload, using another vulnerable entrypoint, or using a man-in-the-middle position.
*   The attacker needs to trick a victim into accessing the malicious link or page.

**CVSS Score:**
*   CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N - Base Score 6.1

**Additional Notes:**

*   The JVN report provides the most detailed information about this CVE.
*   The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2024-36450, which also involves XSS, but the vulnerable script is `sysinfo.cgi`.
*   The fix is to upgrade to a version of Webmin or Usermin after the versions mentioned which have patched the vulnerability.
