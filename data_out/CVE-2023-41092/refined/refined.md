Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** An unchecked return value in the Secure Device Manager (SDM) firmware.
*   **Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is present in the SDM firmware for Intel Stratix 10 and Intel Agilex 7 FPGAs. Specifically, the issue is related to an unchecked return value, which can be exploited.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to a denial of service. While the confidentiality aspect of the attack is none, it can cause Integrity impact with limited privilege and High impact on Availability
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is adjacent access.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker requires low privileges and must be authenticated to the system. The attack requires no user interaction.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability lies in the SDM firmware of Intel Stratix 10 and Agilex 7 FPGAs where an unchecked return value allows an authenticated user with adjacent access to potentially cause a denial of service. The fix is to update the firmware to version 23.3 or later.
