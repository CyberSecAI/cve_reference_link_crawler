- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists in SnapCenter versions 4.8 through 4.9. It allows an authenticated SnapCenter Server user to gain admin privileges on a remote system where a SnapCenter plug-in is installed. The specific flaw is not described in this document.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Privilege escalation vulnerability.
- **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an authenticated, privileged user to escalate their privileges on a remote system, potentially gaining full control over the target system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through an authenticated SnapCenter user interacting with a remote system where a SnapCenter plug-in is installed. This likely involves a vulnerability in the communications or operations performed on the remote system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of SnapCenter Server and have a network connection to a remote system with an installed SnapCenter plugin.
