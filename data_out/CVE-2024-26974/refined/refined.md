{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the Intel QAT driver's AER (Advanced Error Reporting) recovery process. If a device restart takes longer than 10 seconds, the function scheduling the restart may timeout and free the reset_data structure, which is still needed for completion notification, leading to a use-after-free.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free (UAF)",
      "Race condition"
    ],
    "impact": "The use-after-free vulnerability can lead to a kernel crash, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution in the kernel context.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the PCI AER system's error recovery process of a QAT device when a reset operation takes longer than 10 seconds.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trigger a PCI AER error on the target QAT device. This would require access to the system with the vulnerable QAT driver installed. No special privileges are needed, just interaction with the device."

  "affected_component": "Intel QAT driver in the Linux kernel",
    "fixed_versions": [
        "The fix was backported to stable kernel branches"
