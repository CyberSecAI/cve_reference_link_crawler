The provided content relates to **CVE-2021-44401** as part of a larger set of vulnerabilities.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper input validation in the `cgiserver.cgi` JSON command parser. The parser assumes that the "param" field within a JSON command is always an object. However, it is possible to send a request with a "param" field that is not an object (e.g., an empty string), which causes the parser to crash due to a failed assertion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Input Validation (CWE-20): The `cgiserver.cgi` process does not properly validate the type of the "param" field within the JSON commands.
- Denial of Service: By sending a crafted HTTP request with a non-object "param" value, an attacker can trigger an assertion failure that crashes the `cgiserver.cgi` process.
- Lack of Authentication: While most of the described vulnerabilities require a logged-in user, they can be exploited without authentication by using a separate vulnerability described in TALOS-2021-1420 (not included in this document).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a denial-of-service. When the `cgiserver.cgi` process crashes, the device will reboot.
- Repeated attacks can cause frequent reboots, making the camera unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is an HTTP request with a crafted JSON body.
- The request is sent to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint.
- The JSON body contains a command with a `param` field that is not an object.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the device's `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint.
- While most of the described vulnerabilities require a logged-in user, they can be exploited without authentication by using a separate vulnerability described in TALOS-2021-1420.

**Specific Details for CVE-2021-44401:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `PtzCtrl` command's JSON parameter parser.
- Sending a request with the `PtzCtrl` command where `param` is not a JSON object will trigger the vulnerability.
