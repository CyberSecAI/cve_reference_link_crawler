| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1203018#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-09-01 10:29:15 UTC  ``` Martin Wilck, to whom I recommended using our chkstat safe_open() code to solve his problem, noticed that we're missing group-write checks in our respective algorithm:  <https://github.com/openSUSE/permissions/blob/SLE-15-SP4/chkstat.c#L622>  This affects both the Factory version (C++) and the backported C code in SLE. It means that chkstat will not notice when permissions are to be applied in a path that is write-controlled by a non-root group.  The impact foremost is that e.g. setuid-root bits or capabilities could be handed out to untrusted binaries. In practice such constellations shouldn't occur often (or at all) in SUSE distributions but it still is a formal vulnerability. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1203018#c1)  Johannes Segitz   2022-09-01 11:17:38 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2022-31252 ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1203018#c2)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-09-02 11:08:17 UTC  ``` We're fixing this in the open, therefore publishing this bug.  I just opened a PR# [1] with a first shot at fixing this in the current C++ code. This also adds test coverage.
