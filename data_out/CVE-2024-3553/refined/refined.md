Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3553

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `hide_notices` function within the Tutor LMS plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to verify if an unauthenticated user has the necessary capabilities to perform the action of hiding registration notices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of authorization checks before allowing modification of settings related to hiding registration notices.
* **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Unauthorized Modification:** An attacker can enable user registration even if it has been disabled through the plugin's settings. This could lead to:
    * **Spam Registrations:** Attackers might enable registration to create numerous spam accounts.
    * **Unauthorized Access:** If registration is enabled where it shouldn't be, unauthorized individuals might gain access to site functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network:** The attack is performed remotely over the network.
* **Direct Request:** The attacker sends a crafted request to the vulnerable function, `hide_notices`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any existing account on the target WordPress site.
* **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to send requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerable function is located within the `classes/User.php` file of the Tutor LMS plugin.
* The fix involves adding a capability check (`current_user_can('manage_options')`) to ensure only users with the `manage_options` capability can modify the hide_notice setting.
* The vulnerability affects all versions of the Tutor LMS plugin up to and including version 2.6.2.
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.7.0
