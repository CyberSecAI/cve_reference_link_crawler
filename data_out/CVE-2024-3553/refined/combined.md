### Description

The Tutor LMS – eLearning and online course solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the hide\_notices function in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to enable user registration on sites that may have it disabled.
