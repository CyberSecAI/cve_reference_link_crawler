## Summary

DocsGPT is vulnerable to unauthenticated limited file write.

## Project

DocsGPT

## Tested Version

[v0.5.0](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/releases/tag/0.5.0)

## Details

### limited file write in `routes.py` (`GHSL-2023-250`)

The [check\_docs](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/blob/95fdedf12e4b938744055bf2bc2e4bbff66d3c28/application/api/user/routes.py#L195) endpoint concatenates user-controlled [POST data with a URL](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/blob/95fdedf12e4b938744055bf2bc2e4bbff66d3c28/application/api/user/routes.py#L201-L202), which allows for traversing the URL and changing the repository the files are downloaded from. The files are then saved on the server on lines as shown on line [214](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/blob/95fdedf12e4b938744055bf2bc2e4bbff66d3c28/application/api/user/routes.py#L214) and [219](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/blob/95fdedf12e4b938744055bf2bc2e4bbff66d3c28/application/api/user/routes.py#L219).

```
def check_docs():
    # check if docs exist in a vectorstore folder
    data = request.get_json()
    # split docs on / and take first part
    if data["docs"].split("/")[0] == "local":
        return {"status": "exists"}
    vectorstore = "vectors/" + data["docs"]
    base_path = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arc53/DocsHUB/main/"
    if os.path.exists(vectorstore) or data["docs"] == "default":
        return {"status": "exists"}
    else:
        r = requests.get(base_path + vectorstore + "index.faiss")

        if r.status_code != 200:
            return {"status": "null"}
        else:
            if not os.path.exists(vectorstore):
                os.makedirs(vectorstore)
            with open(vectorstore + "index.faiss", "wb") as f:
                f.write(r.content)

            # download the store
            r = requests.get(base_path + vectorstore + "index.pkl")
            with open(vectorstore + "index.pkl", "wb") as f:
                f.write(r.content)

```

The vulnerability was found with the help of [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/python/py-full-ssrf/).

#### Impact

This issue may lead to `limited file write`.
