- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the GlobalProtect portal feature of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected XSS (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows execution of malicious JavaScript in the context of a userâ€™s browser, enabling phishing attacks and potentially leading to credential theft.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user clicks on a malicious link.
