- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability (CWE-89).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform SQL injection attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or even complete compromise of the database.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the `adStatus` parameter in the URL when accessing the plugin's settings page via the WordPress admin panel (`options-general.php`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrative privileges within the WordPress instance.
