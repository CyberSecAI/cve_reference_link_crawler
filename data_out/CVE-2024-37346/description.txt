There is an insufficient input validation vulnerability in
the Warehouse component of Absolute Secure Access prior to 13.06. Attackers
with system administrator permissions can impair the availability of certain
elements of the Secure Access administrative UI by writing invalid data to the
warehouse over the network. There is no loss of warehouse integrity or
confidentiality, the security scope is unchanged. Loss of availability is high.
