  "CVE-2023-42253": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the \"Invioce No\", \"To\", and \"Mammul\" fields within the `add.php` page, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they visit the vulnerable page. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, or stealing of sensitive user information.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the web interface of the vulnerable Vehicle Management system. An attacker would inject a malicious script into the form fields of the `add.php` page which, when rendered, would execute the script.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to access the vulnerable web application and be able to input text into the specific fields within the add.php page. The attacker doesn't require any special privileges or positions other than the ability to use the forms of the application."
