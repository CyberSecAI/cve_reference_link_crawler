# Code Execution Vulnerability via Local File Path Traversal in Vnote

High

[tamlok](/tamlok)
published
GHSA-vhh5-8wcv-68gj
Jul 11, 2024

## Package

Vnote
(https://github.com/vnotex/vnote)

## Affected versions

3.17.0

## Patched versions

3.18.1

## Description

### Summary

A code execution vulnerability exists in VNote, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary programs on the victim's system.

### Description

A crafted URI can be used in a note to perform this attack using file:/// as a link. For example, file:///C:/WINDOWS/system32/cmd.exe. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary programs by embedding a reference to a local executable file such as file:///C:/WINDOWS/system32/cmd.exe and file:///C:/WINDOWS/system32/calc.exe. This vulnerability can be exploited by creating and sharing specially crafted notes. An attacker could send a crafted note file and perform further attacks.

### Affected Version Details

3.17.0

### Steps To Reproduce:

Create a note in VNote.

For reproduction, use binaries from C:/WINDOWS/system32/ as it is universally available on Windows OS.

Click on "Insert" and select the "Link" option.

Provide the "Text" for the hyperlink (e.g., "Click Me") and the "Link" to the executable (e.g., file:///C:/WINDOWS/system32/cmd.exe). Also, change the title so that on hover, no one can notice anything unusual.

Click on the "Apply" button to create the hyperlink.

Right-click on the "Click Me" hyperlink and select "Open in browser". Observe that C:/WINDOWS/system32/cmd.exe is executed on the system.
