{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition exists between `ffs_func_eps_disable` and `ffs_epfile_release`. When `ffs_func_eps_disable` is called during a composition switch and `ffs_epfile_release` is called from userspace at the same time, the `epfile` local copy becomes stale leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free due to a race condition.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The use-after-free vulnerability can lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a race condition that can be triggered when a USB gadget composition switch happens while the endpoint file is released from userspace.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to trigger the composition switch and also control the userspace interaction with the gadget's endpoint file."
