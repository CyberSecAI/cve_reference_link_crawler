- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing capability check on the `save` function within the Redirects plugin for WordPress.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization, allowing unauthorized modification of data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated attackers can change redirects, potentially leading to redirection to phishing sites or malicious web pages.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks; unauthenticated requests to the vulnerable `save` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special privileges or authentication is needed, the attacker just needs to be able to send requests to the server.
