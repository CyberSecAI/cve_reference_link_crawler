{
  "related": true,
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `sanitize_svg` function within the `lollms/security.py` file, specifically within the SVG sanitization process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper neutralization of input during web page generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability.",
       "Inadequate sanitization of SVG content."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious SVG content containing JavaScript, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks when the sanitized SVG is rendered within a web page. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "By submitting crafted SVG content through an application interface that uses the vulnerable `sanitize_svg` function."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to supply user-controlled input to the application, specifically crafted SVG content.",
      "Ability to inject malicious SVG content into the application which then uses this function"
    ],
    "additional_information": "The provided commit introduces changes to the `sanitize_svg` function which shows an attempt to improve sanitization, but the previous code was vulnerable because it did not properly remove all potentially dangerous elements and attributes. The old code used xpath to remove script elements and on* attributes, whereas the new code checks for allowed elements and attributes. The diff highlights the changes made to address this vulnerability."
