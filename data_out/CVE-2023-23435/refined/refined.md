{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect privilege assignment in the signature management of some Honor products.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability allows a forged system file to overwrite a correct system file due to improper privilege handling during signature verification.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to a forged system file overwriting a legitimate one, potentially resulting in device malfunction, compromise or other security issues.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves replacing a system file with a malicious one that bypasses signature checks due to the incorrect privilege assignment.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need the capability to craft a forged system file with a valid signature, and potentially require some level of access to the system to perform the replacement."
