{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The error from rpc_proc_register() in nfs_net_init() was ignored. When rpc_proc_register() fails, the nfs_net_init() still succeeds, which later results in nfs_net_exit() being called during net namespace destruction. This leads to remove_proc_entry() being called for a non-existent proc directory, triggering a warning.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Error handling",
      "Resource management"
    ],
    "impact": "A warning is triggered while destroying immature netns due to attempting to remove a non-existing proc directory. This doesn't seem to be a critical issue but indicates improper resource management within the kernel.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Creating and destroying network namespaces",
        "Triggering the failure of rpc_proc_register"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to create and destroy network namespaces which is usually available to unprivileged users. The attacker also needs to trigger an error in `rpc_proc_register`, which might require a specific environment or state of the system.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present since Linux 2.6.12-rc2. A commit introduced per-netns procfs which made the issue more visible."
