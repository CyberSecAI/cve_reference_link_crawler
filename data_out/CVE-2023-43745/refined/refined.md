Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** Improper input validation in Intel® Code Base Investigator (CBI) software.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  The software fails to properly validate user input, which allows for a denial-of-service condition.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS).
* **Attack Vectors:** Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated local user with user interaction (UI:R).

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is present in Intel® CBI software versions prior to 1.1.0.
* The provided document also gives the CVSS vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L`, which translates to:
    *   **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):**  The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the system.
    *   **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low):** The attack is relatively easy to perform.
    *   **PR:L (Privileges Required: Low):** The attacker needs only low-level user privileges.
    *  **UI:R (User Interaction: Required):** The attack requires some form of user interaction.
    *   **S:U (Scope: Unchanged):** The vulnerability only affects the component it is found in.
    *   **C:N (Confidentiality: None):** There is no impact on data confidentiality.
    *   **I:N (Integrity: None):** There is no impact on data integrity.
    *   **A:L (Availability: Low):** There is a low impact on the availability of the system.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS Base Score of 2.8, which is considered Low severity.
* Intel has released software updates (version 1.1.0 and later) to mitigate the vulnerability.
