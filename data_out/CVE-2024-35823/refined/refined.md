Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35823:

**1. Verification:**
The provided content clearly relates to CVE-2024-35823. The commit messages across multiple sources reference a fix for "unicode buffer corruption when deleting characters" in the Linux kernel's virtual terminal (vt) driver, which is the vulnerability addressed by this CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the usage of `memcpy` instead of `memmove` within the `vc_uniscr_delete` function in `drivers/tty/vt/vt.c`. This function handles the deletion of characters in the virtual console's unicode screen buffer. When deleting characters, the source and destination memory regions overlap, and `memcpy` does not handle overlapping regions correctly.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Memory corruption:** The use of `memcpy` with overlapping memory regions leads to memory corruption. When deleting characters from the screen, the function attempts to shift existing characters to the left to overwrite the deleted character. However, with `memcpy`, the overlapping memory can cause the data to be copied incorrectly, which can result in garbage characters displayed on the virtual terminal.
- **Incorrect buffer handling:** The code did not account for the potential overlap when moving characters within the buffer. This highlights a flaw in buffer management within the `vc_uniscr_delete` function.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
- **Display Corruption:** The direct impact of this vulnerability is screen corruption in the virtual terminal when deleting characters. This is primarily a usability issue, but could become a problem during activities such as text editing or viewing log data.
- **Potential for further issues**: While not explicitly stated in the provided text, memory corruption issues can sometimes lead to more severe issues such as crashes or even privilege escalation, though this isn't a stated impact in the fix description.

**5. Attack vectors:**
- **User interaction with the virtual terminal:** The vulnerability is triggered by a user deleting characters in the virtual console, meaning the user must perform the actions to trigger the bug.
- **Command line editing**: The issue is specifically noted in the commit messages as fixing "line garbage in virtual console on command line edition," implying that command line input/editing is a primary attack vector.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local user:** An attacker would need to be a local user who can interact with the virtual terminal to trigger the bug by deleting characters.
- **No special privileges needed:** The vulnerability is triggered by a standard user action within the virtual terminal, meaning no special privileges are needed to cause the vulnerability.

**Summary of Fix:**
The fix implemented to address the vulnerability replaces the `memcpy` function call with `memmove`. The `memmove` function is designed to handle overlapping memory regions safely, preventing the data corruption that occurred with `memcpy`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is described as being similar to a previously fixed bug in the VGA text buffer, further suggesting the root cause is the incorrect use of `memcpy`.
*   The fix is backported to multiple stable kernel branches as evidenced by the multiple commit IDs
* The Debian Security Advisories lists the CVE as one of many vulnerabilities fixed in updates for multiple kernel versions.
