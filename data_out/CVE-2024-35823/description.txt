In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vt: fix unicode buffer corruption when deleting characters

This is the same issue that was fixed for the VGA text buffer in commit
39cdb68c64d8 ("vt: fix memory overlapping when deleting chars in the
buffer"). The cure is also the same i.e. replace memcpy() with memmove()
due to the overlaping buffers.
