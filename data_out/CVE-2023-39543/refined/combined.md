- MySQL.

##### Responsibility / Liability

correct reported errors and problems whenever possible. However, LuxSoft accepts
no responsibility or liability whatsoever with regard to the use of the LuxCal
calendar, nor the data stored by the LuxCal calendar.

##### Other LuxSoft Applications

To keep our programming knowledge cutting edge, we used spare moments, or
moments when working on the LuxCal calendar became too obsessive, to produce
some high quality small applications, using a minimum of code:

* LuxFile: A light-weight server file viewer application, which you can find
  in the Gems menu, or by clicking
  [here](https://www.luxsoft.eu/?luxfile).
* LuxFind: A light-weight server file text search application, which you can
  also find in the Gems menu, or by clicking
  [here](https://www.luxsoft.eu/?luxfind).
* LuxLog: A light weight hit logger, logging each visit to your website(s),
  which you can also find in the Gems menu, or by clicking
  [here](https://www.luxsoft.eu/?luxlog).
* LuxView: A general CSV file viewer to view your server side CSV files in your
  browser. See the Gems menu, or click
  [here](https://www.luxsoft.eu/?luxview).
* Several small JavaScript applets to make announcements on your website in an
  eye-catching way, which you can find in the Smile menu, or by clicking
  [here](https://www.luxsoft.eu/?jsapplets).
* A number of small JavaScript games, which can be run from a website or from
  your computer. You can find them in the Smile menu, or by clicking
  [here](https://www.luxsoft.eu/?jsgames).
