### Description

The QQWorld Auto Save Images plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the save\_remote\_images\_get\_auto\_saved\_results() function hooked via a norpriv AJAX in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the contents of arbitrary posts that may not be public.
