### Analysis of CVE-2024-1324

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content from wordfence.com directly relates to CVE-2024-1324, describing a missing authorization vulnerability in the QQWorld Auto Save Images plugin. It matches the CVE description by stating "Missing Authorization to Arbitrary Post Content Retrieval"
   - The vulnerability is in the `save_remote_images_get_auto_saved_results()` function.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check within the `save_remote_images_get_auto_saved_results()` function. This function, accessible via an AJAX action, does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions to access the requested post content.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Missing Authorization:** The core weakness is the absence of an authorization check, allowing unauthorized access to data.
   - **Insecure AJAX Handling:** The plugin exposes a sensitive function via AJAX without proper permission controls, making it accessible to unauthenticated users.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary Post Content Retrieval:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve the content of any post, including those that are not intended to be public (e.g., draft posts, private content, etc.)
   - **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information contained in posts could be exposed to attackers.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Network:** The attack is performed over the network using AJAX requests.
   - **Direct Function Call:** Attackers can trigger the vulnerable function directly through the AJAX endpoint.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Unauthenticated User:** No login or special privileges are required.
   - **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable WordPress website.
   - **Knowledge of Plugin:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable function and how to access it via AJAX.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided code confirms the existence of the `save_remote_images_get_auto_saved_results` function which is hooked to the `wp_ajax_nopriv_save_remote_images-get-auto-saved-results` and therefore available to unauthenticated users. The code also provides context about the plugin, and its functionality related to fetching and saving images.
* The Wordfence description provides additional context from a security point of view which is missing from the WordPress plugin code.
