| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2165722#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2023-01-30 20:54:18 UTC  ``` A modified, unauthenticated server can send an unterminated string during the establishment of Kerberos transport encryption. When a libpq client application has a Kerberos credential cache and doesn't explicitly disable option "gssencmode", a server can cause libpq to over-read and report an error message containing uninitialized bytes from and following its receive buffer. If libpq's caller somehow makes that message accessible to the attacker, this achieves a disclosure of the over-read bytes. We have not confirmed or ruled out viability of attacks that arrange for a crash or for presence of notable, confidential information in disclosed bytes.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2165722#c4)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2023-02-15 15:07:04 UTC  ``` Created postgresql-jdbc tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2170071](show_bug.cgi?id=2170071 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2022-41862 postgresql-jdbc: postgresql: Client memory disclosure when connecting with Kerberos to modified server [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2165722#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-04-04 09:46:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2023:1576 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:1576](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A1576)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2165722#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-04-11 14:24:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2023:1693 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:1693](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A1693)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2165722#c10)  Product Security DevOps Team    2023-04-11 19:35:58 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
