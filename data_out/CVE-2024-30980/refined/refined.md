Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input validation in the `/edit-computer-detail.php` component of the Cyber Cafe Management System (CCMS) allows for the execution of arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is SQL Injection. The system fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the "Computer Location" parameter is vulnerable.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to:
    *   Manipulation of the system's behavior.
    *   Access to sensitive data.
    *   Potential data loss.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through the web interface of the CCMS.
    *   Specifically, the vulnerable parameter is "Computer Location" within the edit computer details page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have access to the CCMS system, implying they would need to be a valid user or have bypassed authentication.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to navigate to the "manage-computer.php" page and have the ability to edit computer details.
