Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The application directly incorporates user input (`txtphone`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or the use of prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `txtphone` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can potentially manipulate the database, including reading sensitive data, modifying information, or potentially gaining control of the database server. As demonstrated in the provided SQLmap output, an attacker can successfully extract the current database user `root@localhost`.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted POST request to `/Admin/edit_profile.php`, where the `txtphone` parameter contains malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint (`/Admin/edit_profile.php`).
*   The attacker does not require authentication to reach the page; however, the vulnerable code snippet is within an authenticated session.
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter, which is `txtphone`.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located within `/Admin/edit_profile.php`.
*   The vulnerable SQL query is constructed using string concatenation, not prepared statements.
*   The vulnerability was tested on a system using PHP, Apache, and MySQL.
*   The SQLmap tool was used to confirm the SQL injection vulnerability.
