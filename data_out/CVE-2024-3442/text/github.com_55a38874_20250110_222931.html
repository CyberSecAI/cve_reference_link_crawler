Prison Management System - SQL Injection on (/Employee/delete\_leave.php)

Vendor Homepage:

```
https://www.sourcecodester.com/sql/17287/prison-management-system.html

```

Version:

```
V1.0

```

Tested on:

```
PHP, Apache, MySQL

```

Crudentials:

```
http://url:8888/Account/login.php
releaseme@gmail.com
escobar2012

```

Affected Page:

```
/Employee/delete_leave.php

```

In this scenario, user input (id) is directly incorporated into an SQL query without any filtering or prepared statements, making the application susceptible to SQL Injection attacks.

```
11: mysqli_query $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);
10: $sql = "DELETE From `tblleave` where leaveID ='$id'";
9: $id = $_GET['id'];

```
