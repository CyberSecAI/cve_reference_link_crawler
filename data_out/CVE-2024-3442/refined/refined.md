Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the direct incorporation of user-supplied input (`id` parameter) into an SQL query within the `/Employee/delete_leave.php` file without proper sanitization or the use of prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it constructs SQL queries using user-provided input without any validation or escaping. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker can manipulate or delete data within the database by injecting malicious SQL queries. As seen in the provided sqlmap output, the attacker can retrieve the database user `root@localhost`.
*   **Potential Full System Compromise:** If the database user has sufficient privileges, the attacker could potentially achieve full control over the database server and, in some cases, the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/Employee/delete_leave.php` endpoint, specifically by manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know the parameter (`id`) that is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Basic SQL knowledge:** A basic understanding of SQL syntax is needed to craft malicious queries. Tools like `sqlmap` can assist in this.
*   **Login Credentials:** While not directly part of the exploit, the provided credentials indicate that an attacker with access to an account would have the opportunity to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is:
    ```php
    $sql = "DELETE From `tblleave` where leaveID ='$id'";
    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);
    ```
    where `$id` is directly obtained from the GET request without any processing.

**Additional Information from the provided content**

*   **Vendor:** Sourcecodester
*   **Product:** Prison Management System
*   **Version:** 1.0
*   **Affected URL:** `/Employee/delete_leave.php`
*   **Proof of Concept:** The provided content includes a sample GET request to trigger the vulnerability and an example of using `sqlmap` to confirm SQL injection.

This is a classic example of a SQL injection vulnerability, and the provided information clearly outlines the issue and its exploitability.
