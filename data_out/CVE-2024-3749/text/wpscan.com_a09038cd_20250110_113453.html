## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# SP Project & Document Manager <= 4.71 - Subscriber+ File Download via IDOR

### Description

The plugin lacks proper access controllers and allows a logged in user to view and download files belonging to another user

### Proof of Concept

As a logged in user, send a GET request:
GET /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=cdm\_file\_list&uid=3(CHANGE HERE)&pid=0(CHANGE HERE)&search=&\_=1708406394720
You can view files and directories owned by other users by manipulating the `uid` and `pid` parameters
That information can then be leveraged to download the files.
