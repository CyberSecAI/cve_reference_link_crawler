- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "Expert Invoice" does not properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input when creating a new customer, leading to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization and escaping.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's customer creation feature. An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the customer name field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator (or other high-privileged user) in the WordPress dashboard to access the plugin settings and create a customer.
