## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Expert Invoice <= 1.0.2 -Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Navigate to Expert Invoice >> Customers >> Add Customer, and set the payload below as the name for this customer:
<img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie) />
2. Click on "Ok"
3. You will observe that the payload was stored in the database, the JavaScript payload was executed successfully, and we got a pop-up.
