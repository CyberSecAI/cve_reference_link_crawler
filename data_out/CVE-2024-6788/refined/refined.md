- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default (CWE-1188).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote unauthenticated attacker can reset the password for the low-privileged "user-app" account to its default value.
- **Attack vectors**: The firmware update feature on the LAN interface of the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to access the device's LAN interface and initiate a firmware update.
