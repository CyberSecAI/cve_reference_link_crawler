- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authentication for a critical function (configuration export) in the web-based management interface of WAGO programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and touch panels.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated access to download backup files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can download backup files containing sensitive information such as credentials and cryptographic material.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the web-based management interface of affected WAGO devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the affected devices and does not need any prior authentication. A valid user must have created a backup with selected content after the last reboot for the attack to succeed.
