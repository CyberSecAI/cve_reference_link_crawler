**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Administrator Privilege:** The patchstack content specifies that an attacker needs administrator privileges to exploit this vulnerability, suggesting that the vulnerable areas are accessible by admins.

**Additional Notes**
* The changelog provides a good view of the security improvements made to the plugin over time.
* The plugin has a history of XSS vulnerabilities, as indicated by the multiple fixes in the changelog.
