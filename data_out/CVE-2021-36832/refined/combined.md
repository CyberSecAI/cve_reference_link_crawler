How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

## FAQ

### Messages look broken / formatting is weird…

This is most likely due to CSS conflicts with the current theme. We suggest using simple formatting for messages. You can also write custom CSS in your theme to fix any problems.

### Extra Line Breaks / Paragraphs in messages…

Go to HTML mode in content editor and pull your custom HTML code all together in one line. Don’t leave blank lines between two tags. That should fix it.

### How do I add custom CSS for messages?

You can use custom CSS/JS inline in your message HTML. You can also use your theme’s custom JS / CSS feature to add your changes.

### Optin Forms / Mailing service integration…

You can embed any opt-in / subscription form to your Icegram Engage messages using HTML code. You may even use a shortcode if you are using a WP plugin from your newsletter/lead capture service.

Use the “Embed Form” button above the text editor to paste in HTML code from your mailing list service and let Icegram Engage automatically “clean it up” for usage in Icegram Engage messages.

### Preview does not work / not refreshing…

Doing a browser refresh while previewing will not show your most recent changes. Click the ‘Preview’ button to see a preview with your latest changes.

### Can I use shortcodes in a message?

Yes! Messages support shortcodes. You may need to adjust CSS so the shortcode output looks good in your message.

### I can’t find a way to do X…

Icegram Engage is actively developed. If you can’t find your favorite feature (or have a suggestion) contact us. We’d love to hear from you.

### I’m facing a problem and can’t find a way out…

Contact Us, provide as much detail of the problem as you can. We will try to solve the problem ASAP.

I only needed a quick and fast alert banner for a CTA and Icegram came recommended.It installed easily and I was able to quickly add a CTA banner and a pop up verification.There are so many other features available on the Pro version I did not know I needed and will be exploring those to increase the functionality of my basic site.

This plugin always works how it’s supposed to, I haven’t had any issues with sending (though that will depend on your hosting), and the support is usually very fast.
