# Settings[¶](#settings "Link to this heading")

The `wagtail.contrib.settings` module allows you to define models that hold
settings which are either common across all site records or specific to each site.

Settings are editable by administrators within the Wagtail admin and can be
accessed in code as well as in templates.

## Installation[¶](#installation "Link to this heading")

Add `wagtail.contrib.settings` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```
INSTALLED_APPS += [
    'wagtail.contrib.settings',
]

```

**Note:** If you are using `settings` within templates, you will also need to
update your `TEMPLATES` settings (discussed later in this page).

## Defining settings[¶](#defining-settings "Link to this heading")

Create a model that inherits from either:

* `BaseGenericSetting` for generic settings across all sites
* `BaseSiteSetting` for site-specific settings

and register it using the `register_setting` decorator:

```
from django.db import models
from wagtail.contrib.settings.models import (
    BaseGenericSetting,
    BaseSiteSetting,
    register_setting,
)

@register_setting
class GenericSocialMediaSettings(BaseGenericSetting):
    facebook = models.URLField()

@register_setting
class SiteSpecificSocialMediaSettings(BaseSiteSetting):
    facebook = models.URLField()

```

Links to your settings will appear in the Wagtail admin ‘Settings’ menu.

## Edit handlers[¶](#edit-handlers "Link to this heading")

Settings use edit handlers much like the rest of Wagtail.
Add a `panels` setting to your model defining all the edit handlers required:

```
@register_setting
class GenericImportantPages(BaseGenericSetting):
    donate_page = models.ForeignKey(
        'wagtailcore.Page', null=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, related_name='+'
    )
    sign_up_page = models.ForeignKey(
        'wagtailcore.Page', null=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, related_name='+'
    )

    panels = [
        FieldPanel('donate_page'),
        FieldPanel('sign_up_page'),
    ]

@register_setting
class SiteSpecificImportantPages(BaseSiteSetting):
    donate_page = models.ForeignKey(
        'wagtailcore.Page', null=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, related_name='+'
    )
    sign_up_page = models.ForeignKey(
        'wagtailcore.Page', null=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, related_name='+'
    )

    panels = [
        FieldPanel('donate_page'),
        FieldPanel('sign_up_page'),
    ]

```

You can also customize the edit handlers [like you would do for `Page` model](../../advanced_topics/customisation/page_editing_interface.html#customising-the-tabbed-interface) with a custom `edit_handler` attribute:

```
from wagtail.admin.panels import TabbedInterface, ObjectList

@register_setting
class MySettings(BaseGenericSetting):
    # ...
    first_tab_panels = [
        FieldPanel('field_1'),
    ]
    second_tab_panels = [
        FieldPanel('field_2'),
    ]

    edit_handler = TabbedInterface([
        ObjectList(first_tab_panels, heading='First tab'),
        ObjectList(second_tab_panels, heading='Second tab'),
    ])

```

## Appearance[¶](#appearance "Link to this heading")

You can change the label used in the menu by changing the
`verbose_name` of your model.

You can add an icon to the menu by passing an `icon` argument to the
`register_setting` decorator:

```
@register_setting(icon='placeholder')
class GenericSocialMediaSettings(BaseGenericSetting):
    ...
    class Meta:
        verbose_name = "Social media settings for all sites"

@register_setting(icon='placeholder')
class SiteSpecificSocialMediaSettings(BaseSiteSetting):
    ...
    class Meta:
        verbose_name = "Site-specific social media settings"

```

Wagtail’s default icon set can be seen in our [icons overview](../../advanced_topics/icons.html#icons). All icons available in a given project are displayed in the [styleguide](../../contributing/styleguide.html#styleguide).

## Using the settings[¶](#using-the-settings "Link to this heading")

Settings can be used in both Python code and in templates.

### Using in Python[¶](#using-in-python "Link to this heading")

#### Generic settings[¶](#generic-settings "Link to this heading")

If you require access to a generic setting in a view, the
`BaseGenericSetting.load()` method allows you to retrieve the generic
settings:

```
def view(request):
    social_media_settings = GenericSocialMediaSettings.load(request_or_site=request)
    ...

```

#### Site-specific settings[¶](#site-specific-settings "Link to this heading")

If you require access to a site-specific setting in a view, the
`BaseSiteSetting.for_request()` method allows you to retrieve the site-specific
settings for the current request:

```
def view(request):
    social_media_settings = SiteSpecificSocialMediaSettings.for_request(request=request)
    ...

```

In places where the request is unavailable, but you know the `Site` you wish to
retrieve settings for, you can use
`BaseSiteSetting.for_site` instead:

```
def view(request):
    social_media_settings = SiteSpecificSocialMediaSettings.for_site(site=user.origin_site)
    ...

```

### Using in Django templates[¶](#using-in-django-templates "Link to this heading")

Add the `wagtail.contrib.settings.context_processors.settings`
context processor to your settings:

```
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        ...

        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                ...

                'wagtail.contrib.settings.context_processors.settings',
            ]
        }
    }
]

```

Then access the generic settings through `{{ settings }}`:

```
{{ settings.app_label.GenericSocialMediaSettings.facebook }}
{{ settings.app_label.SiteSpecificSocialMediaSettings.facebook }}

```

**Note:** Replace `app_label` with the label of the app containing your
settings model.

If you are not in a `RequestContext`, then context processors will not have
run, and the `settings` variable will not be available. To get the
`settings`, use the provided `{% get_settings %}` template tag.

```
{% load wagtailsettings_tags %}
{% get_settings %}
{{ settings.app_label.GenericSocialMediaSettings.facebook }}
{{ settings.app_label.SiteSpecificSocialMediaSettings.facebook }}

```

By default, the tag will create or update a `settings` variable in the
context. If you want to assign to a different context variable instead, use
`{% get_settings as other_variable_name %}`:

```
{% load wagtailsettings_tags %}
{% get_settings as wagtail_settings %}
{{ wagtail_settings.app_label.GenericSocialMediaSettings.facebook }}
{{ wagtail_settings.app_label.SiteSpecificSocialMediaSettings.facebook }}

```

### Using in Jinja2 templates[¶](#using-in-jinja2-templates "Link to this heading")

Add `wagtail.contrib.settings.jinja2tags.settings` extension to your
Jinja2 settings:

```
TEMPLATES = [
    ...

    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.jinja2.Jinja2',
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'extensions': [
                ...

                'wagtail.contrib.settings.jinja2tags.settings',
            ],
        },
    }
]

```

Then access the settings through the `settings()` template function:

```
{{ settings("app_label.GenericSocialMediaSettings").facebook }}
{{ settings("app_label.SiteSpecificSocialMediaSettings").facebook }}

```

**Note:** Replace `app_label` with the label of the app containing your
settings model.

If there is no `request` available in the template at all, you can use the
settings for the default site instead:

```
{{ settings("app_label.GenericSocialMediaSettings", use_default_site=True).facebook }}
{{ settings("app_label.SiteSpecificSocialMediaSettings", use_default_site=True).facebook }}

```

**Note:** You can not reliably get the correct settings instance for the
current site from this template tag if the request object is not available.
This is only relevant for multi-site instances of Wagtail.

You can store the settings instance in a variable to save some typing,
if you have to use multiple values from one model:

```
{% with generic_social_settings=settings("app_label.GenericSocialMediaSettings") %}
    Follow us on Facebook at {{ generic_social_settings.facebook }},
    or Instagram at @{{ generic_social_settings.instagram }}.
{% endwith %}

{% with site_social_settings=settings("app_label.SiteSpecificSocialMediaSettings") %}
    Follow us on Facebook at {{ site_social_settings.facebook }},
    or Instagram at {{ site_social_settings.instagram }}.
{% endwith %}

```

Or, alternately, using the `set` tag:

```
{% set generic_social_settings=settings("app_label.GenericSocialMediaSettings") %}
{% set site_social_settings=settings("app_label.SiteSpecificSocialMediaSettings") %}

```

## Utilising `select_related` to improve efficiency[¶](#utilising-select-related-to-improve-efficiency "Link to this heading")

For models with foreign key relationships to other objects (for example pages),
which are very often needed to output values in templates, you can set
the `select_related` attribute on your model to have Wagtail utilize
Django’s [QuerySet.select\_related()](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/querysets/#select-related)
method to fetch the settings object and related objects in a single query.
With this, the initial query is more complex, but you will be able to
freely access the foreign key values without any additional queries,
making things more efficient overall.

Building on the `GenericImportantPages` example from the previous section, the
following shows how `select_related` can be set to improve efficiency:

```
@register_setting
class GenericImportantPages(BaseGenericSetting):

    # Fetch these pages when looking up GenericImportantPages for or a site
    select_related = ["donate_page", "sign_up_page"]

    donate_page = models.ForeignKey(
        'wagtailcore.Page', null=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, related_name='+'
    )
    sign_up_page = models.ForeignKey(
        'wagtailcore.Page', null=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, related_name='+'
    )

    panels = [
        FieldPanel('donate_page'),
        FieldPanel('sign_up_page'),
    ]

```

With these additions, the following template code will now trigger
a single database query instead of three (one to fetch the settings,
and two more to fetch each page):

```
{% load wagtailcore_tags %}
{% pageurl settings.app_label.GenericImportantPages.donate_page %}
{% pageurl settings.app_label.GenericImportantPages.sign_up_page %}

```

## Utilising the `page_url` setting shortcut[¶](#utilising-the-page-url-setting-shortcut "Link to this heading")

If, like in the previous section, your settings model references pages,
and you often need to output the URLs of those pages in your project,
you can likely use the setting model’s `page_url` shortcut to do that more
cleanly. For example, instead of doing the following:

```
{% load wagtailcore_tags %}
{% pageurl settings.app_label.GenericImportantPages.donate_page %}
{% pageurl settings.app_label.GenericImportantPages.sign_up_page %}

```

You could write:

```
{{ settings.app_label.GenericImportantPages.page_url.donate_page }}
{{ settings.app_label.GenericImportantPages.page_url.sign_up_page }}

```

Using the `page_url` shortcut has a few of advantages over using the tag:

1. The ‘specific’ page is automatically fetched to generate the URL,
   so you don’t have to worry about doing this (or forgetting to do this)
   yourself.
2. The results are cached, so if you need to access the same page URL
   in more than one place (for example in a form and in footer navigation), using
   the `page_url` shortcut will be more efficient.
3. It’s more concise, and the syntax is the same whether using it in templates
   or views (or other Python code), allowing you to write more consistent
   code.

When using the `page_url` shortcut, there are a couple of points worth noting:

1. The same limitations that apply to the `{% pageurl %}` tag apply to the
   shortcut: If the settings are accessed from a template context where the
   current request is not available, all URLs returned will include the
   site’s scheme/domain, and URL generation will not be quite as efficient.
2. If using the shortcut in views or other Python code, the method will
   raise an `AttributeError` if the attribute you request from `page_url`
   is not an attribute on the settings object.
3. If the settings object DOES have the attribute, but the attribute returns
   a value of `None` (or something that is not a `Page`), the shortcut
   will return an empty string.

# Permission check bypass when editing a model with per-field restrictions through `wagtail.contrib.settings` or `ModelViewSet`

Low

[gasman](/gasman)
published
GHSA-w2v8-php4-p8hc

## Package

pip

wagtail
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

6.0 - 6.0.2

## Patched versions

6.0.3, 6.1

## Description

### Impact

If a model has been made available for editing through the [`wagtail.contrib.settings`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/settings.html) module or [`ModelViewSet`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/extending/generic_views.html#modelviewset), and the [`permission` argument on `FieldPanel`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/pages/panels.html#wagtail.admin.panels.FieldPanel.permission) has been used to further restrict access to one or more fields of the model, a user with edit permission over the model but not the specific field can craft an HTTP POST request that bypasses the permission check on the individual field, allowing them to update its value.

The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin, or by a user who has not been granted edit access to the model in question. The editing interfaces for pages and snippets are also unaffected.

### Patches

Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 6.0.3 and 6.1. Wagtail releases prior to 6.0 are unaffected.

### Workarounds

Site owners who are unable to upgrade to a patched version can avoid the vulnerability in `ModelViewSet` by registering the model as a snippet instead. No workaround is available for `wagtail.contrib.settings`.

### Acknowledgements

Many thanks to Ben Morse and Joshua Munn for reporting this issue.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Generic views[¶](#generic-views "Link to this heading")

Wagtail provides several generic views for handling common tasks such as creating / editing model instances and chooser modals. For convenience, these views are bundled in [viewsets](../reference/viewsets.html#viewsets-reference).

## ModelViewSet[¶](#modelviewset "Link to this heading")

The [`ModelViewSet`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet") class provides the views for listing, creating, editing, and deleting model instances. For example, if we have the following model:

```
from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

    def __str__(self):
        return "%s %s" % (self.first_name, self.last_name)

```

The following definition (to be placed in the same app’s `views.py`) will generate a set of views for managing Person instances:

```
from wagtail.admin.viewsets.model import ModelViewSet
from .models import Person

class PersonViewSet(ModelViewSet):
    model = Person
    form_fields = ["first_name", "last_name"]
    icon = "user"
    add_to_admin_menu = True
    copy_view_enabled = False
    inspect_view_enabled = True

person_viewset = PersonViewSet("person")  # defines /admin/person/ as the base URL

```

This viewset can then be registered with the Wagtail admin to make it available under the URL `/admin/person/`, by adding the following to `wagtail_hooks.py`:

```
from wagtail import hooks

from .views import person_viewset

@hooks.register("register_admin_viewset")
def register_viewset():
    return person_viewset

```

The viewset can be further customized by overriding other attributes and methods.

### Icon[¶](#icon "Link to this heading")

You can define an [`icon`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.icon "wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.icon") attribute on the `ModelViewSet` to specify the icon that is used across the views in the viewset. The `icon` needs to be [registered in the Wagtail icon library](../advanced_topics/icons.html).

### URL prefix and namespace[¶](#url-prefix-and-namespace "Link to this heading")

The [`url_prefix`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.url_prefix "wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.url_prefix") and [`url_namespace`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.url_namespace "wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.url_namespace") properties can be overridden to use a custom URL prefix and namespace for the views. If unset, they default to the model’s `model_name`.

### Menu item[¶](#menu-item "Link to this heading")

By default, registering a `ModelViewSet` will not register a main menu item. To add a menu item, set [`add_to_admin_menu`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.add_to_admin_menu "wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.add_to_admin_menu") to `True`. Alternatively, if you want to add the menu item inside the “Settings” menu, you can set [`add_to_settings_menu`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.add_to_settings_menu "wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.add_to_settings_menu") to `True`. Unless [`menu_icon`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.menu_icon "wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.menu_icon") is specified, the menu will use the same [`icon`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.icon "wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.icon") used for the views. The [`menu_url`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.menu_url "wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.menu_url") property can be overridden to customize the menu item’s link, which defaults to the listing view for the model.

Unless specified, the menu item will be labeled after the model’s verbose name. You can customize the menu item’s label, name, and order by setting the [`menu_label`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.menu_label "wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.menu_label"), [`menu_name`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.menu_name "wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.menu_name"), and [`menu_order`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.menu_order "wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.menu_order") attributes respectively. If you would like to customize the `MenuItem` instance completely, you could override the [`get_menu_item()`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.get_menu_item "wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSet.get_menu_item") method.

You can group multiple `ModelViewSet`s’ menu items inside a single top-level menu item using the [`ModelViewSetGroup`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSetGroup "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSetGroup") class. It is similar to `ViewSetGroup`, except it takes the [`app_label`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/options/#django.db.models.Options.app_label "(in Django v5.1)") of the first viewset’s model as the default [`menu_label`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSetGroup.menu_label "wagtail.admin.viewsets.base.ViewSetGroup.menu_label"). Refer to [the examples for `ViewSetGroup`](admin_views.html#using-base-viewsetgroup) for more details.

### Listing view[¶](#listing-view "Link to this heading")

The [`list_display`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.list_display "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.list_display") attribute can be set to specify the columns shown on the listing view. To customize the number of items to be displayed per page, you can set the [`list_per_page`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.list_per_page "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.list_per_page") attribute. Additionally, the [`ordering`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.ordering "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.ordering") attribute can be used to override the `default_ordering` configured in the listing view.

You can add the ability to filter the listing view by defining a [`list_filter`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.list_filter "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.list_filter") attribute and specifying the list of fields to filter. Wagtail uses the django-filter package under the hood, and this attribute will be passed as django-filter’s `FilterSet.Meta.fields` attribute. This means you can also pass a dictionary that maps the field name to a list of lookups.

If you would like to make further customizations to the filtering mechanism, you can also use a custom `wagtail.admin.filters.WagtailFilterSet` subclass by overriding the [`filterset_class`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.filterset_class "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.filterset_class") attribute. The `list_filter` attribute is ignored if `filterset_class` is set. For more details, refer to [django-filter’s documentation](https://django-filter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/usage.html#the-filter).

You can add the ability to export the listing view to a spreadsheet by setting the [`list_export`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.list_export "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.list_export") attribute to specify the columns to be exported. The [`export_filename`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.export_filename "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.export_filename") attribute can be used to customize the file name of the exported spreadsheet.

### Create and edit views[¶](#create-and-edit-views "Link to this heading")

You can define a `panels` or `edit_handler` attribute on the `ModelViewSet` or your Django model to use Wagtail’s panels mechanism. For more details, see [Panels](forms.html#forms-panels-overview).

If neither `panels` nor `edit_handler` is defined and the [`get_edit_handler()`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.get_edit_handler "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.get_edit_handler") method is not overridden, the form will be rendered as a plain Django form. You can customize the form by setting the [`form_fields`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.form_fields "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.form_fields") attribute to specify the fields to be shown on the form. Alternatively, you can set the [`exclude_form_fields`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.exclude_form_fields "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.exclude_form_fields") attribute to specify the fields to be excluded from the form. If panels are not used, you must define `form_fields` or `exclude_form_fields`, unless [`get_form_class()`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.get_form_class "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.get_form_class") is overridden.

### Copy view[¶](#copy-view "Link to this heading")

The copy view is enabled by default and will be accessible by users with the ‘add’ permission on the model. To disable it, set [`copy_view_enabled`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.copy_view_enabled "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.copy_view_enabled") to `False`.

The view’s form will be generated in the same way as create or edit forms. To use a custom form, override the `copy_view_class` and modify the `form_class` property on that class.

### Inspect view[¶](#inspect-view "Link to this heading")

The inspect view is disabled by default, as it’s not often useful for most models. However, if you need a view that enables users to view more detailed information about an instance without the option to edit it, you can enable the inspect view by setting [`inspect_view_enabled`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.inspect_view_enabled "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.inspect_view_enabled") on your `ModelViewSet` class.

When inspect view is enabled, an ‘Inspect’ button will automatically appear for each row on the listing view, which takes you to a view that shows a list of field values for that particular instance.

By default, all ‘concrete’ fields (where the field value is stored as a column in the database table for your model) will be shown. You can customize what values are displayed by specifying the [`inspect_view_fields`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.inspect_view_fields "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.inspect_view_fields") or the [`inspect_view_fields_exclude`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.inspect_view_fields_exclude "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.inspect_view_fields_exclude") attributes on your `ModelViewSet` class.

### Templates[¶](#templates "Link to this heading")

If [`template_prefix`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.template_prefix "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.template_prefix") is set, Wagtail will look for the views’ templates in the following directories within your project or app, before resorting to the defaults:

1. `templates/{template_prefix}/{app_label}/{model_name}/`
2. `templates/{template_prefix}/{app_label}/`
3. `templates/{template_prefix}/`

To override the template used by the `IndexView` for example, you could create a new `index.html` template and put it in one of those locations. For example, given `custom/campaign` as the `template_prefix` and a `Shirt` model in a `merch` app, you could add your custom template as `templates/custom/campaign/merch/shirt/index.html`.

For some common views, Wagtail also allows you to override the template used by overriding the `{view_name}_template_name` property on the viewset. The following is a list of customization points for the views:

* `IndexView`: `index.html` or [`index_template_name`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.index_template_name "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.index_template_name")

  + For the results fragment used in AJAX responses (e.g. when searching), customize `index_results.html` or [`index_results_template_name`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.index_results_template_name "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.index_results_template_name")
* `CreateView`: `create.html` or [`create_template_name`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.create_template_name "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.create_template_name")
* `EditView`: `edit.html` or [`edit_template_name`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.edit_template_name "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.edit_template_name")
* `DeleteView`: `delete.html` or [`delete_template_name`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.delete_template_name "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.delete_template_name")
* `HistoryView`: `history.html` or [`history_template_name`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.history_template_name "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.history_template_name")
* `InspectView`: `inspect.html` or [`inspect_template_name`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.inspect_template_name "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.inspect_template_name")

### Other customizations[¶](#other-customizations "Link to this heading")

By default, the model registered with a `ModelViewSet` will also be registered to the [reference index](../advanced_topics/reference_index.html#managing-the-reference-index). You can turn off this behavior by setting [`add_to_reference_index`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.add_to_reference_index "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet.add_to_reference_index") to `False`.

Various additional attributes are available to customize the viewset - see the [`ModelViewSet`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet "wagtail.admin.viewsets.model.ModelViewSet") documentation.

## ChooserViewSet[¶](#chooserviewset "Link to this heading")

The [`ChooserViewSet`](../reference/viewsets.html#wagtail.admin.viewsets.chooser.ChooserViewSet "wagtail.admin.viewsets.chooser.ChooserViewSet") class provides the views that make up a modal chooser interface, allowing users to select from a list of model instances to populate a ForeignKey field. Using the same `Person` model, the following definition (to be placed in `views.py`) will generate the views for a person chooser modal:

```
from wagtail.admin.viewsets.chooser import ChooserViewSet

class PersonChooserViewSet(ChooserViewSet):
    # The model can be specified as either the model class or an "app_label.model_name" string;
    # using a string avoids circular imports when accessing the StreamField block class (see below)
    model = "myapp.Person"

    icon = "user"
    choose_one_text = "Choose a person"
    choose_another_text = "Choose another person"
    edit_item_text = "Edit this person"
    form_fields = ["first_name", "last_name"]  # fields to show in the "Create" tab

person_chooser_viewset = PersonChooserViewSet("person_chooser")

```

Again this can be registered with the `register_admin_viewset` hook:

```
from wagtail import hooks

from .views import person_chooser_viewset

@hooks.register("register_admin_viewset")
def register_viewset():
    return person_chooser_viewset

```

Registering a chooser viewset will also set up a chooser widget to be used whenever a ForeignKey field to that model appears in a `WagtailAdminModelForm` - see [Using forms in admin views](forms.html). In particular, this means that a panel definition such as `FieldPanel("author")`, where `author` is a foreign key to the `Person` model, will automatically use this chooser interface. The chooser widget class can also be retrieved directly (for use in ordinary Django forms, for example) as the `widget_class` property on the viewset. For example, placing the following code in `widgets.py` will make the chooser widget available to be imported with `from myapp.widgets import PersonChooserWidget`:

```
from .views import person_chooser_viewset

PersonChooserWidget = person_chooser_viewset.widget_class

```

The viewset also makes a StreamField chooser block class available, through the method `get_block_class`. Placing the following code in `blocks.py` will make a chooser block available for use in StreamField definitions by importing `from myapp.blocks import PersonChooserBlock`:

```
from .views import person_chooser_viewset

PersonChooserBlock = person_chooser_viewset.get_block_class(
    name="PersonChooserBlock", module_path="myapp.blocks"
)

```

### Limiting choices via linked fields[¶](#limiting-choices-via-linked-fields "Link to this heading")

Chooser viewsets provide a mechanism for limiting the options displayed in the chooser according to another input field on the calling page. For example, suppose the person model has a country field - we can then set up a page model with a country dropdown and a person chooser, where an editor first selects a country from the dropdown and then opens the person chooser to be presented with a list of people from that country.

To set this up, define a `url_filter_parameters` attribute on the ChooserViewSet. This specifies a list of URL parameters that will be recognized for filtering the results - whenever these are passed in the URL, a `filter` clause on the correspondingly-named field will be applied to the queryset. These parameters should also be listed in the `preserve_url_parameters` attribute, so that they are preserved in the URL when navigating through the chooser (such as when following pagination links). The following definition will allow the person chooser to be filtered by country:

```
class PersonChooserViewSet(ChooserViewSet):
    model = "myapp.Person"
    url_filter_parameters = ["country"]
    preserve_url_parameters = ["multiple", "country"]

```

The chooser widget now needs to be configured to pass these URL parameters when opening the modal. This is done by passing a `linked_fields` dictionary to the widget’s constructor, where the keys are the names of the URL parameters to be passed, and the values are CSS selectors for the corresponding input fields on the calling page. For example, suppose we have a page model with a country dropdown and a person chooser:

```
class BlogPage(Page):
    country = models.ForeignKey(Country, null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Person, null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL)

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('country'),
        FieldPanel('author', widget=PersonChooserWidget(linked_fields={
            # pass the country selected in the id_country input to the person chooser
            # as a URL parameter `country`
            'country': '#id_country',
        })),
    ]

```

A number of other lookup mechanisms are available:

```
PersonChooserWidget(linked_fields={
    'country': {'selector': '#id_country'}  # equivalent to 'country': '#id_country'
})

# Look up by ID
PersonChooserWidget(linked_fields={
    'country': {'id': 'id_country'}

### Chooser viewsets for non-model datasources[¶](#chooser-viewsets-for-non-model-datasources "Link to this heading")

While the generic chooser views are primarily designed to use Django models as the data source, choosers based on other sources such as REST API endpoints can be implemented through the use of the [queryish](https://pypi.org/project/queryish/) library, which allows any data source to be wrapped in a Django QuerySet-like interface. This can then be passed to ChooserViewSet like a normal model. For example, the Pokemon example from the *queryish* documentation could be made into a chooser as follows:

```
# views.py

import re
from queryish.rest import APIModel
from wagtail.admin.viewsets.chooser import ChooserViewSet

class Pokemon(APIModel):
    class Meta:
        base_url = "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/"
        detail_url = "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/%s/"
        fields = ["id", "name"]
        pagination_style = "offset-limit"
        verbose_name_plural = "pokemon"

    @classmethod
    def from_query_data(cls, data):
        return cls(
            id=int(re.match(r'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/(\d+)/', data['url']).group(1)),
            name=data['name'],
        )

    @classmethod
    def from_individual_data(cls, data):
        return cls(
            id=data['id'],
            name=data['name'],
        )

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class PokemonChooserViewSet(ChooserViewSet):
    model = Pokemon

    choose_one_text = "Choose a pokemon"
    choose_another_text = "Choose another pokemon"

pokemon_chooser_viewset = PokemonChooserViewSet("pokemon_chooser")

# wagtail_hooks.py

from wagtail import hooks

from .views import pokemon_chooser_viewset

@hooks.register("register_admin_viewset")
def register_pokemon_chooser_viewset():
    return pokemon_chooser_viewset

```

# Panel types[¶](#panel-types "Link to this heading")

## Built-in Fields and Choosers[¶](#built-in-fields-and-choosers "Link to this heading")

Wagtail’s panel mechanism automatically recognizes Django model fields and provides them with an appropriate widget for input. You can use it by defining the field in your Django model as normal and passing the field name into
[`FieldPanel`](#wagtail.admin.panels.FieldPanel "wagtail.admin.panels.FieldPanel") (or a suitable panel type) when defining your panels.

Here are some built-in panel types that you can use in your panel definitions. These are all subclasses of the base [`Panel`](../panel_api.html#wagtail.admin.panels.Panel "wagtail.admin.panels.Panel") class, and unless otherwise noted, they accept all of `Panel`’s parameters in addition to their own.

### FieldPanel[¶](#fieldpanel "Link to this heading")

*class* wagtail.admin.panels.FieldPanel(*field\_name*, *widget=None*, *disable\_comments=None*, *permission=None*, *read\_only=False*, *\*\*kwargs*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.FieldPanel "Link to this definition")

This is the panel to use for basic Django model field types. It provides a default icon and heading based on the model field definition, but they can be customized by passing additional arguments to the constructor. For more details, see [Panel customization](#customising-panels).

field\_name[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.FieldPanel.field_name "Link to this definition")

This is the name of the class property used in your model definition.

widget(*optional*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.FieldPanel.widget "Link to this definition")

This parameter allows you to specify a [Django form widget](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/forms/widgets/ "(in Django v5.1)") to use instead of the default widget for this field type.

disable\_comments(*optional*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.FieldPanel.disable_comments "Link to this definition")

This allows you to prevent a field-level comment button from showing for this panel if set to `True`. See [Create and edit comments](https://guide.wagtail.org/en-latest/how-to-guides/manage-pages/#create-and-edit-comments).

permission(*optional*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.FieldPanel.permission "Link to this definition")

Allows a field to be selectively shown to users with sufficient permission. Accepts a permission codename such as `'myapp.change_blog_category'` - if the logged-in user does not have that permission, the field will be omitted from the form. See Django’s documentation on [custom permissions](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/auth/customizing/#custom-permissions "(in Django v5.1)") for details on how to set permissions up; alternatively, if you want to set a field as only available to superusers, you can use any arbitrary string (such as `'superuser'`) as the codename, since superusers automatically pass all permission tests.

read\_only(*optional*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.FieldPanel.read_only "Link to this definition")

Allows you to prevent a model field value from being set or updated by editors.

For most field types, the field value will be rendered in the form for editors to see (along with field’s label and help text), but no form inputs will be displayed, and the form will ignore attempts to change the value in POST data. For example by injecting a hidden input into the form HTML before submitting.

By default, field values from `StreamField` or `RichTextField` are redacted to prevent rendering of potentially insecure HTML mid-form. You can change this behavior for custom panel types by overriding `Panel.format_value_for_display()`.

attrs(*optional*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.FieldPanel.attrs "Link to this definition")

Allows a dictionary containing HTML attributes to be set on the rendered panel. If you assign a value of `True` or `False` to an attribute, it will be rendered as an HTML5 boolean attribute.

### MultiFieldPanel[¶](#multifieldpanel "Link to this heading")

*class* wagtail.admin.panels.MultiFieldPanel(*children=()*, *\*args*, *permission=None*, *\*\*kwargs*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.MultiFieldPanel "Link to this definition")

This panel condenses several [`FieldPanel`](#wagtail.admin.panels.FieldPanel "wagtail.admin.panels.FieldPanel") s or choosers, from a `list` or `tuple`, under a single `heading` string. To save space, you can [collapse the panel by default](#collapsible).

children[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.MultiFieldPanel.children "Link to this definition")

A `list` or `tuple` of child panels

permission(*optional*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.MultiFieldPanel.permission "Link to this definition")

Allows a panel to be selectively shown to users with sufficient permission. Accepts a permission codename such as `'myapp.change_blog_category'` - if the logged-in user does not have that permission, the panel will be omitted from the form. Similar to [`FieldPanel.permission`](#wagtail.admin.panels.FieldPanel.permission "wagtail.admin.panels.FieldPanel.permission").

attrs(*optional*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.MultiFieldPanel.attrs "Link to this definition")

Allows a dictionary containing HTML attributes to be set on the rendered panel. If you assign a value of `True` or `False` to an attribute, it will be rendered as an HTML5 boolean attribute.

### InlinePanel[¶](#inlinepanel "Link to this heading")

*class* wagtail.admin.panels.InlinePanel(*relation\_name*, *panels=None*, *label=''*, *min\_num=None*, *max\_num=None*, *\*\*kwargs*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.InlinePanel "Link to this definition")

This panel allows for the creation of a “cluster” of related objects over a join to a separate model, such as a list of related links or slides to an image carousel. For a full explanation of the usage of `InlinePanel`, see [Inline models](../../topics/pages.html#inline-models). To save space, you can [collapse the panel by default](#collapsible).

relation\_name[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.InlinePanel.relation_name "Link to this definition")

The related\_name label given to the cluster’s ParentalKey relation.

panels(*optional*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.InlinePanel.panels "Link to this definition")

The list of panels that will make up the child object’s form. If not specified here, the panels definition on the child model will be used.

label[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.InlinePanel.label "Link to this definition")

Text for the add button and heading for child panels. Used as the heading when `heading` is not present.

min\_num(*optional*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.InlinePanel.min_num "Link to this definition")

Minimum number of forms a user must submit.

max\_num(*optional*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.InlinePanel.max_num "Link to this definition")

Maximum number of forms a user must submit.

attrs(*optional*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.InlinePanel.attrs "Link to this definition")

Allows a dictionary containing HTML attributes to be set on the rendered panel. If you assign a value of `True` or `False` to an attribute, it will be rendered as an HTML5 boolean attribute.

#### JavaScript DOM events[¶](#javascript-dom-events "Link to this heading")

You may want to execute some JavaScript when `InlinePanel` items are ready, added or removed. The `w-formset:ready`, `w-formset:added` and `w-formset:removed` events allow this.

For example, given a child model that provides a relationship between Blog and Person on `BlogPage`.

```
class CustomInlinePanel(InlinePanel):
    class BoundPanel(InlinePanel.BoundPanel):
        class Media:
            js = ["js/inline-panel.js"]

class BlogPage(Page):
        # .. fields

        content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
               CustomInlinePanel("blog_person_relationship"),
              # ... other panels
        ]

```

Using JavaScript is as follows.

```
// static/js/inline-panel.js

document.addEventListener('w-formset:ready', function (event) {
    console.info('ready', event);
});

document.addEventListener('w-formset:added', function (event) {
    console.info('added', event);
});

document.addEventListener('w-formset:removed', function (event) {
    console.info('removed', event);
});

```

Events will be dispatched and can trigger custom JavaScript logic such as setting up a custom widget.

### MultipleChooserPanel[¶](#multiplechooserpanel "Link to this heading")

*class* wagtail.admin.panels.MultipleChooserPanel(*relation\_name*, *chooser\_field\_name=None*, *panels=None*, *label=''*, *min\_num=None*, *max\_num=None*, *\*\*kwargs*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.MultipleChooserPanel "Link to this definition")

This panel is a variant of `InlinePanel` that can be used when the inline model includes a `ForeignKey` relation to a model that implements Wagtail’s chooser interface.
Wagtail images, documents, snippets, and pages all implement this interface, and other models may do so by [registering a custom ChooserViewSet](../../extending/generic_views.html#chooserviewset).

Rather than the “Add” button inserting a new form to be filled in individually, it immediately opens up the chooser interface for that related object, in a mode that allows multiple items to be selected. The user is then returned to the main edit form with the appropriate number of child panels added and pre-filled.

`MultipleChooserPanel` accepts an additional required argument `chooser_field_name`, specifying the name of the `ForeignKey` relation that the chooser is linked to.

For example, given a child model that provides a gallery of images on `BlogPage`:

```
class BlogPageGalleryImage(Orderable):
    page = ParentalKey(BlogPage, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='gallery_images')
    image = models.ForeignKey(
        'wagtailimages.Image', on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='+'
    )
    caption = models.CharField(blank=True, max_length=250)

    panels = [
        FieldPanel('image'),
        FieldPanel('caption'),
    ]

```

The `MultipleChooserPanel` definition on `BlogPage` would be:

```
        MultipleChooserPanel(
            'gallery_images', label="Gallery images", chooser_field_name="image"
        )

```

### FieldRowPanel[¶](#fieldrowpanel "Link to this heading")

*class* wagtail.admin.panels.FieldRowPanel(*children=()*, *\*args*, *permission=None*, *\*\*kwargs*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.FieldRowPanel "Link to this definition")

This panel creates a columnar layout in the editing interface, where each of the child Panels appears alongside each other rather than below.

The use of `FieldRowPanel` particularly helps reduce the “snow-blindness” effect of seeing so many fields on the page, for complex models. It also improves the perceived association between fields of a similar nature. For example, if you created a model representing an “Event” which had a starting date and ending date, it may be intuitive to find the start and end date on the same “row”.

By default, the panel is divided into equal-width columns, but this can be overridden by adding `col*` class names to each of the child Panels of the FieldRowPanel. The Wagtail editing interface is laid out using a grid system. Classes `col1`-`col12` can be applied to each child of a FieldRowPanel to define how many columns they span out of the total number of columns. When grid items add up to 12 columns, the class `col3` will ensure that field appears 3 columns wide or a quarter the width. `col4` would cause the field to be 4 columns wide, or a third the width.

children[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.FieldRowPanel.children "Link to this definition")

A `list` or `tuple` of child panels to display on the row

permission(*optional*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.FieldRowPanel.permission "Link to this definition")

Allows a panel to be selectively shown to users with sufficient permission. Accepts a permission codename such as `'myapp.change_blog_category'` - if the logged-in user does not have that permission, the panel will be omitted from the form. Similar to [`FieldPanel.permission`](#wagtail.admin.panels.FieldPanel.permission "wagtail.admin.panels.FieldPanel.permission").

attrs(*optional*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.FieldRowPanel.attrs "Link to this definition")

Allows a dictionary containing HTML attributes to be set on the rendered panel. If you assign a value of `True` or `False` to an attribute, it will be rendered as an HTML5 boolean attribute.

### HelpPanel[¶](#helppanel "Link to this heading")

*class* wagtail.admin.panels.HelpPanel(*content=''*, *template='wagtailadmin/panels/help\_panel.html'*, *\*\*kwargs*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.HelpPanel "Link to this definition")

A panel to display helpful information to the user.

This panel does not support the `help_text` parameter.

content[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.HelpPanel.content "Link to this definition")

HTML string that gets displayed in the panel.

template[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.HelpPanel.template "Link to this definition")

Path to a template rendering the full panel HTML.

attrs(*optional*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.HelpPanel.attrs "Link to this definition")

Allows a dictionary containing HTML attributes to be set on the rendered panel. If you assign a value of `True` or `False` to an attribute, it will be rendered as an HTML5 boolean attribute.

### PageChooserPanel[¶](#pagechooserpanel "Link to this heading")

*class* wagtail.admin.panels.PageChooserPanel(*field\_name*, *page\_type=None*, *can\_choose\_root=False*, *\*\*kwargs*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.PageChooserPanel "Link to this definition")

While `FieldPanel` also supports `ForeignKey` to [`Page`](model_reference.html#wagtail.models.Page "wagtail.models.Page") models, you can explicitly use `PageChooserPanel` to allow `Page`-specific customizations.

```
from wagtail.models import Page
from wagtail.admin.panels import PageChooserPanel

class BookPage(Page):
    related_page = models.ForeignKey(
        'wagtailcore.Page',
        null=True,
        blank=True,
        on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
        related_name='+',
    )

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        PageChooserPanel('related_page', 'demo.PublisherPage'),
    ]

```

`PageChooserPanel` takes one required argument, the field name. Optionally, specifying a page type (in the form of an `"appname.modelname"` string) will filter the chooser to display only pages of that type. A list or tuple of page types can also be passed in, to allow choosing a page that matches any of those page types:

```
PageChooserPanel('related_page', ['demo.PublisherPage', 'demo.AuthorPage'])

```

Passing `can_choose_root=True` will allow the editor to choose the tree root as a page. Normally this would be undesirable since the tree root is never a usable page, but in some specialized cases it may be appropriate; for example, a page with an automatic “related articles” feed could use a `PageChooserPanel` to select which subsection articles will be taken from, with the root corresponding to ‘everywhere’.

### FormSubmissionsPanel[¶](#module-wagtail.contrib.forms.panels "Link to this heading")

*class* wagtail.contrib.forms.panels.FormSubmissionsPanel(*\*\*kwargs*)[¶](#wagtail.contrib.forms.panels.FormSubmissionsPanel "Link to this definition")

This panel adds a single, read-only section in the edit interface for pages implementing the `wagtail.contrib.forms.models.AbstractForm` model.
It includes the number of total submissions for the given form and also a link to the listing of submissions.

```
from wagtail.contrib.forms.models import AbstractForm
from wagtail.contrib.forms.panels import FormSubmissionsPanel

class ContactFormPage(AbstractForm):
    content_panels = [
        FormSubmissionsPanel(),
    ]

```

### TitleFieldPanel[¶](#titlefieldpanel "Link to this heading")

*class* wagtail.admin.panels.TitleFieldPanel(*\*args*, *apply\_if\_live=False*, *classname='title'*, *placeholder=True*, *targets=['slug']*, *\*\*kwargs*)[¶](#wagtail.admin.panels.TitleFieldPanel "Link to this definition")

Prepares the default widget attributes that are used on Page title fields.
Can be used outside of pages to easily enable the slug field sync functionality.

Parameters:

* **apply\_if\_live** – (optional) If `True`, the built in slug sync behaviour will apply irrespective of the published state.
  The default is `False`, where the slug sync will only apply when the instance is not live (or does not have a live property).
* **classname** – (optional) A CSS class name to add to the panel’s HTML element. Default is `"title"`.
* **placeholder** – (optional) If a value is provided, it will be used as the field’s placeholder, if `False` is provided no placeholder will be shown.
  If `True`, a placeholder value of `"Title*"` will be used or `"Page Title*"` if the model is a `Page` model.
  The default is `True`. If a widget is provided with a placeholder, the widget’s value will be used instead.
* **targets** – (optional) This allows you to override the default target of the field named slug on the form.
  Accepts a list of field names, default is `["slug"]`.
  Note that the slugify/urlify behaviour relies on usage of the `wagtail.admin.widgets.slug` widget on the slug field.

This is the panel to use for Page title fields or main titles on other models. It provides a default classname, placeholder, and widget attributes to enable the automatic sync with the slug field in the form. Many of these defaults can be customized by passing additional arguments to the constructor. All the same FieldPanel arguments are supported including a custom widget. For more details, see [Panel customization](#customising-panels).

## Panel customization[¶](#panel-customization "Link to this heading")

By adding extra parameters to your panel/field definitions, you can control much of how your fields will display in the Wagtail page editing interface. Wagtail’s page editing interface takes much of its behavior from Django’s admin, so you may find many options for customisation covered there.
(See [Django model field reference](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/fields/ "Django 5.1")).

### Icons[¶](#icons "Link to this heading")

Use the `icon` argument to the panel constructor to override the icon to be displayed next to the panel’s heading. For a list of available icons, see [Available icons](../../advanced_topics/icons.html#available-icons).

### Heading[¶](#heading "Link to this heading")

Use the `heading` argument to the panel constructor to set the panel’s heading. This will be used for the input’s label and displayed on the content minimap. If left unset for `FieldPanel`s, it will be set automatically using the form field’s label (taken in turn from a model field’s `verbose_name`).

### CSS classes[¶](#css-classes "Link to this heading")

Use the `classname` argument to the panel constructor to add CSS classes to the panel. The class will be applied to the HTML `<section>` element of the panel. This can be used to add extra styling to the panel or to control its behavior.

The `title` class can be used to make the input stand out with a bigger font size and weight.

The `collapsed` class will load the editor page with the panel collapsed under its heading.

```
    content_panels = [
        MultiFieldPanel(
            [
                FieldPanel('cover'),
                FieldPanel('book_file'),
                FieldPanel('publisher'),
            ],
            heading="Collection of Book Fields",
            classname="collapsed",
        ),
    ]

```

### Help text[¶](#help-text "Link to this heading")

Use the `help_text` argument to the panel constructor to customize the help text to be displayed above the input. If unset for `FieldPanel`s, it will be set automatically using the form field’s `help_text` (taken in turn from a model field’s `help_text`).

### Placeholder text[¶](#placeholder-text "Link to this heading")

By default, Wagtail uses the field’s label as placeholder text. To change it, pass to the `FieldPanel` a widget with a placeholder attribute set to your desired text. You can select widgets from [Django’s form widgets](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/forms/widgets/ "Django 5.1"), or any of the Wagtail’s widgets found in `wagtail.admin.widgets`.

For example, to customize placeholders for a `Book` snippet model:

```
# models.py
from django import forms            # the default Django widgets live here
from wagtail.admin import widgets   # to use Wagtail's special datetime widget

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=256)
    release_date = models.DateField()
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=5, decimal_places=2)

    # You can create them separately
    title_widget = forms.TextInput(
        attrs = {
            'placeholder': 'Enter Full Title'
        }
    )
    # using the correct widget for your field type and desired effect
    date_widget = widgets.AdminDateInput(
        attrs = {
            'placeholder': 'dd-mm-yyyy'
        }
    )

    panels = [
        TitleFieldPanel('title', widget=title_widget), # then add them as a variable
        FieldPanel('release_date', widget=date_widget),
        FieldPanel('price', widget=forms.NumberInput(attrs={'placeholder': 'Retail price on release'})) # or directly inline
    ]

```

### Required fields[¶](#required-fields "Link to this heading")

To make input or chooser selection mandatory for a field, add [`blank=False`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.Field.blank "Django 5.1") to its model definition.

### Hiding fields[¶](#hiding-fields "Link to this heading")

Without a top-level panel definition, a `FieldPanel` will be constructed for each field in your model. If you intend to hide a field on the Wagtail page editor, define the field with [`editable=False`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.Field.editable "Django 5.1"). If a field is not present in the panels definition, it will also be hidden.

### Permissions[¶](#permissions "Link to this heading")

Most panels can accept a `permission` kwarg, allowing the set of panels or specific panels to be restricted to a set permissions.
See [Permissions](../../topics/permissions.html#permissions-overview) for details about working with permissions in Wagtail.

In this example, ‘notes’ will be visible to all editors, ‘cost’ and ‘details’ will only be visible to those with the `submit` permission, ‘budget approval’ will be visible to super users only. Note that super users will have access to all fields.

```
    content_panels = [
        FieldPanel("notes"),
        MultiFieldPanel(
            [
                FieldPanel("cost"),
                FieldPanel("details"),
            ],
            heading="Budget details",
            classname="collapsed",
            permission="submit"
        ),
        FieldPanel("budget_approval", permission="superuser"),
    ]

```

### Additional HTML attributes[¶](#additional-html-attributes "Link to this heading")

Use the `attrs` parameter to add custom attributes to the HTML element of the panel. This allows you to specify additional attributes, such as `data-*` attributes. The `attrs` parameter accepts a dictionary where the keys are the attribute names and these will be rendered in the same way as Django’s widget [`attrs`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/forms/widgets/#django.forms.Widget.attrs "(in Django v5.1)") where `True` and `False` will be treated as HTML5 boolean attributes.

For example, you can use the `attrs` parameter to integrate your Stimulus controller into the panel:

```
    content_panels = [
        MultiFieldPanel(
            [
                FieldPanel('cover'),
                FieldPanel('book_file'),
                FieldPanel('publisher', attrs={'data-my-controller-target': 'myTarget'}),
            ],
            heading="Collection of Book Fields",
            classname="collapsed",
            attrs={'data-controller': 'my-controller'},
        ),
    ]

```
