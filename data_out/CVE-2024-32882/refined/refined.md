  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from a lack of proper permission checks when editing a model with per-field restrictions through `wagtail.contrib.settings` or `ModelViewSet`. Specifically, the system fails to enforce the `permission` argument on `FieldPanel` during HTTP POST requests, allowing unauthorized users to modify restricted fields.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper access control",
        "Insufficient permission checks",
        "Bypass of field-level restrictions"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker with edit permission over the model, but lacking specific permission for a particular field, can bypass the permission check and update the field's value. This could lead to unauthorized modifications of sensitive data.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafting a malicious HTTP POST request to the edit form",
        "Exploiting the vulnerable endpoints of `wagtail.contrib.settings` or `ModelViewSet`."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have:\n  - Access to the Wagtail admin interface.\n  - Edit permissions for the affected model, but not necessarily for the specific field being targeted.",
      "additional_details": "This vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without admin access or by a user lacking edit permissions on the affected model. The editing interfaces for pages and snippets are not affected by this vulnerability. The provided content includes the specific commit that reverts the fix for this vulnerability, along with the code changes."
