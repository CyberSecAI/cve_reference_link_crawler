In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: dev: can_put_echo_skb(): don't crash kernel if can_priv::echo_skb is accessed out of bounds

If the "struct can_priv::echoo_skb" is accessed out of bounds, this
would cause a kernel crash. Instead, issue a meaningful warning
message and return with an error.
