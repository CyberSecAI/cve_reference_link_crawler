### Description

The Elespare – Blog, Magazine and Newspaper Addons for Elementor with Templates, Widgets, Kits, and Header/Footer Builder. One Click Import: No Coding Required! plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'Horizontal Nav Menu' widget in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
