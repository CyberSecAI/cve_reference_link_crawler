| Missed this, or misunderstood it until just now. From what I understand, the attacker needs to be, or gain access as the geoserver administrator, who uploads script content into the geoserver catalog, for example as the layer `name`. In other words, geoserver must be coded to not trust content that comes from the geoserver catalog when serving that content as HTML, is that correct? Hopefully it's not too common that attackers get admin access, but I guess it could happen. In any case, thanks for keeping users safe, looks good to me. |
