- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress WP RSS Images plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious request, an attacker can trick a logged-in user into unknowingly performing actions on the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges into visiting a malicious webpage or clicking a malicious link. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
