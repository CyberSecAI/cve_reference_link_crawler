Based on the provided information, the content is related to CVE-2021-47165.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing check for a valid `priv` structure pointer in the `meson_drv_shutdown` function within the Linux kernel's DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem for Meson SoCs. When the main DRM component fails to probe (e.g., if the dw-hdmi module is not loaded), the `priv` pointer remains uninitialized, leading to a null pointer dereference during system shutdown.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The `meson_drv_shutdown` function accesses the `priv` structure without verifying that it is not NULL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: The null pointer dereference results in a kernel crash during system shutdown/reboot.
- Denial of service: The crash prevents a clean shutdown and renders the system unavailable, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during system shutdown.
- The attacker does not need to be local or have special permissions.
- The vulnerability occurs when the main component of the DRM driver is not probed. This can happen if modules are not loaded or if probing is deferred.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be in a privileged position or have special capabilities to trigger this bug.
- The system needs to be in a state where the main DRM component was not successfully probed (for example, if the `dw-hdmi` module is not loaded, or if probing is deferred) prior to system shutdown/reboot.

**More Details:**
The provided content includes the actual patch that fixes the vulnerability. The fix is simple: it adds a check to ensure the `priv` pointer is valid before accessing any members of the `priv` structure.
```c
static void meson_drv_shutdown(struct platform_device *pdev)
{
        struct meson_drm *priv = dev_get_drvdata(&pdev->dev);

        if (!priv)
                return;

        drm_kms_helper_poll_fini(priv->drm);
        drm_atomic_helper_shutdown(priv->drm);
}
```
This prevents the null pointer dereference and thus the kernel crash during shutdown.
