Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `/admin/students/manage.php` page of the eLearning System.
- The `id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection because it is not properly sanitized or parameterized before being used in a database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, leading to:
    - Data exfiltration: Accessing sensitive data, including user information.
    - Data manipulation: Modifying or deleting data in the database.
    - Potential for privilege escalation, depending on database permissions.
    - Full database compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to `/admin/students/manage.php` by manipulating the `id` parameter, for example by appending a single quote: `/admin/students/manage.php?id=1'`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application.
- The attacker does not require any specific authentication level to exploit this vulnerability (although the admin interface is likely protected).
- Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.
