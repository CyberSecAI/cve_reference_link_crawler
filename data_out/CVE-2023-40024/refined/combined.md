  attack due to inadequate validation and sanitization of the key parameter.
  The license views were migrated class-based views are the inputs are now properly
  sanitized.
  Credit to @0xmpij for reporting the vulnerability.
  <https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/security/advisories/GHSA-6xcx-gx7r-rccj>
  [#847](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode.io/issues/847)
* Add bandit analyzer and Django "check --deploy" to the check/validation stack.

  with scancode-toolkit scanners without using subprocess. This new function is used
  in the `scan_package` pipeline.
  The `SCANCODE_TOOLKIT_CLI_OPTIONS` settings was renamed
  `SCANCODE_TOOLKIT_RUN_SCAN_ARGS`. Refer to the documentation for the next "dict"
  syntax.

  [#526](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode.io/issues/526)
* `CodebaseResource.for_packages` now returns a list of
  `DiscoveredPackage.package_uid` or `DiscoveredPackage.package_url` if
  `DiscoveredPackage.package_uid` is not present. This is done to reflect the
  how scancode-toolkit's JSON output returns `package_uid``s in the
  ``for_packages` field for Resources.
* Add the model DiscoveredDependency. This represents Package dependencies
  discovered in a Project. The `scan_codebase` and `scan_packages` pipelines
  have been updated to create DiscoveredDepdendency objects. The Project API has
  been updated with new fields:

  + `dependency_count`
    - The number of DiscoveredDependencies associated with the project.
  + `discovered_dependencies_summary`
    - A mapping that contains following fields:

    > - `total`
    >   - The number of DiscoveredDependencies associated with the project.
    > - `is_runtime`
    >   - The number of runtime dependencies.
    > - `is_optional`
    >   - The number of optional dependencies.
    > - `is_resolved`
    >   - The number of resolved dependencies.

  These values are also available on the Project view.
  [#447](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode.io/issues/447)
* The `dependencies` field has been removed from the DiscoveredPackage model.
* Create directory CodebaseResources in the rootfs pipeline.
  [#515](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode.io/issues/515)

  A new "toast" type of notification is displayed along the status update.
  [#390](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode.io/issues/390)
* Ensure the worker service waits for migrations completion before starting.
  To solve this issue we install the wait-for-it script available in
  Debian by @vishnubob and as suggested in the Docker documentation.
  In the docker-compose.yml, we let the worker wait for the web processing
  to be complete when gunicorn exposes port 8000 and web container is available.

## v30.1.0 (2021-11-22)

* Synchronize QUEUED and RUNNING pipeline runs with their related worker jobs during
  worker maintenance tasks scheduled every 10 minutes.
  If a container was taken down while a pipeline was running, or if pipeline process
  was killed unexpectedly, that pipeline run status will be updated to a FAILED state
  during the next maintenance tasks.
  QUEUED pipeline will be restored in the queue as the worker redis cache backend data
  is now persistent and reloaded on starting the image.
  Note that internaly, a running job emits a "heartbeat" every 60 seconds to let all the
  workers know that it is properly running.
  After 90 seconds without any heartbeats, a worker will determine that the job is not
  active anymore and that job will be moved to the failed registry during the worker
  maintenance tasks. The pipeline run will be updated as well to reflect this failure
  in the Web UI, the REST API, and the command line interface.

# Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in license endpoint

Moderate

[tdruez](/tdruez)
published
GHSA-6xcx-gx7r-rccj
Aug 14, 2023

## Package

nexB/scancode.io
(github)

## Affected versions

<= 32.5.1

## Patched versions

32.5.2

## Description

### Summary

In the `/license/` endpoint, the detailed view key is not properly validated and sanitized, which can result in a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability when attempting to access a detailed license view that does not exist.

### Details

In the `/license/` endpoint, the `license_details_view` function is vulnerable to a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attack due to inadequate validation and sanitization of the `key` parameter. This vulnerability arises when attempting to access a key with malicious javascript.

```
def license_details_view(request, key):
    """
    Display all available information about a given license `key` followed by
    the full license text.
    """
    licenses = get_licenses()
    try:
        data = saneyaml.dump(licenses[key].to_dict())
        text = licenses[key].text
    except KeyError:
        return HttpResponseNotFound(f"License {key} not found.") # Leads to cross-site scripting when key is malicious javascript
    return HttpResponse(f"<pre>{data}</pre><hr><pre>{text}</pre>")
```
### PoC

1. Access following endpoint on scancode.io instance: [http://localhost/license/%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie);%3C/script%3E/](http://localhost/license/%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3B%3C/script%3E/)

### Impact

Attackers can exploit the vulnerability to inject malicious scripts into the response generated by the `license_details_view` function. When unsuspecting users visit the page, their browsers will execute the injected scripts, leading to unauthorized actions, session hijacking, or stealing sensitive information.

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
