{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website, leading to an unwanted action performed by the user's browser on the vulnerable website.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into submitting a malicious request on the affected website. This does not require authentication on the vulnerable website."
