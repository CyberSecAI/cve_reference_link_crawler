- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A CPU can speculate the result of the boundary check in `__gfn_to_memslot` and continue execution speculatively using an illegal Guest Frame Number (gfn). This can lead to calculating an out-of-bounds Host Virtual Address (hva). If this hva is used to load another guest physical address, it creates a Spectre gadget consisting of two consecutive reads, where the second read is data-dependent on the first.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Speculative execution leading to out-of-bounds memory access. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the fact that the CPU speculatively calculates the hva even when the gfn is invalid, leading to a potential out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially read arbitrary memory from the VMM's ring 3 address space, or other sensitive locations, through crafted guest physical address.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious guest can trigger the vulnerability by accessing invalid guest physical addresses. This causes the CPU to speculatively execute calculations using an invalid gfn, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds hva calculation and a subsequent read.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to control the guest OS and its memory access patterns. This requires the attacker to have the ability to execute code within a KVM guest.
