- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied tag attributes within the WPB Elementor Addons plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages, which will execute whenever a user accesses those pages, potentially leading to malicious actions like session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: Authenticated users with contributor-level access or higher can inject malicious scripts through the 'tags' added to widgets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
