```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `SetLocalLink`'s JSON `param` parser assumes that the `param` JSON element is an object, accessing it using subscription operator, but a string can be provided instead.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The `cgiserver.cgi` process will assert and the device will reboot, resulting in a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially-crafted HTTP POST request with a JSON body containing a `SetLocalLink` command with a string as param.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device. Authentication may be bypassed using TALOS-2021-1420."
