Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-25152

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of filenames in the Message Board widget when handling file attachments. This allows for the injection of malicious code within the filename.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored XSS, where the malicious script is stored persistently and executed when a user interacts with the affected feature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Web Script or HTML Injection:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code within the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Potential for Full Compromise:** Successfully exploited XSS vulnerabilities can lead to account hijacking, data theft, malware distribution, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Message Board File Attachment:** The attacker uploads a file to the Message Board widget with a filename containing malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Privilege:** An attacker needs only a low privileged account, potentially a basic user account that can post to message boards.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user to view the message or download the attachment, causing the malicious code in the filename to be executed.

**Affected Versions:**
*   Liferay Portal 7.4.0 through 7.4.2
*   Liferay Portal 7.3.0 through 7.3.7
*  Liferay Portal 7.2.0 and 7.2.1
