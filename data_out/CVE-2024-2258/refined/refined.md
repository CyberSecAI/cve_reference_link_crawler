### Summary
The provided content details a stored self-based cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Form Maker by 10Web WordPress plugin, specifically in versions up to and including 1.15.24. The vulnerability stems from the plugin's improper sanitization of user display names when autofilling form fields, allowing authenticated users (with subscriber-level access or higher) to inject malicious scripts that execute when a user accesses the injected page.

### Root cause of vulnerability
The root cause is the insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user display names when they are automatically populated into form fields.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): User-supplied data (display name) is not properly sanitized before being stored and rendered within form fields, leading to the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

### Impact of exploitation
- **Arbitrary script execution:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript that will execute in the context of any user viewing the page containing the vulnerable form, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Self-based XSS:** The XSS is considered "self-based" because the injected scripts affect other users (or the same user) who view the affected page.

### Attack vectors
- **Form autofill:** The vulnerability is triggered when the plugin attempts to autofill form fields with a user's display name.
- **Authenticated access:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level permissions.
- **Web page access:** The malicious script is executed when a user views a page containing the vulnerable form.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level permissions.
- The attacker needs to be able to modify their display name to include malicious script.
