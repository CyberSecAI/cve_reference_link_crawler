### **[paragbagul111](/paragbagul111)** commented [Dec 25, 2023](#issuecomment-1868899521)

| Dear [@Fraenkiman](https://github.com/Fraenkiman)  I am reaching out to inquire about the assignment of a CVE number for the vulnerability I reported. Kindly review the details on the Huntr platform: Vulnerability Report. I kindly request the assignment of a CVE for the patched vulnerabilities.  Alternatively, if there is a process for requesting a CVE directly from CVE Mitre, please provide guidance on how I can proceed.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.  Best Regards, Parag Bagul |
