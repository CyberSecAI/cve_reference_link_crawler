## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WANotifier < 2.6.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to the WANotifier settings page
2. Add the payload `" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//` for the API key
3. Click "Submit and Validate"
4. See the XSS when the page re-loads or whenever the page is viewed
