The provided content is related to CVE-2023-45481.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `SetFirewallCfg` function of the Tenda AC10 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the usage of `strcpy` to copy the `firewallEn` parameter into a stack-based buffer without prior bounds checking.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can trigger a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the router service.
- The vulnerability can potentially lead to remote code execution (RCE), allowing an attacker to gain control over the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/goform/SetFirewallCfg` endpoint with a large value for the `firewallEn` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This typically requires network connectivity to the router.
- No authentication appears to be required to trigger the vulnerability.
