## How to fix?

Upgrade `black` to version 24.3.0 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the `lines_with_leading_tabs_expanded` function in the `strings.py` file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious input that causes a denial of service.

Exploiting this vulnerability is possible when running Black on untrusted input, or if you habitually put thousands of leading tab characters in your docstrings.

## PoC

```
import time
from black.strings import lines_with_leading_tabs_expanded

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
        print(f"Function '{func.__name__}' executed in {elapsed_time:.4f}s")
        return result

    return wrapper

def sizer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Payload length: {args[0]}\nPayload size: {len(result.encode()) / (1024 ** 2)} MB")
        return result

    return wrapper

@sizer
def create_payload(char_length: int):
    return "\t" * char_length

@timer
def redos_poc_runner(char_length: int):
    print(char_length)
    lines_with_leading_tabs_expanded(create_payload(char_length))
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    redos_poc_runner(100)
    redos_poc_runner(1000)

```
## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.

The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.

Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:

```
regex = /A(B|C+)+D/

```

This regular expression accomplishes the following:

* `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'
* `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
* `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'

The expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`

It most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:

```
$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test("ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD")'
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test("ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX")'
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total

```

The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.

Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as *catastrophic backtracking*.

Let's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: "ACCCX". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:

1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.

The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.

From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.

| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACCCX | 3 | 38 |
| ACCCCX | 4 | 71 |
| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136 |
| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553 |

By the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.3 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**

### Highlights

This release is a milestone: it fixes Black's first CVE security vulnerability. If you

run Black on untrusted input, or if you habitually put thousands of leading tab

characters in your docstrings, you are strongly encouraged to upgrade immediately to fix

[CVE-2024-21503](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-21503).

This release also fixes a bug in Black's AST safety check that allowed Black to make

incorrect changes to certain f-strings that are valid in Python 3.12 and higher.

### Stable style

* Don't move comments along with delimiters, which could cause crashes ([#4248](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/4248))
* Strengthen AST safety check to catch more unsafe changes to strings. Previous versions

  of Black would incorrectly format the contents of certain unusual f-strings containing

  nested strings with the same quote type. Now, Black will crash on such strings until

  support for the new f-string syntax is implemented. ([#4270](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/4270))
* Fix a bug where line-ranges exceeding the last code line would not work as expected

  ([#4273](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/4273))

### Performance

* Fix catastrophic performance on docstrings that contain large numbers of leading tab

  characters. This fixes

  [CVE-2024-21503](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-21503).

  ([#4278](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/4278))

### Documentation

* Note what happens when `--check` is used with `--quiet` ([#4236](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/4236))
