### Highlights

This release is a milestone: it fixes Black's first CVE security vulnerability. If you

run Black on untrusted input, or if you habitually put thousands of leading tab

characters in your docstrings, you are strongly encouraged to upgrade immediately to fix

[CVE-2024-21503](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-21503).

This release also fixes a bug in Black's AST safety check that allowed Black to make

incorrect changes to certain f-strings that are valid in Python 3.12 and higher.

### Stable style

* Don't move comments along with delimiters, which could cause crashes ([#4248](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/4248))
* Strengthen AST safety check to catch more unsafe changes to strings. Previous versions

  of Black would incorrectly format the contents of certain unusual f-strings containing

  nested strings with the same quote type. Now, Black will crash on such strings until

  support for the new f-string syntax is implemented. ([#4270](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/4270))
* Fix a bug where line-ranges exceeding the last code line would not work as expected

  ([#4273](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/4273))

### Performance

* Fix catastrophic performance on docstrings that contain large numbers of leading tab

  characters. This fixes

  [CVE-2024-21503](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-21503).

  ([#4278](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/4278))

### Documentation

* Note what happens when `--check` is used with `--quiet` ([#4236](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/4236))
