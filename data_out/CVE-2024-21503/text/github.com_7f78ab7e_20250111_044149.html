|  |  | This release is a milestone: it fixes Black's first CVE security vulnerability. If you |
|  |  | run Black on untrusted input, or if you habitually put thousands of leading tab |
|  |  | characters in your docstrings, you are strongly encouraged to upgrade immediately to fix |
|  |  | [CVE-2024-21503](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-21503). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This release also fixes a bug in Black's AST safety check that allowed Black to make |
|  |  | incorrect changes to certain f-strings that are valid in Python 3.12 and higher. |
