{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Couchbase SDK defaults to negotiating with SCRAM-SHA when remote link encryption is set to HALF, which allows a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacker to force the negotiation to PLAIN credentials.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure credential negotiation",
      "Lack of enforcement of strong authentication protocols"
    ],
    "impact": "A MITM attacker can intercept and potentially obtain plaintext credentials, leading to unauthorized access to the Couchbase server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be positioned on the network between the client (SDK) and the Couchbase server to intercept network traffic. They also need to be able to manipulate the authentication negotiation."
