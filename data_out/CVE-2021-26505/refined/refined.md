Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `hello.utils.extend` function in `hello.js` recursively merges properties of objects, leading to a prototype pollution vulnerability. Specifically, the line `r[x] = hello.utils.extend(r[x], a[x]);` within the extend function allows an attacker to modify the prototype of the object by providing a crafted input containing `__proto__` as a key.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The vulnerability stems from the recursive merge function in `hello.utils.extend` which allows modification of the `__proto__` property of objects via crafted input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By polluting the prototype, an attacker can introduce malicious properties into objects used by the application. In the case of the `hello.js` library, it can be used to achieve XSS, as demonstrated in the provided proof of concepts by manipulating the `callback` or `onbeforescriptexecute` properties.

**Attack vectors:**
- **URL parameters:** The vulnerability can be exploited via specially crafted URL parameters, including hash and search parameters.
- **Input manipulation:** An attacker provides malicious input, containing `__proto__` key to be merged using the vulnerable `extend` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input that is processed by the vulnerable `hello.utils.extend` function. This can be achieved by manipulating the URL parameters, specifically location.search or location.hash.
- The attacker must know that the application utilizes the vulnerable `hello.js` library.

**Additional details:**
- The provided proof of concept URLs clearly demonstrate how an attacker can use a crafted URL to inject malicious code and achieve XSS by polluting the prototype. The PoC urls inject a `callback` property to trigger an alert or `onbeforescriptexecute` property to execute arbitrary script.
- The vulnerable code is located in `hello.js` file at lines 17-45 and line 1320.
- The identified vulnerable function is `hello.utils.extend` which recursively merges properties.
- The maintainer has fixed the vulnerability with commit `7ab50aeff2d41991f08d4ad6c0481125eea8f6b7`.
