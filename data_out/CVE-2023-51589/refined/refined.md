- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the handling of the AVRCP protocol in BlueZ. This leads to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to insufficient input validation in the AVRCP protocol handling.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can disclose sensitive information. The advisory also notes the potential to execute arbitrary code in the context of root if this vulnerability is combined with other vulnerabilities.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attackers can exploit this vulnerability via Bluetooth by connecting to a malicious device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range and be able to set up a malicious Bluetooth device. The target user has to connect to the attacker's malicious device to trigger the vulnerability.
