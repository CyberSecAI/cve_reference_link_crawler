Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36840:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the Boelter Blue System Management application, specifically in the handling of parameters within `news_details.php`, `services.php`, and `location_details.php` files. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerabilities exist in multiple parameters:
  - `news_details.php?id`
  - `services.php?section`
  - `location_details.php?id`
- The application is vulnerable to Boolean-based blind, time-based blind, and UNION query SQL injection techniques.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
- Unauthorized access to the database.
- Data leakage, including admin credentials, user email/passwords hashes, device hashes, user PII, purchase history, and database credentials.
- Account takeovers.
- Potential full control of the affected application and database.
- Remote code execution through the execution of arbitrary SQL queries.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to vulnerable PHP files (`news_details.php`, `services.php`, `location_details.php`) by manipulating the `id` and `section` parameters.
- Attackers can use tools like SQLMap to automate the exploitation process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is needed for the injection itself.
- Knowledge of SQL and common SQL injection techniques is needed.
- The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable application to perform the SQLi attack

**Additional details:**
- The application is hosted on a Linux Debian 9 (stretch) server running Apache 2.4.25, with a MySQL database >= 5.0.12.
- Specific PoC payloads for different types of SQL injection are provided
- The `Anchor5Digital` database is identified as a target. Sample extracted data from the `DatabaseConnection`, `Payment`, and `system_user` tables is provided to demonstrate potential data leakage.
- Mitigation includes sanitizing user inputs, using parameterized queries, and employing a WAF.
