fix two bugs when parsing malformed LLDP packets:

* add length check for LLDP\_TLV\_AA\_ELEMENT\_SUBTYPE to avoid out-of-bounds read
* add length check for LLDP\_TLV\_AA\_ISID\_VLAN\_ASGNS\_SUBTYPE to avoid out-of-bounds read/integer underflow

| Hi. Thanks for the fixes! In order to accept them we need your Signed-off-by tag in the commit message in a following format: `Signed-off-by: Firstname Lastname <email@example.org>`  Here is what FAQ says about that:  ``` Q: What's a Signed-off-by and how do I provide one?      A: Free and open source software projects usually require a contributor to     provide some assurance that they're entitled to contribute the code that     they provide.  Some projects, for example, do this with a Contributor     License Agreement (CLA) or a copyright assignment that is signed on paper     or electronically.      For this purpose, Open vSwitch has adopted something called the Developer's     Certificate of Origin (DCO), which is also used by the Linux kernel and     originated there.  Informally stated, agreeing to the DCO is the     developer's way of attesting that a particular commit that they are     contributing is one that they are allowed to contribute.  You should visit     https://developercertificate.org/ to read the full statement of the DCO,     which is less than 200 words long.      To certify compliance with the Developer's Certificate of Origin for a     particular commit, just add the following line to the end of your commit     message, properly substituting your name and email address:          Signed-off-by: Firstname Lastname <email@example.org>      Git has special support for adding a Signed-off-by line to a commit     message: when you run "git commit", just add the -s option, as in "git     commit -s".  If you use the "git citool" GUI for commits, you can add a     Signed-off-by line to the commit message by pressing Control+S.  Other Git     user interfaces may provide similar support.  ``` |

# [ovs-dev] [PATCH v2] lldp: fix bugs when parsing malformed AutoAttach

```
The OVS LLDP implementation includes support for AutoAttach standard, which
the 'upstream' lldpd project does not include.  As part of adding this
support, the message parsing for these TLVs did not include proper length
checks for the LLDP_TLV_AA_ELEMENT_SUBTYPE and the
LLDP_TLV_AA_ISID_VLAN_ASGNS_SUBTYPE elements.  The result is that a message
without a proper boundary will cause an overread of memory, and lead to
undefined results, including crashes or other unidentified behavior.

The fix is to introduce proper bounds checking for these elements.  Introduce
a unit test to ensure that we have some proper rejection in this code
base in the future.

Following CVE identifiers have been allocated for the issue (one per
TLV type since they can have a slightly different effect):

 - CVE-2022-4337 for Out-of-Bounds Read in Organization Specific TLV
 - CVE-2022-4338 for Integer Underflow in Organization Specific TLV

The fix referenced in this advisory covers both issues.

Package        : openvswitch
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-4337 CVE-2022-4338
Debian Bug     : 1027273

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in the LLPD implementation of Open
vSwitch, software-based Ethernet virtual switch, which could result in
denial of service.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.15.0+ds1-2+deb11u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your openvswitch packages.

For the detailed security status of openvswitch please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openvswitch>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
