    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2022-4338",
      "description": "Integer Underflow in Organization Specific TLV in Open vSwitch.",
      "root_cause": "The LLDP implementation of Open vSwitch lacks proper length checks for LLDP_TLV_AA_ISID_VLAN_ASGNS_SUBTYPE elements when parsing Auto Attach TLVs.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer underflow",
        "Out-of-bounds read"
      ],
       "impact": "A malformed LLDP packet with a short LLDP_TLV_AA_ISID_VLAN_ASGNS_SUBTYPE element can cause an integer underflow, potentially leading to a denial of service or other undefined behavior, including crashes. An out-of-bounds read may also occur.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network"
       ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send crafted LLDP packets to an Open vSwitch instance where LLDP processing is enabled on an interface."
