The Slider Hero plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 8.2.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the qc_slider_hero_duplicate() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to duplicate slides via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
