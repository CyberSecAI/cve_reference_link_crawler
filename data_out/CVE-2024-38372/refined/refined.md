    "root_cause": "A performance optimization in undici's `response.arrayBuffer()` method, introduced in commit f979ec3, caused it to sometimes return a memory buffer with leaked data from the Node.js process instead of the requested response body.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Data Leakage",
      "Incorrect Memory Handling"
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of potentially sensitive data from the Node.js process, including logs and other internal information, which might be present in the server's memory.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network requests using the fetch API, specifically utilizing the `response.arrayBuffer()` method to access response data",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to send requests to a server using vulnerable `undici` library versions."
  },
  "summary": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in the undici library where the `response.arrayBuffer()` method may return a buffer containing leaked memory data, including logs, due to a performance optimization. The vulnerability is present in versions >= v6.14.0 and < v6.19.2, and is fixed in v6.19.2. The severity is classified as low due to high attack complexity and the requirement of privileges and user interaction. A CVE id CVE-2024-38372 has been assigned, with a CWE-201. The root cause was a commit which attempted to avoid cloning. This resulted in the arraybuffer not correctly returning data and instead returning random memory. The issue was resolved by reverting this change."
