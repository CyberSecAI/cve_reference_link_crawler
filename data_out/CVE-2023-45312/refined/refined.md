- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improperly secured default installation due to a default Erlang cookie.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The Erlang mtproto proxy uses a default Erlang cookie, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands with the privileges of the "mtproto-proxy" user. This could lead to complete compromise of the server.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable over the network if the Erlang distribution port (4369) is exposed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server and knowledge of the default Erlang cookie, which is often publicly known. The attacker can then connect to the Erlang distribution port (4369).
