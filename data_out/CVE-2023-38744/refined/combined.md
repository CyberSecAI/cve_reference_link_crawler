■Mitigations and Protections

OMRON recommends that customers take the following mitigation measures to minimize the

risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities.

1. Anti-virus protection

Protect  any  PC  with  access  to  the  control  system  against  malware  and  ensure

installation  and  maintenance  of  up-to-date  commercial  grade  anti-virus  software

protection.

2. Security measures to prevent unauthorized access

  Minimize  connection  of  control  systems  and  equipment  to  open  networks,  so  that

untrusted devices will be unable to access them.



Implement  firewalls  (by  shutting  down  unused  communications  ports,  limiting

communications hosts) and isolate them from the IT network.

  Use  a  virtual  private  network  (VPN)  for  remote  access  to  control  systems  and

equipment.

  Use strong passwords and change them frequently.



Install physical controls so that only authorized personnel can access control systems

and equipment.

  Scan virus to ensure safety of any USB drives or similar devices before connecting

them to systems and devices.



Enforce  multifactor  authentication  to  all  devices  with  remote  access  to  control

systems and equipment whenever possible.

3. Data input and output protection

Validation  processing  such  as  backup  and  range  check  to  cope  with  unintentional

modification of input/output data to control systems and devices.

4. Data recovery

Periodical data backup and maintenance to prepare for data loss.
