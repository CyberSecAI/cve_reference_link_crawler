Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-20937:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient management of system resources within the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Software's RADIUS request monitoring feature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Resource exhaustion due to inadequate handling of RADIUS traffic.
- The feature to detect high rate of RADIUS requests is enabled by default, making systems more susceptible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause reduced performance of the affected device, resulting in significant delays to RADIUS authentications.
- This can lead to denial of service, making it difficult for users to authenticate.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit by sending specific RADIUS traffic to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic (specifically RADIUS) to the targeted Cisco ISE device.
- No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco ISE Software when the "Detect High Rate of RADIUS Requests" feature is enabled.
- A workaround is available, which involves disabling the "Detect High Rate of RADIUS Requests" setting.
- Software updates are available to fix the issue.
- The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score for this vulnerability is 5.3, categorized as Medium severity.
- Cisco has released a security advisory (cisco-sa-ise-sec-atk-dos-zw5RCUYp) which includes a CSAF file for machine-readable information.
- Affected versions are 2.61 and earlier, 2.7, 3.0 and 3.1. Version 3.2 is not vulnerable.
- Fixed versions are: 2.7 patch 8, 3.0 patch 6, 3.1 patch 4, and any version after 3.2.
