WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* For CVE-2023-52237, CVE-2023-52238: Disable the webserver if not required on the affected systems. Restrict the access to Port 80/tcp and 443/tcp to trusted IP address only
* For CVE-2024-38278: Disable the IP Forwarding if not required on the affected system. Also note, the IP forwarding is disabled by default
* For CVE-2024-39675: Disable the Modbus Server if not required on the affected system. Restrict the access to Port 502/tcp to trusted IP address only. Also note, Modbus is disabled by default

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.
Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

RUGGEDCOM ROS-based devices, typically switches and serial-to-Ethernet devices, are used to connect devices that operate in harsh environments such as electric utility substations and traffic control cabinets.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-52237

The web server of the affected devices allow a low privileged user to access hashes and password salts of all system's users, including admin users. An attacker could use the obtained information to brute force the passwords offline.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.5 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score | 7.7 |
| CVSS v4.0 Vector | CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N |
| CWE | CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor |

Vulnerability CVE-2023-52238

The web server of the affected systems leaks the MACSEC key in clear text to a logged in user. An attacker with the credentials of a low privileged user could retrieve the MACSEC key and access (decrypt) the ethernet frames sent by authorized recipients.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 4.3 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |

| CWE | CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-38278

The affected products with IP forwarding enabled wrongly make available certain remote services in non-managed VLANs, even if these services are not intentionally activated. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to create a remote shell to the affected system.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 6.6 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |

| CWE | CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-39675

In some configurations the affected products wrongly enable the Modbus service in non-managed VLANS. Only serial devices are affected by this vulnerability.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 8.8 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |
