- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `decode_status_report()` function of ofono due to a missing bounds check when copying data into the `out->status_report.ud` buffer. The size of the data to copy is derived from the SMS PDU and not validated against the buffer size.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow. The `memcpy` in `decode_status_report` does not check if the size of the data from the SMS PDU exceeds the buffer `out->status_report.ud`, leading to a buffer overflow when a large data length is provided in the SMS message.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote Code Execution. By exploiting the buffer overflow, an attacker can overwrite parts of the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted SMS message to the vulnerable device. The attack scenario is accessible from a compromised modem, malicious base station, or just SMS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send an SMS message to the vulnerable device. This can be achieved through a compromised modem, malicious base station, or a regular SMS message.
