Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-0851:

**Root Cause:**
The `convert2rhel` tool passes the activation key as a command-line argument to `subscription-manager`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  **Command-line argument exposure:** Passing sensitive information like the activation key via command-line arguments makes it visible to local users. Any user with local access to the machine can potentially view the command-line arguments of running processes using tools like `ps` or `htop`.
- **Insecure handling of sensitive data:** The activation key, which is used for registering systems to a subscription, is handled in an insecure manner.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized System Registration:** An attacker with local access can obtain the activation key. This allows them to register their own systems using the victim's subscription, resulting in a form of fraud.
- **Financial Loss:** The victim may incur financial losses by having their subscription used by an unauthorized user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker must have local access to the system where the `convert2rhel` tool is used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local user account on the system running `convert2rhel`
- Basic knowledge of using command-line tools to view running processes (e.g., `ps`, `htop`)

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists regardless of how the activation key is supplied to `convert2rhel`.
- This issue affects convert2rhel tool across different Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions (RHEL 6,7 and 8).
- Red Hat has released updates to address this vulnerability via errata RHSA-2022:6266, RHSA-2022:6268 and RHSA-2022:6269.
