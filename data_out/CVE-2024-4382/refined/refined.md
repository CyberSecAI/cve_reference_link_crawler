- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "CB (legacy)" lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection for certain bulk actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Absence of CSRF tokens or checks in the plugin's code when deleting codes, timeframes, and bookings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into performing unwanted actions, including deleting codes, timeframes, and bookings.
- **Attack vectors:** CSRF attacks using specially crafted links or forms that an authenticated administrator is tricked into accessing. The provided PoC URLs shows how an attacker could construct such links for each of the vulnerable actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or submitting a malicious form. The administrator needs to be logged into the WordPress dashboard for the attack to be successful.
