Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an error in the `vsock_connect()` function within the Linux kernel's vmw_vsock module. Specifically, when a connection attempt is interrupted by a signal, the socket might already be in the TCP_ESTABLISHED state and present in the connected table. However, upon being interrupted and the socket state reset, it's not removed from the connected table.  If the process retries the connection, and it's successful, the socket is added to the connected table again, resulting in a corrupted list, due to a double add.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **List Corruption:** The primary vulnerability is the potential corruption of the connected socket list due to a double addition of a socket entry.
*   **Improper state handling:** Failure to remove the socket from the connected table when the connection is interrupted by a signal

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The double add leads to a corrupted list of connected sockets. The documents do not describe the specific effects of list corruption, but it can potentially cause unpredictable behavior, system instability, or a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves establishing a vsock connection. An attacker could induce a signal during the connection process causing the improper state change of the socket, leading to the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to initiate a vsock connection. They would also need to be able to send a signal that interrupts the connect() call during the connection process, in order to trigger the double add of the socket to the connected table.

**Additional Notes:**
The fix involves calling `vsock_remove_connected()` when a signal is received during connection. The commit message also clarifies a dependency on commit `d5afa82c977e` which is present in all stable trees except 4.9.y.
