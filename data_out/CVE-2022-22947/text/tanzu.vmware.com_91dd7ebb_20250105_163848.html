# CVE-2022-22947: Spring Cloud Gateway Code Injection Vulnerability

CRITICAL | MARCH 01, 2022 | CVE-2022-22947
# Description

Applications using Spring Cloud Gateway are vulnerable to a code injection attack when the Gateway Actuator endpoint is enabled, exposed and unsecured. A remote attacker could make a maliciously crafted request that could allow arbitrary remote execution on the remote host.

# Affected Spring Products and Versions

* Spring Cloud Gateway
  + 3.1.0
  + 3.0.0 to 3.0.6
  + Older, unsupported versions are also affected

# Mitigation

Users of affected versions should apply the following remediation. 3.1.x users should upgrade to 3.1.1+. 3.0.x users should upgrade to 3.0.7+. If the Gateway actuator endpoint is not needed it should be disabled via management.endpoint.gateway.enabled: false. If the actuator is required it should be secured using Spring Security, see [<https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/actuator.html#actuator.endpoints.security>](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/actuator.html#actuator.endpoints.security). Releases that have fixed this issue include:

* Spring Cloud Gateway
  + 3.1.1+
  + 3.0.7+
