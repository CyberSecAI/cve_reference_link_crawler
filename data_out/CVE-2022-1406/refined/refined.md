{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that the 'merge_access_levels' setting for protected branches can be modified within an imported project's configuration file (tree/project/protected_branches.ndjson) by a user with the developer role. This allows them to bypass the intended access control restrictions and potentially gain unauthorized merge access.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper access control: The system incorrectly allows a developer role user to modify the protected branch merge access level setting within an imported project's configuration.",
    "Data exposure: By gaining merge access to protected branches, an attacker can inject malicious code into the project's CI/CD pipeline, leading to the exposure of sensitive CI/CD variables."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with a developer role can steal masked CI/CD variables from both the group and project. They can also modify the main branch without maintainer's permissions, by modifying the project's configuration file, and then pushing a malicious `.gitlab-ci.yml` to a protected branch that extracts the environment variables and sends them to an attacker controlled server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves: 1. Creating a malicious project with a modified 'merge_access_levels' setting. 2. Importing this project into a group where the attacker has a developer role. 3. Triggering the CI/CD pipeline with a malicious `.gitlab-ci.yml` file on a protected branch to exfiltrate data.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires: 1. A developer role within the target group. 2. The ability to create and export a GitLab project. 3. The ability to modify the project's exported configuration file. 4. The ability to create and merge branches, and modify `.gitlab-ci.yml` files."
