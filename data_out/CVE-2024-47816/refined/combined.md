# Users can impersonate import requesters if their actor IDs coincide

Moderate

[Universal-Omega](/Universal-Omega)
published
GHSA-jjmq-mg36-6387
Oct 9, 2024

## Package

ImportDump
(MediaWiki)

## Affected versions

All

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

The user's local actor ID is stored in the database to tell who made what requests. Therefore, if a user on another wiki happens to have the same actor ID as someone on the central wiki, the user on the other wiki can act as if they're the original wiki requester. This can be abused to create new comments, edit the request, and view the request if it's marked private.

### Patches

* [5c91dfc](https://github.com/miraheze/ImportDump/commit/5c91dfce78320e717516ee65ef5a05f01979ee6c)

### Workarounds

It is possible to disable the special page outside of your global wiki by doing something similar to [miraheze/mw-config@e566499](https://github.com/miraheze/mw-config/commit/e5664995fbb8644f9a80b450b4326194f20f9ddc). You must adapt that to your setup.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Description

Special:RequestImportQueue is still enabled on all wikis. However, the user's *local* actor ID is stored in the database to tell who made what requests. Therefore, if a user on another wiki happens to have the same actor ID as someone on metawiki, the user on the other wiki can act as if they're the original wiki requester.

For example, a user called... User from mw142.icecone.internal requested an import. However, another user called Vandal2 from uwu.mw142.icecone.internal happens to have the same local actor ID as User from mw142.icecone.internal. Thus, they can act on the import request as if they're User:

This is similar to <https://github.com/miraheze/CreateWiki/security/advisories/GHSA-89fx-77w7-rc64>, except this case is for actor IDs, while that one is for user IDs.

Advisory: <https://github.com/miraheze/ImportDump/security/advisories/GHSA-jjmq-mg36-6387>

This shouldn't be an issue in CW since you can only access RWQ from the global wiki, for ImportDump we just need to add:

```
$dbr = $this->connectionProvider->getReplicaDatabase( 'virtual-importdump' );
		if ( !WikiMap::isCurrentWikiDbDomain( $dbr->getDomainID() ) ) {
			throw new ErrorPageError( 'importdump-notcentral', 'importdump-notcentral-text' );
		}
```

to RequestImportQueue like we do RequestImport, don't we?

Its only meant to use central wiki hence why we don't use central ids here because we only really care about the wiki you request from as it shouldn't be possible to do anything from other wikis, and that is indeed the issue here.
