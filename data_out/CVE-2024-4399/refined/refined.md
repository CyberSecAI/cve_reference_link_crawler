- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The theme does not validate a parameter ("path") before using it to make a request, resulting in an SSRF vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can make arbitrary requests to internal or external resources by manipulating the `path` parameter, potentially leading to information disclosure or further attacks on internal systems.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL with a desired `path` parameter, an unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerable request via the `download.php` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They need to craft a malicious URL that contains the target for the SSRF attack.
