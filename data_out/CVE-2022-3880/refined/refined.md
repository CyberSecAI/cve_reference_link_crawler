The provided content relates to CVE-2022-3880.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The AntiHacker WordPress plugin lacks proper authorization and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in an AJAX action.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect authorization: The plugin allows any authenticated user (including subscribers) to call an AJAX action intended for administrators.
- Missing CSRF protection: The AJAX action is vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker, even with subscriber-level access, can install and activate arbitrary plugins from the WordPress.org plugin repository. This could lead to full site compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network attack via a malicious request.
- Attackers can exploit the lack of CSRF protection by crafting a malicious link or webpage that triggers the vulnerable AJAX action when visited by a logged-in user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have an account on the affected WordPress site (at least subscriber role).
- The attacker can use a web browser to send the malicious request.
