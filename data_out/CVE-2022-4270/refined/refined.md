Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-4270:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an "Incorrect privilege assignment issue" within M-Files Web. Specifically, a user with access to a document that has a special Access Control List (ACL) could accidentally save the document with incorrect default permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in the way M-Files Web handles permission assignments when saving documents with specific ACLs. The system fails to properly retain the intended permissions during save operations under certain specific configurations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is that permissions can be unintentionally changed. Specifically a user may accidentally save a document with incorrect default permissions due to this bug. The CVE description explicitly states this vulnerability does *not* allow an attacker without privileges to obtain more privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a user interacting with the M-Files Web interface. The user must have access to a document with a special ACL. The user needs to perform an action that triggers the save mechanism to cause the incorrect default permissions to be applied.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a user who has legitimate access to M-Files Web.
*   The user must have access to a document with a specific ACL configuration.
*   The user must perform an action to save the document.
*  The vulnerability requires very specific configurations.

**Additional Notes**

*   The issue is present in M-Files Web versions before 22.5.11436.1.
