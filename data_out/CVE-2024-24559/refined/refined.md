  "CVE-2024-24559": {
    "description": "There is an error in the stack management when compiling the `IR` for `sha3_64`. Concretely, the `height` variable is miscalculated.\n\nThe vulnerability can't be triggered without writing the `IR` by hand. That is, it cannot be triggered from regular vyper code, it can only be triggered by using the `fang` binary directly (this binary used to be called `vyper-ir` prior to v0.3.4).",
    "root_cause": "The `height` variable, which tracks the stack depth during compilation, was not incremented after compiling the first argument of the `sha3_64` operation. This leads to incorrect stack manipulation when the second argument is compiled, as it uses the same `height` instead of an incremented one, which results in `DUP` instruction to access an incorrect stack item.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect stack manipulation due to miscalculated height variable.",
      "Use of incorrect stack height leads to duplicate stack items."
    ],
    "impact": "Incorrect bytecode is generated, causing unexpected behavior during contract execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can only be triggered by manually crafting the `IR` (Intermediate Representation) code and using the `fang` binary directly.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to manually write `IR` code for the `sha3_64` operation using the fang binary. This is not a vulnerability that can be triggered through normal Vyper code compilation."
