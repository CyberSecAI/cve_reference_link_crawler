# sha3 codegen bug

Low

[charles-cooper](/charles-cooper)
published
GHSA-6845-xw22-ffxv
Feb 5, 2024

## Package

pip

vyper
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=0.3.10

## Patched versions

0.4.0

## Description

### Summary

There is an error in the stack management when compiling the `IR` for `sha3_64`. Concretely, the `height` variable is miscalculated.

The vulnerability can't be triggered without writing the `IR` by hand. That is, it cannot be triggered from regular vyper code, it can only be triggered by using the `fang` binary directly (this binary used to be called `vyper-ir` prior to v0.3.4).

### Details

To compile `sha3_64`, the `arg[0]` and `arg[1]` have to be compiled:

[vyper/vyper/ir/compile\_ir.py](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/c150fc49ee9375a930d177044559b83cb95f7963/vyper/ir/compile_ir.py#L585-L586)

Lines 585 to 586
in
[c150fc4](/vyperlang/vyper/commit/c150fc49ee9375a930d177044559b83cb95f7963)

|  | o = \_compile\_to\_assembly(code.args[0], withargs, existing\_labels, break\_dest, height) |
| --- | --- |
|  | o.extend(\_compile\_to\_assembly(code.args[1], withargs, existing\_labels, break\_dest, height)) |

As can be seen, after compiling the 0th arg, the `height` variable isn't increased. If new `withargs` are defined in the inner scope, they are manipulated correctly, because both their `height` is off and also the global `height` is off and thus their placement on the stack is computed correctly.

`sha3_64` is used for retrieval in mappings. No flow that would cache the `key` was found, the issue shouldn't be possible to trigger when compiling the compiler-generated `IR`.

### PoC

Suppose the following hand-written IR:

```
(with _loc
	(with val 1
		(with key 2
			(sha3_64 val key)))
				(seq
					(sstore _loc
					(with x (sload _loc)
						(with ans (add x 1) (seq (assert (ge ans x)) ans))))))
```

after compilation:

```
the generated bytecode: 6001600281806020525f5260405f2090509050805460018101818110610026579050815550005b5f80fd

0000    60  PUSH1 0x01
0002    60  PUSH1 0x02
0004    81  DUP2
0005    80  DUP1       *********** bad code here!!!!!!
0006    60  PUSH1 0x20
0008    52  MSTORE

```

It can be seen that the second `DUP` will dup the item on the top of the stack which is incorrect.

### Patches

Patched in [#4063](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/4063).

### Impact

Versions v0.2.0-v0.3.10 were evaluated, and access of the variable with the invalid height is not reachable from IR generated by the vyper front-end. Because the issue isn't triggered during normal compilation of vyper code, the impact is considered low.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-24559

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
