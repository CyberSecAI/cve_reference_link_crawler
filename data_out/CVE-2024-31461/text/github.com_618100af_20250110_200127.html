# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerability

Critical

[sriramveeraghanta](/sriramveeraghanta)
published
GHSA-j77v-w36v-63v6
Apr 10, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= v0.16-dev

## Patched versions

v0.17-dev

## Description

We have identified a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in [makeplane/plane](https://github.com/makeplane/plane). This issue may allow an attacker to send arbitrary requests from the server hosting the application, potentially leading to unauthorized access to internal systems.

### Impact

The impact of this vulnerability includes, but is not limited to:

* Unauthorized access to internal services accessible from the server.
* Potential leakage of sensitive information from internal services.
* Manipulation of internal systems by interacting with internal APIs.

### Affected Components

Version(s) Affected: <= v0.16-dev

Fixed in Version: v0.17-dev

SSRF vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can control the server's HTTP requests to arbitrary locations. In our case, jira importer API can be used as a proxy to make a request to any other server. This could allow an attacker to use host machine as a poxy and hide all activity.

### Mitigation and Remediation

We strongly recommend all users to update to the latest version of Plane, where this vulnerability has been addressed. If you are unable to update immediately, consider the following mitigation steps:

* Restrict outgoing network connections from servers hosting the application to essential services only.
* Implement strict input validation on URLs or parameters that are used to generate server-side requests.
