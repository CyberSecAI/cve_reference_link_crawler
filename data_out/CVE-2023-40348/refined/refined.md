Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-40348:

**CVE-2023-40348** is associated with the **Gogs Plugin**.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Gogs plugin's webhook endpoint (`/gogs-webhook`) does not enforce authentication or a secret by default, allowing unauthenticated access.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   **Insecure default configuration**: The plugin does not enable the Gogs secret by default for its webhook endpoint.
    *   **Information Disclosure**: The webhook endpoint reveals whether a job exists or not based on the provided name, even if the user lacks permission to access it.
*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   **Unauthenticated job triggering**: Attackers can trigger builds of arbitrary jobs, as the webhook endpoint does not require authentication.
    *   **Job existence enumeration**: Attackers can determine if a job with a specific name exists on the Jenkins instance, even if they don't have the necessary permissions to view it.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   The attack vector is over the network via the `/gogs-webhook` endpoint.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Jenkins instance, and is unauthenticated.
    *   The attacker needs to know the Jenkins instance's URL.
*   **Additional Information:**
    *   There is no fix available for this vulnerability as of the publication of the advisory.
    *   The vulnerability was reported by anhnm99.
