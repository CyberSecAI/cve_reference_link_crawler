Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `username` and `password` parameters within the login functionality of the Event Registration System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection. The 'username' and 'password' parameters in the login forms are directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, potentially including user credentials, personal information, and event details.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
*  **Application Compromise:** Complete compromise of the application and underlying database.
*   **Database Exploitation:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying database, suggesting further compromise might be possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `Login.php` script via the vulnerable portal.php or admin/login.php pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application server.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL syntax to construct malicious payloads and use tools like sqlmap.
*   **Tools:** Using tools like Burp Suite to intercept and modify requests and sqlmap to automate database exploitation.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable parameters are `username` and `password` which are passed via the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited using SQL injection techniques like boolean-based blind and time-based blind injection.
*  The back-end DBMS is MySQL (MariaDB fork)

**URLs affected:**
*   `http://localhost/event/portal.php`
*   `http://localhost/event/admin/login.php`
*   `http://localhost/event/classes/Login.php?f=rlogin`

**CVE ID:** Although a CVE ID is mentioned as "Reported, waiting for CVE number," the content clearly points to the vulnerability that was later assigned CVE-2024-5118.
