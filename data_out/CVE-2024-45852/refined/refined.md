This document contains a security advisory detailing multiple vulnerabilities in MindsDB, including CVE-2024-45852.

**CVE-2024-45852**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of `pickle.loads` on a custom model within the `decode` function of the `mindsdb/integrations/handlers/byom_handler/proc_wrapper.py` file.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Deserialization of untrusted data leading to arbitrary code execution. Specifically, a malicious pickle object can be injected into a custom model during the "Build Your Own Model" process via the 'Upload Custom Model' feature.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code on the server where MindsDB is running.
*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker uploads a malicious python script with a malicious pickle object as part of a custom model via the MindsDB UI, which is then deserialized when a `predict` or `describe` query is executed.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   Attacker must be authenticated to a MindsDB instance.
    *  Attacker must be able to access the 'Upload Custom Model' feature
    *   Attacker can inject malicious pickle object into the model by writing a python script that creates it.
    * The attacker needs to upload the model, dataset and `requirements.txt`
