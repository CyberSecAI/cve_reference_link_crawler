- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter (`afirstname`) before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user to malicious websites, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user, especially if the victim has high privileges, like an admin.
- **Attack vectors:** A crafted URL or HTML form can be used to inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious link or HTML file. No authentication is required.
