- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path within the `copyStickerContent` command before using it in file operations. This allows an attacker to manipulate the path.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability. The application does not sanitize user-provided paths, allowing access to arbitrary files on the system via directory traversal.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can disclose sensitive information in the context of SYSTEM. The vulnerability allows unauthorized read access to files on the system.

- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability without authentication. The `copyStickerContent` command is vulnerable to manipulation.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, and attackers can do so remotely.
