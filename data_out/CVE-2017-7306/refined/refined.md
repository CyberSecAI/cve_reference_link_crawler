{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Riverbed products use a weak default password for the secure vault, which can be easily derived using the appliance's serial number and a known algorithm.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Weak default password for the secure vault.",
    "The password can be derived using appliance serial number and a known algorithm"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A physically proximate attacker can defeat the secure-vault protection mechanism and gain access to sensitive information, such as SSL private keys, RiOS data store encryption keys, and replication or delegate user configuration details. This would compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Physical access to the appliance.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires physical access to the Riverbed appliance. They also need knowledge of the password algorithm and the appliance serial number."
