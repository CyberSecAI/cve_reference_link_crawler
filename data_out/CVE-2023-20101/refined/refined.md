- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The presence of static user credentials for the *root* account that are typically reserved for use during development. These credentials cannot be changed or deleted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Hardcoded, static credentials for the root user account. This falls under CWE-798, which is Use of Hard-coded Credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can log into the affected system and execute arbitrary commands as the *root* user, leading to a complete compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, unauthenticated network access is used to login to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network connectivity to the affected device, but does not require any prior authentication.
