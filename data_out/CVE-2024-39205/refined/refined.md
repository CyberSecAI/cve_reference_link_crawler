{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a sandbox escape in the js2py library, which is used by the `/flash/addcrypted2` API endpoint in pyload-ng. This endpoint, intended for localhost connections only, can be accessed remotely by manipulating the HTTP Host header.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "js2py sandbox escape vulnerability (CVE-2024-28397)",
      "Insufficient restriction on access to the `/flash/addcrypted2` API endpoint, allowing remote access via HTTP header manipulation."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution (RCE) is possible on the server running vulnerable versions of pyload-ng. An attacker can send a malicious request containing shell commands, which will be executed by the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attack by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/flash/addcrypted2` API endpoint."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target pyload-ng server. No specific privileges are required.",
