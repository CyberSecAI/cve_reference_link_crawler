- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web application, which would then be executed by the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits a malicious URL or interacts with a manipulated link. The malicious script is reflected back to the user's browser in the response.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL or link and induce a victim to visit the malicious URL.
