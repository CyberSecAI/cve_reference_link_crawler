- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the search functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This can be used to steal cookies, session tokens, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed through the search functionality of the I-Librarian application via the '/librarian/index.php/arxiv/search', '/librarian/index.php/#pubmed/search' and '/librarian/index.php/#pmc/search' endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to submit input to the search functionality of the vulnerable application, indicating that they could be either a local or remote attacker. The content specifies the vulnerability allows a local attacker to execute XSS.
