- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A data race occurs when a `tokio::sync::oneshot` channel is closed via `oneshot::Receiver::close` and, concurrently, `oneshot::Sender::send` is called while the corresponding `oneshot::Receiver` is being `await`ed or calling `try_recv`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Data race due to concurrent access of a shared memory location by the sender and receiver halves of the channel after the receiver has been closed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory corruption can occur due to the data race.
- **Attack vectors**: Concurrent calls to `oneshot::Sender::send` and either `await` or `try_recv` on the `oneshot::Receiver` after `oneshot::Receiver::close` has been called.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trigger the described race condition by concurrently interacting with the `oneshot` channel after it has been closed. Specifically, they must trigger `close()` on the receiver end, and concurrently call `send()` on the sender, and either `await` or `try_recv` on the receiver.
