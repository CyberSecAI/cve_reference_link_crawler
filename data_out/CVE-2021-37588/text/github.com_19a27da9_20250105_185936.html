| Hello,  At CT-RSA 2021 Venema and Alpar presented attacks against 11 ABE schemes and two of them are implemented in the last version of CHARM: DAC-MACS and MA-ABE-YJ14:   * <https://jhuisi.github.io/charm/charm/schemes/abenc/abenc_dacmacs_yj14.html> * <https://jhuisi.github.io/charm/_modules/abenc_maabe_yj14.html>   Moreover, the YCT14 scheme was broken in 2019 and is also implemented in CHARM: <https://github.com/JHUISI/charm/blob/dev/charm/schemes/abenc/abenc_yct14.py>  It is possible to mount decryption attacks against them.
