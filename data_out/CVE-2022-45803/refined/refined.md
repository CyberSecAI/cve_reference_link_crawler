- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication or nonce token check in a function, leading to broken access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute actions that should be limited to users with higher privileges. The specific impact varies depending on the action that can be performed.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability is triggered by a function lacking proper access control mechanisms.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a subscriber level user.
