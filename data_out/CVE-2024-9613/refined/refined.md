Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9613

**Vulnerability Description:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'userId' and 'publishId' parameters within the FormFacade WordPress plugin. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input, specifically the 'userId' and 'publishId' parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the webpage.
- If a user clicks on a crafted link containing the malicious script, the script will execute in the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable website.
- This could lead to various attacks, such as:
  - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
  - Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
  - Defacing the website.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted URLs that include malicious JavaScript code within the `userId` and `publishId` URL parameters.
- An attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on a malicious URL. This can be done via social engineering, phishing emails or by injecting the link into another website the victim frequents.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs.
- The attacker needs to trick a user to click on the malicious URL.

**Affected Software:**
- FormFacade WordPress plugin versions up to and including 1.3.6

**Patched Version:**
- 1.3.7

**Remediation:**
- Update the FormFacade WordPress plugin to version 1.3.7 or later.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided code snippet shows sanitization attempts with `sanitize_text_field`, `wp_unslash` and escaping with `esc_attr` when building the URL parameters, however, this is insufficient to prevent injection of malicious code via these parameters.
