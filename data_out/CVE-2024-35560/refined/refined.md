Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the described vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Root Cause:** The `idccms V1.35` application is vulnerable to CSRF. Specifically, the `/admin/ca_deal.php` endpoint, which is used to delete data, does not implement proper CSRF protection. The application does not validate the origin or source of the request, which makes it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses:**
*   Lack of CSRF protection mechanisms such as:
    *   Synchronizer token pattern (CSRF tokens)
    *   Checking the `Origin` or `Referer` headers

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can trick a logged-in user into executing unwanted actions on the `idccms` application.
*   In this specific case, the provided example demonstrates that an attacker can force a user to delete an advertisement by submitting a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that targets the vulnerable endpoint (`/admin/ca_deal.php`).
*   The attacker tricks a logged-in user into visiting the malicious page. This could be achieved through social engineering or by injecting the malicious code into a website the user is likely to visit.
*   When the user loads the page, their browser automatically sends the crafted POST request to `/admin/ca_deal.php`, including any active session cookies.
*   Because the application does not validate CSRF tokens, the request is treated as legitimate and performs the delete operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and the parameters required to trigger the desired action.
*   The attacker needs to be able to host or deliver the crafted HTML page to a logged-in user of the `idccms` application.
*   The user must have an active session with the vulnerable application.

**Additional Information:**
* The provided PoC demonstrates the vulnerability by deleting an advertisement. However, CSRF attacks can be used to perform any action that the user is authorized to do within the application.
* The target application is accessible on `http://127.0.0.1:80/`.

**Summary:**

The provided content describes a CSRF vulnerability in `idccms V1.35`, where an attacker can force logged-in users to perform actions such as deleting advertisements via a crafted HTML page. The vulnerability exists due to the lack of CSRF protection mechanisms, which is a common weakness.
