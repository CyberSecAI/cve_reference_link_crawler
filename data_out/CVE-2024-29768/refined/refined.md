- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Astra Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The theme does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts into the website, which will be executed when guests visit the site. This could lead to redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payload execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through user-supplied input to the theme.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject scripts into the theme, which may require editor-level privileges.
