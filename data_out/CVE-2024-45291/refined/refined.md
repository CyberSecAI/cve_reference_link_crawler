Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper path validation when embedding images within an XLSX file using the HTML writer of PhpSpreadsheet. Specifically, the application doesn't sanitize or validate the paths of linked images in the `drawing1.xml.rels` file. This allows an attacker to provide arbitrary file paths or URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Absolute Path Traversal:** By specifying file paths like `/etc/passwd` in the `Target` attribute of the `Relationship` tag in `drawing1.xml.rels`, an attacker can force the application to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  By specifying URLs (e.g., `http://example.org`) in the `Target` attribute, the application can be made to perform HTTP requests to arbitrary destinations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files from the server, such as configuration files, passwords, or other confidential data.
*   **SSRF:** Attackers can potentially access internal resources, interact with internal APIs, or reveal secrets from cloud metadata by exploiting the SSRF vulnerability.
*   **Remote Code Execution (Potentially):** If PHP protocol wrappers like `expect://` are enabled, this vulnerability could lead to remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker crafts a malicious XLSX file, embedding references to arbitrary local files or URLs within the drawing relationships.
*   The attacker then tricks the user/application into processing the malicious XLSX file using the vulnerable PhpSpreadsheet library with `setEmbedImages(true)`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create or modify XLSX files.
*   The attacker must convince a user or application to process the malicious XLSX file using a vulnerable version of PhpSpreadsheet with HTML writer and `setEmbedImages(true)` enabled.
*   The attacker does not need specific user privileges in the application in order to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability exists because the `getimagesize()` function does not prevent the vulnerability.
*   The `file_get_contents()` function is used without proper path validation, making it possible to read arbitrary files or URLs.
*   The code snippet within the content shows how `base64_encode` is used on the content of the files read which is then embedded into the `src` attribute of an `img` tag.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to read `/etc/passwd` and a HTTP response using a crafted XLSX file.
