**Root cause of vulnerability:** SAP HANA XS does not enforce encryption for form-based authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319). The vulnerability lies in the lack of encryption enforcement when using form-based authentication in SAP HANA Extended Application Services (XS).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially capture valid credentials from network traffic, gaining unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack vectors:** Network traffic interception.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be positioned on the network to intercept traffic between the client and the SAP HANA server. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
