# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2017

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2017

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 310 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at [July 2017 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2282980.1).

Please note that the vulnerabilities in this Critical Patch Update are scored using version 3.0 of Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com](//www.java.com/en/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use  [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2017verbose.html) .

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a  [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see  [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible** . Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2017 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 2261562.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2261562.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 32 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 28 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2017verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2018

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2018

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](//www.oracle.com/securityalerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 334 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2018 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2420273.1).

Many industry experts anticipate that exploits leveraging known flaws in modern processor designs will continue to be disclosed for the foreseeable future (i.e., “Spectre” variants). For information related to these issues, please refer to:

* the January 2018 Critical Patch Update (and later) Advisories,
* the "Addendum to the January 2018 Critical Patch Update Advisory for Spectre (CVE-2017-5715, CVE-2017-5753) and Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754)" ([Doc ID 2347948.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2347948.1)), and
* "Information about processor vulnerabilities CVE-2018-3640 ("Spectre v3a") and CVE-2018-3639 ("Spectre v4")" ([Doc ID 2399123.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2399123.1)).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](//www.oracle.com/securityalerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2018verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](//www.oracle.com/securityalerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 44 new security fixes for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  38 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujul2018verbose.html#FMW).

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update July 2018 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2394520.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2394520.1).

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2787)

## Topic

An update for rh-mysql56-mysql is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of the MySQL server daemon, mysqld, and many client programs.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: rh-mysql56-mysql (5.6.37).

Security Fix(es):

* An integer overflow flaw leading to a buffer overflow was found in the way MySQL parsed connection handshake packets. An unauthenticated remote attacker with access to the MySQL port could use this flaw to crash the mysqld daemon. (CVE-2017-3599)
* It was discovered that the mysql and mysqldump tools did not correctly handle database and table names containing newline characters. A database user with privileges to create databases or tables could cause the mysql command to execute arbitrary shell or SQL commands while restoring database backup created using the mysqldump tool. (CVE-2016-5483, CVE-2017-3600)
* Multiple flaws were found in the way the MySQL init script handled initialization of the database data directory and permission setting on the error log file. The mysql operating system user could use these flaws to escalate their privileges to root. (CVE-2017-3265)
* It was discovered that the mysqld\_safe script honored the ledir option value set in a MySQL configuration file. A user able to modify one of the MySQL configuration files could use this flaw to escalate their privileges to root. (CVE-2017-3291)
* It was discovered that the MySQL client command line tools only checked after authentication whether server supported SSL. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to hijack client's authentication to the server even if the client was configured to require SSL connection. (CVE-2017-3305)
* Multiple flaws were found in the way the mysqld\_safe script handled creation of error log file. The mysql operating system user could use these flaws to escalate their privileges to root. (CVE-2017-3312)
* A flaw was found in the way MySQL client library (libmysqlclient) handled prepared statements when server connection was lost. A malicious server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could possibly use this flaw to crash an application using libmysqlclient. (CVE-2017-3302)
* This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the MySQL database server. Information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory pages listed in the References section. (CVE-2016-8327, CVE-2017-3238, CVE-2017-3244, CVE-2017-3257, CVE-2017-3258, CVE-2017-3273, CVE-2017-3308, CVE-2017-3309, CVE-2017-3313, CVE-2017-3317, CVE-2017-3318, CVE-2017-3450, CVE-2017-3452, CVE-2017-3453, CVE-2017-3456, CVE-2017-3461, CVE-2017-3462, CVE-2017-3463, CVE-2017-3464, CVE-2017-3633, CVE-2017-3634, CVE-2017-3636, CVE-2017-3641, CVE-2017-3647, CVE-2017-3648, CVE-2017-3649, CVE-2017-3651, CVE-2017-3652, CVE-2017-3653)

Red Hat would like to thank Pali Rohár for reporting CVE-2017-3305.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, the md5() function was blocked by MySQL in FIPS mode because the MD5 hash algorithm is considered insecure. Consequently, the mysqld daemon failed with error messages when FIPS mode was enabled. With this update, md5() is allowed in FIPS mode for non-security operations. Note that users are able to use md5() for security purposes but such usage is not supported by Red Hat. (BZ#1452469)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

## Topic

An update for rh-mysql57-mysql is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of the MySQL server daemon, mysqld, and many client programs.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: rh-mysql57-mysql (5.7.19).

Security Fix(es):

* An integer overflow flaw leading to a buffer overflow was found in the way MySQL parsed connection handshake packets. An unauthenticated remote attacker with access to the MySQL port could use this flaw to crash the mysqld daemon. (CVE-2017-3599)
* It was discovered that the mysql and mysqldump tools did not correctly handle database and table names containing newline characters. A database user with privileges to create databases or tables could cause the mysql command to execute arbitrary shell or SQL commands while restoring database backup created using the mysqldump tool. (CVE-2016-5483, CVE-2017-3600)
* It was discovered that the mysqld\_safe script honored the ledir option value set in a MySQL configuration file. A user able to modify one of the MySQL configuration files could use this flaw to escalate their privileges to root. (CVE-2017-3291)
* Multiple flaws were found in the way the mysqld\_safe script handled creation of error log file. The mysql operating system user could use these flaws to escalate their privileges to root. (CVE-2017-3312)
* This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the MySQL database server. Information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory pages listed in the References section. (CVE-2016-8327, CVE-2017-3238, CVE-2017-3244, CVE-2017-3251, CVE-2017-3256, CVE-2017-3257, CVE-2017-3258, CVE-2017-3273, CVE-2017-3308, CVE-2017-3309, CVE-2017-3313, CVE-2017-3317, CVE-2017-3318, CVE-2017-3319, CVE-2017-3320, CVE-2017-3331, CVE-2017-3450, CVE-2017-3453, CVE-2017-3454, CVE-2017-3455, CVE-2017-3456, CVE-2017-3457, CVE-2017-3458, CVE-2017-3459, CVE-2017-3460, CVE-2017-3461, CVE-2017-3462, CVE-2017-3463, CVE-2017-3464, CVE-2017-3465, CVE-2017-3467, CVE-2017-3468, CVE-2017-3529, CVE-2017-3633, CVE-2017-3634, CVE-2017-3637, CVE-2017-3638, CVE-2017-3639, CVE-2017-3640, CVE-2017-3641, CVE-2017-3642, CVE-2017-3643, CVE-2017-3644, CVE-2017-3645, CVE-2017-3646, CVE-2017-3647, CVE-2017-3648, CVE-2017-3649, CVE-2017-3650, CVE-2017-3651, CVE-2017-3652, CVE-2017-3653)

Bug Fix(es):

* Prior to this update, the scl macros were not set for the rh-mysql57-mysqld@.service file, which consequently made the service file unusable. This bug has been fixed, and rh-mysql57-mysqld@.service now works as expected. (BZ#1452511)
* Previously, the md5() function was blocked by MySQL in FIPS mode because the MD5 hash algorithm is considered insecure. Consequently, the mysqld daemon failed with error messages when FIPS mode was enabled. With this update, md5() is allowed in FIPS mode for non-security operations. Note that users are able to use md5() for security purposes but such usage is not supported by Red Hat. (BZ#1452514)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.
