**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-50270

**Vulnerability Description:** Apache DolphinScheduler versions 1.3.8 through 3.2.0 are vulnerable to session fixation. User sessions remain valid even after a password change.

**Root Cause:** The application fails to invalidate or expire existing user sessions upon a password change.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Session Fixation:** The core vulnerability is the failure to invalidate sessions after a password change. This allows an attacker who has compromised a user's session to maintain access even after the user updates their password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who has previously obtained a valid session cookie or token can maintain access to the user's account even after the user has changed their password. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of system configurations, or execution of malicious workflows within DolphinScheduler.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could acquire a valid session via methods like cross-site scripting (XSS) or by intercepting network traffic.
*   **Exploitation:** After user changes password, the attacker can continue to use the hijacked session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Initial Access:** The attacker needs to have somehow gained a valid session before the user changes their password. This could be through malicious means.

**Additional Details:**
*   The fix involves invalidating existing sessions when a user's password is changed.
*   The fix is included in version 3.2.1
*   The fix was implemented in [PR #15219](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/15219)
