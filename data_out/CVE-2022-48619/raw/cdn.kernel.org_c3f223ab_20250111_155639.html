    afs: Fix afs_getattr() to refetch file status if callback break occurred
    
    [ Upstream commit 2aeb8c86d49967552394d5e723f87454cb53f501 ]
    
    If a callback break occurs (change notification), afs_getattr() needs to
    issue an FS.FetchStatus RPC operation to update the status of the file
    being examined by the stat-family of system calls.
    
    Fix afs_getattr() to do this if AFS_VNODE_CB_PROMISED has been cleared
    on a vnode by a callback break.  Skip this if AT_STATX_DONT_SYNC is set.
    
    This can be tested by appending to a file on one AFS client and then
    using "stat -L" to examine its length on a machine running kafs.  This
    can also be watched through tracing on the kafs machine.  The callback
    break is seen:
    
         kworker/1:1-46      [001] .....   978.910812: afs_cb_call: c=0000005f YFSCB.CallBack
         kworker/1:1-46      [001] ...1.   978.910829: afs_cb_break: 100058:23b4c:242d2c2 b=2 s=1 break-cb
         kworker/1:1-46      [001] .....   978.911062: afs_call_done:    c=0000005f ret=0 ab=0 [0000000082994ead]
    
    And then the stat command generated no traffic if unpatched, but with
    this change a call to fetch the status can be observed:
    
                stat-4471    [000] .....   986.744122: afs_make_fs_call: c=000000ab 100058:023b4c:242d2c2 YFS.FetchStatus
                stat-4471    [000] .....   986.745578: afs_call_done:    c=000000ab ret=0 ab=0 [0000000087fc8c84]

    Input: ili210x - fix reset timing
    
    commit e4920d42ce0e9c8aafb7f64b6d9d4ae02161e51e upstream.
    
    According to Ilitek "231x & ILI251x Programming Guide" Version: 2.30
    "2.1. Power Sequence", "T4 Chip Reset and discharge time" is minimum
    10ms and "T2 Chip initial time" is maximum 150ms. Adjust the reset
    timings such that T4 is 12ms and T2 is 160ms to fit those figures.
    
    This prevents sporadic touch controller start up failures when some
    systems with at least ILI251x controller boot, without this patch
    the systems sometimes fail to communicate with the touch controller.

    net: atlantic: fix "frag[0] not initialized"
    
    [ Upstream commit 62e0ae0f4020250f961cf8d0103a4621be74e077 ]
    
    In aq_ring_rx_clean(), if buff->is_eop is not set AND
    buff->len < AQ_CFG_RX_HDR_SIZE, then hdr_len remains equal to
    buff->len and skb_add_rx_frag(xxx, *0*, ...) is not called.
    
    The loop following this code starts calling skb_add_rx_frag() starting
    with i=1 and thus frag[0] is never initialized. Since i is initialized
    to zero at the top of the primary loop, we can just reference and
    post-increment i instead of hardcoding the 0 when calling
    skb_add_rx_frag() the first time.

    net: fix wrong network header length
    
    [ Upstream commit cf3ab8d4a797960b4be20565abb3bcd227b18a68 ]
    
    When clatd starts with ebpf offloaing, and NETIF_F_GRO_FRAGLIST is enable,
    several skbs are gathered in skb_shinfo(skb)->frag_list. The first skb's
    ipv6 header will be changed to ipv4 after bpf_skb_proto_6_to_4,
    network_header\transport_header\mac_header have been updated as ipv4 acts,
    but other skbs in frag_list didnot update anything, just ipv6 packets.
    
    udp_queue_rcv_skb will call skb_segment_list to traverse other skbs in
    frag_list and make sure right udp payload is delivered to user space.
    Unfortunately, other skbs in frag_list who are still ipv6 packets are
    updated like the first skb and will have wrong transport header length.
    
    e.g.before bpf_skb_proto_6_to_4,the first skb and other skbs in frag_list
    has the same network_header(24)& transport_header(64), after
    bpf_skb_proto_6_to_4, ipv6 protocol has been changed to ipv4, the first
    skb's network_header is 44,transport_header is 64, other skbs in frag_list
    didnot change.After skb_segment_list, the other skbs in frag_list has
    different network_header(24) and transport_header(44), so there will be 20
    bytes different from original,that is difference between ipv6 header and
    ipv4 header. Just change transport_header to be the same with original.
    
    Actually, there are two solutions to fix it, one is traversing all skbs
    and changing every skb header in bpf_skb_proto_6_to_4, the other is
    modifying frag_list skb's header in skb_segment_list. Considering
    efficiency, adopt the second one--- when the first skb and other skbs in
    frag_list has different network_header length, restore them to make sure
    right udp payload is delivered to user space.

    The probe function, pmt_telem_probe(), adds an entry for devices even if
    they have not been initialized.  This results in the array of initialized
    devices containing both initialized and uninitialized entries.  This
    causes a panic in the remove function, pmt_telem_remove() which expects
    the array to only contain initialized entries.
    
    Only use an entry when a device is initialized.

    [ Upstream commit aa2fef6f40e6ccc22e932b36898f260f0e5a021a ]
    
    There was an issue with the dual fan probe whereby the probe was
    failing as it assuming that second_fan support was not available.
    
    Corrected the logic so the probe works correctly. Cleaned up so
    quirks only used if 2nd fan not detected.

    fbdev: Prevent possible use-after-free in fb_release()
    
    [ Upstream commit 89bfd4017e58faaf70411555e7f508495114e90b ]
    
    Most fbdev drivers have issues with the fb_info lifetime, because call to
    framebuffer_release() from their driver's .remove callback, rather than
    doing from fbops.fb_destroy callback.
    
    Doing that will destroy the fb_info too early, while references to it may
    still exist, leading to a use-after-free error.
    
    To prevent this, check the fb_info reference counter when attempting to
    kfree the data structure in framebuffer_release(). That will leak it but
    at least will prevent the mentioned error.

    Revert "fbdev: Make fb_release() return -ENODEV if fbdev was unregistered"
    
    [ Upstream commit 135332f34ba2662bc1e32b5c612e06a8cc41a053 ]
    
    This reverts commit aafa025c76dcc7d1a8c8f0bdefcbe4eb480b2f6a. That commit
    attempted to fix a NULL pointer dereference, caused by the struct fb_info
    associated with a framebuffer device to not longer be valid when the file
    descriptor was closed.
    
    The issue was exposed by commit 27599aacbaef ("fbdev: Hot-unplug firmware
    fb devices on forced removal"), which added a new path that goes through
    the struct device removal instead of directly unregistering the fb.
    
    Most fbdev drivers have issues with the fb_info lifetime, because call to
    framebuffer_release() from their driver's .remove callback, rather than
    doing from fbops.fb_destroy callback. This meant that due to this switch,
    the fb_info was now destroyed too early, while references still existed,
    while before it was simply leaked.
    
    The patch we're reverting here reinstated that leak, hence "fixed" the
    regression. But the proper solution is to fix the drivers to not release
    the fb_info too soon.

    selftests: add ping test with ping_group_range tuned
    
    [ Upstream commit e71b7f1f44d3d88c677769c85ef0171caf9fc89f ]
    
    The 'ping' utility is able to manage two kind of sockets (raw or icmp),
    depending on the sysctl ping_group_range. By default, ping_group_range is
    set to '1 0', which forces ping to use an ip raw socket.
    
    Let's replay the ping tests by allowing 'ping' to use the ip icmp socket.
    After the previous patch, ipv4 tests results are the same with both kinds
    of socket. For ipv6, there are a lot a new failures (the previous patch
    fixes only two cases).

    scsi: qla2xxx: Fix missed DMA unmap for aborted commands
    
    [ Upstream commit 26f9ce53817a8fd84b69a73473a7de852a24c897 ]
    
    Aborting commands that have already been sent to the firmware can
    cause BUG in qlt_free_cmd(): BUG_ON(cmd->sg_mapped)
    
    For instance:
    
     - Command passes rdx_to_xfer state, maps sgl, sends to the firmware
    
     - Reset occurs, qla2xxx performs ISP error recovery, aborts the command
    
     - Target stack calls qlt_abort_cmd() and then qlt_free_cmd()
    
     - BUG_ON(cmd->sg_mapped) in qlt_free_cmd() occurs because sgl was not
       unmapped
    
    Thus, unmap sgl in qlt_abort_cmd() for commands with the aborted flag set.

    scsi: scsi_dh_alua: Properly handle the ALUA transitioning state
    
    [ Upstream commit 6056a92ceb2a7705d61df7ec5370548e96aee258 ]
    
    The handling of the ALUA transitioning state is currently broken. When a
    target goes into this state, it is expected that the target is allowed to
    stay in this state for the implicit transition timeout without a path
    failure. The handler has this logic, but it gets skipped currently.
    
    When the target transitions, there is in-flight I/O from the initiator. The
    first of these responses from the target will be a unit attention letting
    the initiator know that the ALUA state has changed.  The remaining
    in-flight I/Os, before the initiator finds out that the portal state has
    changed, will return not ready, ALUA state is transitioning. The portal
    state will change to SCSI_ACCESS_STATE_TRANSITIONING. This will lead to all
    new I/O immediately failing the path unexpectedly. The path failure happens
    in less than a second instead of the expected successes until the
    transition timer is exceeded.
    
    Allow I/Os to continue while the path is in the ALUA transitioning
    state. The handler already takes care of a target that stays in the
    transitioning state for too long by changing the state to ALUA state
    standby once the transition timeout is exceeded at which point the path
    will fail.

    [ Upstream commit 8994e97be3eb3c3a7b59d6223018ffab8c272e2d ]
    
    Perf BPF filter test fails in environment where "clang" is not
    installed.
    
    Test failure logs:
    
    <<>>

    Enabling verbose option provided debug logs which says clang/llvm needs
    to be installed. Snippet of verbose logs:

    Unable to get BPF object, fix kbuild first
    test child finished with -1
     ---- end ----
    BPF filter subtest 2: FAILED!
    <<>>
    
    Here subtests, "BPF pinning" and "BPF prologue generation" failed and
    logs shows clang/llvm is needed. After installing clang, testcase
    passes.
    
    Reason on why subtest failure happens though logs has proper debug
    information:
    
    Main function __test__bpf calls test_llvm__fetch_bpf_obj by
    passing 4th argument as true ( 4th arguments maps to parameter
    "force" in test_llvm__fetch_bpf_obj ). But this will cause
    test_llvm__fetch_bpf_obj to skip the check for clang/llvm.
    
    Snippet of code part which checks for clang based on
    parameter "force" in test_llvm__fetch_bpf_obj:
    
    <<>>
    if (!force && (!llvm_param.user_set_param &&
    <<>>
    
    Since force is set to "false", test won't get skipped and fails to
    compile test case. The BPF code compilation needs clang, So pass the
    fourth argument as "false" and also skip the test if reason for return
    is "TEST_SKIP"
    
    After the patch:
    
    <<>>
     42: BPF filter                    :

    perf regs x86: Fix arch__intr_reg_mask() for the hybrid platform
    
    [ Upstream commit 01b28e4a58152e8906eeb5f1b55a0c404c48c7c8 ]
    
    The X86 specific arch__intr_reg_mask() is to check whether the kernel
    and hardware can collect XMM registers. But it doesn't work on some
    hybrid platform.
    
    Without the patch on ADL-N:
    
      $ perf record -I?
      available registers: AX BX CX DX SI DI BP SP IP FLAGS CS SS R8 R9 R10
      R11 R12 R13 R14 R15
    
    The config of the test event doesn't contain the PMU information. The
    kernel may fail to initialize it on the correct hybrid PMU and return
    the wrong non-supported information.
    
    Add the PMU information into the config for the hybrid platform. The
    same register set is supported among different hybrid PMUs. Checking
    the first available one is good enough.
    
    With the patch on ADL-N:
    
      $ perf record -I?
      available registers: AX BX CX DX SI DI BP SP IP FLAGS CS SS R8 R9 R10
      R11 R12 R13 R14 R15 XMM0 XMM1 XMM2 XMM3 XMM4 XMM5 XMM6 XMM7 XMM8 XMM9

    perf test: Fix "all PMU test" to skip hv_24x7/hv_gpci tests on powerpc
    
    [ Upstream commit 451ed8058c69a3fee29fa9e2967a4e22a221fe75 ]
    
    "perf all PMU test" picks the input events from "perf list --raw-dump
    pmu" list and runs "perf stat -e" for each of the event in the list. In
    case of powerpc, the PowerVM environment supports events from hv_24x7
    and hv_gpci PMU which is of example format like below:
    
    - hv_24x7/CPM_ADJUNCT_INST,domain=?,core=?/
    - hv_gpci/event,partition_id=?/
    
    The value for "?" needs to be filled in depending on system and
    respective event. CPM_ADJUNCT_INST needs have core value and domain
    value. hv_gpci event needs partition_id.  Similarly, there are other
    events for hv_24x7 and hv_gpci having "?" in event format. Hence skip
    these events on powerpc platform since values like partition_id, domain
    is specific to system and event.

    perf build: Fix check for btf__load_from_kernel_by_id() in libbpf
    
    [ Upstream commit 0ae065a5d265bc5ada13e350015458e0c5e5c351 ]
    
    Avi Kivity reported a problem where the __weak
    btf__load_from_kernel_by_id() in tools/perf/util/bpf-event.c was being
    used and it called btf__get_from_id() in tools/lib/bpf/btf.c that in
    turn called back to btf__load_from_kernel_by_id(), resulting in an
    endless loop.
    
    Fix this by adding a feature test to check if
    btf__load_from_kernel_by_id() is available when building perf with
    LIBBPF_DYNAMIC=1, and if not then provide the fallback to the old
    btf__get_from_id(), that doesn't call back to btf__load_from_kernel_by_id()
    since at that time it didn't exist at all.
    
    Tested on Fedora 35 where we have libbpf-devel 0.4.0 with LIBBPF_DYNAMIC
    where we don't have btf__load_from_kernel_by_id() and thus its feature
    test fail, not defining HAVE_LIBBPF_BTF__LOAD_FROM_KERNEL_BY_ID:

    net: bridge: Clear offload_fwd_mark when passing frame up bridge interface.
    
    [ Upstream commit fbb3abdf2223cd0dfc07de85fe5a43ba7f435bdf ]
    
    It is possible to stack bridges on top of each other. Consider the
    following which makes use of an Ethernet switch:
    
           br1
         /    \
        /      \
       /        \
     br0.11    wlan0
       |
       br0
     /  |  \
    p1  p2  p3
    
    br0 is offloaded to the switch. Above br0 is a vlan interface, for
    vlan 11. This vlan interface is then a slave of br1. br1 also has a
    wireless interface as a slave. This setup trunks wireless lan traffic
    over the copper network inside a VLAN.
    
    A frame received on p1 which is passed up to the bridge has the
    skb->offload_fwd_mark flag set to true, indicating that the switch has
    dealt with forwarding the frame out ports p2 and p3 as needed. This
    flag instructs the software bridge it does not need to pass the frame
    back down again. However, the flag is not getting reset when the frame
    is passed upwards. As a result br1 sees the flag, wrongly interprets
    it, and fails to forward the frame to wlan0.
    
    When passing a frame upwards, clear the flag. This is the Rx
    equivalent of br_switchdev_frame_unmark() in br_dev_xmit().

    [ Upstream commit acde3929492bcb9ceb0df1270230c422b1013798 ]
    
    The current code evaluates RQT size based on the configured number of
    virtqueues. This can raise an issue in the following scenario:
    
    Assume MQ was negotiated.
    1. mlx5_vdpa_set_map() gets called.
    2. handle_ctrl_mq() is called setting cur_num_vqs to some value, lower
       than the configured max VQs.
    3. A second set_map gets called, but now a smaller number of VQs is used
       to evaluate the size of the RQT.
    4. handle_ctrl_mq() is called with a value larger than what the RQT can
       hold. This will emit errors and the driver state is compromised.
    
    To fix this, we use a new field in struct mlx5_vdpa_net to hold the
    required number of entries in the RQT. This value is evaluated in
    mlx5_vdpa_set_driver_features() where we have the negotiated features
    all set up.
    
    In addition to that, we take into consideration the max capability of RQT
    entries early when the device is added so we don't need to take consider
    it when creating the RQT.
    
    Last, we remove the use of mlx5_vdpa_max_qps() which just returns the
    max_vas / 2 and make the code clearer.

    netfilter: flowtable: move dst_check to packet path
    
    [ Upstream commit 2738d9d963bd1f06d5114c2b4fa5771a95703991 ]
    
    Fixes sporadic IPv6 packet loss when flow offloading is enabled.
    
    IPv6 route GC and flowtable GC are not synchronized.
    When dst_cache becomes stale and a packet passes through the flow before
    the flowtable GC teardowns it, the packet can be dropped.
    So, it is necessary to check dst every time in packet path.

    netfilter: flowtable: fix TCP flow teardown
    
    [ Upstream commit e5eaac2beb54f0a16ff851125082d9faeb475572 ]
    
    This patch addresses three possible problems:
    
    1. ct gc may race to undo the timeout adjustment of the packet path, leaving
       the conntrack entry in place with the internal offload timeout (one day).
    
    2. ct gc removes the ct because the IPS_OFFLOAD_BIT is not set and the CLOSE
       timeout is reached before the flow offload del.
    
    3. tcp ct is always set to ESTABLISHED with a very long timeout
       in flow offload teardown/delete even though the state might be already
       CLOSED. Also as a remark we cannot assume that the FIN or RST packet
       is hitting flow table teardown as the packet might get bumped to the
       slow path in nftables.
    
    This patch resets IPS_OFFLOAD_BIT from flow_offload_teardown(), so
    conntrack handles the tcp rst/fin packet which triggers the CLOSE/FIN
    state transition.
    
    Moreover, teturn the connection's ownership to conntrack upon teardown
    by clearing the offload flag and fixing the established timeout value.
    The flow table GC thread will asynchonrnously free the flow table and
    hardware offload entries.
    
    Before this patch, the IPS_OFFLOAD_BIT remained set for expired flows on
    which is also misleading since the flow is back to classic conntrack
    path.
    
    If nf_ct_delete() removes the entry from the conntrack table, then it
    calls nf_ct_put() which decrements the refcnt. This is not a problem
    because the flowtable holds a reference to the conntrack object from
    flow_offload_alloc() path which is released via flow_offload_free().
    
    This patch also updates nft_flow_offload to skip packets in SYN_RECV
    state. Since we might miss or bump packets to slow path, we do not know
    what will happen there while we are still in SYN_RECV, this patch
    postpones offload up to the next packet which also aligns to the
    existing behaviour in tc-ct.
    
    flow_offload_teardown() does not reset the existing tcp state from
    flow_offload_fixup_tcp() to ESTABLISHED anymore, packets bump to slow
    path might have already update the state to CLOSE/FIN.
    
    Joint work with Oz and Sven.

    igb: skip phy status check where unavailable
    
    [ Upstream commit 942d2ad5d2e0df758a645ddfadffde2795322728 ]
    
    igb_read_phy_reg() will silently return, leaving phy_data untouched, if
    hw->ops.read_reg isn't set. Depending on the uninitialized value of
    phy_data, this led to the phy status check either succeeding immediately
    or looping continuously for 2 seconds before emitting a noisy err-level
    timeout. This message went out to the console even though there was no
    actual problem.
    
    Instead, first check if there is read_reg function pointer. If not,
    proceed without trying to check the phy status register.

    mptcp: fix checksum byte order
    
    [ Upstream commit ba2c89e0ea74a904d5231643245753d77422e7f5 ]
    
    The MPTCP code typecasts the checksum value to u16 and
    then converts it to big endian while storing the value into
    the MPTCP option.
    
    As a result, the wire encoding for little endian host is
    wrong, and that causes interoperabilty interoperability
    issues with other implementation or host with different endianness.
    
    Address the issue writing in the packet the unmodified __sum16 value.
    
    MPTCP checksum is disabled by default, interoperating with systems
    with bad mptcp-level csum encoding should cause fallback to TCP.

    lockdown: also lock down previous kgdb use
    
    commit eadb2f47a3ced5c64b23b90fd2a3463f63726066 upstream.
    
    KGDB and KDB allow read and write access to kernel memory, and thus
    should be restricted during lockdown.  An attacker with access to a
    serial port (for example, via a hypervisor console, which some cloud
    vendors provide over the network) could trigger the debugger so it is
    important that the debugger respect the lockdown mode when/if it is
    triggered.
    
    Fix this by integrating lockdown into kdb's existing permissions
    mechanism.  Unfortunately kgdb does not have any permissions mechanism
    (although it certainly could be added later) so, for now, kgdb is simply
    and brutally disabled by immediately exiting the gdb stub without taking
    any action.
    
    For lockdowns established early in the boot (e.g. the normal case) then
    this should be fine but on systems where kgdb has set breakpoints before
    the lockdown is enacted than "bad things" will happen.

    [ Upstream commit 785d7ed295513bd3374095304b7034fd65c123b0 ]
    
    When modifying TTL, packet's csum has to be recalculated.
    Due to HW issue in ConnectX-5, csum recalculation for modify
    TTL on RX is supported through a work-around that is specifically
    enabled by configuration.
    If the work-around isn't enabled, rather than adding an unsupported
    action the modify TTL action on RX should be ignored.
    Ignoring modify TTL action might result in zero actions, so in such
    cases we will not convert the match STE to modify STE, as it is done
    by FW in DMFS.
    
    This patch fixes an issue where modify TTL action was ignored both
    on RX and TX instead of only on RX.

    NFC: nci: fix sleep in atomic context bugs caused by nci_skb_alloc
    
    [ Upstream commit 23dd4581350d4ffa23d58976ec46408f8f4c1e16 ]
    
    There are sleep in atomic context bugs when the request to secure
    element of st-nci is timeout. The root cause is that nci_skb_alloc
    with GFP_KERNEL parameter is called in st_nci_se_wt_timeout which is
    a timer handler. The call paths that could trigger bugs are shown below:
    
        (interrupt context 1)
    st_nci_se_wt_timeout
      nci_hci_send_event
        nci_hci_send_data
          nci_skb_alloc(..., GFP_KERNEL) //may sleep
    
       (interrupt context 2)
    st_nci_se_wt_timeout
      nci_hci_send_event
        nci_hci_send_data
          nci_send_data
            nci_queue_tx_data_frags
              nci_skb_alloc(..., GFP_KERNEL) //may sleep
    
    This patch changes allocation mode of nci_skb_alloc from GFP_KERNEL to
    GFP_ATOMIC in order to prevent atomic context sleeping. The GFP_ATOMIC
    flag makes memory allocation operation could be used in atomic context.

    net/qla3xxx: Fix a test in ql_reset_work()
    
    [ Upstream commit 5361448e45fac6fb96738df748229432a62d78b6 ]
    
    test_bit() tests if one bit is set or not.
    Here the logic seems to check of bit QL_RESET_PER_SCSI (i.e. 4) OR bit
    QL_RESET_START (i.e. 3) is set.
    
    In fact, it checks if bit 7 (4 | 3 = 7) is set, that is to say
    QL_ADAPTER_UP.
    
    This looks harmless, because this bit is likely be set, and when the
    ql_reset_work() delayed work is scheduled in ql3xxx_isr() (the only place
    that schedule this work), QL_RESET_START or QL_RESET_PER_SCSI is set.
    
    This has been spotted by smatch.

    ice: Fix interrupt moderation settings getting cleared
    
    [ Upstream commit bf13502ed5f941b0777b3fd1e24dac5d93f3886c ]
    
    Adaptive-rx and Adaptive-tx are interrupt moderation settings
    that can be enabled/disabled using ethtool:
    ethtool -C ethX adaptive-rx on/off adaptive-tx on/off
    
    Unfortunately those settings are getting cleared after
    changing number of queues, or in ethtool world 'channels':
    ethtool -L ethX rx 1 tx 1
    
    Clearing was happening due to introduction of bit fields
    in ice_ring_container struct. This way only itr_setting
    bits were rebuilt during ice_vsi_rebuild_set_coalesce().
    
    Introduce an anonymous struct of bitfields and create a
    union to refer to them as a single variable.
    This way variable can be easily saved and restored.

    ice: fix possible under reporting of ethtool Tx and Rx statistics
    
    [ Upstream commit 31b6298fd8e29effe9ed6b77351ac5969be56ce0 ]
    
    The hardware statistics counters are not cleared during resets so the
    drivers first access is to initialize the baseline and then subsequent
    reads are for reporting the counters. The statistics counters are read
    during the watchdog subtask when the interface is up. If the baseline
    is not initialized before the interface is up, then there can be a brief
    window in which some traffic can be transmitted/received before the
    initial baseline reading takes place.
    
    Directly initialize ethtool statistics in driver open so the baseline will
    be initialized when the interface is up, and any dropped packets
    incremented before the interface is up won't be reported.

    ice: fix crash when writing timestamp on RX rings
    
    [ Upstream commit 4503cc7fdf9a84cd631b0cb8ecb3c9b1bdbf3594 ]
    
    Do not allow to write timestamps on RX rings if PF is being configured.
    When PF is being configured RX rings can be freed or rebuilt. If at the

    arm64: kexec: load from kimage prior to clobbering
    
    [ Upstream commit eb3d8ea3e1f03f4b0b72d8f5ed9eb7c3165862e8 ]
    
    In arm64_relocate_new_kernel() we load some fields out of the kimage
    structure after relocation has occurred. As the kimage structure isn't
    allocated to be relocation-safe, it may be clobbered during relocation,
    and we may load junk values out of the structure.
    
    Due to this, kexec may fail when the kimage allocation happens to fall
    within a PA range that an object will be relocated to. This has been
    observed to occur for regular kexec on a QEMU TCG 'virt' machine with
    2GiB of RAM, where the PA range of the new kernel image overlaps the
    kimage structure.
    
    Avoid this by ensuring we load all values from the kimage structure
    prior to relocation.
    
    I've tested this atop v5.16 and v5.18-rc6.

    net: vmxnet3: fix possible NULL pointer dereference in vmxnet3_rq_cleanup()
    
    [ Upstream commit edf410cb74dc612fd47ef5be319c5a0bcd6e6ccd ]
    
    In vmxnet3_rq_create(), when dma_alloc_coherent() fails,
    vmxnet3_rq_destroy() is called. It sets rq->rx_ring[i].base to NULL. Then
    vmxnet3_rq_create() returns an error to its callers mxnet3_rq_create_all()
    -> vmxnet3_change_mtu(). Then vmxnet3_change_mtu() calls
    vmxnet3_force_close() -> dev_close() in error handling code. And the driver
    calls vmxnet3_close() -> vmxnet3_quiesce_dev() -> vmxnet3_rq_cleanup_all()
    -> vmxnet3_rq_cleanup(). In vmxnet3_rq_cleanup(),
    rq->rx_ring[ring_idx].base is accessed, but this variable is NULL, causing
    a NULL pointer dereference.
    
    To fix this possible bug, an if statement is added to check whether
    rq->rx_ring[0].base is NULL in vmxnet3_rq_cleanup() and exit early if so.
    
    The error log in our fault-injection testing is shown as follows:

    net: vmxnet3: fix possible use-after-free bugs in vmxnet3_rq_alloc_rx_buf()
    
    [ Upstream commit 9e7fef9521e73ca8afd7da9e58c14654b02dfad8 ]
    
    In vmxnet3_rq_alloc_rx_buf(), when dma_map_single() fails, rbi->skb is
    freed immediately. Similarly, in another branch, when dma_map_page() fails,
    rbi->page is also freed. In the two cases, vmxnet3_rq_alloc_rx_buf()
    returns an error to its callers vmxnet3_rq_init() -> vmxnet3_rq_init_all()
    -> vmxnet3_activate_dev(). Then vmxnet3_activate_dev() calls
    vmxnet3_rq_cleanup_all() in error handling code, and rbi->skb or rbi->page
    are freed again in vmxnet3_rq_cleanup_all(), causing use-after-free bugs.
    
    To fix these possible bugs, rbi->skb and rbi->page should be cleared after
    they are freed.
    
    The error log in our fault-injection testing is shown as follows:

    net: lan966x: Fix assignment of the MAC address
    
    [ Upstream commit af8ca6eaa9b24a90484218e356f959a94bff22fa ]
    
    The following two scenarios were failing for lan966x.
    1. If the port had the address X and then trying to assign the same
       address, then the HW was just removing this address because first it
       tries to learn new address and then delete the old one. As they are
       the same the HW remove it.
    2. If the port eth0 was assigned the same address as one of the other
       ports eth1 then when assigning back the address to eth0 then the HW
       was deleting the address of eth1.
    
    The case 1. is fixed by checking if the port has already the same
    address while case 2. is fixed by checking if the address is used by any
    other port.

    xfrm: fix "disable_policy" flag use when arriving from different devices
    
    [ Upstream commit e6175a2ed1f18bf2f649625bf725e07adcfa6a28 ]
    
    In IPv4 setting the "disable_policy" flag on a device means no policy
    should be enforced for traffic originating from the device. This was
    implemented by seting the DST_NOPOLICY flag in the dst based on the
    originating device.
    
    However, dsts are cached in nexthops regardless of the originating
    devices, in which case, the DST_NOPOLICY flag value may be incorrect.
    
    Consider the following setup:
    
                         +------------------------------+
                         | ROUTER                       |
      +-------------+    | +-----------------+          |
      | ipsec src   |----|-|ipsec0           |          |
      +-------------+    | |disable_policy=0 |   +----+ |
                         | +-----------------+   |eth1|-|-----
      +-------------+    | +-----------------+   +----+ |
      | noipsec src |----|-|eth0             |          |
      +-------------+    | |disable_policy=1 |          |
                         | +-----------------+          |
                         +------------------------------+
    
    Where ROUTER has a default route towards eth1.
    
    dst entries for traffic arriving from eth0 would have DST_NOPOLICY
    and would be cached and therefore can be reused by traffic originating
    from ipsec0, skipping policy check.
    
    Fix by setting a IPSKB_NOPOLICY flag in IPCB and observing it instead
    of the DST in IN/FWD IPv4 policy checks.

    i915/guc/reset: Make __guc_reset_context aware of guilty engines
    
    [ Upstream commit 89e96d822bd51f7afe2d3e95a34099480b5c3d55 ]
    
    There are 2 ways an engine can get reset in i915 and the method of reset
    affects how KMD labels a context as guilty/innocent.
    
    (1) GuC initiated engine-reset: GuC resets a hung engine and notifies
    KMD. The context that hung on the engine is marked guilty and all other
    contexts are innocent. The innocent contexts are resubmitted.
    
    (2) GT based reset: When an engine heartbeat fails to tick, KMD
    initiates a gt/chip reset. All active contexts are marked as guilty and
    discarded.
    
    In order to correctly mark the contexts as guilty/innocent, pass a mask
    of engines that were reset to __guc_reset_context.

    net: macb: Increment rx bd head after allocating skb and buffer
    
    [ Upstream commit 9500acc631dbb8b73166e25700e656b11f6007b6 ]
    
    In gem_rx_refill rx_prepared_head is incremented at the beginning of
    the while loop preparing the skb and data buffers. If the skb or data
    buffer allocation fails, this BD will be unusable BDs until the head
    loops back to the same BD (and obviously buffer allocation succeeds).
    In the unlikely event that there's a string of allocation failures,
    there will be an equal number of unusable BDs and an inconsistent RX
    BD chain. Hence increment the head at the end of the while loop to be
    clean.

    net: ipa: certain dropped packets aren't accounted for
    
    [ Upstream commit 30b338ff7998b6ed7a90815870cd5db725f87168 ]
    
    If an RX endpoint receives packets containing status headers, and a
    packet in the buffer is not dropped, ipa_endpoint_skb_copy() is
    responsible for wrapping the packet data in an SKB and forwarding it
    to ipa_modem_skb_rx() for further processing.
    
    If ipa_endpoint_skb_copy() gets a null pointer from build_skb(), it
    just returns early.  But in the process it doesn't record that as a
    dropped packet in the network device statistics.
    
    Instead, call ipa_modem_skb_rx() whether or not the SKB pointer is
    NULL; that function ensures the statistics are properly updated.

    dma-buf: ensure unique directory name for dmabuf stats
    
    commit 370704e707a5f2d3c9a1d4ed8bd8cd67507d7bb5 upstream.
    
    The dmabuf file uses get_next_ino()(through dma_buf_getfile() ->
    alloc_anon_inode()) to get an inode number and uses the same as a
    directory name under /sys/kernel/dmabuf/buffers/<ino>. This directory is
    used to collect the dmabuf stats and it is created through
    dma_buf_stats_setup(). At current, failure to create this directory
    entry can make the dma_buf_export() to fail.
    
    Now, as the get_next_ino() can definitely give a repetitive inode no
    causing the directory entry creation to fail with -EEXIST. This is a
    problem on the systems where dmabuf stats functionality is enabled on
    the production builds can make the dma_buf_export(), though the dmabuf
    memory is allocated successfully, to fail just because it couldn't
    create stats entry.
    
    This issue we are able to see on the snapdragon system within 13 days
    where there already exists a directory with inode no "122602" so
    dma_buf_stats_setup() failed with -EEXIST as it is trying to create
    the same directory entry.
    
    To make the dentry name as unique, use the dmabuf fs specific inode
    which is based on the simple atomic variable increment. There is tmpfs
    subsystem too which relies on its own inode generation rather than
    relying on the get_next_ino() for the same reason of avoiding the
    duplicate inodes[1].

    reset for handling aborted suspend can't work with s2idle.
    
    This functionality was introduced in commit daf8de0874ab5b ("drm/amdgpu:
    always reset the asic in suspend (v2)").  A few other commits have
    gone on top of the ASIC reset, but this still doesn't work on the A+A
    configuration in s2idle.
    
    Avoid doing the reset on dGPUs specifically when using s2idle.

    libceph: fix potential use-after-free on linger ping and resends
    
    commit 75dbb685f4e8786c33ddef8279bab0eadfb0731f upstream.
    
    request_reinit() is not only ugly as the comment rightfully suggests,
    but also unsafe.  Even though it is called with osdc->lock held for
    write in all cases, resetting the OSD request refcount can still race
    with handle_reply() and result in use-after-free.  Taking linger ping
    as an example:
    
        handle_timeout thread                     handle_reply thread
    
                                                  down_read(&osdc->lock)
                                                  req = lookup_request(...)
                                                  ...
                                                  finish_request(req)  # unregisters
                                                  up_read(&osdc->lock)
                                                  __complete_request(req)
                                                    linger_ping_cb(req)
    
          # req->r_kref == 2 because handle_reply still holds its ref
    
        down_write(&osdc->lock)
        send_linger_ping(lreq)
          req = lreq->ping_req  # same req
          # cancel_linger_request is NOT
          # called - handle_reply already
          # unregistered
          request_reinit(req)
            WARN_ON(req->r_kref != 1)  # fires
            request_init(req)
              kref_init(req->r_kref)
    
                       # req->r_kref == 1 after kref_init
    
                                                  ceph_osdc_put_request(req)
                                                    kref_put(req->r_kref)
    
                # req->r_kref == 0 after kref_put, req is freed
    
            <further req initialization/use> !!!
    
    This happens because send_linger_ping() always (re)uses the same OSD
    request for watch ping requests, relying on cancel_linger_request() to
    unregister it from the OSD client and rip its messages out from the
    messenger.  send_linger() does the same for watch/notify registration
    and watch reconnect requests.  Unfortunately cancel_request() doesn't
    guarantee that after it returns the OSD client would be completely done
    with the OSD request -- a ref could still be held and the callback (if
    specified) could still be invoked too.
    
    The original motivation for request_reinit() was inability to deal with
    allocation failures in send_linger() and send_linger_ping().  Switching
    to using osdc->req_mempool (currently only used by CephFS) respects that
    and allows us to get rid of request_reinit().

    mmc: core: Fix busy polling for MMC_SEND_OP_COND again
    
    commit e949dee3625e1b0ef2e40d9aa09c2995281b12f6 upstream.
    
    It turned out that polling period for MMC_SEND_OP_COND, that currently is
    set to 1ms, still isn't sufficient. In particular a Micron eMMC on a
    Beaglebone platform, is reported to sometimes fail to initialize.
    
    Additional test, shows that extending the period to 4ms is working fine, so
    let's make that change.

    crypto: qcom-rng - fix infinite loop on requests not multiple of WORD_SZ
    
    commit 16287397ec5c08aa58db6acf7dbc55470d78087d upstream.
    
    The commit referenced in the Fixes tag removed the 'break' from the else
    branch in qcom_rng_read(), causing an infinite loop whenever 'max' is
    not a multiple of WORD_SZ. This can be reproduced e.g. by running:
    
        kcapi-rng -b 67 >/dev/null
    
    There are many ways to fix this without adding back the 'break', but
    they all seem more awkward than simply adding it back, so do just that.
    
    Tested on a machine with Qualcomm Amberwing processor.

    As an optimisation, only pages mapped with PROT_MTE in user space have
    the MTE tags zeroed. This is done lazily at the set_pte_at() time via

    KVM: Free new dirty bitmap if creating a new memslot fails
    
    commit c87661f855c3f2023e40ddc364002601ee234367 upstream.
    
    Fix a goof in kvm_prepare_memory_region() where KVM fails to free the
    new memslot's dirty bitmap during a CREATE action if
    kvm_arch_prepare_memory_region() fails.  The logic is supposed to detect
    if the bitmap was allocated and thus needs to be freed, versus if the
    bitmap was inherited from the old memslot and thus needs to be kept.  If
    there is no old memslot, then obviously the bitmap can't have been
    inherited
    
    The bug was exposed by commit 86931ff7207b ("KVM: x86/mmu: Do not create
    SPTEs for GFNs that exceed host.MAXPHYADDR"), which made it trivally easy
    for syzkaller to trigger failure during kvm_arch_prepare_memory_region(),
    but the bug can be hit other ways too, e.g. due to -ENOMEM when
    allocating x86's memslot metadata.

    KVM: x86/mmu: Update number of zapped pages even if page list is stable
    
    commit b28cb0cd2c5e80a8c0feb408a0e4b0dbb6d132c5 upstream.
    
    When zapping obsolete pages, update the running count of zapped pages
    regardless of whether or not the list has become unstable due to zapping
    a shadow page with its own child shadow pages.  If the VM is backed by
    mostly 4kb pages, KVM can zap an absurd number of SPTEs without bumping
    the batch count and thus without yielding.  In the worst case scenario,
    this can cause a soft lokcup.

    KVM: arm64: vgic-v3: Consistently populate ID_AA64PFR0_EL1.GIC
    
    commit 5163373af195f10e0d99a8de3465c4ed36bdc337 upstream.
    
    When adding support for the slightly wonky Apple M1, we had to
    populate ID_AA64PFR0_EL1.GIC==1 to present something to the guest,
    as the HW itself doesn't advertise the feature.
    
    However, we gated this on the in-kernel irqchip being created.
    This causes some trouble for QEMU, which snapshots the state of
    the registers before creating a virtual GIC, and then tries to
    restore these registers once the GIC has been created.  Obviously,
    between the two stages, ID_AA64PFR0_EL1.GIC has changed value,
    and the write fails.
    
    The fix is to actually emulate the HW, and always populate the
    field if the HW is capable of it.

    Above commit does everything correctly according to the datasheet.
    However datasheet wasn't correct.
    
    I got confirmation from hardware engineers that the actual CAN
    hardware on Intel Elkhart Lake is based on M_CAN version v3.2.0.
    Datasheet was mirroring values from an another specification which was
    based on earlier M_CAN version leading to wrong bit timings.
    
    Therefore revert the commit and switch back to common bit timings.

    PCI/PM: Avoid putting Elo i2 PCIe Ports in D3cold
    
    commit 92597f97a40bf661bebceb92e26ff87c76d562d4 upstream.
    
    If a Root Port on Elo i2 is put into D3cold and then back into D0, the
    downstream device becomes permanently inaccessible, so add a bridge D3 DMI
    quirk for that system.
    
    This was exposed by 14858dcc3b35 ("PCI: Use pci_update_current_state() in
    pci_enable_device_flags()"), but before that commit the Root Port in
    question had never been put into D3cold for real due to a mismatch between
    its power state retrieved from the PCI_PM_CTRL register (which was
    accessible even though the platform firmware indicated that the port was in
    D3cold) and the state of an ACPI power resource involved in its power
    management.

    Fix double fget() in vhost_net_set_backend()
    
    commit fb4554c2232e44d595920f4d5c66cf8f7d13f9bc upstream.
    
    Descriptor table is a shared resource; two fget() on the same descriptor
    may return different struct file references.  get_tap_ptr_ring() is
    called after we'd found (and pinned) the socket we'll be using and it
    tries to find the private tun/tap data structures associated with it.
    Redoing the lookup by the same file descriptor we'd used to get the
    socket is racy - we need to same struct file.
    
    Thanks to Jason for spotting a braino in the original variant of patch -
    I'd missed the use of fd == -1 for disabling backend, and in that case
    we can end up with sock == NULL and sock != oldsock.

    audit,io_uring,io-wq: call __audit_uring_exit for dummy contexts
    
    commit 69e9cd66ae1392437234a63a3a1d60b6655f92ef upstream.
    
    Not calling the function for dummy contexts will cause the context to
    not be reset. During the next syscall, this will cause an error in
    __audit_syscall_entry:
    
            WARN_ON(context->context != AUDIT_CTX_UNUSED);
            WARN_ON(context->name_count);
            if (context->context != AUDIT_CTX_UNUSED || context->name_count) {
                    audit_panic("unrecoverable error in audit_syscall_entry()");
                    return;
            }
    
    These problematic dummy contexts are created via the following call
    chain:
    
           exit_to_user_mode_prepare
        -> arch_do_signal_or_restart
        -> get_signal

    perf: Fix sys_perf_event_open() race against self
    
    commit 3ac6487e584a1eb54071dbe1212e05b884136704 upstream.
    
    Norbert reported that it's possible to race sys_perf_event_open() such
    that the looser ends up in another context from the group leader,
    triggering many WARNs.
    
    The move_group case checks for races against itself, but the
    !move_group case doesn't, seemingly relying on the previous
    group_leader->ctx == ctx check. However, that check is racy due to not
    holding any locks at that time.
    
    Therefore, re-check the result after acquiring locks and bailing
    if they no longer match.
    
    Additionally, clarify the not_move_group case from the
    move_group-vs-move_group race.

    ALSA: wavefront: Proper check of get_user() error
    
    commit a34ae6c0660d3b96b0055f68ef74dc9478852245 upstream.
    
    The antient ISA wavefront driver reads its sample patch data (uploaded
    over an ioctl) via __get_user() with no good reason; likely just for
    some performance optimizations in the past.  Let's change this to the
    standard get_user() and the error check for handling the fault case
    properly.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Restore Rane SL-1 quirk
    
    commit 5c62383c06837b5719cd5447a5758b791279e653 upstream.
    
    At cleaning up and moving the device rename from the quirk table to
    its own table, we removed the entry for Rane SL-1 as we thought it's
    only for renaming.  It turned out, however, that the quirk is required
    for matching with the device that declares itself as no standard
    audio but only as vendor-specific.
    
    Restore the quirk entry for Rane SL-1 to fix the regression.

    nilfs2: fix lockdep warnings during disk space reclamation
    
    [ Upstream commit 6e211930f79aa45d422009a5f2e5467d2369ffe5 ]
    
    During disk space reclamation, nilfs2 still emits the following lockdep
    warning due to page/folio operations on shadowed page caches that nilfs2
    uses to get a snapshot of DAT file in memory:
    
      WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2643 at include/linux/backing-dev.h:272 __folio_mark_dirty+0x645/0x670

    This fixes the remaining warning by using inode objects to hold those
    page caches.

    nilfs2: fix lockdep warnings in page operations for btree nodes
    
    [ Upstream commit e897be17a441fa637cd166fc3de1445131e57692 ]
    
    Patch series "nilfs2 lockdep warning fixes".
    
    The first two are to resolve the lockdep warning issue, and the last one
    is the accompanying cleanup and low priority.
    
    Based on your comment, this series solves the issue by separating inode
    object as needed.  Since I was worried about the impact of the object
    composition changes, I tested the series carefully not to cause
    regressions especially for delicate functions such like disk space
    reclamation and snapshots.
    
    This patch (of 3):
    
    If CONFIG_LOCKDEP is enabled, nilfs2 hits lockdep warnings at
    inode_to_wb() during page/folio operations for btree nodes:

    This is because nilfs2 uses two page caches for each inode and
    inode->i_mapping never points to one of them, the btree node cache.
    
    This causes inode_to_wb(inode) to refer to a different page cache than
    the caller page/folio operations such like __folio_start_writeback(),
    __folio_end_writeback(), or __folio_mark_dirty() acquired the lock.
    
    This patch resolves the issue by allocating and using an additional
    inode to hold the page cache of btree nodes.  The inode is attached
    one-to-one to the traditional nilfs2 inode if it requires a block
    mapping with b-tree.  This setup change is in memory only and does not
    affect the disk format.

    platform/chrome: cros_ec_debugfs: detach log reader wq from devm
    
    [ Upstream commit 0e8eb5e8acbad19ac2e1856b2fb2320184299b33 ]
    
    Debugfs console_log uses devm memory (e.g. debug_info in
    cros_ec_console_log_poll()).  However, lifecycles of device and debugfs
    are independent.  An use-after-free issue is observed if userland
    program operates the debugfs after the memory has been freed.
    
    The call trace:
     do_raw_spin_lock
     _raw_spin_lock_irqsave
     remove_wait_queue
     ep_unregister_pollwait
     ep_remove
     do_epoll_ctl
    
    A Python example to reproduce the issue:
    ... import select
    ... p = select.epoll()
    ... f = open('/sys/kernel/debug/cros_scp/console_log')
    ... p.register(f, select.POLLIN)
    ... p.poll(1)
    [(4, 1)]                    # 4=fd, 1=select.POLLIN
    
    [ shutdown cros_scp at the point ]
    
    ... p.poll(1)
    [(4, 16)]                   # 4=fd, 16=select.POLLHUP
    ... p.unregister(f)
    
    An use-after-free issue raises here.  It called epoll_ctl with
    EPOLL_CTL_DEL which in turn to use the workqueue in the devm (i.e.
    log_wq).
    
    Detaches log reader's workqueue from devm to make sure it is persistent
    even if the device has been removed.

    drbd: remove usage of list iterator variable after loop
    
    [ Upstream commit 901aeda62efa21f2eae937bccb71b49ae531be06 ]
    
    In preparation to limit the scope of a list iterator to the list
    traversal loop, use a dedicated pointer to iterate through the list [1].
    
    Since that variable should not be used past the loop iteration, a
    separate variable is used to 'remember the current location within the
    loop'.
    
    To either continue iterating from that position or skip the iteration
    (if the previous iteration was complete) list_prepare_entry() is used.

    kzalloc() is a memory allocation function which can return NULL when
    some internal memory errors happen. So it is better to check the
    return value of it to prevent potential wrong memory access or

    when get fiemap starting from MAX_LFS_FILESIZE, (maxbytes - *len) < start
    will always true , then *len set zero. because of start offset is beyond
    file size, for erofs filesystem it will always return iomap.length with
    zero,iomap iterate will enter infinite loop. it is necessary cover this
    corner case to avoid this situation.

    rtc: mc146818-lib: Fix the AltCentury for AMD platforms
    
    [ Upstream commit 3ae8fd41573af4fb3a490c9ed947fc936ba87190 ]
    
    Setting the century forward has been failing on AMD platforms.
    There was a previous attempt at fixing this for family 0x17 as part of
    commit 7ad295d5196a ("rtc: Fix the AltCentury value on AMD/Hygon
    platform") but this was later reverted due to some problems reported
    that appeared to stem from an FW bug on a family 0x17 desktop system.
    
    The same comments mentioned in the previous commit continue to apply
    to the newer platforms as well.
    
    ```
    MC146818 driver use function mc146818_set_time() to set register
    RTC_FREQ_SELECT(RTC_REG_A)'s bit4-bit6 field which means divider stage
    reset value on Intel platform to 0x7.
    
    While AMD/Hygon RTC_REG_A(0Ah)'s bit4 is defined as DV0 [Reference]:
    DV0 = 0 selects Bank 0, DV0 = 1 selects Bank 1. Bit5-bit6 is defined
    as reserved.
    
    DV0 is set to 1, it will select Bank 1, which will disable AltCentury
    register(0x32) access. As UEFI pass acpi_gbl_FADT.century 0x32
    (AltCentury), the CMOS write will be failed on code:
    CMOS_WRITE(century, acpi_gbl_FADT.century).
    
    Correct RTC_REG_A bank select bit(DV0) to 0 on AMD/Hygon CPUs, it will
    enable AltCentury(0x32) register writing and finally setup century as
    expected.
    ```
    
    However in closer examination the change previously submitted was also
    modifying bits 5 & 6 which are declared reserved in the AMD documentation.
    So instead modify just the DV0 bank selection bit.
    
    Being cognizant that there was a failure reported before, split the code
    change out to a static function that can also be used for exclusions if
    any regressions such as Mikhail's pop up again.

    nvme-multipath: fix hang when disk goes live over reconnect
    
    [ Upstream commit a4a6f3c8f61c3cfbda4998ad94596059ad7e4332 ]
    
    nvme_mpath_init_identify() invoked from nvme_init_identify() fetches a
    fresh ANA log from the ctrl.  This is essential to have an up to date
    path states for both existing namespaces and for those scan_work may
    discover once the ctrl is up.
    
    This happens in the following cases:
      1) A new ctrl is being connected.
      2) An existing ctrl is successfully reconnected.
      3) An existing ctrl is being reset.
    
    While in (1) ctrl->namespaces is empty, (2 & 3) may have namespaces, and
    nvme_read_ana_log() may call nvme_update_ns_ana_state().
    
    This result in a hang when the ANA state of an existing namespace changes
    and makes the disk live: nvme_mpath_set_live() issues IO to the namespace
    through the ctrl, which does NOT have IO queues yet.
    
    See sample hang below.
    
    Solution:
    - nvme_update_ns_ana_state() to call set_live only if ctrl is live
    - nvme_read_ana_log() call from nvme_mpath_init_identify()
      therefore only fetches and parses the ANA log;
      any erros in this process will fail the ctrl setup as appropriate;
    - a separate function nvme_mpath_update()
      is called in nvme_start_ctrl();
      this parses the ANA log without fetching it.
      At this point the ctrl is live,
      therefore, disks can be set live normally.
    
    Sample failure:
        nvme nvme0: starting error recovery
        nvme nvme0: Reconnecting in 10 seconds...
        block nvme0n6: no usable path - requeuing I/O

    nvmet: use a private workqueue instead of the system workqueue
    
    [ Upstream commit 8832cf922151e9dfa2821736beb0ae2dd3968b6e ]
    
    Any attempt to flush kernel-global WQs has possibility of deadlock
    so we should simply stop using them, instead introduce nvmet_wq
    which is the generic nvmet workqueue for work elements that
    don't explicitly require a dedicated workqueue (by the mere fact
    that they are using the system_wq).
    
    Changes were done using the following replaces:
    
     - s/schedule_work(/queue_work(nvmet_wq, /g
     - s/schedule_delayed_work(/queue_delayed_work(nvmet_wq, /g

    smb3: cleanup and clarify status of tree connections
    
    [ Upstream commit fdf59eb548e51bce81382c39f1a5fd4cb9403b78 ]
    
    Currently the way the tid (tree connection) status is tracked
    is confusing.  The same enum is used for structs cifs_tcon
    and cifs_ses and TCP_Server_info, but each of these three has
    different states that they transition among.  The current
    code also unnecessarily uses camelCase.
    
    Convert from use of statusEnum to a new tid_status_enum for
    tree connections.  The valid states for a tid are:
    
            TID_NEW = 0,
            TID_GOOD,
            TID_EXITING,
            TID_NEED_RECON,
            TID_NEED_TCON,
            TID_IN_TCON,
            TID_NEED_FILES_INVALIDATE, /* unused, considering removing in future */
            TID_IN_FILES_INVALIDATE
    
    It also removes CifsNeedTcon, CifsInTcon, CifsNeedFilesInvalidate and
    CifsInFilesInvalidate from the statusEnum used for session and
    TCP_Server_Info since they are not relevant for those.
    
    A follow on patch will fix the places where we use the
    tcon->need_reconnect flag to be more consistent with the tid->status.

    s390/pci: improve zpci_dev reference counting
    
    [ Upstream commit c122383d221dfa2f41cfe5e672540595de986fde ]
    
    Currently zpci_dev uses kref based reference counting but only accounts
    for one original reference plus one reference from an added pci_dev to
    its underlying zpci_dev. Counting just the original reference worked
    until the pci_dev reference was added in commit 2a671f77ee49 ("s390/pci:
    fix use after free of zpci_dev") because once a zpci_dev goes away, i.e.
    enters the reserved state, it would immediately get released. However
    with the pci_dev reference this is no longer the case and the zpci_dev
    may still appear in multiple availability events indicating that it was
    reserved. This was solved by detecting when the zpci_dev is already on
    its way out but still hanging around. This has however shown some light
    on how unusual our zpci_dev reference counting is.
    
    Improve upon this by modelling zpci_dev reference counting on pci_dev.
    Analogous to pci_get_slot() increment the reference count in
    get_zdev_by_fid(). Thus all users of get_zdev_by_fid() must drop the
    reference once they are done with the zpci_dev.
    
    Similar to pci_scan_single_device(), zpci_create_device() returns the
    device with an initial count of 1 and the device added to the zpci_list
    (analogous to the PCI bus' device_list). In turn users of
    zpci_create_device() must only drop the reference once the device is
    gone from the point of view of the zPCI subsystem, it might still be
    referenced by the common PCI subsystem though.

    anything useful on 32-bit systems.
    
    Use the proper time64_t type when dealing with timestamps, and avoid
    cutting down the time range unnecessarily. This also fixes the flawed
    check for the alarm time being too far into the future.
    
    The check for this condition is actually somewhat theoretical, as the
    RTC counts till 2033 only anyways, and 2^32 seconds from now is not
    before the year 2157 - at which point I hope nobody will be using this
    hardware anymore.

    gfs2: Disable page faults during lockless buffered reads
    
    [ Upstream commit 52f3f033a5dbd023307520af1ff551cadfd7f037 ]
    
    During lockless buffered reads, filemap_read() holds page cache page
    references while trying to copy data to the user-space buffer.  The
    calling process isn't holding the inode glock, but the page references
    it holds prevent those pages from being removed from the page cache, and
    that prevents the underlying inode glock from being moved to another
    node.  Thus, we can end up in the same kinds of distributed deadlock
    situations as with normal (non-lockless) buffered reads.
    
    Fix that by disabling page faults during lockless reads as well.

    um: Cleanup syscall_handler_t definition/cast, fix warning
    
    [ Upstream commit f4f03f299a56ce4d73c5431e0327b3b6cb55ebb9 ]
    
    The syscall_handler_t type for x86_64 was defined as 'long (*)(void)',
    but always cast to 'long (*)(long, long, long, long, long, long)' before
    use. This now triggers a warning (see below).
    
    Define syscall_handler_t as the latter instead, and remove the cast.
    This simplifies the code, and fixes the warning.

    [ Upstream commit 73ce05302007eece23a6acb7dc124c92a2209087 ]
    
    The first bug is that reading the 5 alarm registers results in a read
    operation of 20 bytes. The reason is because the destination buffer is
    defined as an array of "unsigned int", and we use the sizeof()
    operator on this array to define the bulk read count.
    
    The second bug is that the read value is invalid, because we are
    indexing the destination buffer as integers (4 bytes), instead of
    indexing it as u8.
    
    Changing the destination buffer type to u8 fixes both problems.

    The driver currently uses a CPU family match of 17h to determine

    revision ID 0x51 or greater. The MMIO access method has been available
    since at least SMBus controllers using PCI revision 0x51. This revision
    check will support family 17h and future AMD processors including EFCH
    functionality without requiring driver changes.

    i2c: piix4: Add EFCH MMIO support for SMBus port select
    
    commit 381a3083c6747ae5cdbef9b176d57d1b966db49f upstream.
    
    AMD processors include registers capable of selecting between 2 SMBus
    ports. Port selection is made during each user access by writing to
    FCH::PM::DECODEEN[smbus0sel]. Change the driver to use MMIO during
    SMBus port selection because cd6h/cd7h port I/O is not available on
    later AMD processors.

    i2c: piix4: Add EFCH MMIO support to SMBus base address detect
    
    commit 46967bc1ee93acd1d8953c87dc16f43de4076f93 upstream.
    
    The EFCH SMBus controller's base address is determined using details in
    FCH::PM::DECODEEN[smbusasfiobase] and FCH::PM::DECODEEN[smbusasfioen].These
    register fields were accessed using cd6h/cd7h port I/O. cd6h/cd7h port I/O
    is no longer available in later AMD processors. Change base address
    detection to use MMIO instead of port I/O cd6h/cd7h.

    i2c: piix4: Add EFCH MMIO support to region request and release
    
    commit 7c148722d074c29fb998578eea5de3c14b9608c9 upstream.
    
    EFCH cd6h/cd7h port I/O may no longer be available on later AMD
    processors and it is recommended to use MMIO instead. Update the
    request and release functions to support MMIO.
    
    MMIO request/release and mmapping require details during cleanup.
    Add a MMIO configuration structure containing resource and vaddress
    details for mapping the region, accessing the region, and releasing
    the region.

    kernel/resource: Introduce request_mem_region_muxed()
    
    commit 27c196c7b73cb70bbed3a9df46563bab60e63415 upstream.
    
    Support for requesting muxed memory region is implemented but not
    currently callable as a macro. Add the request muxed memory
    region macro.
    
    MMIO memory accesses can be synchronized using request_mem_region() which
    is already available. This call will return failure if the resource is
    busy. The 'muxed' version of this macro will handle a busy resource by
    using a wait queue to retry until the resource is available.

    floppy: use a statically allocated error counter
    
    commit f71f01394f742fc4558b3f9f4c7ef4c4cf3b07c8 upstream.
    
    Interrupt handler bad_flp_intr() may cause a UAF on the recently freed
    request just to increment the error count.  There's no point keeping
    that one in the request anyway, and since the interrupt handler uses a
    static pointer to the error which cannot be kept in sync with the
    pending request, better make it use a static error counter that's reset
    for each new request.  This reset now happens when entering
    redo_fd_request() for a new request via set_next_request().
    
    One initial concern about a single error counter was that errors on one
    floppy drive could be reported on another one, but this problem is not
    real given that the driver uses a single drive at a time, as that
    PC-compatible controllers also have this limitation by using shared
    signals.  As such the error count is always for the "current" drive.

    usb: gadget: fix race when gadget driver register via ioctl
    
    commit 5f0b5f4d50fa0faa8c76ef9d42a42e8d43f98b44 upstream.
    
    The usb_gadget_register_driver can be called multi time by to
    threads via USB_RAW_IOCTL_RUN ioctl syscall, which will lead
    to multiple registrations.
    
    Call trace:
      driver_register+0x220/0x3a0 drivers/base/driver.c:171
      usb_gadget_register_driver_owner+0xfb/0x1e0

      ioctl USB_RAW_IOCTL_RUN
    
    This routine allows two processes to register the same driver instance
    via ioctl syscall. which lead to a race condition.
    
    Please refer to the following scenarios.

    There will be UAF in this scenario.
    
    We can fix it by adding a new STATE_DEV_REGISTERING device state to
    avoid double register.
