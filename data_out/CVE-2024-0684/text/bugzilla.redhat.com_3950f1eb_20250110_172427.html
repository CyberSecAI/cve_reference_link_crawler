| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2258948#c0)  Rohit Keshri    2024-01-18 07:15:46 UTC  ``` Since coreutils 9.2 <https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/commit/40bf1591b> introduced a heap overflow issue, which can be triggered like:      { printf '%131070s\n' ''; printf 'x\n'; printf '%131071s\n' ''; } > in     split -C 131072 ---io=131072 in  That will dump core, but as with all heap overflows is a potential security issue. I'll leave it up to you to determine whether a CVE is required.  There is already a patch upstream, but it's not flagged as a security issue, in an abundance of caution, in case this issue in more security sensitive than first envisaged. The upstream patch is: <https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/commit/c4c5ed8f4.patch>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2258948#c1)  Rohit Keshri    2024-01-18 07:20:12 UTC  ``` [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2258913](show_bug.cgi?id=2258913 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2024-0684 coreutils: heap overflow in split --line-bytes with very long lines [fedora-all]")   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2258948#c3)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2024-01-18 13:59:39 UTC  ``` Created coreutils tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2258913](show_bug.cgi?id=2258913 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2024-0684 coreutils: heap overflow in split --line-bytes with very long lines [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |
