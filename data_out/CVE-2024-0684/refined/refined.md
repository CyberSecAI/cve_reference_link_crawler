Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-0684:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `split` program within GNU coreutils versions 9.2, 9.3, and 9.4.
- The vulnerability was introduced by commit `40bf1591b` in coreutils 9.2.
- Specifically, the issue lies in the `line_bytes_split()` function, where the `hold` buffer can overflow due to an incorrect size calculation when handling very long lines.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow. This occurs when the program writes data beyond the allocated size of a heap buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions.
- **User-Controlled Data:** The overflow can be triggered using user-controlled data, meaning an attacker can manipulate input to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Incorrect Size Calculation:** The vulnerability stems from a faulty calculation when reallocating memory for the 'hold' buffer inside the `line_bytes_split()` function. The calculation fails to account for the correct amount of space needed for long input lines when the `-C` or `--line-bytes` option is used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a crash of the `split` program, resulting in a denial of service. This can disrupt the normal operation of the system.
- **Potential Security Issue:** The heap overflow, as with all heap overflows, is a potential security issue that could lead to more severe impacts, though the provided information only explicitly mentions DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Command-Line Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafted command-line arguments to the `split` utility, specifically when used with the `-C` or `--line-bytes` option.
- **Long Input Lines:** The attacker crafts a file with very long lines to cause the buffer overflow when processed by the `split` command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to execute the `split` command with the crafted input. The NetApp advisory specifies that successful exploitation requires a low privilege user.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `split` command is used with the `-C` option and a specific length, along with a crafted input file that contains very long lines.
- Example: `split -C 131072 --io=131072 in`
- A proof-of-concept exploit file is available: `https://github.com/Valentin-Metz/writeup_split/blob/main/split_me`.
- The vulnerability was fixed in coreutils with commit `c4c5ed8f4e9cd55a12966d4f520e3a13101637d9`.
- NetApp has identified specific products affected by this vulnerability, primarily the NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H610C and H610S
- NetApp will not address the vulnerability in these two identified products as they are end-of-life.
