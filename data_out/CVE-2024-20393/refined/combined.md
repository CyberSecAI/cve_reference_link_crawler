For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has not released and will not release software updates that address these vulnerabilities because the affected products are past their respective dates for End of Software Maintenance Releases. The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) will continue to evaluate and disclose security vulnerabilities that affect these products until they reach their respective Last Dates of Support.  There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv34x-privesc-rce-qE33TCms>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect the following Cisco RV Series Small Business Routers:    + RV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers   + RV340W Dual WAN Gigabit Wireless-AC VPN Routers   + RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers   + RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit PoE VPN Routers **Determine the Device Configuration**  The web-based management interface of these devices is available through a local LAN connection, which cannot be disabled, or through the WAN connection if the remote management feature is enabled. By default, the remote management feature is disabled on these devices.  To determine whether the remote management feature is enabled on a device, open the web-based management interface and choose **Basic Settings > Remote Management**. If the **Enable** check box is checked, remote management is enabled on the device. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the following Cisco RV Series Small Business Routers:    + RV160 VPN Routers   + RV160W Wireless-AC VPN Routers   + RV260 VPN Routers   + RV260P VPN Routers with PoE   + RV260W Wireless-AC VPN Routers  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2024-20393: Cisco RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers Privilege Escalation Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges on an affected device.  This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface discloses sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to elevate privileges from *guest* to *admin.*  There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwm27935](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwm27935)CVE ID:CVE-2024-20393Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 8.8CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  **CVE-2024-20470: Cisco RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers Remote Code Execution Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid *admin* credentials.  This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not sufficiently validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the *root* user on the underlying operating system.  There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwk99655](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk99655)CVE ID:CVE-2024-20470Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 4.7CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco Small Business RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers are past their respective dates for End of Software Maintenance Releases. For this reason, Cisco has not released and will not release software updates to address the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory. Customers are advised to refer to the end-of-life notices for these products:  [End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco Small Business RV340 and RV345 Series](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/small-business-rv-series-routers/small-business-rv340-rv345-series-eol.html)  [End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco RV 160, RV260, RV345P, RV340W, RV260W, RV260P and RV160W VPN Router](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/small-business-rv-series-routers/eos-eol-notice-c51-2655972.html)  When considering a device migration, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the new products will be sufficient for their network needs, that the new devices contain sufficient memory, and that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new product. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
