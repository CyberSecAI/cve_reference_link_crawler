- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web-based management interface of the affected Cisco Small Business RV Series routers discloses sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Insufficient input validation in the web-based management interface allows for privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated remote attacker can elevate privileges from *guest* to *admin* by sending crafted HTTP input.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted HTTP input to the vulnerable web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a guest user on the web-based management interface and have network access to the device, either locally or remotely if remote management is enabled.
