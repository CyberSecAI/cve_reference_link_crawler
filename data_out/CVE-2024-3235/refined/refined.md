**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization check within the `on_front_ajax_action()` function of the Essential Grid Gallery WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to properly verify user permissions before allowing access to potentially sensitive content. This lack of authorization allows unauthenticated users to trigger the vulnerable function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** An unauthenticated attacker can view private and password-protected posts, potentially exposing sensitive information that was intended to be restricted.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Unauthenticated access**: The attacker does not need to have any credentials to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress instance and the ability to send HTTP requests. No special user privileges or position within the network are required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Essential Grid Gallery WordPress Plugin up to and including 3.1.1.
- The vulnerability has been patched in version 3.1.2.
