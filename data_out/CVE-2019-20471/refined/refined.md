    "information": "The provided text contains information about CVE-2019-20471.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the fact that the TK-Star Q90 Junior GPS watch does not require a PIN to be configured on the SIM card used in the device. If a PIN is set, the device displays an error message and is unusable.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nThe device's design forces users to disable the common security feature of SIM card PIN protection.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nExploitation of this vulnerability makes it easier for an attacker to use the SIM card by stealing the device, potentially leading to unauthorized calls, messages, and data access.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe attack vector is physical; an attacker needs to steal the device to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nAn attacker needs physical access to the TK-Star Q90 Junior GPS watch. No special technical knowledge is required beyond knowing that the device requires the SIM card PIN to be disabled."
