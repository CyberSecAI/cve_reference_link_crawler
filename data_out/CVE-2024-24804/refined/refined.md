- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The MW WP Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can allow a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into your website. These scripts are then executed when other users or guests visit the affected pages.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through user-supplied input within the WordPress plugin's forms or functionalities.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would require the capability to insert malicious script into a field of the vulnerable plugin and an editor role to access the affected function.
