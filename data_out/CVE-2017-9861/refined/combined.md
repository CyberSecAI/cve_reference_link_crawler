#### CVE-2017-9852

[Suggested description]

An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products.

Default passwords exist which are rarely changed. User passwords will

almost always be 0000. Installer passwords are expected to be default

or similar across installations installed by the same company. Hidden

user accounts have (at least in some cases, though more research is

required to test this for all hidden user accounts) a fixed password

for all SMA devices. This allows passwords to be easily guessed or

predicted, compromising the affected device and its functions.

Default passwords for user and installer are reused across inverters.

Installer passwords are sometimes changed, but are expected (based on

field tests) to be the same across installations installed by the

installer company. This enables an attacker to simply guess passwords

that are used a lot. It also ensures that if one system is

compromised, multiple systems are compromised.

Default passwords for user and installer are reused across inverters.

Installers passwords are sometimes changed, but are expected to be the

same across installations installed by the installer company. Every

Grid Guard code however, can be used on every SMA inverter. There are

also hidden user accounts of which the password can never be changed

by the user. An attacker with access to such a password, can use this

password on any SMA inverter with success. Other vulnerabilities exist

that allow an attacker to get the passwords of these hidden user

accounts. This ensures that if one system can be compromised, all

systems can be compromised.

[Additional Information]

One of the CVE’s that could potentially be used in the horus scenario.

#### CVE-2017-9853

[Suggested description]

An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products.

All SMA inverters have a very weak password policy regarding the user

and installer password. Many characters cannot be used; no complexity

requirements or length requirements are set. Specifically, complex

passwords are even impossible due to a maximum of 12 characters and a

limited set of characters. Other “hidden” user accounts have a

password which is impossible to change for regular users.

#### CVE-2017-9857

[Suggested description]

An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products.

The SMAdata2+ communication protocol is vulnerable to man in the

middle, packet injection, and replay attacks. Any setting change,

authentication packet, scouting packet etc. can be replayed, injected,

or used for a man in the middle session. All functionalities available

in Sunny Explorer can effectively be done from anywhere within the

network as long as an attacker gets the packet setup correctly. This

includes the authentication process for all (including hidden) access

levels and the changing of settings in accordance with the gained

access rights.

The SMAdata2+ communication channel is unencrypted. An attacker

capable of understanding the protocol can eavesdrop on these

communications. Sensitive data should not be transmitted using this

protocol. Any sensitive data transmitted over this channel can be

retrieved by a malicious hacker by packet sniffing. For example,

passwords can be extracted from the network communications this way.

These passwords can then be used to compromise the overall device.

[Additional Information]

This CVE can be used as part of the horus scenario.

#### CVE-2017-9859

[Suggested description]

An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products.

The inverters make use of a weak hashing algorithm to encrypt the password for REGISTER requests. This hashing algorithm can be cracked relatively

easily. An attacker will likely be able to crack the password using

offline crackers. This cracked password can then be used to register

at the SMA servers.

[Additional Information]

This CVE can be used as part of the horus scenario.

#### CVE-2017-9860

[Suggested description]

An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products.

An attacker can use Sunny Explorer or the SMAdata2+ network protocol

to update the device firmware without ever having to authenticate. If

an attacker is able to create a custom firmware version which is

accepted by the inverter, the inverter is compromised completely. This

allows the attacker to do nearly anything: for example, giving access

to the local OS, creating a botnet, using the SMA inverters as a

stepping stone into companies etc. The device can be completely

compromised this way.

[Additional Information]

This CVE can be used as part of the horus scenario.

#### CVE-2017-9861

[Suggested description]

An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products.

The used SIP implementation is vulnerable to replay attacks, packet

injection attacks and man in the middle attacks. An attacker is able

to successfully use SIP to communicate with the device from anywhere

within the LAN. An attacker may use this to crash the device, stop it

from communicating with the SMA servers, exploit known SIP

vulnerabilities, or find sensitive information from the SIP

communications.

The SIP communication channel is unencrypted. An attacker capable of

understanding the protocol can eavesdrop on these communications.

Sensitive data should not be transmitted using this protocol. All

communications should be considered readable for attackers. Sensitive

data transmitted over this channel can be retrieved by a malicious

hacker. For example, passwords can be extracted from the network

communications this way.

[Additional Information]

This CVE can be used as part of the horus scenario.

CVSS vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H

[VulnerabilityType Other]

Several flaws in network communications

[Vendor of Product]

[Affected Component]

SIP communications of all SMA inverters. (webconnect functionality)

[Attack Type]

Remote

[Impact Denial of Service]

true

[Impact Information Disclosure]

true

[CVE Impact Other]

Known SIP vulnerabilities can be attempted.

[Attack Vectors]

The SIP communications of these devices are vulnerable to replay

attacks, packet injection attacks and man in the middle attacks. An

attacker simply needs to send correct packets to the device. if the

device is directly attached to the internet or uses NAT this is

possible over the internet.

#### CVE-2017-9862

[Suggested description]

An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products.

When signed in to the Sunny Explorer with a wrong password, it is

possible to create a debug report, disclosing information regarding

the application and allowing the attacker to create and save a .txt

file with contents to his liking. An attacker may use this for

information disclosure, or to write a file to normally unavailable

locations on the local system where the Sunny Explorer is allowed.

[Additional Information]

This CVE can be used as part of the horus scenario.

CVSS vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N

#### CVE-2017-9863

[Suggested description]

An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products.

If a user simultaneously has Sunny Explorer running and visits a

malicious host, cross-site request forgery can be used to change

settings in the inverters. For example, issuing a post request to

change the user password, etc. All Sunny Explorer settings available to

the authenticated user are also available to the attacker. (In some

cases, this also includes changing settings that the user has no

access to.) This may result in complete compromise of the device.

[Additional Information]

This CVE can be used as part of the horus scenario.

CVSS vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

#### CVE-2017-9864

[Suggested description]

An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products.

An attacker can change the plant time even when he is not

authenticated in any way. This changes the system time, possibly

affecting lockout policies, random generators based on time stamps, and

makes timestamp for data analysis unreliable.

[Additional Information]

This CVE can be used as part of the horus scenario.

CVSS vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

[Vulnerability Type]

Incorrect Access Control

[Vendor of Product]

SMA Solar Technology

[Affected Product Code Base]

All SMA inverters – All

[Affected Component]

Sunny Explorer application

[Attack Type]

Remote

[CVE Impact Other]

Change System time without authentication (makes data coming in from the device to registration programs unreliable)

[Attack Vectors]

To exploit the vulnerability simply start the Sunny Explorer and

attempt to authenticate with a false password. the application will

still start but state that you have no access rights to the devices.

You can however select the change plant time functionality. This

changes the system time of the inverters, possibly affecting lockout

policies, random generators based on time stamps and makes timestamp

for data analysis unreliable. (for example the graphs generated based

on PV power submitted per hour can be messed with this way.)
