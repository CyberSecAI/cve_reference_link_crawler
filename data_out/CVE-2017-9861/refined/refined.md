{
  "vulnerability_information": {
    "CVE-2017-9861": {
      "root_cause": "The SIP implementation used by SMA inverters is vulnerable to replay attacks, packet injection attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The SIP communication channel is unencrypted, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping.",
        "Lack of proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for SIP communications.",
        "Vulnerabilities inherent to the SIP protocol are exploitable."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can potentially crash the device, stop it from communicating with SMA servers, exploit known SIP vulnerabilities, and find sensitive information from the SIP communications.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attacker sends crafted packets to the device. If the device is directly attached to the internet or uses NAT, this can be done over the internet.",
      "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs network access to the SMA inverter.",
    }
  }
