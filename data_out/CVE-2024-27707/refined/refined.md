Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by the Huly platform processing SVG files uploaded by users without proper sanitization. Specifically, the platform renders the SVG, including any embedded links or scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application server makes an HTTP request to an attacker-controlled server when it renders a malicious SVG file. This is because of the `xlink:href` attribute in the `<image>` tag.
- **Lack of SVG Sanitization:** The platform does not sanitize or block potentially malicious elements within uploaded SVG files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause the Huly platform server to make requests to arbitrary external servers.
- This can be used to scan internal networks, exfiltrate internal data if the platform has access to it, or potentially perform other attacks if the requested servers are vulnerable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted SVG file to the Huly platform via the file attachment feature when creating or editing an issue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create and edit issues and also attach files to them within the Huly platform.
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious SVG file that includes an `xlink:href` to a server controlled by the attacker.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit uses the `<image>` tag in SVG, combined with the `xlink:href` attribute to make the server fetch the resource.
- The provided PoC SVG code snippet demonstrates this with the following attributes set on the image tag: `xlink:href="https://link_to_server.com" height="200" width="200" onload="document.getElementById('foo').setAttribute('fill', 'blue');"`.
- The attacker would replace the `https://link_to_server.com` placeholder with a server that they control.
- The SVG also has `onload` attribute, which is not relevant for the attack, but might be helpful in other scenarios to perform JavaScript injections.
