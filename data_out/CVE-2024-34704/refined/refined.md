- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect assumption in the `DAGCombine` phase of the zksolc compiler during instruction selection for XOR operations. The compiler incorrectly assumed -1 represents the true value when it should be 1, leading to an incorrect optimization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a misoptimization during the transformation of the expression `!(x cc y)` to `(x !cc y)` where `cc` is a comparison condition. The second operand of XOR should be a constant representing the true value which is 1 and not -1.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The misoptimization can cause the compiler to generate incorrect assembly code, leading to unexpected program behavior where boolean operations are not performed correctly. In the specific case of `xor(zext(cmp), -1)`, the output could be either `1` or `0` when it should have consistently been the result of XORing with -1. This may result in a wrong value which is not consistent with the Solidity source code.
- **Attack vectors**: This is a compiler bug, so the attack vector is through compiled code. Contracts compiled with affected versions of the compiler may exhibit the unexpected behavior. The vulnerability is triggered during the compilation process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to exploit this vulnerability indirectly by deploying contracts compiled with the vulnerable compiler or using the affected contracts and hoping the miscompilation will affect the behavior. The attacker does not interact directly with the compiler during the vulnerability exploitation but it relies on the compiler miscompiling and therefore is a supply chain issue.
