# `xor(zext(cmp), -1)` misoptimization

Moderate

[hedgar2017](/hedgar2017)
published
GHSA-22pj-7cvw-r3gc
May 13, 2024

## Package

zksolc
(Solidity)

## Affected versions

1.2.0 - 1.4.0

## Patched versions

1.4.1

## Description

### Impact

The problem occurred during instruction selection in the `DAGCombine` phase while visiting the XOR operation. The issue arises when attempting to fold the expression `!(x cc y)` into `(x !cc y)`. To perform this transformation, the second operand of XOR should be a constant representing the true value. However, it was incorrectly assumed that -1 represents the true value, when in fact, 1 is the correct representation, so this transformation for this case should be skipped.

Before doing wrong optimization, Selection DAG nodes look like this:

```
t16: i256 = setcc t2, Constant:i256<0>, seteq:ch
t10: i256 = xor t16, Constant:i256<-1>
```

After performing wrong optimization in the `DAGCombine`, it is folded into:

```
t18: i256 = setcc t2, Constant:i256<0>, setne:ch
```

As the result, we are generating following assembly and the output can be `1` or `0`:

```
	sub!	r1, r0, r1
	add	0, r0, r1
	add.ne	1, r0, r1
```

Instead of where the output can be `1 ^ -1` or `0 ^ -1`:

```
	sub!	r1, r0, r1
	add	0, r0, r1
	add.eq	1, r0, r1
	sub.s	1, r0, r2
	xor	r1, r2, r1
```

To fix this issue, we needed to set that EraVM represents true and false values with 1 and 0, instead of using default LLVM behaviour where only bit 0 counts, the rest can hold garbage.

Since we deal with a backend optimization bug, it’s hard to lift it to the language semantic and describe precisely which pieces of vyper, solidity and yul are affected. To determine if a contract is affected by this bug, you will need to generate an optimized LLVM IR file and look for the following pattern:

```
%cmp = icmp cond i256 %a, %b <- Where cond can be eq, ne, etc.
%zext = zext i1 %cmp to i256
%not = xor i256 %zext, -1
```

If this pattern is found `xor(zext(cmp))`, it is likely that the bug exists in the contract.

Analysis has shown that no contracts were affected by the date of publishing this advisory.

### Patches

Fixed in version 1.4.1.

### Workarounds

Upgrading and redeploying affected contracts is the only way.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-34704

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
