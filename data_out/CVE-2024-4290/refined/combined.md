## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Sailthru Triggermail <= 1.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=sailthru&action=options
2. Enter the payload `"><script>alert(2)</script>` for any of the inputs
3. Save and see the XSS
