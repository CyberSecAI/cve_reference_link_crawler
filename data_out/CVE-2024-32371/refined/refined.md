- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient access control checks on the `type` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application fails to properly validate and authorize changes to the `type` parameter, allowing an attacker to manipulate this parameter to elevate their privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate privileges from a regular user to an administrator, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data, system configurations, and privileged functionalities. This can lead to further compromise or data breaches.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by intercepting or crafting a request with the `type` parameter set to 0.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with a regular user account can exploit this vulnerability. They would need the ability to intercept or modify HTTP requests, typically through a web proxy or other network manipulation tools.
