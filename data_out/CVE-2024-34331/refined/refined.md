Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in Parallels Desktop's use of a `setuid` binary, `Parallels Service`, to execute the `createinstallmedia` command as root. The `repack_osx_install_app.sh` script, responsible for handling macOS installer applications, was not verifying the code signature of `createinstallmedia` before execution. This allowed an attacker to replace the legitimate `createinstallmedia` binary within a specially crafted macOS installer app with a malicious one.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Lack of code signature verification:** The primary vulnerability was the absence of code signature verification on the `createinstallmedia` binary within the `repack_osx_install_app.sh` script before executing it as root.
- **Abuse of setuid binary:** The use of `setuid` binary `Parallels Service` that runs the vulnerable `repack_osx_install_app.sh` as root allowed the exploit to gain root privileges.
- **Trust in macOS installer structure:** Parallels Desktop was trusting the structure of macOS installer applications without proper validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker could gain root privileges by exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With root privileges, the attacker can execute any code on the affected system, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious macOS installer application containing a modified `createinstallmedia` binary.
- The attacker convinces Parallels Desktop to open the crafted application.
- `Parallels Service`, running with root privileges, executes `repack_osx_install_app.sh`.
- The script executes the malicious `createinstallmedia` without signature verification, leading to arbitrary code execution as root.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious macOS installer application.
- The attacker needs to be able to convince the user to load this application into Parallels Desktop.
- No prior root access is required, as the vulnerability provides local privilege escalation.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability only affects x86_64-based macOS machines because the vulnerable code path involving `createinstallmedia` is not used on Apple Silicon Macs, which use IPSW restore images.
- The vulnerability was present in Parallels Desktop versions 16.0.0 through 19.3.0 and fixed in version 19.3.1 with the addition of a code signature check for `createinstallmedia`.
- The fix implemented in version 19.3.1 verifies the code signature of `createinstallmedia` against `anchor apple` to ensure it is signed by Apple before executing it.
