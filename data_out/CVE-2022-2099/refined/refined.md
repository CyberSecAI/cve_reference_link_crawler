- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WooCommerce plugin is vulnerable to stored HTML injection due to a lack of escaping and sanitizing in the payment gateway titles.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored HTML injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML code, which will be rendered in both the admin panel and on the checkout screen for visitors. This could lead to various attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or phishing attempts, depending on the injected code.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by navigating to WooCommerce -> Settings -> Payments tab, enabling BAC (Bank Account Transfers), and then editing the title in the setup dialog.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have admin access to the WordPress site to modify the payment gateway settings.
