| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2274767#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2024-04-12 18:25:41 UTC  ``` The digest values, handled by the Go library github.com/opencontainers/go-digest and used throughout the Go-implemented containers ecosystem, are not always validated. That allows attackers to trigger unexpected authenticated registry accesses on behalf of a victim user, resource exhaustion, local path traversal and other attacks.
