### Description

The Booking for Appointments and Events Calendar – Amelia Premium and Lite plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the 'ameliaButtonCommand' function in all versions up to, and including, Premium 7.7 and Lite 1.2.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to access employee calendar details, including Google Calendar OAuth tokens in the premium version.
