### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization check in the 'ameliaButtonCommand' function within the Booking for Appointments and Events Calendar â€“ Amelia Premium and Lite plugins for WordPress.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of capability checks on the `ameliaButtonCommand` function, which allows unauthorized access to sensitive data.

### Impact of exploitation
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to access sensitive information, including:
    - Employee calendar details.
    - Google Calendar OAuth tokens (in the premium version of the plugin).

### Attack vectors
- The attack vector is through the 'ameliaButtonCommand' function, which can be accessed without proper authorization.

### Required attacker capabilities/position

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in all versions of the Amelia Premium plugin up to and including 7.7, and all versions of the Amelia Lite plugin up to and including 1.2.4.
- The Wordfence article states that there is no known patch for the premium version, recommending the user review the details and potentially uninstall the plugin. The Lite version was patched in version 1.2.5
