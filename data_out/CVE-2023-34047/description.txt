A batch loader function in Spring for GraphQL versions 1.1.0 - 1.1.5 and 1.2.0 - 1.2.2 may be exposed to GraphQL context with values, including security context values, from a different session. An application is vulnerable if it provides a DataLoaderOptions instance when registering batch loader functions through DefaultBatchLoaderRegistry.
