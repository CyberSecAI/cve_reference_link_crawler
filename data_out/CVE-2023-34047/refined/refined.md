- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A batch loader function in Spring for GraphQL may be exposed to GraphQL context with values, including security context values, from a different session. This occurs when an application provides a `DataLoaderOptions` instance when registering batch loader functions through `DefaultBatchLoaderRegistry`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive data (including security context) to the wrong session.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker may gain access to sensitive data or perform actions as another user by exploiting the context confusion. The confidentiality of the data is affected, but not the integrity or availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the GraphQL API, by sending requests that leverage the vulnerable batch loading mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send GraphQL requests and have some knowledge of the application's usage of batch loading. It has a high attack complexity and requires user interaction from the victim by having an active session.
