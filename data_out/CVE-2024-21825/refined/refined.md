- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Integer overflow when calculating the allocation size for `gguf_str` array, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. Specifically, the multiplication of `kv->value.arr.n` (a 64-bit unsigned integer) and `sizeof(struct gguf_str)` (16 bytes) can overflow, resulting in a smaller allocation than required.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Integer overflow
    - Heap-based buffer overflow
- **Impact of exploitation**: Code execution, due to heap-based buffer overflow when writing to the undersized allocated buffer.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted .gguf file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide the malicious .gguf file to be parsed by the vulnerable `llama.cpp` application. The user would have to load the crafted model file.
