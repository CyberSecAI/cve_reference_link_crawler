…r()` fallback ([GH-122134](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/122134)) ([GH-122429](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/122429))

Authenticate socket connection for `socket.socketpair()` fallback when the platform does not have a native `socketpair` C API.  We authenticate in-process using `getsocketname` and `getpeername` (thanks to Nathaniel J Smith for that suggestion).

(cherry picked from commit [78df104](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/78df1043dbdce5c989600616f9f87b4ee72944e5))
