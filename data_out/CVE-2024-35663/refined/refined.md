- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unprivileged users can perform actions that should be restricted to higher privileged users. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is in the WP Translate WordPress plugin, and can be triggered through a function with missing authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber (unprivileged user).
