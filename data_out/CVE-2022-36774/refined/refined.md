- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the manipulation of the client proxy configuration in IBM Robotic Process Automation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) vulnerability, arising from the ability to manipulate client proxy configurations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful MITM attack could allow an attacker to intercept and potentially alter communications between the client and server, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves manipulating the client proxy configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be in a position to manipulate the client's proxy configuration to carry out the attack. This could involve compromising a network device, intercepting network traffic, or otherwise gaining access to client settings.
