Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9813 (based on the content referring to "Codezips Pharmacy Management System In PHP With Source Code V1.0 SQL Injection #10" which is likely related to the CVE)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw due to insufficient user input validation of the `category` parameter in the `product/register.php` file. The application directly uses the unsanitized `category` parameter in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the injection of malicious SQL code through the `category` parameter.
- Lack of Input Validation: The system fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, specifically the `category` parameter.
- Direct use of user input in SQL queries

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Database Access: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- Sensitive Data Leakage: Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
- Data Tampering: Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- Comprehensive System Control: In severe cases, attackers may gain control over the entire system.
- Service Interruption: The attack could potentially lead to service disruptions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `product/register.php`
- Maliciously crafted SQL payload within the `category` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is required.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious SQL injection payload

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable file is `product/register.php` within the `Pharmacy Management System In PHP With Source Code` project.
- The vulnerable parameter is `category`.
- A time-based blind SQL injection is demonstrated using a `SLEEP()` function in the payload.
- Example payload:  `bar_code=11&med_name=11&category=11' AND (SELECT 2260 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))wopH) AND 'KzXg'='KzXg&quantity=12&sell_type=Bot&reg_date=0001-01-01&exp_date=0001-01-01&company=1&actual_price=1&selling_price=1&profit_price=0(10%)&submit=Save`
- Sqlmap was successfully used to exploit the vulnerability.

**Remediation Advice:**

1.  **Use Prepared Statements and Parameter Binding:**
    - This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection by separating SQL code from user input.
2.  **Input Validation and Filtering:**
    - Implement strict validation and filtering to ensure user input conforms to the expected format.
3.  **Minimize Database User Permissions:**
    - Use a database account with the least required permissions to prevent extensive damage if an injection occurs.
4.  **Regular Security Audits:**
    - Conduct regular security audits to promptly identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.
