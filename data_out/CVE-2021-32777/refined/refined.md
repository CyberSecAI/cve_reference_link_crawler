Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `ext-authz` extension in Envoy incorrectly handles multiple value request headers when sending them to an external authorization service. Instead of merging the multiple values as per HTTP specifications, it only sends the last header value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Header Handling:** The core issue is the failure to properly concatenate or merge multiple values for a single request header before sending it to the external authorization service.
- **Authorization Bypass:** This incorrect handling can lead to authorization bypass because the external authorization service might rely on multiple header values for proper access control decisions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Escalation of Privileges:**  A successful exploit can lead to privilege escalation. By crafting a request with multiple header values, an attacker might bypass the intended authorization checks and gain unauthorized access or permissions.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** The vulnerability is categorized with High Confidentiality impact in the CVSS vector. While integrity and availability are not directly impacted, the ability to bypass authorization could give attackers access to sensitive information

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously Crafted Requests:** The attack vector involves a downstream peer (potentially untrusted) sending a carefully crafted request with multiple values for the same header. The Envoy proxy, using the vulnerable `ext-authz` extension, forwards this request to the external authorization service, but only the last header value is sent.
- **Presence of Vulnerable Extension:** The vulnerability is only exploitable when the `ext-authz` extension is enabled and configured.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Downstream Peer:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to an Envoy instance that uses the vulnerable `ext-authz` extension.
- **Control over Request Headers:** The attacker must be able to manipulate the request headers and send multiple values for the same header.
