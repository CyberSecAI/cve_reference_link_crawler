# Versa Security Bulletin:  Update on CVE-2024-39717 – Versa Director Dangerous File Type Upload Vulnerability

[![Versa Security Research Team](/images/photos/photo-versa-security-research-team.jpg)](https://versa-networks.com/blog/author/versa-security-research-team/)
##### By [Versa Security Research Team](/blog/author/versa-security-research-team/)

###### August 26, 2024

**Affected Platforms**: Versa Director

**Impacted Users**: Targeted at managed service providers

**Impact**: Privilege Escalation

**Severity Level**: High

Overview

* Versa Networks has established and published [**Firewall Requirements**](https://docs.versa-networks.com/Getting_Started/Deployment_and_Initial_Configuration/Deployment_Basics/Firewall_Requirements)since2015 and [**System Hardening**](https://docs.versa-networks.com/Solutions/System_Hardening)requirementssince 2017

* A vulnerability was recently discovered in Versa Director ([CVE-2024-39717](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-39717)). This vulnerability allowed potentially malicious files to be uploaded by users with Provider-Data-Center-Admin or Provider-Data-Center-System-Admin privileges.

* Impacted customers had not implemented system hardening and firewall guidelines mentioned above, leaving a management port exposed on the internet that provided the threat actors with initial access.

* Versa has released a patch for the vulnerability, and we are actively working with all customers to ensure the patch and system hardening guidelines are applied.

Exploitation Status

* This vulnerability has been exploited in at least one known instance by an Advanced Persistent Threat actor.

* Although the vulnerability is difficult to exploit, it’s rated “High” and affects all Versa SD-WAN customers using Versa Director, that have not implemented the system hardening and firewall guidelines.

* CISA has added this vulnerability to its “Known Exploited Vulnerabilities” list ([CVE-2024-39717](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-39717)).
