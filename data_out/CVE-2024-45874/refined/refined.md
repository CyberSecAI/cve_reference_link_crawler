Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-45874

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a DLL hijacking issue within the VegaBird Vooki application. Specifically, the application attempts to load DLL files from its working directory without proper verification, which allows an attacker to substitute a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DLL Hijacking:** The application loads DLLs insecurely, making it vulnerable to DLL hijacking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code by replacing a legitimate DLL with a malicious one.
- **Persistence:** The malicious DLL can be used to maintain persistence on the affected system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Under specific conditions, an attacker could potentially achieve privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to place a crafted DLL file (e.g., `dcomp.dll`) in the same directory where `Yaazhini.exe` or `Vooki.exe` is located, typically `C:\Program Files\Vooki`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs write access to the application directory to place the malicious DLL.
- The attacker needs the user to launch the vulnerable application (`Vooki.exe` or `Yaazhini.exe`) for the malicious DLL to be loaded.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in VegaBird Vooki version 5.2.9
- The application's working directory (`C:\Program Files\Vooki`) is the attack vector.
