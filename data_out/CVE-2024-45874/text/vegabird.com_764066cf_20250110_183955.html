Thanks to “Vooki Infosec Private Limited ” for giving us a powerful
suite of tools that every cyber security team must have. I was quite startled to see how
fast the scanner works and find issues compared to other professional tools. One of the
best tool i have ever used to perform API pentest. Excellent job.

Recently I am started to use Vooki DAST. Vooki is really fast
scanner. Vooki finds more security vulnerabilities than other softwares available in the
market. And REST API scanner is really helpful to scan my mobile application apis.
Appreciate it. Keep up the good work.
