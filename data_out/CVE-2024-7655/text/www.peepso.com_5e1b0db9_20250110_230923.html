#app #mobileapp #release

We‚Äôre excited to announce the release of PeepSo 6.4.6.0. This update focuses on security enhancements, user-friendly settings, and improved performance for Your Community. Oh‚Ä¶ and in case you missed it‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre making Mobile Apps for Your Community now too. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new:

### Security Update ‚Äì Act Now!

WordFence reported some minor security issues, which have been swiftly addressed in this release. We highly recommend updating immediately to ensure your site remains secure and protected. For security reasons, we don‚Äôt disclose the details of the reports.

### Relaxed Version Lock ‚Äì Flexibility for Admins

Admins now have more control over version compatibility. With the new **Relaxed Version Lock** option in the Advanced settings, you can choose not to disable child plugins when there‚Äôs a version mismatch. While this could lead to potential PHP errors (though it shouldn‚Äôt in most cases), it‚Äôs a helpful feature for those who struggle with frequent updates. This option gives you the flexibility to keep things running smoothly while addressing updates at your own pace.

### Reset Notification Preferences ‚Äì Quick and Easy

Need to reset notification settings for all users? We‚Äôve got you covered! At the bottom of the Notifications options, you‚Äôll find two buttons that allow you to reset notification preferences for every user in your community. This is especially useful if you need to limit emails sent by the site or want to set default preferences for everyone, saving you time and hassle.

### Performance Boosts and Compatibility Enhancements

* **Hashtags Queries Performance**: We‚Äôve optimized the performance of hashtags queries, ensuring faster load times and better user experience.
* **Elementor Compatibility**: We‚Äôve improved compatibility with Elementor, allowing for smoother integration and seamless page-building within your community.

For a complete list of changes, please refer to our¬†[changelog](https://www.peepso.com/changelog/).

### Have You Heard? PeepSo Makes Mobile Apps Now!

# Make Your Community Mobile

**PeepSo** now offers a seamless solution to transform your PeepSo-based community into a powerful mobile app. No third-party integrations needed.

I‚Äôm a Digital Nomad currently living in Manila, The Philippines. Co-Founder and CEO of PeepSo.com. First time WordCamp Speaker at WordCamp Kuala Lumpur 2017, WordCamp Singapore 2019 and hoping to speak more soon.
I started my journey with open source nearly a decade ago as a simple support guy. Joomla! was my first encounter with the world of Open Source. After that period of my life got phased out I fell in love with WordPress and never left. I have been both lucky and at the same time I worked my ass off to get to where I am right now.
Free time, if I have any, is usually spent with my wife and / or travel around South-East Asia. Even when I‚Äôm supposed to be on a little vacation, not a day goes by when I don‚Äôt check up on PeepSo. So far visited or lived in: Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Hungary, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, China, Japan, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Norway, Germany, Scotland, England and more‚Ä¶
Whenever possible, I jump on my Ducati Monster and just ride.

@peepso\_user\_10386(Josh Journey)
Great update. I enabled the new relaxed version lock as the addon‚Äôs have not yet arrived in WP update. This removed the compatibility error. I‚Äôll go back to strict once they are updated. I also appreciate the security fix, house cleaning, default notification settings, and further performance enhancements. I‚Äôm very pleased with the direction PeepSo is going.
