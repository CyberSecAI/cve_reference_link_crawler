  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A change in the ext4 filesystem error handling logic introduced in commit 014c9caa29d3 caused a deviation from expected behavior when the 'errors=panic' mount option was used. Specifically, remounting a filesystem with the 'abort' option would no longer trigger a panic, which was the behavior prior to the mentioned commit.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inconsistency in error handling behavior regarding the 'errors=panic' mount option when remounting with 'abort'",
      "Unexpected deviation from the behavior prior to commit 014c9caa29d3"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability, while not exploitable for arbitrary code execution or data corruption, manifests as an inconsistency in system behavior. The system may not panic as expected when 'errors=panic' is specified, which can lead to unexpected state changes. Prior to this change, with `errors=panic`, an error would cause a kernel panic, while the change made it possible to remount with 'abort' without a panic. Additionally, the following sequence now also causes a panic: 1. mount /dev/sda -o ro,errors=panic test; 2. echo test > /sys/fs/ext4/sda/trigger\_fs\_error.",
