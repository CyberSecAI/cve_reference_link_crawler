When an OIDC app that serves multiple tenants attempts to access the second tenant, it should prompt the user to log in again since the second tenant is secured with a different OIDC configuration. The underlying issue is in OidcSessionTokenStore when determining if a cached token should be used or not. This logic needs to be updated to take into account the new "provider-url" option in addition to the "realm" option. EAP-7 does not provide the vulnerable provider-url configuration option in its OIDC implementation and is not affected by this flaw. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2250812#c0)  Rohit Keshri    2023-11-21 09:35:26 UTC  ``` When attempting to access the second tenant, the user should be prompted to log in again since the second tenant is secured with different OIDC configuration (e.g., with a different Keycloak realm).  The underlying issue is a bug in OidcSessionTokenStore when determining if a cached token should be used or not. This logic needs to be updated to take into account the new "provider-url" option in addition to the "realm" option.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2250812#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-06-04 10:59:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform  Via RHSA-2024:3583 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3583](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3583)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2250812#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-06-04 11:00:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8.0 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2024:3581 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3581](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3581)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2250812#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-06-04 11:03:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8.0 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:3580 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3580](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3580)   ``` |  |
