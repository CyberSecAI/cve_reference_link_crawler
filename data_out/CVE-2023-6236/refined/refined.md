  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is related to OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) 8.0. When an OIDC application serves multiple tenants and attempts to access a second tenant, the user is not prompted to re-authenticate with the correct OIDC configuration for the new tenant. This occurs due to a flaw in the OidcSessionTokenStore, which incorrectly determines if a cached token is valid for the new tenant.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the `OidcSessionTokenStore`'s logic, which inadequately checks if a cached token is valid for different tenants. The logic does not properly consider the `provider-url` option of an OIDC configuration, relying only on the `realm` option. This results in reusing cached tokens across tenants that should have unique authentication settings.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect token validation logic in `OidcSessionTokenStore`.",
        "Failure to consider the `provider-url` when determining if a cached OIDC token is valid."
      ],
      "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is that an authenticated user in one tenant can unintentionally gain access to resources in another tenant without proper re-authentication. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or actions within the second tenant.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker can exploit this by gaining access to an application served in a JBoss EAP instance that has an OIDC provider configured to support multiple tenants. After initial authentication with one tenant, they can then attempt to access a different tenant without re-authenticating, potentially gaining unauthorized access.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to have network access to the vulnerable JBoss EAP application and possess valid credentials for at least one of the OIDC tenants it serves. No special privileges are required on the server, and this exploit would occur at the application logic level. An attacker must also be aware of the OIDC provider URLs for different tenants."
