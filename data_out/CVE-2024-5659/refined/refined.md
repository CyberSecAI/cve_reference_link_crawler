- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Sending abnormal packets to the mDNS port (5353) can cause a major non-recoverable fault (MNRF/Assert) on affected controllers. The vulnerability is related to how the controllers handle multicast requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the incorrect handling of network packets specifically, abnormal packets sent to the mDNS port. This is categorized as CWE-670 "Always-Incorrect Flow Implementation."
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a major non-recoverable fault (MNRF/Assert) on the targeted controllers, resulting in a denial of service and compromising the availability of the devices. The impact extends to all affected controllers on the same network.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the network, by sending abnormal packets to the mDNS port (5353).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be on the same network as the targeted controllers to send the malicious packets. No authentication is required (PR:N) and no user interaction is necessary(UI:N). The attack requires adjacent network access (AV:A).
