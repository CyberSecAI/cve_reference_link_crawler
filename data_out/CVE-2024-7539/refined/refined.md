- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists within the parsing of responses from AT+CUSD commands due to the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a stack-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of root.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target modem. The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted response to an AT+CUSD command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local attacker with the ability to execute code on the target modem.
