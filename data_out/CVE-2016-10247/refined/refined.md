Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10247:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A global buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `my_getline` function within `jstest_main.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Global buffer overflow:** The `my_getline` function writes data beyond the allocated boundary of the `getline_buffer` global variable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of service (DoS):** The buffer overflow leads to an out-of-bounds write, causing the program to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted file:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted file as input to the `mujstest` tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted file to be processed by the `mujstest` utility.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `my_getline` function at `platform/x11/jstest_main.c:214:5`.
- The overflow occurs when writing to the `getline_buffer` global variable, which is defined at `platform/x11/jstest_main.c:24:13` and has a size of 4096 bytes.
- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop.
- The issue was fixed in mupdf version 1.10, with the fix committed via [446097f97b71ce20fa8d1e45e070f2e62676003e](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?446097f97b71ce20fa8d1e45e070f2e62676003e).
- The Debian LTS advisory DLA-2765-1 addresses this issue along with other CVEs in mupdf, with the fix available in version `1.14.0+ds1-4+deb9u1`.
