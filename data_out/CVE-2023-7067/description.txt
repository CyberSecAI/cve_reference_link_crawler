The ShopLentor – WooCommerce Builder for Elementor & Gutenberg +10 Modules – All in One Solution (formerly WooLentor) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'woolentor_template_store' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above to access the nonce used to access this function and set a blank template as the default template.
