The provided content contains several commits and a pull request related to a vulnerability fix in the `weborf` project. The vulnerability is related to a missing null termination of the path for CGI scripts.

Based on the information from the commit messages and the CHANGELOG, the vulnerability details are as follows:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The path for CGI scripts was not always null-terminated, which could lead to issues during execution or other unexpected behavior.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Missing null termination for the CGI script path when the executor is not explicitly set.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact is not detailed in the provided text, but the vulnerability is described as a "security bug," suggesting potential for arbitrary code execution or other security breaches if a crafted or long path is used as a CGI script. The commit message "Solve issue with unterminated buffer" also suggests potential buffer overflow issues.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request with a long file path intended to be executed as a CGI script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server with an ability to specify the file path that should be executed as CGI. This may require knowledge of the serverâ€™s CGI configuration.

**Additional notes:**

- The fix involves correctly setting the executor of the script. The code change in the commit `49824204add55aab0568d90a6b1e7c822d32120d` shows that the executor variable was incorrectly being assigned the connection\_prop->strfile directly instead of creating a copy.  The correct code will first malloc space, copy the string and then use it to execute the script.

- The commit `6f83c3e9ceed8b0d93608fd5d42b53c081057991` removes the need for CGI wrappers, which also changes the execution method, where files are directly executed except PHP which still requires its wrapper.

- The CHANGELOG entry in commit `7057d254b734dfc9cfb58983f901aa6ec3c94fd4` mentions the fix explicitly, confirming it as a security-related issue.
