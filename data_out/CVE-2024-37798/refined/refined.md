The provided content is a comprehensive overview of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, and it does not reference a specific CVE. Therefore, I am unable to provide specific information on CVE-2024-37798

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
XSS vulnerabilities arise when web applications include untrusted user input in their output without proper validation or encoding. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that are then executed by the victim's browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation and output encoding.
- Failure to sanitize user input before displaying it on a web page.
- Not using appropriate techniques to prevent script execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Stealing cookies and session tokens.
- Hijacking user sessions and accounts.
- Redirecting users to malicious sites.
- Displaying incorrect content.
- Modifying displayed data or information.
- Performing actions on behalf of the user.
- Disclosure of user files or sensitive data
- Installation of trojan horse programs.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious URLs (Reflected XSS).
- Stored malicious scripts (Stored XSS).
- DOM manipulation using malicious JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to inject malicious code into web applications.
- Ability to trick users into clicking on malicious links or submitting malicious forms (Reflected XSS).
- Ability to store malicious code in a database or other storage mechanism (Stored XSS)
- Ability to manipulate DOM through client-side code.
