{
  "cveId": "CVE-2024-3302",
  "description": "There was no limit to the number of HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames that would be processed. A server could abuse this to create an Out of Memory condition in the browser.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "Lack of proper limitation on the number of HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames processed by the server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unbounded resource consumption",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to out-of-memory (OOM) condition, potentially leading to server crashes or unavailability.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Malicious HTTP/2 server sending a continuous stream of CONTINUATION frames without the END_HEADERS flag set."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "Attacker needs the ability to establish an HTTP/2 connection to the target server and send crafted HTTP/2 frames."
  },
  "affectedProducts": [
    "Firefox",
    "Firefox ESR",
    "Thunderbird",
    "Node.js",
    "Envoy",
    "Tempesta FW",
    "amphp/http",
    "Go net/http, net/http2",
    "nghttp2 library",
    "Apache Httpd",
      "Apache Traffic Server"

  ],
  "additionalDetails": [
    "The vulnerability arises from the server not limiting the number of CONTINUATION frames within a single HTTP/2 stream.",
    "Attackers can exploit this by sending a large stream of CONTINUATION frames, eventually leading to OOM on the server or CPU resource exhaustion from decoding HPACK Huffman encoded frames.",
    "Multiple implementations of HTTP/2 are vulnerable due to this issue, each possibly having its own specific aspects and exploitation techniques.",
    "The vulnerability can be difficult to analyze as the HTTP request is not completed properly, requiring analysis of raw HTTP traffic to identify the attack."
