{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The root cause is missing usb_kill_urb() calls on the error handling path of the ->probe function in the port100 driver.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free (UAF)"
    ],
    "impact": "A use-after-free vulnerability occurs when `port100_send_complete()` accesses memory that has been deallocated due to a probe failure. This can lead to a kernel crash and potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the probe function of the port100 driver fails, leading to deallocation of memory used by the URBs before they are killed. An attacker can trigger this by causing a probe failure.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to interact with the NFC port100 device in a way that causes the driver's probe function to fail."
