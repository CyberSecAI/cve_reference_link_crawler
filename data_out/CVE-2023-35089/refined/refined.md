{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious request that targets a vulnerable action in the plugin, and tricks an authenticated user into submitting this request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into performing an action that they did not intend, which can be done via social engineering or a malicious link. They do not need to be logged in themselves, since they are relying on the victim's active session."
