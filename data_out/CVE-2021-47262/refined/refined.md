The provided content relates to a vulnerability fix in the Linux kernel's KVM module, specifically concerning a tracepoint for nested VM-Enter failures.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability arises because the tracepoint for "nested VM-Enter failed" used string literals directly without making a copy. When KVM was built as a module, the memory holding these string literals could be freed when the module was unloaded. However, the tracepoint itself and its data in the ring buffer could persist, leading to the tracepoint dereferencing stale memory after the module unload. This issue was exposed by a new check in the tracing subsystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Use-after-free: The tracepoint was accessing memory that could be freed when the KVM module was unloaded.
- Incorrect handling of string literals in tracepoints when using modules.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Dereferencing stale memory: The primary impact is the kernel attempting to access freed memory, which could lead to a crash.
- System instability: Kernel crashes can cause system instability, and could potentially be escalated by an attacker to achieve a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Triggering the nested VM-Enter failure tracepoint: This would require setting up a nested virtualization environment and causing a VM-Enter failure.
- Unloading the KVM module after triggering the tracepoint: If KVM is built as a module, an attacker could unload the module after triggering the vulnerability to cause the use-after-free.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger nested VM-Enter failures within a KVM environment.
- If KVM is built as a module, the attacker would need the ability to unload kernel modules which may require root access.

**Fix:**
The fix involves using the `__string()` machinery provided by the tracing subsystem to make a copy of the string literals. The `__assign_str` function now copies the string into trace buffer, ensuring the tracepoint does not outlive the memory it is using.
