Based on the provided document, here's the information related to CVE-2023-25860:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Write

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The software is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write. This means that the software can write data to a memory location that it is not authorized to access, potentially overwriting other data or code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker can run their own malicious code on the user's machine.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs to have access to the local machine or system.
- The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), meaning the user has to perform some action, likely opening a malicious file, in order to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attack complexity is low (AC:L), which means that the attacker does not need special skills or tools to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a malicious file.
- The attacker does not need any privileges or special access rights to trigger the vulnerability (PR:N).
