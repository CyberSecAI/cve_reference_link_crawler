### **[breakingsystems](/breakingsystems)** commented [Oct 12, 2021](#issue-1023878745) ‚Ä¢ edited by bsweeney Loading

| A malicious user is able to use Dompdf to execute code remotely under the following conditions:   * the Dompdf font directory (dompdf/lib/fonts by default) is accessible through the web * a remote user is able to inject CSS into a document rendered by Dompdf   On a vulnerable system a user can reference a specially crafted font file that is able to pass the initial parsing process, at which time Dompdf persists the font file to the font directory with an extension matching that of the file on the remote system. At this point the user is able to load the persisted file to execute code within the context of the PHP process.  Recommended mitigations for Dompdf versions prior to 1.2.1:   * move Dompdf and/or the Dompdf font directory outside the web root * disable access to remote resources by setting the isRemoteEnabled option to false * sanitize user input   Vulnerability details are available on the [Positive Security blog](https://positive.security/blog/dompdf-rce).  Refer to the wiki for additional information on [securing Dompdf](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/wiki/Securing-dompdf). |

| FYI, after reviewing the vulnerability and in consideration of the public release I'm going to include a patch in the upcoming 1.2.1 release. |
