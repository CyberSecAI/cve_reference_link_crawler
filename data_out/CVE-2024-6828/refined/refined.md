{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization and capability checks within the `Redux_Color_Scheme_Import` function, allowing unauthenticated users to upload JSON files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')",
      "Missing authorization and capability checks",
      "Unrestricted file upload"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can upload malicious JSON files. These files can be used to execute stored XSS attacks and, in some cases, lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when `wp_filesystem` initialization fails.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through network access (AV:N), and it does not require any user interaction (UI:N). The attack is possible due to the lack of authentication (PR:N) requirements for uploading the malicious JSON files.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs network access to send a crafted request to upload malicious JSON files. No user authentication or interaction is needed."
