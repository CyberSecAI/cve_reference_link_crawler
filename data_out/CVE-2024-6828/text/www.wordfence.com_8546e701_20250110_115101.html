### Description

The Redux Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated JSON file uploads due to missing authorization and capability checks on the Redux\_Color\_Scheme\_Import function in versions 4.4.12 to 4.4.17. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload JSON files, which can be used to conduct stored cross-site scripting attacks and, in some rare cases, when the wp\_filesystem fails to initialize - to Remote Code Execution.
