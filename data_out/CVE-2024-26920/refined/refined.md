{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2024-26920",
    "Description": "The provided content relates to a series of commits that address a flaw in the Linux kernel's tracing functionality, specifically within the `register_snapshot_trigger` function. This series of commits aims to fix an incorrect return value in the tracing subsystem when a snapshot allocation fails. The initial fix was flawed due to an incorrect assumption about the return value of the function, leading to a series of reverts and corrections.",
    "Root cause": "The root cause is an incorrect assumption about the return value of `tracing_alloc_snapshot_instance` in older stable kernel trees (<=5.15). The function returned 0 on failure which was interpreted as success, leading to the incorrect registration of a snapshot trigger. The problem arises because the commit which changed this return value (b8cc44a4d3c1) was not present in these stable trees.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect error handling",
      "Flawed assumption about return values",
      "Inconsistency between different kernel versions"
    ],
    "Impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is that a snapshot trigger could be registered even if the snapshot allocation failed. This could lead to unexpected behavior or prevent the proper functioning of the tracing subsystem. Although the content does not explicitly state a security impact, such issues can be exploited or cause unexpected behavior of the tracing subsystem, which in turn can affect system stability or expose internal states of the system.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector would involve attempting to register a snapshot trigger and observe the failure being ignored due to the incorrect return value handling.  A user with the ability to configure tracing triggers would be able to trigger this issue.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to configure tracing triggers, likely requiring root privileges or a specific capability. They would also need to be aware of the flaw in the tracing subsystem and how to trigger it, which is not directly possible given the information in the provided documents."
