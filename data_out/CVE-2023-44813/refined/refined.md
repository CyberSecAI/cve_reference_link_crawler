Root cause of vulnerability:
The `mode` parameter in the Invite Friend function of mooSocial v3.1.8 is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Reflected XSS vulnerability due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `mode` parameter.

Impact of exploitation:
- Attackers can steal user's session cookies.
- Attackers can impersonate user accounts.
- Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.

Attack vectors:
-  A crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the `mode` parameter is used as the attack vector.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- An attacker needs to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to induce a user to click the malicious link.
