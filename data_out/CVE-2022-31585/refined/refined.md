This results in the exposure of sensitive information and potentially compromised availability. All the vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable, without requiring special privileges or user interaction. The common weakness being exploited here is CWE-22. The primary remediation is to avoid using user-controlled inputs directly into send_file, and instead use safer alternatives like `flask.safe_join` or `flask.send_from_directory`.
