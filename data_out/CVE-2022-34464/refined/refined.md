- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An improperly protected file is used to import SSH keys in the SICAM GridEdge software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control, specifically, exposure of resource to the wrong sphere (CWE-668).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can inject a custom SSH key by modifying the vulnerable file. This could allow them to gain unauthorized access to the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the host system's filesystem is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have local access to the host system running SICAM GridEdge to manipulate files.
