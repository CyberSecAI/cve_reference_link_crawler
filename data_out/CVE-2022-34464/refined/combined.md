SUMMARY

The SICAM GridEdge software contains a improper access control vulnerability. This could allow persons
with local access to the host system to inject an SSH key.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet
available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict physical access to the device and limit access to the ssh port (22/tcp) to trusted IP

addresses if possible.

Product speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations
to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes.
It is therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures
are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of
the grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SICAM GridEdge enables your existing IEC61850 equipment with IoT functionality using just a few clicks.
Based on international standards (MQTT, OPC UA Pub/Sub (IEC 62451), IEC61850) data collected
from your equipment is transmitted to well-known cloud platforms Siemens MindSphere, Microsoft Azure
and to self-hosted platforms. SICAM GridEdge creates a multi-layered communication architecture,
where the substation IEDs are capable of ingesting local huge data streams and only transmit relevant
pre-processed data into the cloud.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-34464

Affected software uses an improperly protected ﬁle to import SSH keys. Attackers with access to the
ﬁlesystem of the host on which SICAM GridEdge runs, are able to inject a custom SSH key to that ﬁle.
