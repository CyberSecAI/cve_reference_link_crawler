```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length before copying it to a stack-based buffer during the processing of Data Node jobs in MySQL Cluster.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- Impact of exploitation: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the service account.
- Attack vectors: A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted data to the affected service.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker can be remote and does not need authentication.
