Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Root Cause:** The "Api checker" module within Pandora FMS allows users to specify a custom URL. This module then fetches the content from the provided URL without proper validation or sanitization, making it vulnerable to SSRF.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of proper URL validation, allowing the user to supply arbitrary URLs.
- The application fetches the content of the user-supplied URL without sufficient checks.
- The "Api checker" module is vulnerable to SSRF.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read local files on the server, including sensitive files like `/etc/passwd` or database configuration files (e.g., `pandoradb_data.sql`). The attacker can leverage this to extract information from the server.
- **Potentially further exploitation:** Depending on the accessed information, this vulnerability might be a stepping stone for further attacks, such as privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Api checker" module which has a custom URL field.
- The attacker can supply a `file://` URI.
- This does not require the attacker to be on the same network as the target system as the vulnerable web application will perform the requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with administrative privileges (evil admin user).
- The attacker needs access to the Pandora FMS web interface.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Pandora FMS versions up to and including v767.
- The exploit author is identified as Damodar Naik.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS 3.1 score of 6.5 (Medium).
- The exploit is reproducible using the steps detailed in the provided document.
