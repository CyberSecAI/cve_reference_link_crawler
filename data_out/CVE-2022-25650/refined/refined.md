- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application allows sorting database query results using protected fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control (CWE-284) by not properly restricting access to protected fields when sorting database query results.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker can extract information about the contents of a protected field.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can perform database queries and sort by a protected field, allowing them to infer information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
