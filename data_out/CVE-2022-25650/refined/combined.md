WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• The behavior of sorting by non-accessible attributes can be changed by changing the value of the
DataStorage.EnableOrderByEntityAccess custom runtime setting to true. Starting with version 9.12
it is turned on by default with the new, improved behavior.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Mendix is a high productivity app platform that enables you to build and continuously improve mobile and
web applications at scale. The Mendix Platform is designed to accelerate enterprise app delivery across
your entire application development lifecycle, from ideation to deployment and operations.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
