Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `formWriteFacMac` function within the Tenda AC500 router's firmware. The `mac` parameter, provided by the user, is directly passed to the `doSystemCmd` function without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. Because the user-controlled `mac` parameter is passed directly to `doSystemCmd`, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands within the `mac` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system with the privileges of the web server. This can lead to a complete compromise of the device.
*   **Device takeover:** The attacker can take full control of the router, allowing actions such as network manipulation, data exfiltration, malware installation, denial of service attacks and more.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/WriteFacMac` endpoint, with the malicious commands injected in the `mac` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Tenda AC500 router, either locally or remotely if the router's web interface is exposed to the internet.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** Attacker must know the path `/goform/WriteFacMac` to target the device.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided Proof of Concept (POC) code demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands (in the example, a simple echo command).
* The vulnerability affects Tenda AC500 firmware version V2.0.1.9(1307).
* The VulDB submission confirms this command injection vulnerability and assigns it the ID 261144.
