In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/af_unix: disable sending io_uring over sockets

File reference cycles have caused lots of problems for io_uring
in the past, and it still doesn't work exactly right and races with
unix_stream_read_generic(). The safest fix would be to completely
disallow sending io_uring files via sockets via SCM_RIGHT, so there
are no possible cycles invloving registered files and thus rendering
SCM accounting on the io_uring side unnecessary.
