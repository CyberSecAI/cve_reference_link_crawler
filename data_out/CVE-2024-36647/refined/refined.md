The provided content is related to CVE-2024-36647.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization when registering a new family via the external registration form, which is available to unauthenticated users when the application's default setting allows it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the "Family Name" field of the registration form.
- When an authenticated user (e.g., an administrator) views the family page, the injected script will execute within their browser session.
- This could lead to session hijacking and unauthorized actions.
- Sensitive information exposure.

**Attack vectors:**
- An unauthenticated user can access the external family registration form when this feature is enabled.
- The attacker injects a malicious payload (e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert(2)>`) into the Family Name field.
- The injected script is stored in the database.
- When an authenticated user visits the family page, the stored script is executed in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, they can use the external family registration form when available.
- The attacker must be able to access the registration form.
- The attacker needs to inject the malicious payload into the Family Name field.
