- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Cooked plugin for WordPress lacks proper nonce validation on the AJAX action handler for saving the default recipe template.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The plugin does not correctly verify the origin of the request, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a user into saving a malicious default recipe template, potentially leading to unintended behavior or content manipulation on the affected website.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious HTML page that triggers a POST request to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to lure a logged-in WordPress user with administrative privileges on a website using the vulnerable plugin to visit a malicious website or click on a malicious link to trigger the crafted request.
