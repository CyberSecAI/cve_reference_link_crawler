I purchased the pro version 1 year ago. I tested it on a website and found so many bugs that I just parked it somewhere never to be touched again. Worse support ever. I opened a support ticket for the first issue I found. The issue was never resolved. I just received circumstantial scripted replies that amounted to nothing. Not surprisingly, there is no way to cancel your subscription from their website, so I had to open a support ticket to get it cancelled. First, they replied by saying that in order to accept my cancellation request I had to submit a feedback. This alone raised all sorts of red flags, because this is a usual tactic that dodgy companies use to delay cancellation requests. After I submitted the feedback they replied “Please rest assured that I’ve processed your cancellation request, and you’ll receive confirmation shortly”. A few days passes, I receive no confirmation, and on my account page on their website my subscription is still active. I write to them again to ask for explanation and they reply, “We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused. Please rest assured that your subscription has already been canceled as per your request. However, the license key remains active until the date of …, and will automatically deactivate on that date.”That’s right, the key should remain active for the time I have paid for, but the subscription, which is something different than the key is still shown as active, meaning that I am going to be charged on the day of renewal. They offer to “If you’d like us to deactivate the license key immediately, please let us know, and we will take care of it for you.” to which I reply yes, deactivate the key, hoping that this is what is needed to change the status of the subscription and guess what?Nothing has changed. On their website there is no indication of the status of the key, so I cannot say whether has been deactivated, especially because I have not received any confirmation email even for this operation, what a surprise.What I Know for sure, is that the subscription is still active. 10 days have passed with several messages exchanged just for doing something as simple as cancelling a subscription and yet, I have no written or visual confirmation that the subscription has been cancelled. I have blocked them through the bank. Hopefully, this will prevent them from charging with no authorization, but just in case you try XPro, be sure that a chargeback request will be filled. Just stay away from this company and their products.Wordpress.org should ban companies like this one.

### [Floating Effect Bug: Usability Issue on Frontend](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/floating-effect-bug-usability-issue-on-frontend/)

The plugin has a bug with its floating effect. The effect only works in the Elementor editor and appears correctly on the frontend immediately after saving content, but it stops working after the first page refresh. This inconsistency disrupts the floating effect’s functionality, impacting the intended visual experience for site visitors.
