Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23109:

**CVE-2022-23109**

*   **Root Cause:** The HashiCorp Vault Plugin, prior to version 3.8.0, did not explicitly declare Vault credentials as sensitive. It relied on the behavior of Pipeline: Groovy Plugin versions 2.84 and earlier, which used an allowlist of non-sensitive variables, masking everything else.  Later versions of Pipeline Groovy Plugin expect each pipeline step to declare sensitive variables to be masked.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper credential masking in Pipeline step descriptions and build logs. The plugin failed to explicitly mask Vault credentials, which were then displayed in plain text in these locations.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Exposure of Vault credentials (secrets) in pipeline build logs and step descriptions. This could lead to unauthorized access to systems and resources protected by the compromised credentials.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker who has access to Jenkins build logs or pipeline step descriptions could obtain the Vault credentials.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attackers need to have at least Overall/Read access to view the Pipeline build logs or pipeline step descriptions.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability exists because the HashiCorp Vault Plugin did not adapt to changes in the Pipeline: Groovy Plugin's credential masking behavior.
*   The fix involves explicitly masking Vault credentials in build logs and pipeline step descriptions in HashiCorp Vault Plugin 3.8.0
*   The fix is not retroactive and administrators need to review previous build logs for leaked credentials
