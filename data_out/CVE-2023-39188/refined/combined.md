SSA-811403: Multiple File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Solid Edge
before V223 Update 7

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

SUMMARY

Solid Edge is affected by multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the
application reads specially crafted ﬁles in various formats such as DFT, PAR or PSM format. If a user is
tricked to open a malicious ﬁle with the affected application, an attacker could leverage the vulnerability to
crash the application or execute arbitrary code.

Siemens has released an update for Solid Edge SE2023 and recommends to update to the latest version.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

Solid Edge SE2023:
All versions < V223.0 Update 7

Update to V223.0 Update 7 or later version
https://support.sw.siemens.com/
See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Avoid to open untrusted ﬁles from unknown sources in Solid Edge

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Solid Edge is a portfolio of software tools that addresses various product development processes: 3D
design, simulation, manufacturing and design management.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-39181
