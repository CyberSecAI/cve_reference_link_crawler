- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated structure. This occurs during the parsing of specially crafted DFT files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could result in complete compromise of the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a specially crafted DFT file that, when opened by the vulnerable application, triggers the out-of-bounds read.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious DFT file with the affected Solid Edge application. The attacker does not need prior access to the system or the application, only the ability to deliver the malicious file to the user.
