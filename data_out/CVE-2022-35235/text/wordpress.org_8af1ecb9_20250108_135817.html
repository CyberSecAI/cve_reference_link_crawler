## Description

**WPIDE** is an Advanced **File Manager** and **Code Editor** plugin for WordPress that you can use completely for free.

The Code Editor lets you edit any file within your wp-content folder, not just plugins and themes.

The included **code completion** will help you remember your WordPress/PHP commands providing function reference along the way. Edit multiple files with the tabbed editor.

The File Manager lets you copy, move, duplicate, create archives, download, upload, edit, delete, preview files & directories **without FTP or cPanel access**.

WPIDE uses a **very modern, clean and easy to use interface** to make managing and editing your files a breeze! It comes with 6 different themes and a dark mode to reduce blue light exposure.

**Did you know?**

More than [700,000 WordPress websites](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2020/09/millions-of-sites-targeted-in-file-manager-vulnerability-attacks/) were attacked during September 2020.

Malicious bots are looking to exploit vulnerable versions of WP file manager plugins.

Fortunately, WPIDE is built with **security in mind** and comes with this vulnerability **fixed**! So rest assured! WPIDE poses no risk to you!

  File Recovery Wizard

## Installation

1. Upload the WPIDE folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‚ÄòPlugins‚Äô menu in WordPress
3. Access WPIDE by clicking the WPIDE menu item in your main administration menu

## FAQ

### What is in place to stop me from breaking my website ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe white screen of death‚Äù

When you edit a PHP file, before that file is saved to the filesystem it is syntax checked to make sure there isn‚Äôt something obvious that will break your site.

Every file that you edit is backed up before your first save to the filesystem and then on subsequent saves WPIDE will try and make a backup. It will save a maximum of files for up to 5 days to the server.

As you edit or more specifically save PHP files, in case of a fatal error, the File recovery Wizard will appear and a restore button will display which will allow you to restore the most recent backup.

If your WordPress install is fully functional then you can use the file manager to browse all of your backed up files (/upload/wpide/backups/), if your WordPress install isn‚Äôt responding then restoring the file directly via FTP/SSH is the only way.

The backed up PHP files cannot be accessed/restored from the web directly without the 40 digit nonce/key so should not pose a security concern.

### Can I override the default file permissions when creating files/directories on the local filesystem

Yes you can use the below WordPress settings in wp-config.php which will affect files created with WPIDE and files added during the WordPress upgrade process.

define(‚ÄòFS\_CHMOD\_DIR‚Äô, (0755 & ~ umask()));

define(‚ÄòFS\_CHMOD\_FILE‚Äô, (0644 & ~ umask()));

### I get an error notification on the bottom right saying ‚Äòsomething went wrong, unknown error‚Äô. How can I fix this ?

Some hosts might disable direct access to PHP files which will block the plugin from accessing them.

Some users reported this issue on **Cloudways**, and they were able to fix it by enabling **Direct PHP File Access** under application settings within Cloudways dashboard.

This option might be available on other hosting platforms as well.

Espa√±ol ‚ÄìComo desarrollador, es un complemento indispensable. Super√≥ todas mis espectativas como Administrador de Archivos, al igual con el editor de c√≥digo integrado que es hermoso y eficiente. La posibilidad de recuperar archivos permiti√≥ (en alguna ocasi√≥n) que no se rompiera el sitio.
Solo tengo mis apreciaciones con respecto a la b√∫squeda de texto ‚ÄúSearch within this folder‚Äù, que deber√≠a tener un bot√≥n ‚ÄúBuscar ahora‚Äù en vez de realizar la busqueda inmediatamente, o por lo menos configurable. Adem√°s, comparado con otro plugin de b√∫squeda de texto en c√≥digo, esta es muy lenta; quiz√°s sea porque busca en todos los archivos sin discriminaci√≥n.
Vengo a bajar 2 estrellas, luego de encontrar que no tiene acceso a los archivos del core si no pagas‚Ä¶ me ha descepcionado.
English‚ÄìAs a developer, it is an indispensable add-on. It exceeded all my expectations as a File Manager, as well as the integrated code editor which is beautiful and efficient. The ability to recover files made it possible (on occasion) not to break the site.
I only have my appreciations regarding the text search ‚ÄúSearch within this folder‚Äù, which should have a ‚ÄúSearch now‚Äù button instead of performing the search immediately, or at least configurable. Also, compared to other text search plugin in code, this one is very slow; maybe it‚Äôs because it searches in all files without discrimination.
I come to lower 2 stars, after finding that it doesn‚Äôt have access to the core files if you don‚Äôt pay‚Ä¶ it has disappointed me.

It‚Äôs been awesome to not have to bounce back-and-forth between FTP‚Äôs somewhat unreliable upload speeds and my browser, particularly for integrating GSAP animation code.
