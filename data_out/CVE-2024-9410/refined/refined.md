The provided content is related to CVE-2024-9410.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A misconfiguration in Ada.cx's Sentry integration allowed for blind server-side request forgeries (SSRF). Sentry's automatic data scraping feature was enabled, triggering requests to user-controlled endpoints when a "filename" was included in "stacktrace" fields submitted to Sentry's error tracking endpoints.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The Sentry configuration allowed an attacker to cause the server to make requests to arbitrary URLs. The vulnerability is considered "blind" as the attacker does not receive any response from the serverâ€™s request directly.
- **Misconfigured Sentry:** The root cause is the improper configuration of the Sentry monitoring tool, specifically the automatic data scraping feature.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker could make requests from Ada.cx's infrastructure to internal or external endpoints.
- This could potentially be leveraged to probe internal resources or exfiltrate information, depending on network configurations and accessible services.
- The impact is limited because the attacker has no direct control over the request parameters beyond the URL and cannot see the response from the forged requests.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can utilize Ada.cx's Sentry key to submit requests to Sentry's "store" endpoint.
- The malicious request contains a crafted "stacktrace" field with a "filename" that points to an attacker-controlled endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to know the Sentry key of Ada.cx.
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to Ada's Sentry instance.
