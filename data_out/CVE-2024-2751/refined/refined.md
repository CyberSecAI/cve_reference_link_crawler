### Summary of Vulnerability Information for CVE-2024-2751
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Improper input sanitization and output escaping of the `exad_infobox_animating_mask_style` parameter within the "Exclusive Addons for Elementor" plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be stored within the WordPress database. This code is then executed when other users view the affected page.
- Insufficient input sanitization. The plugin does not adequately clean the `exad_infobox_animating_mask_style` parameter to prevent the insertion of malicious code.
- Insufficient output escaping. The plugin does not properly encode the output of the `exad_infobox_animating_mask_style` parameter when displaying the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages of a WordPress site.
- When a user views a page containing the injected script, the malicious code is executed within their browser, which can lead to various consequences such as:
  - Stealing user session cookies
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Defacing website content
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `exad_infobox_animating_mask_style` parameter, which is user-controlled input.
- Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the parameter, which is then stored in the database and executed when other users visit the affected page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated with Contributor access or higher to be able to edit the content where the malicious code is injected.
- No user interaction other than visiting the affected page is required to trigger the exploit, which makes it an attractive target for attackers.
- The attacker does not require any elevated privileges in addition to contributor permissions.
