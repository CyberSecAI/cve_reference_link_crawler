- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "Name Directory" lacks CSRF protection when importing names. Additionally, it does not sanitize or escape some of the imported data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
  - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to missing sanitization and escaping.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability to trick a logged-in administrator into importing names containing malicious XSS payloads. When the imported data is displayed, the XSS payloads will execute, potentially allowing the attacker to perform malicious actions in the context of the administrator's session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in administrator, imports a CSV file containing XSS payloads. The attack is performed by exploiting the missing CSRF protection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into submitting a malicious import request. This could be done through social engineering or by other means that can force the victim to trigger the crafted request.
