- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the Everest Forms plugin. This lack of proper access control allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken access control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated user can execute higher-privileged actions. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted request to a vulnerable function, bypassing the required authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the WordPress website, and does not require authentication.
