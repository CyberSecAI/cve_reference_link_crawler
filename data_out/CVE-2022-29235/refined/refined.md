Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29235:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control when sharing external video information within a BigBlueButton meeting. Specifically, the application was not verifying if a user requesting video data was actually a participant in the meeting.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Leakage: The system exposes information about external videos (current timestamp and play/pause status) to unauthorized users.
- Missing Access Control: The application fails to verify if the user requesting information about shared external videos is a participant in the corresponding meeting.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker who has knowledge of the meeting identifier can gain access to sensitive information about externally shared videos. This includes the current playback timestamp and whether the video is playing or paused. This could be used to gain insights into the meeting without actually being a participant.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves an unauthorized user gaining access to the meeting identifier.
- Subsequently, by crafting malicious requests to the server, the attacker could retrieve information about external videos shared within the meeting.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to know the meeting identifier to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not need to be a participant in the meeting to retrieve video information.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability was addressed in BigBlueButton versions 2.3.18 and 2.4-rc-6 and higher by ensuring that video data is only shared with actual participants in the meeting.
- The fixes were implemented in pull requests [#13788](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/13788) and [#14265](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/14265).
- There is no known workaround for this issue.
- The vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed by Nico Heitmann, Sven Hebrok, and Juraj Somorovsky from Paderborn University.
