Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization when modifying the library name in the general settings section of the backend homepage of YXBOOKCMS. This allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code is saved (stored) within the application's database. Because the modified library name becomes the website title, the injected JavaScript is executed whenever the page is loaded.
    * **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user input before storing it, allowing for the injection of harmful scripts.

* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    * **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser.
    * **Information Theft:**  Attackers can potentially steal sensitive user information (like session cookies), leading to account hijacking.
    * **Website Manipulation:** Malicious scripts can redirect users to malicious sites, change the website's content, or perform other harmful actions within the browser.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Backend Settings Panel:** The attack vector is through the backend administration panel of the YXBOOKCMS software. Specifically, the "general settings" section.
    * **Malicious Input:**  The attacker crafts malicious JavaScript code and inserts it as the library name.

* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * **Authenticated Backend Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative or privileged access to the backend of the YXBOOKCMS application to modify the library name.

**Summary**
The vulnerability is a stored XSS in YXBOOKCMS version 1.0.2. It occurs because the application fails to sanitize input when modifying the website's library name in the backend settings. This allows an authenticated attacker to inject malicious JavaScript, leading to arbitrary code execution in the browsers of users who visit the website.
