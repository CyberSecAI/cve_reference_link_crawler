### Description

The LadiApp plugn for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the init\_endpoint() function hooked via 'init' in versions up to, and including, 4.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify a variety of settings. An attacker can directly modify the 'ladipage\_key' which enables them to create new posts on the website and inject malicious web scripts.
