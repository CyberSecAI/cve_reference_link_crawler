Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The commit `7d23b17cdbbefcd2e7b5c3150f0b5ec908dc835f` in the `apache/answer` repository introduces a fix to prevent spaces in user passwords. The root cause was the lack of input validation that allowed passwords to include spaces.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The system previously did not validate user-supplied passwords for spaces. This allowed users to create passwords that included spaces, potentially causing issues with password storage, retrieval or other system functionalities, even though not explicitly stated in this commit.
- **Potential for Bypass:**  Without validation, an attacker could potentially exploit the space character to bypass security checks or introduce vulnerabilities within the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unintended Behavior:** Allowing spaces in passwords could lead to unexpected behavior and inconsistencies in how passwords are handled within the application.
- **Security Issues:** Although not clearly described, it might lead to bypass of some security mechanisms or other vulnerabilities due to unexpected character being part of a password.
- **Data Integrity Issues**: Storing/processing passwords containing spaces might lead to data integrity issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Input:** An attacker could create a user account or modify an existing password to include spaces during the registration, password change, or reset processes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User or Account Creation:** The attacker needs to be in a position where they can input a password. This might be during registration or password modification/reset.

**Additional Details:**
- The commit modifies the `pkg/checker/password.go` file to include a check that returns an error if a password contains spaces. It also updates i18n files (`en_US.yaml`, `zh_CN.yaml`) to add an error message related to spaces in passwords.
- The changes in `internal/schema/user_schema.go` remove the old password strength check and only use the new `CheckPassword` function.
- The commit does not provide any information on past exploitation or if this was a result of an active exploitation.
- The commit message `fix(password): password can't contains space` clearly states the fix.
