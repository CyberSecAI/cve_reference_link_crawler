- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a buffer during the handling of DNS names.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution in the context of root.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-adjacent attackers can exploit the vulnerability if the device is configured to use the Comexe DDNS service. Authentication is not required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be network-adjacent to the vulnerable device, and the device must have the Comexe DDNS service configured.
