### Description

The 10WebAnalytics plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the create\_csv\_file() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create a CSV file via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
