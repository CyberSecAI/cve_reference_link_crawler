        "owasp.org_3377b5af_20250111_061039.html": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of XSS vulnerabilities is the inclusion of untrusted data in dynamic content sent to a web user without proper validation or encoding.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Lack of input validation",
        "Lack of output encoding"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser, potentially leading to: session hijacking (stealing cookies, session tokens), data theft, redirecting to malicious content, performing malicious operations on the user's machine, modifying website content, and other severe problems.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Reflected XSS: Malicious script is injected through a web request and reflected back in the HTTP response (e.g., error messages, search results).",
        "Stored XSS: Malicious script is permanently stored on the target server (e.g., database, message forums) and retrieved by users.",
		"Blind XSS: Malicious payload saved on the server and reflected back to the victim from the backend application.",
        "DOM-based XSS: Malicious script is injected via the DOM, manipulating the client-side code."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the application through untrusted sources. This can include crafting malicious URLs, submitting specially crafted forms or data, or injecting code into data stores."
    },
        "portswigger.net_cfd4e9c6_20250111_061039.html": {
      "root_cause": "Stored XSS occurs when an application receives data from an untrusted source and includes that data within its later HTTP responses in an unsafe way.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Inadequate input validation",
        "Failure to properly encode output"
      ],
      "impact": "Full compromise of the victim user, since the attacker can control script execution in the victim's browser. Actions can include session hijacking, data theft, and any other action possible via reflected XSS but can be self-contained within the application.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Data is submitted through various entry points and later emitted at an 'exit point', including URL parameters, message body, URL path, HTTP headers, and out-of-band routes.",
        "Attackers inject malicious scripts into application storage (e.g., databases, comment fields) which is then served to other users."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to submit data to the application and the vulnerability to persist across different requests. The attacker does not need to induce users to make a specific request."
