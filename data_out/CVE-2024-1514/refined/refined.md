- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient escaping of the user-supplied `cart_contents` parameter and lack of sufficient preparation of the SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Unauthenticated attackers can append additional SQL queries to existing queries, allowing them to extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The `cart_contents` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
