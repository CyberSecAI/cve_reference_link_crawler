According to npm, [`1.0.1` has more downloads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json5?activeTab=versions) so it makes sense to backport it.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@jordanbtucker](https://github.com/jordanbtucker) heads up that if this is failing on node 4, publishing this will be a breaking change for eslint-plugin-import.  (However, if it's just rollup breaking in node 4, then it should work fine, and a good fix for CI would be doing the build in one stage on latest node, and the tests in all the nodes on another stage) |
