Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `SEMCMS_Menu.php` file, specifically line 66, where the `$_GET["ID"]` parameter is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct inclusion of user-supplied input (`$_GET["ID"]`) into an SQL query.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** While the `test_input` function and `inject_check_sql` function attempts to sanitize input, it fails to prevent SQL injection using techniques like `REGEXP`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database by manipulating the SQL query.
- **Data Manipulation:** With a successful injection, attackers could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- **Database takeover:** A successful SQL injection may lead to complete control over the database

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `ID` parameter in the HTTP GET request to `xcR45q_Admin/SEMCMS_Menu.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker needs to understand how to craft SQL injection payloads that bypass existing filtering mechanisms.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit leverages the `REGEXP` operator to perform a blind SQL injection, bypassing the basic filters.
- The exploit uses `length(database())` to determine the length of the database name, then uses `char()` to compare against the ASCII value of each character in the database name.
- The specific payload `-1%20or%20length(database())%20REGEXP%20char(94,53,36)` is used to check if the length of the database name is 5 characters. The numbers 94, 53 and 36 are the decimal ASCII representation of ^, 5 and $ respectively, used for regex matching.
