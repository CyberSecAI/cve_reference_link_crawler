Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The commit diff shows a change in the `api_user.php` file within the Microweber project. Specifically, the `api_expose('users/search_authors', ...)` function was changed to `api_expose_admin('users/search_authors', ...)` This indicates that the `users/search_authors` API endpoint was made accessible only to admin users, whereas it was previously available to all users

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `users/search_authors` API endpoint was previously accessible to any user, possibly leading to information disclosure.
The change to `api_expose_admin` indicates that the previous exposure was a bug.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of exploiting the vulnerability would likely be information disclosure.  Potentially, an unauthenticated or non-admin user could access the `search_authors` endpoint and obtain a list of authors.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `users/search_authors` API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to be able to access the `users/search_authors` API endpoint which was publicly available. They do not need to be logged in or an admin. After the change to `api_expose_admin` the attacker would need to have administrator privileges to access the same information.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit message "search_authors only admins" reinforces that the vulnerability was related to this endpoint being exposed to non-admin users.
*   This commit aims to fix the issue by restricting access to only admin users.

This analysis provides more detail than a generic CVE description would typically contain, giving context to the fix and the original vulnerability.
