Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-36420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in Polipo's handling of the `Range` header in HTTP requests. Specifically, Polipo doesn't properly validate the `Range` header and fails to reject malformed headers which can cause a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Validation:** Polipo lacks proper validation of the `Range` header, specifically when the specified byte range is invalid (e.g., `bytes=3-2`).
- **Assertion Failure:** Instead of gracefully handling the invalid header, Polipo triggers an assertion failure due to the invalid byte range. This assertion failure leads to program termination.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request with a malformed `Range` header to cause Polipo to crash, leading to a denial of service for users relying on the proxy.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector involves sending a malicious HTTP request to the Polipo proxy server.
- **Malformed `Range` Header:** The malicious request includes a `Range` header with an invalid byte range (e.g., `bytes=3-2`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Polipo proxy server.
- **HTTP Request Sending Ability:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests, including crafting custom headers.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content indicates that the project is no longer maintained by its original author.
- Gentoo has masked the package due to this vulnerability and other issues including another potential heap buffer overflow that was discovered after applying a fix for CVE-2020-36420.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a request with a header such as `Range: bytes=3-2`.
- The original report included a Perl script to demonstrate the vulnerability.
