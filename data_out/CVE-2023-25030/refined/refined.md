- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, which allows unprivileged users to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unprivileged users can execute higher privileged actions. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by using a function without proper authorization, authentication or nonce token check, leading to the execution of a higher privileged action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A subscriber-level account is required to exploit the vulnerability.
