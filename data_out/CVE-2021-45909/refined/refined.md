Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-45909

**Root Cause:** Heap-based buffer overflow in the `DecodeLZW` function within the `gif2apng` tool.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The `DecodeLZW` function writes data to a buffer allocated with `malloc`, but it doesn't validate the size of the data written against the allocated buffer's size.
*  The size of the allocated buffer is initially calculated based on an image size value (`imagesize * 2`), however, this `imagesize` variable is later overwritten, so the `DecodeLZW` function doesn't have access to the actual allocated buffer size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can cause a heap-based buffer overflow, leading to memory corruption.
*   The overflow allows writing an arbitrary number of arbitrary bytes to the heap, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   The provided PoC demonstrates this by corrupting the heap, resulting in the program aborting with `malloc(): corrupted top size`.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is a maliciously crafted GIF image file.
*   By providing a GIF with specific data, an attacker can trigger the overflow in the `DecodeLZW` function.
*   The `gif2apng` tool processes the crafted GIF file which triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted GIF file to be processed by the `gif2apng` tool.
*   No special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is in the `gif2apng.cpp` file, specifically in the `DecodeLZW` function.
*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) Python script demonstrates how to create a malicious GIF file to trigger the overflow, writing 10000 "A"s into a buffer of size 512, leading to memory corruption.
*   The fix involves passing the allocated buffer size to the `DecodeLZW` function and adding checks to ensure the writes don't overflow the buffer.
*   The initial size is calculated with `buffer_size = imagesize * 2;`, and `imagesize` is overwritten at some point leading to the bug.

**Additional Notes:**
* The severity of this vulnerability was initially labeled as "important" and later upgraded to "grave."
*  The issue has been fixed in versions 1.9+srconly-2+deb10u1 and 1.9+srconly-3+deb11u1.
* Multiple CVEs (CVE-2021-45909, CVE-2021-45910 and CVE-2021-45911) were addressed in the same fix.
