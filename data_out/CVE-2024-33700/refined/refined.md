- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The device's FTP functionality does not properly handle receiving new input before it has finished processing the previous command and sending the corresponding response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation within the FTP service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a series of malformed FTP commands, leading to device reboots and service disruption.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a sequence of FTP commands or any characters terminated by "\r\n" in quick succession to the FTP service on port 21.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device's FTP port. No authentication is required.
