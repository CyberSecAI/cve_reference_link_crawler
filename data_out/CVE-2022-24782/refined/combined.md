### @martin-brennan **[martin-brennan](/martin-brennan)** commented [Mar 24, 2022](#issue-1179018623)

In some of the user's own activity export data,

we sometimes showed a secure category's name or

exposed the existence of a secure category.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Secure category names leaked via user activity export

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

stable <= 2.8.2; beta <= 2.9.0.beta3; tests-passed <= 2.9.0.beta3

## Patched versions

## Description

### Impact

Users can request an export of their own activity. Sometimes, due to category settings, they may have category membership for a secure category, and we are showing the name of this secure category to the user in the export. The same thing occurs when the user's post has been moved to a secure category.

### Patches

This issue is patched in the latest versions of Discourse.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-24782

### Weaknesses

[CWE-202](/advisories?query=cwe%3A202)
