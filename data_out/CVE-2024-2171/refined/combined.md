|  |  | This is a patch release aiming to solve a dependency problem which was brought in with the new rate |
|  |  | limiting functionality. With 0.56.1 you no longer need `starlette` to run client code or to |
|  |  | run ZenML CLI commands. |
|  |  | This release replaces 0.56.0 and 0.56.1, and fixes the major migration bugs that were in |
|  |  | that yanked release. Please upgrade directly to 0.56.2 and avoid upgrading to |
|  |  | 0.56.0 to avoid unexpected migration issues. |
