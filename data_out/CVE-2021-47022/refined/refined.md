Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2021-47022.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A memory leak occurs in the `mt7615_unregister_device` function in the Mediatek mt76 driver. The `mt7615_tx_token_put()` function, which is responsible for releasing allocated resources (tokens), is called *after* `mt7615_dma_cleanup()` and `mt76_free_pending_txwi()`. This causes the system to try and free memory that has already been released, resulting in a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a memory leak due to an incorrect order of operations during device unregistration. The tokens were not released in a timely manner.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of the memory leak is resource exhaustion, which can lead to system instability or denial of service. If the leak occurs repeatedly during device unregistration, it will deplete available memory.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is device unregistration. This could occur when the wireless interface is disabled or when the driver is unloaded.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker with the ability to trigger the unregistration of the mt7615 device, such as by disabling or unloading the wifi driver, can exploit this vulnerability.
