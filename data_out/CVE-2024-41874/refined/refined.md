Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability arises from insecure deserialization of Wddx data. This means the application processes data that has been converted from a serialized format (Wddx) back into objects without proper validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code through crafted Wddx data.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by sending specially crafted Wddx data.

**Attack Vectors:** Network-based attacks. The attacker sends a malicious Wddx data to the affected server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No special privileges or authentication are required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to send crafted data to the server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bulletin provides a JVM flag (`-Djdk.serialFilter`) to mitigate the vulnerability on JEE installations by restricting deserialization of specific classes.
*   Adobe recommends applying security configuration settings and reviewing lockdown guides for further hardening.
*   The vulnerability affects ColdFusion 2023 (Update 9 and earlier) and ColdFusion 2021 (Update 15 and earlier).
*   The vulnerability is rated as critical with a CVSS base score of 9.8.
