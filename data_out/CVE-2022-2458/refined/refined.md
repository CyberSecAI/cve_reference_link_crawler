  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a weakly configured XML parser in Business Central that processes XML input containing references to external entities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "XML External Entity Injection (XXE)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can interfere with the application's processing of XML data, potentially leading to the embedding of incorrect documents into the output. Specifically, the XXE vulnerability can result in External Service interaction and Internal file read within Business Central and Kie-Server APIs.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the processing of maliciously crafted XML documents that contain references to external entities.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide XML input to the vulnerable application.  The specific requirements are not given in terms of authentication or other pre-conditions, but the attacker needs to be able to submit the malicious XML."
