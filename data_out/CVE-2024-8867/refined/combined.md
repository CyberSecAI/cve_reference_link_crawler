# Stored Cross Site Scripting(XSS) Vulnerability in Perfex CRM

December 6, 2024

December 6, 2024September 13, 2024 by [Bytium Team](https://bytium.com/author/bytium-team/ "View all posts by Bytium Team")

A stored Cross-Site Scripting(XSS) vulnerability was identified in Perfex CRM 3.1.6 for open ticket functionality. The vulnerability allows an authenticated(any privilege) attacker to inject malicious Javascript into the ticket submission form. The payload is stored on the server and executed when any other users, including the administrator, view the submitted ticket.

**Affected Product:** Perfex CRM
**Affected Version:** 3.1.6
**Discovered By:** Jobyer Ahmed
**CVE:** [CVE-2024-8867](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8867)

## Vendor Response

The vendor has provided a temporary fix for the issue in the `Clients.php` file. The official patch will be included in the next release. The fix involves replacing the following lines:

```
// In application/controllers/Clients.php, replace:
'message' => $data['message'],

// With:
'message' => $this->input->post('message', false),

// This change should be made in two places within the file.

```
## Proof of Concept

A malicious actor can inject the below payload into the `message` field of the ticket form:

```
<body onload=alert("Vulnerable")>
```

If any user or admin views the submitted ticket, it will trigger an alert demonstrating the Stored XSS vulnerability

## **Steps to Reproduce**

1. Navigate to the **open ticket** form on the Perfex CRM client portal.
2. Submit the form, injecting the following payload into the `message` parameter:`<body onload=alert("Vulnerable")>`
3. The payload is successfully stored in the system.
4. When an admin or any user views the ticket, the malicious script is executed in the victim’s browser.

## Impact

Stored XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious scripts stored on the server and executed in the browser of any user viewing the injected content. In this case, an attacker could exploit this flaw to:

* Steal session cookies.
* Perform unauthorized actions on behalf of users.
* Redirect users to malicious sites.
* Execute any JavaScript in the context of the affected user.

## Mitigation

The **developer team** has been notified about the vulnerability. The developer confirmed the problem and provided a [temporary solution](#vendor-response) while an official patch awaits release.

1. Edit `Clients.php` and apply the vendor-provided fix.
2. Until an official fix, users should sanitize and validate inputs.

**Note:** Applied for CVE number after coordinating with possible concern team. This advisory is published to notify the users and as a part of the public reference for CVE.

## Timeline

* Vulnerability Discovered: 5 Sep 2024
* Vendor Notified: 8 Sep, 2024
* Vendor Response: 9 Sep, 2024
* Additional Concern Team Response: 13 Sep 2024
* Current Status: Fixed in the later version.

## Conclusion

Many custom applications require deeper analysis to discover the hidden vulnerabilities. It is always best to [perform a security assessment](https://portal.bytium.com/index.php/offerings) by an expert before taking the application live.

The vendor has acknowledged the issue and provided a temporary fix, with a patch pending in a future release. CodeCanyon, the platform hosting Perfex CRM, has also initiated their process to ensure the vulnerability is addressed. The developer and CodeCanyon have been informed of the vulnerability. The developer confirmed the issue and provided a temporary fix, while an official solution is waiting to be released. CodeCanyon also said they are actively working with the developer to make sure the problem is fixed.
