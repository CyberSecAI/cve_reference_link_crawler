Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-6970:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `Referer` header in the WP Recipe Maker plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the `Referer` header, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts that are then reflected back to the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary web scripts in the context of a vulnerable user's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Stealing sensitive information (cookies, session tokens)
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user
    *   Defacing the website

**Attack vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the `Referer` header. An attacker can craft a malicious URL that includes the malicious script within the `Referer` header.
*   The attacker then needs to trick a user into clicking on this malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Unauthenticated attacker:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
*   **Social engineering:** The attacker must trick the user into clicking the malicious link (e.g., via phishing email, malicious link on a forum or social media).

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the WP Recipe Maker plugin up to and including 9.1.0.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 9.1.1 by escaping the back\_link using `esc_url()`.
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `print.php` template file of the plugin.

In summary, CVE-2023-6970 is a reflected XSS vulnerability in the WP Recipe Maker plugin caused by insufficient sanitization of the `Referer` header. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious link that, when clicked by a user, executes arbitrary JavaScript code in their browser.
