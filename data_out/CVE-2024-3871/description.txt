The Delta Electronics DVW-W02W2-E2 devices expose a web administration interface to users. This interface implements multiple features that are affected by command injections and stack overflows vulnerabilities.
Successful exploitation of these flaws would allow remote unauthenticated attackers to gain remote code execution with elevated privileges on the affected devices.

This issue affects DVW-W02W2-E2 through version 2.5.2.
