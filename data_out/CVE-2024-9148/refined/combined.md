# Flowise Stored Cross-Site Scripting

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Flowise uses the Flowise Chat Embed JavaScript library to display Flowise chatbot on a website. Flowise Chat Embed versions prior 2.0.0 suffer from a lack of sanitization of user inputs, allowing a remote and unauthenticated user to inject malicious JavaScript and perform Stored Cross-Site scripting attacks against the vulnerable instance.

**Proof-of-Concept**

Flowise's core features include the creation of chatflow, which could be translated as the creation of a chatbot that can then be embedded in a website.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd0s_A4Dd5Tmryv1QklWjQFZJAjnCbpbs-BFD5WKrshf9Atii1ZR7U8258z6mPq3B4qdilrbdME3B9WpRrRG-2a51c0H8cI-aN3Pi77FwTj4iTVEInB4SdA8UMKdBOaf7aKnsv8m7vqVd19yysJz-1Yupc?key=nsGGHN0OgrO0jk8N1dkLkA)

When creating a flow, by starting a conversation with the bot we observed that certain HTML attributes are filtered, such as *on\** events.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeojSP2YYwNlGpIFO2gLCKEz7tiuDS_IyZ8xQEu871GmORQ_eutJZ1vb7AeOlsZGm8yH_hSEnmhALNPB8oXMQDREvae6gkdxdGVIwvUaRwPhxuNe0IuHgCJVn30pPc0snLLJ8oIEFWQFstkrfQZR2rJaQcQ?key=nsGGHN0OgrO0jk8N1dkLkA)

It is however possible to use an XSS payload without an event handler, such as :

```
<iframe src=javascript:console.log(document.domain)>
```

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXerSswjZWo934-VymoZ10tmOlgOYMAfN-Fdgl80HfvrZDR2tGq8P6a1E-xdSrp3NzMOiWKWFzuT0xVb27Z__ZYcLK_vZiNVSUweZT0nINZUHd6e0ZjUE2hclX4i-lFeBkSZvX-jTHNTB44zuZazod7q3d0m?key=nsGGHN0OgrO0jk8N1dkLkA)

As the chatbot is designed to be embedded on a website, the payload will then flow to the Flowise administration panel and being executed, allowing a random user starting a conversation with the chatbot to achieve the attack :

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcaJF6WFw9ht8_2Pv9McN8DdlS6Hk0JkbFcw3hYn1MnDXBurRZwspuedFyhdUIhguv2h4CD_tJSLgntsCagIEyJ9k786FTsrMeb1MDUkNlLKPM6POffqEFspPJXiRaAr5muyxj4ozQndE9paGe6NhDKB6jv?key=nsGGHN0OgrO0jk8N1dkLkA)

### Solution

Upgrade to Flowise 2.1.1 or later. If using Flowise Chat Embed library only, upgrade to version 2.0.0 or later.
