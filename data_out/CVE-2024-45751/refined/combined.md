Subject: CVE-2024-45751: CHAP authentication bypass in user-space Linux target
 framework (tgt) up to v1.0.92

## Summary

The user-space iSCSI target daemon of the Linux target framework (tgt)  uses an insecure
random number generator to generate CHAP authentication callenges. This results in
predictable challenges which an attacker capable of recording network traffic between
iSCSI target and initiator can abuse to bypass CHAP authentication by replaying
previous responses.

Source: <https://github.com/fujita/tgt/blob/e393a80b02b8cb90709c75f9bd91542ea3a78d58/README.md>

## Description

`tgt` supports CHAP for authenticating initiators. As defined in the [CHAP specification](<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1994#section-2>)
the target generates a random challenge and sends it to the initiator. `tgt` fails
to use a cryptographically secure random number generator for this. Instead it
simply uses the [`rand()`](<https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/srand.3.html>) call without
setting a seed using `srand()` first. Thus the default seed (equivalent to `srand(1)`) will be used.
This results in a predictable sequence of numbers being returned by subsequent
calls to `rand()`.

Note that even though `tgt` generates a random length for each challenge,
this does not affect the predictability of challenges as these lengths will
also be generated using predictable output of `rand()`.

```c
static int chap_initiator_auth_create_challenge(struct iscsi_connection *conn)
{
	char *value, *p;
	char text[CHAP_CHALLENGE_MAX * 2 + 8];
	static int chap_id;
	int i;

	[...]

	/*
	 * FIXME: does a random challenge length provide any benefits security-
	 * wise, or should we rather always use the max. allowed length of
	 * 1024 for the (unencoded) challenge?
	 */
	conn->auth.chap.challenge_size = (rand() % (CHAP_CHALLENGE_MAX / 2)) + CHAP_CHALLENGE_MAX / 2;

	conn->auth.chap.challenge = malloc(conn->auth.chap.challenge_size);
	if (!conn->auth.chap.challenge)
		return CHAP_TARGET_ERROR;

	p = text;
	strcpy(p, "0x");
	p += 2;
	for (i = 0; i < conn->auth.chap.challenge_size; i++) {
		conn->auth.chap.challenge[i] = rand();
		sprintf(p, "%.2hhx", conn->auth.chap.challenge[i]);
		p += 2;
	}
	text_key_add(conn, "CHAP_C",  text);

	return 0;
}
```

Source: <https://github.com/fujita/tgt/blob/v1.0.92/usr/iscsi/chap.c#L333>

## Impact

An attacker who is able to recording network traffic between iSCSI target
and initiator can apply a replay attack to bypass the CHAP authentication.
All the attacker has to do is wait for the server or the service to restart
and replay with a previously record CHAP session which fits into the sequence.

Having bypassed CHAP authentication, an attacker has full user privileges and
can modify the iSCSI target at will within that user privileges.

## Mitigation

We recommend replacing the pseudo-random number generator (`rand()`)  with
`getrandom()`as this will yield cryptographically secure pseudo-random numbers
fitting for CHAP challenges.

Version 1.0.93 contains this fix.

```
An issue has been found in tgt, Linux SCSI target user-space daemon and
tools. The issue was related to using rand() without proper seed,
resulting in identical sequences of challenges.
```

For Debian 11 bullseye, this problem has been fixed in version
1:1.0.80-1+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tgt packages.

### @richardweinberger **[richardweinberger](/richardweinberger)** commented [Sep 4, 2024](#issue-2505256851)

The challenge sent to the initiator is based on a poor source of randomness, it uses rand() without seeding it by srand(). So the glibc PRNG is always seeded with 1 and as a consequence the sequence of challenges is always the same.

An attacker which is able to monitor network traffic can apply a replay attack to bypass the CHAP authentication. All the attacker has to do is waiting for the server or the service to restart and replay with a previously record CHAP session which fits into the sequence.

To overcome the issue, use getrandom() to query the kernel random number generator.

Also always send a challenge of length CHAP\_CHALLENGE\_MAX, there is no benefit in sending a variable length challenge.

Sorry, something went wrong.
