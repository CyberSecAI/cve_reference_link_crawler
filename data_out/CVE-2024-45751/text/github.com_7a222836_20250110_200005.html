1. [chap: Use proper entropy source](/fujita/tgt/commit/abd8e0d987ab56013d360077202bf2aca20a42dd)
    …

   ```
   The challenge sent to the initiator is based on a poor
   source of randomness, it uses rand() without seeding it by srand().
   So the glibc PRNG is always seeded with 1 and as a consequence the
   sequence of challenges is always the same.

   An attacker which is able to monitor network traffic can apply a replay
   attack to bypass the CHAP authentication.  All the attacker has to do
   is waiting for the server or the service to restart and replay with a
   previously record CHAP session which fits into the sequence.

   To overcome the issue, use getrandom() to query the kernel random
   number generator.
   Also always send a challenge of length CHAP_CHALLENGE_MAX, there is no
   benefit in sending a variable length challenge.
