### @richardweinberger **[richardweinberger](/richardweinberger)** commented [Sep 4, 2024](#issue-2505256851)

The challenge sent to the initiator is based on a poor source of randomness, it uses rand() without seeding it by srand(). So the glibc PRNG is always seeded with 1 and as a consequence the sequence of challenges is always the same.

An attacker which is able to monitor network traffic can apply a replay attack to bypass the CHAP authentication. All the attacker has to do is waiting for the server or the service to restart and replay with a previously record CHAP session which fits into the sequence.

To overcome the issue, use getrandom() to query the kernel random number generator.

Also always send a challenge of length CHAP\_CHALLENGE\_MAX, there is no benefit in sending a variable length challenge.

Sorry, something went wrong.
