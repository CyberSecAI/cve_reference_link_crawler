Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-26140:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content clearly relates to CVE-2024-26140. It details a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability and its fix in the `yetanalytics/lrs` and `yetanalytics/lrsql` projects. The vulnerability is described in the GitHub Security Advisory GHSA-7rw2-3hhp-rc46, which is linked to CVE-2024-26140.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided data, specifically xAPI statement content, when rendering HTML in the LRS Statement Browser. This allowed for the injection of malicious HTML, including script tags.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **XSS vulnerability:**  The application fails to sanitize user-provided data, allowing for the injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript when displaying xAPI statements in the browser.
*   **Insufficient output encoding:** The application wasn't properly encoding special HTML characters, allowing injected code to be interpreted by the browser.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the Statement Browser.
*   This could potentially lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data exfiltration
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Other client-side attacks, targeting users who access the statement browser.
*   The impact is rated as moderate.

**5. Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.
*   **Malicious xAPI Statement:** The attacker needs to create a malicious xAPI statement containing crafted HTML/JavaScript.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to be able to submit/create xAPI statements which then get rendered by a user in the browser
*   **User interaction required:** A user needs to view the malicious xAPI statement in the LRS Statement Browser for the injected code to execute.

**Technical details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected versions:**
    *   `com.yetanalytics/lrs` versions prior to 1.2.17
    *   SQL LRS versions prior to 0.7.5
*   **Patched versions:**
    *   `com.yetanalytics/lrs` version 1.2.17
    *    SQL LRS version 0.7.5
*   **Code Changes:** The commit `d7f4883bc2252337d25e8bba2c7f9d172f5b0621` in the `yetanalytics/lrs` repository shows the changes made to fix the vulnerability by:
    *   Upgrading `hiccup` library
    *   Implementing functions to sanitize HTML output by escaping special characters: `< > & " '`
    *   Applying the escaping to the rendered JSON values and property keys
*   The fix was implemented in the `src/main/com/yetanalytics/lrs/pedestal/routes/statements/html/json.cljc` file, which is responsible for rendering JSON data in HTML.

In summary, CVE-2024-26140 is an XSS vulnerability in the `yetanalytics/lrs` library that could be exploited by injecting malicious code via xAPI statements. The vulnerability was addressed in versions 1.2.17 of `com.yetanalytics/lrs` and 0.7.5 of `yetanalytics/lrsql`.
