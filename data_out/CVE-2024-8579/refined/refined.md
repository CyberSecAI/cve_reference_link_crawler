{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `setWiFiRepeaterCfg` function due to insufficient bounds checking when handling the `password` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can cause a Denial of Service (DoS).",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered through the `password` parameter in the `setWiFiRepeaterCfg` function of the firmware.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable function, likely through a web interface or API of the device. Specific access requirements are not clear from the provided text, but likely involve making requests to the device with a crafted `password` parameter."
