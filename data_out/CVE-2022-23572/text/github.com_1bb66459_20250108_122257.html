# Crash when type cannot be specialized

Moderate

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-rww7-2gpw-fv6j
Feb 2, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.8.0

## Patched versions

2.5.3, 2.6.3, 2.7.1

## Description

### Impact

Under certain scenarios, TensorFlow can fail to specialize a type during [shape inference](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/framework/shape_inference.cc#L168-L174):

```
void InferenceContext::PreInputInit(
    const OpDef& op_def, const std::vector<const Tensor*>& input_tensors,
    const std::vector<ShapeHandle>& input_tensors_as_shapes) {
  const auto ret = full_type::SpecializeType(attrs_, op_def);
  DCHECK(ret.status().ok()) << "while instantiating types: " << ret.status();
  ret_types_ = ret.ValueOrDie();
  // ...
}
```

However, `DCHECK` is a no-op in production builds and an assertion failure in debug builds. In the first case execution proceeds to the `ValueOrDie` line. This results in an assertion failure as `ret` contains an error `Status`, not a value. In the second case we also get a crash due to the assertion failure.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [cb164786dc891ea11d3a900e90367c339305dc7b](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/cb164786dc891ea11d3a900e90367c339305dc7b).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow 2.6.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
