# Crash when type cannot be specialized

Moderate

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-rww7-2gpw-fv6j
Feb 2, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.8.0

## Patched versions

2.5.3, 2.6.3, 2.7.1

## Description

### Impact

Under certain scenarios, TensorFlow can fail to specialize a type during [shape inference](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/framework/shape_inference.cc#L168-L174):

```
void InferenceContext::PreInputInit(
    const OpDef& op_def, const std::vector<const Tensor*>& input_tensors,
    const std::vector<ShapeHandle>& input_tensors_as_shapes) {
  const auto ret = full_type::SpecializeType(attrs_, op_def);
  DCHECK(ret.status().ok()) << "while instantiating types: " << ret.status();
  ret_types_ = ret.ValueOrDie();
  // ...
}
```

However, `DCHECK` is a no-op in production builds and an assertion failure in debug builds. In the first case execution proceeds to the `ValueOrDie` line. This results in an assertion failure as `ret` contains an error `Status`, not a value. In the second case we also get a crash due to the assertion failure.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [cb164786dc891ea11d3a900e90367c339305dc7b](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/cb164786dc891ea11d3a900e90367c339305dc7b).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow 2.6.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

If the error case in `SpecializeType()` is reached, then we would get a crash when trying to access the value of an errorenous `StatusOr` object
