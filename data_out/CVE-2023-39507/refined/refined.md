- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "Rikunabi NEXT" Android application does not properly restrict access to its custom URL scheme functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper restriction of custom URL schemes (CWE-939). This allows the application to be directed to access arbitrary websites.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can redirect a user to a malicious website, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring user interaction (UI:R) to be successful. An attacker can induce a user to click on a specially crafted URL that, when handled by the vulnerable app, will redirect them to the attacker's chosen site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any special privileges (PR:N), and can be remote. The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking the malicious URL.
