Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-10090:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is described as "insufficient access control checks in AsynchronousChannelGroupImpl". This indicates a flaw in the way the `AsynchronousChannelGroupImpl` component of OpenJDK handles access control, potentially allowing unauthorized operations.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The core weakness is the lack of proper access control mechanisms in the `AsynchronousChannelGroupImpl`. This means that certain operations or resources within this component are not adequately protected from unauthorized access.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sandbox Bypass:** The provided information indicates that a successful exploit of this, and other related vulnerabilities, allows an untrusted Java application or applet to completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions. This could allow malicious code to execute with elevated privileges and compromise the system.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability could potentially allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, which means they could take full control of the affected system.
*   **Other Impacts (from broader advisories):** Alongside CVE-2017-10090, other vulnerabilities lead to other impacts that could potentially occur in conjunction:
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Some vulnerabilities can lead to denial of service by causing the application to use excessive CPU or memory.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Other vulnerabilities could lead to unintended information disclosure by allowing access to sensitive data.
    *   **Bypassing Jar Verification:** Some vulnerabilities could be used to bypass the standard Jar verification process.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation (via network):** The vulnerability can be triggered by a remote attacker, suggesting that the attack can occur over a network connection.
*   **Untrusted Java Application/Applet:** The primary attack vector involves exploiting the vulnerability through an untrusted Java application or applet. This implies that an attacker might be able to embed the malicious code within a seemingly benign Java application.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** An attacker would require remote network access to the target system.
*   **Ability to Deploy Untrusted Java Code:**  The attacker needs the capability to deploy and execute untrusted Java code on the target system. This could involve enticing a user to run a malicious applet on their browser, or deploying a Java application that an administrator might run, perhaps unintentionally.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability specifically resides in the `Libraries` component of OpenJDK.
*   The issue was assigned bugzilla ID 1471517 in Red Hat's tracking system, and was noted to have an upstream fix under the ID 8172465.
*   Multiple sources indicate this vulnerability is "Critical."

**Summary:**

CVE-2017-10090 represents a critical vulnerability due to a flaw in the access controls of the `AsynchronousChannelGroupImpl` within OpenJDK. By exploiting this, alongside other flaws, a remote attacker could bypass the Java sandbox, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution, denial of service, data modification or information disclosure. The attack vector involves deploying untrusted Java code, emphasizing the risk associated with running unverified applets or applications. The update for `java-1.8.0-openjdk` (RHSA-2017:1789 and RHSA-2017:2424) and `java-1.7.0-openjdk` (RHSA-2017:2481),  as well as the updates for java-1.8.0-ibm (RHSA-2017:2469)  addresses this critical vulnerability. Similarly, the updates mentioned in Debian Security Advisory DSA-3919-1 and DSA-3954-1 fixes this issue.
