{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The plugin's `wcal_preview_emails()` function lacks proper nonce validation. The code checks for the presence of a nonce but doesn't verify if it is valid or present, and only performs the verification when a nonce is actually sent in the request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can generate email preview templates by forging a request, provided they can trick a site administrator into clicking a malicious link. This can lead to unauthorized manipulation of the site's settings and/or information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a forged request that includes the parameters required by the vulnerable function, which the administrator must be tricked into submitting.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a site administrator into clicking a malicious link or performing a specific action to trigger the forged request."
