The Send PDF for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of form submissions due to a missing capability check on the hooks function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download information about contact form entries with PDFs.
