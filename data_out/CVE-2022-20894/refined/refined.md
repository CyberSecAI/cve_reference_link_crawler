- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user fields within incoming HTTP packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the web-based management interface of the affected Cisco Small Business RV series routers. These include buffer overflow (CWE-120) and command injection (CWE-77) vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote, authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by forcing the device to restart unexpectedly.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs valid administrator credentials on the affected device and network access to the web-based management interface (either through LAN or WAN if remote management is enabled).
