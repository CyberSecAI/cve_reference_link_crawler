### Summary
The provided content describes a DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the PowerPack Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress, specifically in versions up to and including 2.7.19. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the ‘pp\_animated\_gradient\_bg\_color’ parameter.

### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and output escaping when handling the ‘pp\_animated\_gradient\_bg\_color’ parameter. This allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The injected script is stored in the database and executed in the victim's browser when they access a page with the vulnerable element.

### Impact of exploitation
- **Arbitrary web script execution:** Attackers can execute malicious JavaScript code in the browsers of users who view a page containing the injected payload.
- **Potential for account takeover, data theft, or defacement:** The impact depends on the attacker's malicious code, but it could include stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.

### Attack vectors
- **Plugin settings:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the ‘pp\_animated\_gradient\_bg\_color’ parameter, likely through the plugin's settings interface.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- **Authenticated access:** Attackers need to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Ability to modify plugin settings:** Attackers must be able to access and manipulate the plugin's settings or options where the vulnerable parameter is used.

### Additional Information
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on May 29, 2024, and was discovered by Wesley (wcraft).
- The vulnerability is patched in version 2.7.20 of the plugin.
