Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-25479:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way the Realtek SD card reader driver (RtsPer.sys) handles SCSI commands, specifically `READ CAPACITY`, `READ CAPACITY16` (heap leak), and vendor-specific command `0xF0 0xA` (stack leak) through `IOCTL_SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT`.
- When these SCSI commands are processed, the driver copies data from a kernel buffer to the SRB (SCSI request block) buffer using the data length specified in the SRB.
- The driver fails to validate that the SRB buffer size is not larger than the source kernel buffer size, which allows for out-of-bounds reads from kernel memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The driver copies data into the SRB's buffer based on the size provided by the user, without ensuring that the source buffer in kernel memory is large enough, leading to reading beyond the allocated kernel buffer.
- **Lack of input validation:** The driver does not properly check the size of the data transfer buffer provided in the SRB against the actual source buffer size in kernel memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel memory disclosure:** An attacker can leak contents of kernel memory (both heap and stack) by specifying a larger data transfer length than the actual size of the source buffer. This disclosed memory can contain sensitive information, including addresses of kernel objects, potentially weakening KASLR.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **`IOCTL_SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT` control code:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted `IOCTL_SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT` control requests with a specific SCSI command (`READ CAPACITY`, `READ CAPACITY16`, or vendor command `0xF0 0xA`).
- **User-mode access:** The vulnerable driver has a permissive ACL on its device object, allowing a non-privileged user to send the crafted IOCTL requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Non-privileged user:** The attacker does not need elevated privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Ability to send IOCTL requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send IOCTL requests to the vulnerable device object of the driver.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability can leak both heap and stack memory by using different commands.
- The leaked kernel memory can be used to overcome other security mitigations like KASLR.
- The blog post provides code snippets that demonstrate how to exploit the vulnerability.
- The fix involves limiting the length of the data to copy.
