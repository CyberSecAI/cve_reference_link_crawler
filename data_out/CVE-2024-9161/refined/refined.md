### CVE-2024-9161
The provided content contains detailed information about the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-9161.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `update_metadata` function in `class-shared.php` lacks proper authorization checks, allowing unauthenticated users to make changes to metadata.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Missing authorization check in the `update_metadata` function, specifically at `/includes/rest/class-shared.php#L120`.
    - Vulnerable to metadata insertion, updating and deletion due to the missing capability checks.
    - The `only_this_plugin` function only checks if meta keys start with `rank_math_` but does not validate if the user has proper authorization to update that specific key. This makes it possible for any user to insert any `rank_math_` prefixed metadata.
    - Unauthenticated users can also delete arbitrary existing user and term metadata using `delete_metadata_by_mid` at `/includes/rest/class-shared.php#L169`.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Unauthenticated attackers can insert new and update existing metadata starting with 'rank\_math'.
    - Unauthenticated attackers can delete existing arbitrary user metadata and term metadata, potentially leading to loss of access to the administrator dashboard.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending a crafted POST request to the `rankmath/v1/updateMeta` REST API endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Unauthenticated attacker on any WordPress installation running the vulnerable plugin.
