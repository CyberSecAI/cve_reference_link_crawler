| Issue The extension exposes the Web UI instance to an unauthenticated Local File Inclusion vulnerability.  Example request:  ``` GET /infinite_image_browsing/file?path=/proc/self/environ&t=2023-05-08%2017%3A55%3A10 HTTP/1.1 Host: redacted  ```  An attacker could read the `/etc/passwd` file for example, `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/resolv.conf` to gain more information about the system.  An attacker could also read the `/proc/self/environ` variable to read the command line arguments used to execute Web UI and extract the username and password to login to the server. Fix:  * Ensure that the user is authenticated before allowing the API to be called. * Restrict the file paths and types that the browsing can access.  Next: If you can replicate, please let me know. Trying to get a CVE assigned, thanks.  If you don't plan to fix please also let me know. |

| Have you seen this document? <https://github.com/zanllp/sd-webui-infinite-image-browsing/blob/main/.env.example>  Or, have you tried making sd-webui accessible to the public （--share）and then seeing if you can still access sensitive files? |

| I found the issue when performing a security test previously. I do not have a SD Web UI set up unfortunately with the plugin correctly configured with the secret key to be able to replicate now.  Do you have an instance you can message me with so that I can replicate and test for you?  In general it did not appear that anything would stop the access to sensitive files because the Web UI I was testing was already password protected using `--gradio-auth`. The IIB key, I do not recall having tested it specifically, but it's worth verifying to see if it would bypass the control.  Thanks! |

| The design philosophy of IIB is to grant all permissions locally for easy user operation, and narrow down the allowed permissions by default when allowing public access. It switches based on different environments.  Do you have an instance you can message me with so that I can replicate and test for you?  Unfortunately, I don't use products like Colab, so I can't easily provide you with a test instance. However, if you have sd-webui installed, you just need to input any one of the following parameters, and IIB will automatically enable protection: --share, --ngork, --listen, --server-name.     [sd-webui-infinite-image-browsing/scripts/iib/tool.py](https://github.com/zanllp/sd-webui-infinite-image-browsing/blob/38a04a4b93e057d887371c6ea6ca46c513d7f37e/scripts/iib/tool.py#L244-L262)  Lines 244 to 262 in [38a04a4](/zanllp/sd-webui-infinite-image-browsing/commit/38a04a4b93e057d887371c6ea6ca46c513d7f37e)   |  | def get\_enable\_access\_control(): | | --- | --- | |  | ctrl = os.getenv("IIB\_ACCESS\_CONTROL") | |  | if ctrl == "enable": | |  | return True | |  | if ctrl == "disable": | |  | return False | |  | try: | |  | from modules.shared import cmd\_opts | |  |  | |  | return ( | |  | cmd\_opts.share or cmd\_opts.ngrok or cmd\_opts.listen or cmd\_opts.server\_name | |  | ) | |  | except: | |  | pass | |  | return False | |  |  | |  |  | |  | enable\_access\_control = get\_enable\_access\_control() | |  |  |      In general it did not appear that anything would stop the access to sensitive files because the Web UI I was testing was already password protected using --gradio-auth. The IIB key, I do not recall having tested it specifically, but it's worth verifying to see if it would bypass the control.  If you pass in "gradio-auth" in the sd-webui CLI, IIB will also require you to enter a password.

| When was the secret key added? I tested this plugin around 3 weeks ago and it did not protect the app. Thanks!  It must have been a recent addition? |

| The secret key feature was added early on. However, the requirement to add a secret key after configuring gradio-auth was enforced in pull request [#368](https://github.com/zanllp/sd-webui-infinite-image-browsing/pull/368). Perhaps you just happened to miss that particular pull request.  The security issue does exist in IIB before [#368](https://github.com/zanllp/sd-webui-infinite-image-browsing/pull/368).  In the early stages of design, I never anticipated that someone would use `--gradio-auth` without using `--share/--listen`. |
