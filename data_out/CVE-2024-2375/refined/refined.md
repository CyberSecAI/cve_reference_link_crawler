- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WPQA plugin fails to sanitize and escape user-provided input in the Slider settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape input, allowing malicious JavaScript to be stored in the database.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    - Redirecting the victim to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors**: By adding specially crafted JavaScript payloads to the "Slider height" and "Choose the background opacity" settings within the "Slider Settings" of a question.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user with at least Contributor privileges.
