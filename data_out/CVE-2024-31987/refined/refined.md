Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-31987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control when evaluating template macros within the XWiki platform. Specifically, custom skins could be created by users and contain template overrides that would be executed with programming rights regardless of the user's actual permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authorization:** The core issue is that the system does not properly check the user's privileges before executing template macros defined in custom skins. This allows users without "script" or "admin" rights to execute code with elevated privileges.
- **Template Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious code within a template override (`macros.vm`), which is then processed by the Velocity template engine.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The system doesn't sanitize or validate the content of the template overrides, allowing arbitrary code to be injected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting a malicious template override, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker, who may have limited rights, can gain full control over the XWiki instance.
- **Data Breaches:** An attacker could potentially access or modify sensitive information stored in the XWiki instance.
- **System Compromise:** The attacker could potentially compromise the entire server, leading to data loss, downtime, or further attacks on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Custom Skin Creation:** The primary attack vector is through creating custom skins and providing a malicious override for a skin template, specifically `macros.vm`.
- **Profile Editing:** The vulnerability can be exploited by users editing their profiles and adding a custom skin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** An attacker requires minimal privileges: the ability to edit any page (e.g. their own user profile).
- **Access to XWiki:** The attacker must have access to an XWiki instance that is vulnerable to the flaw.
- **Knowledge of XWiki Skin Structure:** The attacker needs to understand how to create a custom skin and provide a template override via a specific object.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in a range of XWiki versions (>= 6.4-milestone-1, < 14.10.19; >= 15.0-rc-1, < 15.5.4; >= 15.6-rc-1, < 15.10-rc-1), highlighting its widespread impact.
- Patches have been released in versions 14.10.19, 15.5.4, and 15.10-rc-1.
- The fix involves improved rights checking for template macros, ensuring that the code is executed with the appropriate privileges of the template's author.
- The severity is rated as "Critical" with a CVSS score of 10.0, reflecting the significant risk posed by this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is identified by CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).
- The commits `3d4dbb4` and `da177c3` address the issue.
