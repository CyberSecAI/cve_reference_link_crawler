- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authentication in the `POST Request Handler` component of the Private Cloud Management Platform. The application does not properly verify the identity of an actor claiming a specific identity.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-287 Improper Authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation could lead to a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is located in the `/management/api/rcx_management/global_config_query` file and is triggered by manipulating an unknown input to the `POST Request Handler`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint and manipulate the input.  The researcher's notes suggest that the attacker can bypass authentication by changing the return package to `code:1000` after entering a password.
