| A vulnerability was discovered in the Vertex AI API serving Gemini multimodal requests, allowing bypass of [VPC Service Controls](/vertex-ai/docs/general/vpc-service-controls). An attacker may be able to abuse the [`fileURI`](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.tuningJobs#FileData) parameter of the API to exfiltrate data.  **What should I do?**  No actions needed. We've implemented a fix to return an error message when a media file URL is specified in the fileUri parameter and VPC Service Controls is enabled. Other use cases are unaffected.  **What vulnerabilities are being addressed?**  The Cloud Support API serving Gemini multimodal requests lets you include media files by specifying the URL of the media file in the `fileUri` parameter. This capability can be used to bypass VPC Service Controls perimeters. An attacker inside the service perimeter could encode sensitive data in the `fileURI` parameter to bypass the service perimeter. | Medium | [CVE-2024-12236](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-12236) |

| When parsing unknown fields in the Protobuf Java Full and Lite libraries, a maliciously crafted message can cause a StackOverflow error and lead to a program crash.  **What should I do?**  We have been working diligently to address this issue and have released a mitigation that is available now. We encourage that you're using the latest versions of the following software packages:   * protobuf-java (3.25.5, 4.27.5, 4.28.2) * protobuf-javalite (3.25.5, 4.27.5, 4.28.2) * protobuf-kotlin (3.25.5, 4.27.5, 4.28.2) * protobuf-kotlin-lite (3.25.5, 4.27.5, 4.28.2) * com-protobuf [JRuby gem only] (3.25.5, 4.27.5, 4.28.2)   **What vulnerabilities are addressed by this patch?**  This vulnerability is a potential Denial of Service.  Parsing nested groups as unknown fields with DiscardUnknownFieldsParser or Java Protobuf Lite parser, or against Protobuf map fields, creates unbounded recursions that can be abused by an attacker. | CVSS4.0 score 8.7  High | [CVE-2024-7254](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7254) |

| **2024-07-16 Updates:**  Some Serverless VPC Access customers are potentially impacted by a vulnerability in OpenSSH (CVE-2024-6387). In the case of successful exploit, this could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code as root on the target virtual machine. Exploitation is believed to be difficult. For example, customers can't access the VMs and the VMs don't have public IPs. We are not aware of any exploitation attempts.  **What should I do?**  Serverless VPC Access deployments have been automatically updated by Google where possible. However, you should verify that the [Google-managed service agent has its required role](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-serverless-vpc-access#service_account_permissions). If not, your Serverless VPC Access connector might still be vulnerable. We recommend that you [migrate to Direct VPC egress](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/migrate-direct-vpc), or deploy a new connector and delete the old connector, to ensure that you have the required update with the fix.   ---   **2024-07-11 Update:** Added patch versions for GDC software for VMware, GKE on AWS, and GKE on Azure. For details, in the GKE documentation, see the following bulletins:  * [GDC software for VMware security bulletin](/anthos/clusters/docs/security-bulletins#gcp-2024-040-gdcvmware) * [GKE on AWS security bulletin](/anthos/clusters/docs/security-bulletins#gcp-2024-040-gkeaws) * [GKE on Azure security bulletin](/anthos/clusters/docs/security-bulletins#gcp-2024-040-gkeazure)  ---   **2024-07-10 Update:**   * Added security bulletin for Migrate to Virtual Machines.  ---   **2024-07-09 Updates:**  Some App Engine flexible environment customers are potentially impacted by a vulnerability in OpenSSH (CVE-2024-6387). In the case of successful exploit, this could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code as root on the target virtual machine.  **What should I do?**  Google has already updated flexible environment deployments automatically where possible. However some customers who [disabled the Google-managed service agent](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/service-agent#verify_the_service_agent), or made changes to the Google Cloud APIs or other default configurations, could not be updated and might still be vulnerable. You should deploy a new version of your app to pick up the update with the fix.  Please note that updated deployments will report ssh version `OpenSSH_9.6p1`. This version has been patched with a fix for CVE-2024-6387.  **What vulnerabilities are being addressed?**  The vulnerability CVE-2024-6387, which allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code as root on the target machine.   ---   **2024-07-08 Updates:**  Dataproc clusters on Google Compute Engine running on image version 2.2 (all operating systems) and 2.1 (Debian only) are impacted by a vulnerability in OpenSSH (CVE-2024-6387) which in case of successful exploit could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code as root on the target machine.  Dataproc on Google Compute Engine image versions 2.0 and 1.5, as well as Dataproc images version 2.1 not running on Debian, are not impacted. Dataproc clusters with Personal Authentication enabled are not impacted. Dataproc Serverless is also not impacted.  **What should I do?**  Please update your Dataproc clusters on Google Compute Engine to one the following versions:  * 2.2.24 or later * 2.1.58 or later  In case you are not able to update your Dataproc clusters to one of the versions above, we recommend using the initialization action available at this location: `gs://dataproc-initialization-actions/hotfixes/openssh-CVE-2024-6387-mitigation.sh`  Please follow these instructions on how to [specify initialization actions for Dataproc](/dataproc/docs/concepts/configuring-clusters/init-actions). Please note that the initialization action has to be run on every node (masters and workers) for pre-existing clusters.   ---   **2024-07-03 Updates:**   * Added patch versions for GKE. * Added security bulletin for GDC   connected.  ---   **2024-07-02 Updates:**   * Clarified that Autopilot clusters are impacted and   will require user action. * Added impact assessments and mitigation steps for   GDC software for VMware, GKE on AWS, and GKE on Azure. * Corrected the GDC software for bare metal security bulletin to clarify that GDC software for bare metal isn't directly   affected and that customers should check with OS vendors for patches.   --- | Critical | [CVE-2024-6387](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-6387) |

| Looker fixed vulnerabilities reported by an external researcher via the Google and Alphabet Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) program, but found no evidence of exploitation. These issues are now resolved and no user action is required for Looker-hosted customers on Looker (Google Cloud core) and Looker (original). Self-hosted Looker instances are advised to update to the latest supported version.  **What should I do?**  **Looker-hosted instances: Looker (Google Cloud core) and Looker (original) instances** No customer action is required.  **Self-hosted Looker instances only**  If your Looker instance is self-hosted, we recommend upgrading your Looker instances to one of the following [versions](/looker/docs/officially-supported-releases):   * 24.6.12+ * 24.4.27+ * 24.2.58+ * 24.0.65+ * 23.18.100+ * 23.12.105+ * 23.6.163+   **How was this fixed?**  Google disabled direct administrative access to the internal database from the Looker application, removed elevated privileges that enabled cross-tenant access, and rotated the exposed secrets. Additionally, we have patched path traversal vulnerabilities that potentially exposed service account credentials. We are also conducting a thorough review of our code and systems to identify and address any similar potential vulnerabilities. | Critical |  |

| Researchers discovered a vulnerability ([CVE-2023-48022](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48022)) in [Ray](https://www.ray.io/). Ray is a [third-party, open source tool](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) for AI workloads. Because Ray does not require authentication, threat actors can achieve remote code execution through submitting jobs to publicly exposed instances. The vulnerability has been [disputed by Anyscale](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/update-on-ray-cves-cve-2023-6019-cve-2023-6020-cve-2023-6021-cve-2023-48022-cve-2023-48023), the developer of Ray. Ray maintains its functions are an intended, core product feature, and that security must instead be implemented outside of a Ray cluster, as any unintended network exposure of the Ray cluster could lead to compromise.  Based on the response, this CVE is disputed and may not show up in vulnerability scanners. Regardless, it is being actively exploited in the wild and users should configure their usage as suggested below.  **What should I do?**  Follow Ray [best practices](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-security/index.html#best-practices) and guidelines, including running trusted code on trusted networks, in order to secure your Ray workloads. Deployment of [ray.io](http://ray.io/) in customer cloud instances falls under the model of shared responsibility.  Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) security has published a [blog](/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/securing-ray-to-run-on-google-kubernetes-engine) on hardening Ray on GKE.  For further information on ways to add authentication and authorization to Ray services, consult the [Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) documentation](/security/products/iap#documentation). GKE users can implement IAP following this [guidance](/iap/docs/enabling-kubernetes-howto) or by repurposing Terraform modules linked in the [blog](/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/securing-ray-to-run-on-google-kubernetes-engine). | High | [CVE-2023-48022](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-48022) |

| When an Apigee API Management proxy connects to a [target endpoint](https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/reference/api-proxy-configuration-reference#targetendpoint) or [target server](https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/deploy/load-balancing-across-backend-servers), the proxy does not perform hostname validation for the certificate presented by the target endpoint or target server by default. If hostname validation is not enabled using one of the following options, Apigee proxies connecting to a target endpoint or target server may be at risk for a man-in-the-middle attack by an authorized user. For more information, see [Configuring TLS from Edge to the backend (Cloud and Private Cloud)](https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/system-administration/configuring-ssl-edge-backend-service). Apigee proxy deployments on the following Apigee platforms are affected:   * Apigee Edge for Public Cloud * Apigee Edge for Private Cloud   For instructions and more details, see the [Apigee security bulletin](/apigee/docs/security-bulletins/security-bulletins#gcp-2024-006). | High |  |

| TorchServe is used to host PyTorch machine learning models for online prediction. Vertex AI provides prebuilt PyTorch model serving containers which depend on TorchServe. Vulnerabilities were recently discovered in TorchServe which would allow an attacker to take control of a TorchServe deployment if its model management API is exposed. Customers with PyTorch models deployed to Vertex AI online prediction are not affected by these vulnerabilities, since Vertex AI does not expose TorchServe's model management API. Customers using TorchServe outside of Vertex AI should take precautions to ensure their deployments are set up securely.  **What should I do?**  Vertex AI customers with deployed models using Vertex AI's [prebuilt PyTorch serving containers](/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/pre-built-containers#pytorch) do not need to take any action to address the vulnerabilities, since Vertex AI's deployments do not expose TorchServe's management server to the internet.  Customers who are using the prebuilt PyTorch containers in other contexts, or who are using a custom-built or third-party distribution of TorchServe, should do the following:   * Ensure that TorchServe's model management API is not exposed to the internet. The model management API can be restricted to local access only by ensuring that the `[management_address](https://pytorch.org/serve/configuration.html#configure-torchserve-listening-address-and-port)` is bound to `127.0.0.1`. * Use the `[allowed_urls](https://pytorch.org/serve/configuration.html#other-properties)` setting to ensure that models can be loaded from intended sources only. * Upgrade TorchServe to version 0.8.2, which includes mitigations for this issue, as soon as possible. As a precaution, Vertex AI will release fixed prebuilt containers by 2023-10-13.   **What vulnerabilities are being addressed?**  TorchServe's management API is bound to `0.0.0.0` by default in most TorchServe Docker images, including those released by Vertex AI, making it accessible to external requests. The default IP address for the management API is changed to `127.0.0.1` in TorchServe 0.8.2, mitigating this issue.  [CVE-2023-43654](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-43654) and [CVE-2022-1471](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-1471) allow a user with access to the management API to load models from arbitrary sources and remotely execute code. Mitigations for both of these issues are included in TorchServe 0.8.2: the remote code execution path is removed, and a warning is emitted if the default value for `allowed_urls` is used. | High | [CVE-2023-43654](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-43654), [CVE-2022-1471](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-1471) |

| **2024-05-29 Update**: The new feeds no longer use the shared service account, but it remains active for existing feeds to avoid service disruptions. Changes to the source in older feeds are blocked to prevent misuse of the shared service account. Customers can continue using their old feeds normally, as long as they don't change the source.  ---   Customers can configure Google Security Operations to ingest data from customer-owned Cloud Storage buckets using an ingestion feed. Until recently, Google Security Operations provided a shared service account that customers used to grant permission to the bucket. An opportunity existed such that one customer's Google Security Operations instance could be configured to ingest data from another customer's Cloud Storage bucket. After performing an impact analysis, we found no current or prior exploitation of this vulnerability. The vulnerability was present in all versions of Google Security Operations prior to Sept 19, 2023.  **What should I do?**  As of Sept 19, 2023, Google Security Operations has been updated to address this vulnerability. No customer action is required.  **What vulnerabilities are being addressed?**  Previously, Google Security Operations provided a shared service account that customers used to grant permission to a bucket. Because different customers gave the same Google Security Operations service account permission to their bucket, an exploitation vector existed that allowed one customer's feed to access a different customer's bucket when a feed was being created or modified. This exploitation vector required knowledge of the bucket URI. Now, during feed creation or modification, Google Security Operations uses unique service accounts for each customer. | High |  |

| The following CVEs expose Cloud Service Mesh to exploitable vulnerabilities:   * CVE-2023-35941: A malicious client is able to construct   credentials with permanent validity in some specific scenarios.   For example, the combination of host and expiration time in the   HMAC payload can be always valid in OAuth2 filter's HMAC check. * CVE-2023-35942: gRPC access loggers using the listener's global   scope can cause a use-after-free crash when the listener is   drained.

These will be published soon publicly as [CVE-2023-1428](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-1428), [CVE-2023-32731](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-32731) and [CVE-2023-32732](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-32732).  In April, we identified two vulnerabilities in 1.53 and 1.54 releases. One was a Denial-of-Service vulnerability within the gRPC's C++ implementation and the other was a remote data exfiltration vulnerability. These have been fixed in 1.53.1, 1.54.2 and later releases.  Previously in March, our internal teams discovered a Denial-of-Service vulnerability within the gRPC's C++ implementation while performing routine fuzzing activities. It was found in the gRPC 1.52 release, and has been fixed in the 1.52.2 and 1.53 releases. What should I do? Ensure that you're using the latest versions of the following software packages:   * grpc (C++, Python, Ruby) version 1.52, 1.53, and 1.54 need to upgrade to the following patch releases;  + 1.52.2+ 1.53.1+ 1.54.2  * grpc (C++, Python, Ruby) version 1.51 and earlier are not affected, so users with these versions can take no action  What vulnerabilities are addressed by these patches? These patches mitigate the following vulnerabilities:   * 1.53.1, 1.54.2 and later releases address the following: Denial-Of-Service vulnerability in gRPC C++ implementation. Specially crafted requests can cause a termination of connection between a proxy and a backend. Remote data exfiltration vulnerability: Desynchronisation in the HPACK table due to header size limitations can lead to proxy backends leaking header data from other clients connected to a proxy.* 1.52.2, 1.53, and later releases address the following: Denial-of-Service vulnerability within the gRPC's C++ implementation. Parsing some specifically formed requests can lead to a crash impacting a server.   We recommend upgrading to the latest versions of the following software packages as listed above. | High (CVE-2023-1428, CVE-2023-32731).

| A message parsing and memory management vulnerability in ProtocolBuffer’s C++ and Python implementations can trigger an out of memory (OOM) failure when processing a specially crafted message. This could lead to a denial of service (DoS) on services using the libraries. What should I do? Ensure that you're using the latest versions of the following software packages:   * protobuf-cpp (3.18.3, 3.19.5, 3.20.2, 3.21.6) * protobuf-python (3.18.3, 3.19.5, 3.20.2, 4.21.6)  What vulnerabilities are addressed by this patch? The patch mitigates the following vulnerability:  A specially constructed small message that causes the running service to allocate large amounts of RAM. The small size of the request means that it is easy to take advantage of the vulnerability and exhaust resources. C++ and Python systems that consume untrusted protobufs would be vulnerable to DoS attacks if they contain a `MessageSet` object in their RPC request. | Medium | [CVE-2022-1941](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-1941) |
