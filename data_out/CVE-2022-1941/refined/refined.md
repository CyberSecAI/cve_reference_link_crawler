    "summary": "The provided documents discuss CVE-2022-1941, a vulnerability in Protocol Buffers (protobuf) C++ and Python implementations that can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "A message parsing and memory management vulnerability exists in the Protocol Buffers (protobuf) C++ and Python implementations. Specifically, when parsing nested groups as unknown fields with DiscardUnknownFieldsParser or Java Protobuf Lite parser, or against Protobuf map fields, it creates unbounded recursions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of nested groups within Protobuf messages.",
        "Unbounded recursions during parsing of unknown fields, especially when using DiscardUnknownFieldsParser or Java Protobuf Lite parser.",
        "Lack of proper resource management during parsing, leading to excessive memory allocation."
      ],
      "impact": "A specially crafted message can cause excessive memory allocation, leading to an out-of-memory (OOM) condition and a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. A small payload (~500 KB) can cause the service to allocate more than 3GB of RAM, crashing it.",
       "attack_vectors": [
         "Sending a specially crafted Protobuf message with nested groups and/or unknown fields to a vulnerable service.",
         "Exploiting the parsing of MessageSet types with multiple key-value per elements, creating parsing issues and leading to DoS.",
         "Sending mixed scheme requests to bypass scheme checks in Envoy (when used in Cloud Service Mesh) which can lead to the same type of denial of service."
        ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send a specially crafted Protobuf message to a service that uses vulnerable versions of the Protobuf library.",
      "additional_info": [
          "The vulnerability affects C++ and Python Protobuf libraries.",
          "The vulnerability is triggered when parsing nested groups as unknown fields, or against Protobuf map fields.",
          "The vulnerability is also present when using DiscardUnknownFieldsParser or Java Protobuf Lite parser.",
          " Patches are available in protobuf-cpp (3.18.3, 3.19.5, 3.20.2, 3.21.6) and protobuf-python (3.18.3, 3.19.5, 3.20.2, 4.21.6).",
          "Specific unit tests have been created to identify inputs that trigger this vulnerability.",
          "NetApp has identified Spot PC as an affected product, but other NetApp products are not affected.",
          "Fedora has released an update to address this vulnerability in their protobuf package.",
          "Debian LTS has also released an update to address this vulnerability."
