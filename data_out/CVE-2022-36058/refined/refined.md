Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing function name in a `MultiESDTNFTTransfer` call when processing blocks in `elrond-go`. Specifically, the issue occurs when a transaction to a smart contract address includes a `MultiESDTNFTTransfer` call but lacks the function name after the last `@` symbol in the transaction data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of transaction data lacking a function name after the last "@" symbol in a `MultiESDTNFTTransfer` call.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If `elrond-go` is used to process blocks containing such malformed transactions, it will fail to correctly handle the transaction.
- Basic functionality like p2p messaging, storage, API requests remains unaffected
- The vulnerability does not cause a consensus issue.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By sending a crafted transaction to a smart contract address, including the `MultiESDTNFTTransfer` call, without the function name after the last "@" symbol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to create and send transactions on the MultiversX network.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a transaction with the following structure: `MultiESDTNFTTransfer@01@54444558544b4b5955532d323631626138@00@0793afc18c8da2ca@`
- The fix for this issue is included in version v1.3.34 of `elrond-go` and later
- A related integration test has been added to prevent regressions.
- The provided content includes tests that showcase the following:
   - Correct processing of asynchronous ESDT calls.
   - Handling of cases where a second smart contract refuses payment.
   - Out-of-gas scenarios during asynchronous ESDT calls.
   - Asynchronous multi-transfers on callbacks and on calls with callbacks
   - Sending NFT to contract with and without function name specified.
- The fix involved a change in `elrond-vm-common`, updating from v1.3.6 to v1.3.10
