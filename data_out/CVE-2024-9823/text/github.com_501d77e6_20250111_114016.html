## Description

### Description

There exists a security vulnerability in Jetty's DosFilter which can be exploited by unauthorized

users to cause remote denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the server using DosFilter. By repeatedly sending crafted requests,

attackers can trigger OutofMemory errors and exhaust the server's memory finally.

### Vulnerability details

The Jetty DoSFilter (Denial of Service Filter) is a security filter designed to protect web

applications against certain types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and other abusive behavior. It

helps to mitigate excessive resource consumption by limiting the rate at which clients can make

requests to the server. The DoSFilter monitors and tracks client request patterns, including

request rates, and can take actions such as blocking or delaying requests from clients that exceed

predefined thresholds. The internal tracking of requests in DoSFilter is the source of this OutOfMemory

condition.

### Impact

Users of the DoSFilter may be subject to DoS attacks that will ultimately exhaust the memory of the server if they have not configured session passivation or an aggressive session inactivation timeout.

### Patches

The `DoSFilter` has been patched in all active releases to no longer support the session tracking mode, even if configured.

Patched releases:

* 9.4.54
* 10.0.18
* 11.0.18
* 12.0.3

### Workarounds

The `DoSFilter` can be configured to not use sessions for tracking usage by setting the `trackSessions` init parameter to `false`. This will then use only the IP tracking mechanism, which is not vulnerable.

Sessions can also be configured to have aggressive passivation or inactivation limits.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
