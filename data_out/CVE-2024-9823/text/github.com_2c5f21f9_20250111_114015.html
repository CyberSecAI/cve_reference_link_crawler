### **[sbordet](/sbordet)** commented [Jan 11, 2017](#issue-200201194)

| `DoSFilter` automatically removes `RateTracker` entries that belong to type `USER_IP` or `USER_SESSION`, but not the other types.  `DoSFilter` also needs a code review because for example exposes `RateTracker` as a return type of a public method, but `RateTracker` is package private and so it's not possible to override the method. |
