Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the login functionality of the "Simple Realtime Quiz System" application. Specifically, the application does not properly handle user-supplied input for the username field when processing login requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
  - **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By injecting malicious SQL code into the username field, an attacker can manipulate the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and log in as an administrator. This is demonstrated by the provided Proof of Concept (POC) where the attacker logs in using the crafted username `admin' or '1'='1`.
  - **Data Breach (potential):** While not explicitly stated in the provided text, a successful SQL injection could, depending on the database structure and permissions, allow for retrieval, modification, or deletion of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a POST request to the `/ajax.php?action=login` endpoint.
  - **Username Field:** The malicious payload is injected through the `username` parameter within the POST request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
  - **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL (`/ajax.php?action=login`) and how to make a POST request to it.
  - **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker should have basic knowledge of SQL to formulate the malicious injection.

**Technical Details:**
  - The provided POC shows the use of `admin' or '1'='1` as the username, which leverages the nature of SQL `OR` clauses. The crafted username evaluates to true and bypasses the password check by manipulating the SQL query to always return a true condition for authentication.

In summary, this is a classic SQL injection vulnerability that allows for privilege escalation in the "Simple Realtime Quiz System" application, which allows bypassing the authentication mechanism.
