Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient input validation on the `FriendlyName` parameter of custom notification creation requests in Emby Media Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper sanitization allows low-privileged users to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript into the `FriendlyName` field of notification webhooks.
- **Insecure Token Storage:** Authentication tokens (`X-Emby-Token`) are stored in the browser's local storage rather than using HTTP-only cookies. This makes them accessible to client-side JavaScript.
- **Lack of Re-authentication:** Administrative actions are not protected by a secondary authentication mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user can gain administrator privileges on the Emby server.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting Javascript, attackers could perform malicious actions in the context of the victim's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Notification Creation:** A low-privileged user creates a custom notification with a malicious payload in the `FriendlyName` parameter.
- **Social Engineering (or waiting):** The attacker needs to get an administrator to view the malicious notification. This can be achieved by sending the admin a direct link to their notifications page where the malicious notification is listed.
- **XSS Execution:** When the administrator views the notification, the injected JavaScript executes, retrieving the administrator's token.
- **Privilege Elevation:** The malicious script makes a request to promote the attacker's user account to administrator using the administrator's token

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs a low-privileged account on the Emby server.
- The attacker needs to lure an administrator into viewing their malicious notification (either through a direct link or waiting for the administrator to check notifications).
