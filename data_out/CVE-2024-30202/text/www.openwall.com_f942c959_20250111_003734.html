Arbitrary code execution bug is neither CVE-2024-30203 nor
CVE-2024-30204, it is

CVE-2024-30202 "In Emacs before 29.3, arbitrary Lisp code is evaluated
as part of turning on Org mode. This affects Org Mode before 9.6.23."

and it is fixed by

2024-02-20 12:19:46 +0300 Ihor Radchenko: org-macro--set-templates:
Prevent code evaluation

This commit fully covers both scenarios:
- inline preview for attachments in Gnus,
- a text file (not necessary having .org suffix) opened in Emacs directly.

I hope, rare users have Org mode or TeX engine configuration allowing
execution of arbitrary shell commands during generation of LaTeX preview.

The commits mentioned by Sean suppress a kind of DoS (attempt to exhaust
disk space or inodes allocated for /tmp) through LaTeX preview for email
attachments. (There is no reasonable way to address the case when a
malicious file is opened in Emacs.)
