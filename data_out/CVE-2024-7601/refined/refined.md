- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path before using it in file operations within the HTTP API service of the Logsign Unified SecOps Platform.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path Traversal, Arbitrary File Deletion
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can delete arbitrary files on the affected Logsign Unified SecOps Platform installations, potentially leading to data loss, system instability, or denial of service. The vulnerability allows deletion of files in the context of root.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exposed through the HTTP API service, which listens on TCP port 443 by default.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, meaning they require valid user credentials for the Logsign Unified SecOps Platform. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
