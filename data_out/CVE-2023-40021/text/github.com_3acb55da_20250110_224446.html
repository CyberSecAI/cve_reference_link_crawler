Fix [GHSA-49jp-pjc3-2532](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/security/advisories/GHSA-49jp-pjc3-2532 "GHSA-49jp-pjc3-2532"): Strengthen CSRF Protections ([#18769](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/pull/18769))

```
* Strengthen CSRF Protections

Adds the following protections:
* A nonce to prevent collisions. This is best practice per OWASP.
* A constant-time comparison of expected and received tokens.
* HMAC-SHA256 instead of HMAC-MD5. Even though HMAC-MD5 is not broken
  yet, attacks against MD5 have been getting better, and there's no
  reason not to switch to SHA256.

* Fix base controller tests
```
