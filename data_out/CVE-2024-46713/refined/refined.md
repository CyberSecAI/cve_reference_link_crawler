  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient serialization of the AUX buffer in the perf subsystem.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `event->mmap_mutex` was used to serialize access to the AUX buffer, which was not sufficient.",

      "description": "Introduced a per-ring buffer mutex (`rb->aux_mutex`) to properly serialize access to the AUX buffer.",
