Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9650:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2024-9650. The Wordfence article explicitly mentions the CVE ID and describes a stored XSS vulnerability in the "WP Recipe Maker" plugin, which is the same plugin referenced in the Trac logs.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and output escaping when handling the `tooltip` parameter within the WP Recipe Maker plugin.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **DOM-based Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin takes user-provided data (the tooltip content) and renders it on the page without sufficient sanitization. This allows malicious JavaScript code to be stored in the database and executed in the victim's browser when the affected page is loaded.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit would allow an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages, leading to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Phishing attacks
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Further exploitation of the user's browser
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through the `tooltip` parameter in the plugin.
    *   An attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript code and stores it via the tooltip functionality of the plugin.
    *   When a user (including administrators) accesses the page containing the crafted tooltip, the injected JavaScript code executes.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with "Contributor" level access or higher.
    *   **Capability to insert tooltips:** The attacker needs to be able to create or edit content that uses the tooltip functionality of the WP Recipe Maker plugin.

**3. Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located within the `assets/js/public/tooltip.js` file.
*   Specifically, the `tooltip` data attribute of an element with the class `wprm-tooltip` is retrieved, and this value is used to populate the content of the tooltip.
*   While the code uses `sanitizeHtml` to sanitize the tooltip content, it appears that the sanitization is not strict enough to prevent all possible XSS attacks.
*   The vulnerable versions of the plugin are all versions up to and including 9.6.1.
*   The patched version is 9.7.0, which includes changes in the `tooltip.js` file.

**4. Additional Notes:**

*   The changeset diff of the file is not shown as it exceeds the size limit. However, the commit message and the list of modified files indicate that the fix is included in version 9.7.0.
*   The Wordfence article provides a good summary of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
*   The provided Trac source code links to the specific file where the vulnerability exists.
