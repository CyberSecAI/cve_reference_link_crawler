Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-20803:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a double-free error present in the OLE2 file parser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double-free vulnerability: This occurs when the same memory location is freed twice, which can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability could lead to a crash due to memory corruption. The provided content doesn't explicitly state remote code execution, but double-free vulnerabilities can sometimes be leveraged for this purpose.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when ClamAV parses a specially crafted OLE2 file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious OLE2 file to ClamAV for scanning. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    - Sending the malicious file as an email attachment for scanning.
    - Placing the malicious file on a file system being scanned by ClamAV.
    - Serving the malicious file through a network connection if ClamAV scans network traffic.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability affects ClamAV versions 0.104.0 through 0.104.2.
- The vulnerability was identified by OSS-Fuzz, a Google project that finds security vulnerabilities using fuzzing techniques.
- This vulnerability was fixed in ClamAV versions 0.105.0, 0.104.3, and 0.103.6.
