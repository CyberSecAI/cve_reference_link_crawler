<h3 id="Upgrading_the_driver_files">Upgrading the Driver Files</h3>

<ol>
<li>Take a back-up of the current driver configuration.</li>

<br>
<li>(Conditional) If the driver is running locally, stop the driver instance and the Identity Vault.</li>
<br>
<li>(Conditional) If the driver is running with a Remote Loader instance, stop the driver and the Remote Loader instance.</li>
<br>
<li>Download and unzip the contents of the <em>IDM_AzureAD_5140.zip</em> file to a temporary location on your computer.</li>
<br>

<li>(Conditional) To upgrade the driver files:</li><br>
<ul><li>As a root user, perform the following steps:</li>
<br>
<ol>
<li>On the server where you want apply the driver patch, log in as <em>root</em>.</li>
<br>

<li>Navigate to the extracted <em>&lt;IDM_AzureAD_5140.zip&gt;</em> directory and perform one of the following actions for your platform:</li></ol>
<br>

<ul>
<li><strong>Linux:</strong></li><br>
<ul><li>Navigate to the <em>&lt;IDM_AzureAD_5140.zip&gt;;/Linux</em> directory</li>
<li>Install the <em>netiq-DXMLRESTAzure.rpm</em> by running the following commands in a terminal window: </li>
<p><em>rpm -Uvh (patch-path)/linux/netiq-DXMLRESTAzure.rpm</em></p>
<li>(Conditonal)If the driver is running on Remote Loader, perform the above steps on the machine where Remote Loader is installed.</li>
</ul></ul><br>

<ul><li><strong>Windows:</strong></li><br>
<ul><li>If the driver is installed locally:</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Navigate to the <em>&lt;extracted IDM_AzureAD_5140.zip&gt;/Windows</em> folder.</li>
<li>Copy and replace the <em>AZDriverShim.jar</em>, <em>RestLib.jar</em>, and <em>OData.jar</em> files in the <em>C:\NetIQ\IDM\NDS\lib folder</em>.</li></br></ol type="a">
<li>If the driver is installed with Remote Loader:</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Navigate to the <em>&lt;extracted IDM_AzureAD_5140.zip&gt;/Windows</em> folder.</li>
<li>Copy and replace the <em>AZDriverShim.jar</em>, <em>RestLib.jar</em>, and <em>OData.jar</em> files in the <em>C:\NetIQ\IDM\RemoteLoader\64bit\lib</em>.</li></ol type="a">
</ul></ul><br>


<ul><li><strong>Upgrade the Windows Exchange Service:</strong></li><br>
<ul>
<li>Stop the IDMExchangeOnline service from Windows services console (services.msc).</li><br>
<li>Navigate to Windows Exchange Service in the extracted <em>&lt;IDM_AzureAD_5140.zip&gt;</em> folder and copy the <em>Microsoft.Identity.Client.dll</em>, <em>ExchServerHost.exe</em> and <em>IDMExchServer.dll</em> files to the Windows Exchange Service installation folder in your file system. For example, <em>C:\NetIQ\ExchangeServerHost</em>.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Important:</strong> To support new APIs, you must mandatorily install the Microsoft Exchange Online PowerShell V2 module (EXO V2).  For the prerequisites and  installation procedure, see <html>
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell-v2?view=exchange-ps">About the Exchange Online PowerShell V2 module</a></span>.</p></ul><br>
<li>As a non-root user, perform the following steps:</li>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Verify that <em><non-root edirectory="" location="">/rpm</em> directory exists and contains <em>_db.*</em> file.</non-root></li>

<p>The <em>_db.*</em> file is created during a non-root installation of the Identity Manager engine. The absence of this file might indicate that the Identity Manager is not installed properly. You must reinstall the Identity Manager to correctly place the file in the directory.</p>
<li>To set the root directory to the location of non-root Identity Vault, enter the following command in the command prompt:</li>

<p><em>ROOTDIR=&lt;non-root eDirectory location&gt;</em></p>

<p>This will set the environmental variables to the directory where Identity Vault is installed as a non-root user.</p>

<li>To install the driver files, enter the following command:</li>

<p>For example, to install the REST driver RPM, use this command:</p>
<p><em>rpm --dbpath $ROOTDIR/rpm -Uvh --relocate=/usr=$ROOTDIR/opt/novell/eDirectory --relocate=/etc=$ROOTDIR/etc --relocate=/opt/novell/eDirectory=$ROOTDIR/opt/novell/eDirectory --relocate=/opt/novell/dirxml=$ROOTDIR/opt/novell/dirxml --relocate=/var=$ROOTDIR/var --badreloc --nodeps --replacefiles /home/user/netiq-DXMLRESTAzure.rpm</em></p>

<p>where /opt/novell/eDirectory is the location where non-root eDirectory is installed and /home/user/ is the home directory of the non-root user. </p>
</ol>

</ul><li>(Conditional) If the driver is running locally, start the Identity Vault and the driver instance.</li>
<br>
<li>(Conditional) If the driver is running with a Remote Loader instance, start the Remote Loader instance and the driver instance.</li> </ol>
