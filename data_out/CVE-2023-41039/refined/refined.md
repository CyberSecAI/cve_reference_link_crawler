Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-41039:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Python's "format" functionality, specifically the `format` and `format_map` methods of `str` (and `unicode`) and `string.Formatter`. This functionality allows a user controlling the format string to potentially access all objects accessible through recursive attribute lookup and subscription from accessible objects, leading to information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted Access Through Format String:** The core issue is that the format string can be crafted to access arbitrary attributes and perform lookups on accessible objects.
- **Vulnerable Methods:** The `format` and `format_map` methods of `str` and `unicode`, and `string.Formatter` are vulnerable when used within the restricted environment of `RestrictedPython`.
- **Recursive Attribute Lookup and Subscription:**  The format functionality performs recursive attribute lookups and subscriptions, which, if not properly restricted, can lead to the disclosure of internal data and objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers can gain access to sensitive data and internal objects of the application via a crafted format string, potentially leading to compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Format String Injection:** The attacker needs to control the format string being passed to the vulnerable `format` or `format_map` methods. This means providing a malicious format string.
- **Vulnerable Functions:** The methods affected are `str.format`, `str.format_map`, and `string.Formatter`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Control over Format String:** The attacker must have the ability to influence the format string that will be processed by the vulnerable methods within `RestrictedPython`.
- **Application Specific:** The specific capabilities would depend on the application using `RestrictedPython` and how format strings are generated, handled and used.
- **Privileges Required:** The CVSS score indicates High privileges are required (PR:H).
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction (UI:R) according to CVSS score.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by preventing access to the `format*` methods of the `str` class and its instances and by preventing access to `string.Formatter`.
- The commit log indicates that the fix involves raising a `NotImplementedError` when attempting to use the format methods and restricting access to `string.Formatter`.
- The vulnerability affects all versions of `RestrictedPython` up to and including 5.3 and 6.1. Patched versions are 5.4 and 6.2.
