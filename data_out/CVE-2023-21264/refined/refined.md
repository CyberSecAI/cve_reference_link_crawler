{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) on ARM64 handles memory transitions initiated by the host. Previously, the `addr_is_allowed_memory()` check relied on the page table entry (PTE) to recover the target physical address. However, host stage-2 mappings are created lazily, so the PTE might not accurately reflect the actual physical address, which leads to incorrect memory access checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect physical address recovery during host-initiated memory transitions.",
        "Reliance on potentially outdated PTE for memory access checks."
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation. A malicious guest VM could potentially bypass memory protection mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to the host's memory, potentially leading to code execution with system privileges.",
     "attack_vectors": "A malicious guest VM could trigger a host-initiated memory transition that exploits the flawed address check.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a guest VM running on the vulnerable system and be able to manipulate the memory transitions to exploit the flaw. The attacker would need to have the ability to trigger the memory transition to reach the vulnerable code path."
