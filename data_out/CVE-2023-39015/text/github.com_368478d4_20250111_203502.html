### **[LetianYuan](/LetianYuan)** commented [Jul 19, 2023](#issue-1812330709)

| **Affected Version** The latest version 0.9.0 and below.  **Describe the vulnerability** there is a method, us.codecraft.webmagic.downloader.PhantomJSDownloader.download(Request, Task), designed to download a page from a request. However, passing an unchecked argument to PhantomJSDownloader constructor can lead to the execution of arbitrary commands. For instance, on Windows, new PhantomJSDownloader("cmd /c "for /l %i in (1, 1, 10) do calc"", "") would open ten calculators.  ``` PhantomJSDownloader downloader = new PhantomJSDownloader("cmd /c \"for /l %i in (1, 1, 10) do calc\"", ""); Request request = new Request(); downloader.download(request, null);  ```  **To Reproduce** Just execute above codes would reproduce it.  **Fix Suggestion** First, I strongly recommend that you can simply remove PhantomJSDownloader.java and all codes related to it in the project, because PhantomJS is no longer maintained 5 years ago, namely since Mar 4, 2018 (See [ariya/phantomjs#15344](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/15344)). Or, you can check parameter `phantomJsCommand` strictly. For example, you can write codes to check whether `phantomJsCommand` is a phantomjs executable. |
