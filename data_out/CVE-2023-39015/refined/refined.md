  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `PhantomJSDownloader` class in webmagic allows arbitrary command execution due to an unchecked argument passed to the constructor.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Code Injection",
      "Lack of input validation"
     ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary command execution on the server where the webmagic application is running.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious `phantomJsCommand` string and passing it to the `PhantomJSDownloader` constructor.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the `phantomJsCommand` parameter, for example, an attacker controlling data passed to the application through a REST API."
