- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the improper handling of entitlement values that contain leading or trailing whitespace during an access request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The impact is described as having High Confidentiality impact, Low Integrity Impact and Low Availability Impact.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated user can trigger the vulnerability when requesting access to an entitlement with leading/trailing whitespace.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user and initiate an access request. The attack requires user interaction (UI:R) and has high attack complexity (AC:H) and scope change (S:C)
