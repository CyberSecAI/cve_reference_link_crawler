- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Automation secrets were being logged in clear text within the audit log. This occurred when the automation secret of an automation user was changed via the REST API or the user interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive automation secrets in the audit log. This could be a result of insufficient sanitization of logged data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the audit log could obtain the automation secrets. This would allow them to gain unauthorized access and control to systems managed by the Checkmk monitoring tool. According to the CVSS vector, the impact is limited to "Low" confidentiality, with no impact on integrity or availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The primary attack vector is an attacker gaining access to the audit log.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be a privileged user (admin) in order to access the audit log.
