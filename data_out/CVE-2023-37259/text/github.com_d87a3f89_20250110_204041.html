# Potential for XSS in Export Chat feature

Moderate

[andybalaam](/andybalaam)
published
GHSA-c9vx-2g7w-rp65
Jul 18, 2023

## Package

npm

matrix-react-sdk
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>= 3.32.0

## Patched versions

3.76.0

## Description

### Description

The Export Chat feature includes certain attacker-controlled elements in the generated document without sufficient escaping, leading to stored XSS.

### Impact

Since the Export Chat feature generates a separate document, an attacker can only inject code run from the `null` origin, restricting the impact.

However, the attacker can still potentially use the XSS to leak message contents. A malicious homeserver is a potential attacker since the affected inputs are controllable server-side.

### Patches

This was patched in matrix-react-sdk 3.76.0.

### Workarounds

None, other than not using the Export Chat feature.

### References

N/A

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
