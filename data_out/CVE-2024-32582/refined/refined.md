**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts into the plugin's input fields, which are then reflected on the website without proper sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, meaning the vulnerability can be exploited by anyone.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability is classified as a medium severity issue with a CVSS score of 7.1.
