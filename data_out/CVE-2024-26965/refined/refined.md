Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-26965:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the missing termination of frequency table arrays in the `drivers/clk/qcom/mmcc-msm8974.c` file within the Linux kernel. These arrays are used to store clock frequencies, and functions like `qcom_find_freq()` or `qcom_find_freq_floor()` traverse these tables. Without a proper terminator (an empty element), these functions could potentially read out of bounds of the array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read issue. Due to the missing array terminator, functions traversing the frequency tables might read memory locations beyond the allocated array, leading to potential crashes or information leaks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could trigger the out-of-bounds read, which could lead to a kernel panic, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Information Leak:** In some scenarios, an out-of-bounds read might expose sensitive kernel memory to an attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered via the clock frequency lookup functions `qcom_find_freq()` and `qcom_find_freq_floor()` when accessing the malformed frequency table arrays.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker would need to be able to influence the clock subsystem and trigger these lookups to exploit the vulnerability.  
- The attacker would likely need to be in a position to control or manipulate the clock configuration or frequency requests within the system to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves adding an empty element (`{ }`) at the end of the frequency table arrays `ftbl_mmss_axi_clk` and `ftbl_ocmemnoc_clk` in `drivers/clk/qcom/mmcc-msm8974.c`. This ensures proper termination of the arrays during traversal.
- The provided commit messages and diffs explicitly mention "Only compile tested", indicating that the fix was not tested for runtime behavior.
- The Debian LTS advisory confirms that this CVE was addressed in their updates.
- Several commits across different kernel versions and branches (stable, LTS) contain the same fix, indicating a widespread impact.

In summary, CVE-2024-26965 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the Qualcomm Multimedia Clock Controller driver due to missing array terminators. It could potentially lead to a denial of service or information disclosure.
