Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-45035:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of default server certificate verification in the VATPS protocol used by Velneo. Specifically, prior to version 29.2, the client would connect to the server without verifying the server's certificate, making it susceptible to MITM attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Certificate Verification:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of mandatory certificate verification during the initial connection phase of the VATPS protocol. This allows a malicious actor to impersonate a legitimate server.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Vulnerability:** Due to the lack of certificate verification, a MITM attacker can intercept the communication between the client and the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive data transmitted between the client and server can be intercepted and read by the attacker.
- **Integrity Violation:** The attacker can modify data in transit, potentially causing data corruption or manipulating application behavior.
- **Loss of Trust:** By impersonating the server, an attacker could potentially gain further access or control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** The attacker needs to position themselves on the network path between a Velneo client and server to intercept and manipulate traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs access to the network where the Velneo client and server are communicating.
- **Interception Capability:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify network traffic in real time.
- **Technical Knowledge:** Requires knowledge of MITM attacks, networking, and potentially some understanding of the VATPS protocol.

**Mitigation:**
- **Upgrade:** Update all Velneo components to version 29.2 or later, where certificate verification is enabled by default.
- **Manual Configuration:** For versions prior to 29.2, manually configure clients to verify server certificates. This is also applicable to other components like Velneo vModApache and Velneo ODBC Driver
- **Use VATPS:** Ensure that the VATPS protocol is enabled for secure connections.
- **Domain Certificate:** Ensure the server is using a valid certificate that matches its domain, not the default test certificate.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is officially addressed in Velneo version 29.2 and later by enabling certificate domain verification by default.
- The vulnerability could be exploited by a MITM attack.
- The vendor has provided manual mitigations for older versions by configuring clients to verify certificates.
- INCIBE has published a notification: [CVE-2021-45035](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45035)
- The vendor recommends to update installations to the latest version.
