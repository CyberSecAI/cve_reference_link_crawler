| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOx Application Hosting Environment Command Injection Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-iox-8whGn5dL  First Published: 2023 February 1 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2023 June 1 15:34 GMT  Version 1.5:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCwc66882](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc66882)     CVE-2023-20076     CWE-233       CVSS Score: [Base 7.2](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2023-20076     CWE-233       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iox-8whGn5dL/csaf/cisco-sa-iox-8whGn5dL.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the Cisco IOx application hosting environment could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands as *root* on the underlying host operating system.  This vulnerability is due to incomplete sanitization of parameters that are passed in for activation of an application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by deploying and activating an application in the Cisco IOx application hosting environment with a crafted activation payload file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as *root* on the underlying host operating system.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iox-8whGn5dL>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running Cisco IOS XE Software if they have the Cisco IOx feature enabled and they do not support native docker.  This vulnerability also affects the following Cisco products, which do not support native docker, if they are running a vulnerable software release and have the Cisco IOx feature enabled:    + 800 Series Industrial ISRs   + CGR1000 Compute Modules   + IC3000 Industrial Compute Gateways (releases 1.2.1 and later run native docker)   + IR510 WPAN Industrial Routers For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  **Determine the Cisco IOS XE Software Native Docker Status**  To determine the native docker status in devices that run Cisco IOS XE Software, use the **show iox** command. If **Dockerd** is not present, the device does not support native docker and is affected by this vulnerability. If the output shows **Dockerd** running, the device supports native docker and is not affected by this vulnerability, as shown in the following example:  ```   Switch#show iox IOx Infrastructure Summary:---------------------------IOx service (CAF)              : RunningIOx service (HA)               : RunningIOx service (IOxman)           : RunningIOx service (Sec storage)      : RunningLibvirtd 5.5.0                 : RunningDockerd v19.03.13-ce   :  RunningSync Status                    : DisabledSwitch#   ```  For more information, see the [IOx Platform Support Matrix](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/iox/#!platform-support-matrix/enterprise-platforms). Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Catalyst 3650 Series Switches   + Catalyst 3850 Series Switches   + Catalyst 9100 Family of Access Points (COS-AP)   + IOS XR Software   + Meraki products   + NX-OS Software (native docker is supported in all releases)  Details  * In addition to CVE-2023-20076, Trellix Advanced Research Center researchers Sam Quinn, senior security researcher; Richard Johnson, principal security researcher; and Kasimir Schulz, security researcher, identified an unchecked tar archive extraction issue that could allow an attacker to write on the underlying host operating system as *root* on platforms that support the compression algorithm that is used in the affected code path.  Cisco confirmed that this issue exists, but no platforms support the affected compression algorithm because the code was put there for future application packaging support. This means that there is no immediate way to exploit this issue. Cisco has resolved this issue in the event that a future platform does support the compression algorithm.  This issue is documented in Cisco Bug ID [CSCwc67015](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc67015).  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  However, customers who do not want to use the Cisco IOx application hosting environment can disable IOx permanently on the device using the **no iox** configuration command.  While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
