- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incomplete sanitization of parameters passed during application activation in the Cisco IOx application hosting environment.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of input parameters, specifically in the activation payload file.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation allows a remote, authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands as `root` on the underlying host operating system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by deploying and activating an application within the Cisco IOx environment using a crafted activation payload file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and be able to deploy applications to the Cisco IOx environment.
