**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The application, Cervantes version Alpha 0.5 and below, does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary scripts in the victim's browser.
- Stealing of session cookies or other sensitive data.
- Potential for account takeover if the attacker can manipulate the application UI or functionality.
- Defacement of the application's content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious scripts can be injected through various input fields within the application.

**Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have access to the application and the ability to input data into the vulnerable fields.
- The attacker does not need to be an admin or privileged user.

**Additional Details:**
