The provided content is related to CVE-2022-40985.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a stack-based buffer overflow in the `DetranCLI` command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. Specifically, the `sprintf` function is used to copy command parameters into a fixed-size stack buffer without checking the size of the input, resulting in a buffer overflow if the input is too long.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-120) due to the use of `sprintf` without input size validation.
- The `DetranCLI` binary uses command templates with special keywords that are inserted into an `argv` array. These keywords, such as `WORD`, `CODE`, `A.B.C.D`, numerical ranges `<min_value-max_value>`, and choices `(choice1|choice2...)`, are not validated for length before being copied into a stack buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution: A successful exploit allows an attacker to overwrite the stack and execute arbitrary code, leading to full control of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network packets: An attacker can send specially crafted network packets containing commands with overly long parameters to trigger the buffer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device.
- The attacker would likely need knowledge of the command structure of the `DetranCLI` interface.
- A CVSS score of 7.2 indicates the attack vector is network based, requires low complexity, high privileges, no user interaction, and impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.
- The specific command to trigger this CVE is:
  ```
   (ddns1|ddns2) hostname WORD
  ```
  with a large string supplied for `WORD`.
