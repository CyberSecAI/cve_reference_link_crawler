Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23580:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `InternalMakeShapeFromTensor` function within TensorFlow's shape inference mechanism. Specifically, the code uses a user-controlled value from a tensor to determine the size of a vector allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unbounded Vector Allocation:** The code reserves space for a `std::vector<DimensionHandle>` called `dims` using a size derived directly from the tensor provided by the user without proper validation,
- **Integer Overflow:** Although not explicitly stated, the possibility of an integer overflow before the vector allocation can not be ruled out, as the value from the user-provided tensor is a `int64_t` and is used to allocate the vector without bounds checking of its size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a very large value in the tensor, an attacker can trigger the allocation of an extremely large vector. This excessive allocation can lead to a denial of service by causing the process to crash or consume excessive memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated Input Tensor:** An attacker can craft a malicious input tensor with a large integer value representing the number of dimensions, which will then be used to allocate the vector.
- **TensorFlow Graph Construction:** The vulnerability can be triggered during the construction of a TensorFlow graph where shape inference is performed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Control over Input Tensor:** The attacker must have the ability to provide or influence the input tensor that is used in the `MakeShapeFromShapeTensor` or `MakeShapeFromShapeTensorTreatScalarAsUnknownShape` functions which calls `InternalMakeShapeFromTensor`
- **Knowledge of TensorFlow Graph Structure:** While not strictly necessary, knowledge of the TensorFlow graph structure where shape inference is performed would help an attacker target the vulnerable code path.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `tensorflow/core/framework/shape_inference.cc`, specifically lines 788-790.
- The fix implemented in commit `1361fb7e29449629e1df94d44e0427ebec8c83c7` adds a check to ensure that the number of dimensions does not exceed `1 << 20`. This prevents the allocation of excessively large vectors.
- The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.8.0, but is also patched in versions 2.5.3, 2.6.3 and 2.7.1.
