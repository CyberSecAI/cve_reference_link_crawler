Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6096

**Root Cause:**
* The vulnerability stems from an insecure type resolution within Telerik Reporting. This allows for object injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Object Injection:**  The core weakness is that the application is vulnerable to object injection due to insecure type resolution. This means that an attacker can inject malicious code by manipulating the type resolution mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* The provided document does not specify the exact impact, but object injection vulnerabilities can potentially lead to a variety of severe outcomes. These could include:
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** The injected code could be crafted to crash or significantly impair the functionality of the Telerik Reporting service.
    * **Data Exfiltration:** It may be possible to extract sensitive data by exploiting the ability to control object instantiation.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, object injection can lead to the ability to gain higher access permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the type resolution process in a way that injects malicious code. The exact mechanism is not detailed in the document, but it implies that the attacker can influence how objects are created.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to influence the type resolution process within Telerik Reporting. This likely involves sending malicious input to the application, but the document lacks specific details.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability affects Telerik Reporting versions prior to 18.1.24.709.
* The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 8.8, indicating a high severity.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Markus Wulftange with CODE WHITE GmbH.
* The vendor recommends upgrading to version 18.1.24.709 or later to remediate the vulnerability.
* The vendor provides instructions on how to check the current Telerik Reporting version.
