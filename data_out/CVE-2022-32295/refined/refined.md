The provided content is related to CVE-2022-32295.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure access to the SPI-NOR by the OS/hypervisor component in the Altra reference design of UEFI access. Specifically, the implementation of SMC protection used seed hashing authentication for all run-time SPI-NOR accesses. The SPI-NOR interface exposed a direct SPI-NOR proxy interface which lacked awareness of the UEFI variables and could not differentiate between UEFI run-time and boot-time variables. In bare-metal deployments where the hypervisor code is not controlled by the platform owner, it can be considered untrusted. This allows the hypervisor to potentially access the UEFI SMC authentication seed by scanning the UEFI data segment.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure access control to the SPI-NOR
- Lack of distinction between UEFI run-time and boot-time variables in the SPI-NOR interface.
- Exposure of the UEFI SMC authentication seed.
- Untrusted hypervisor can access sensitive areas.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An untrusted hypervisor can gain access to the UEFI SMC authentication seed, which could lead to writing to the SPI-NOR and potentially impacting the system. Specifically, a user with control of the hypervisor could potentially modify UEFI variables through the SPI-NOR interface and persist changes.

**Attack vectors:**
- An untrusted hypervisor can scan the UEFI data segment.
- Exploiting the direct SPI-NOR interface using the exposed proxy interface

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to control the hypervisor.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to scan the UEFI data segment.

**Additional notes**
- This vulnerability affects Ampere Altra and Altra Max devices before specific SRP versions (1.09 for Altra, 2.10 for Altra Max)
- The vulnerability was reported by Oracle and discovered by an internal Oracle security researcher.
