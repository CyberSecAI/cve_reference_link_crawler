```
* WIP commit - delay throwing errors on login. Create a fake user and attempt to parallelize operations so similar actions are performed on the fake user and the real user.   This isn't possible for places where we need to write to the database.  Further random delays are added to offset.

* Create a fake user was more time consuming than the database call so bad user requests have become slower than good user requests. I've overcorrected. Instead, create the fake user upfront and hold it in memory.

* Update changelog.
