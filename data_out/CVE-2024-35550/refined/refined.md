Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the idccms V1.35 application. Specifically, the `/admin/infoWeb_deal.php?mudi=rev` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The application doesn't properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can force an authenticated user's browser to make unintended requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- In this case, the provided proof of concept (PoC) shows how an attacker can modify the content of a news web page by injecting malicious HTML content through the `content` parameter.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that contains a form targeting the vulnerable endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1:80/admin/infoWeb_deal.php?mudi=rev`).
- This HTML page can be distributed via various methods such as:
    - Phishing emails with a link to the malicious page
    - Embedding the malicious HTML in a forum or comment section on a website where users of the targeted application might visit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint and its required parameters.
- The attacker needs to induce a logged-in user of the idccms application to visit the malicious page or have the browser execute the malicious code.
- The attacker does not need direct access to the server hosting the idccms application or any user's credentials directly. The user's browser, already authenticated with the vulnerable application, is used as a proxy to perform actions.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided PoC uses a form with hidden input fields to submit the malicious content to the server.
- The `content` field contains HTML injection payload, which, when submitted, would modify the specified web page.
- The target URL `http://idccms.com/` and `http://127.0.0.1:80` represent the vulnerable application location.
- The `history.pushState('', '', '/')` javascript is likely used to hide the malicious request in the browser's history.
- This content provides significantly more details than a typical CVE description.

**Summary:**
The provided content describes a CSRF vulnerability in idccms V1.35 that allows an attacker to modify web content by exploiting the lack of request origin validation at the `/admin/infoWeb_deal.php?mudi=rev` endpoint. This is achieved by crafting an HTML page that forces a logged-in user's browser to send a malicious request.
