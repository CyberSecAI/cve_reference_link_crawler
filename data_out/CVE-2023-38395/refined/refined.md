- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress WP Clone Menu plugin versions 1.0.1 and earlier suffer from a broken access control issue. This means that the plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. Missing authorization, authentication or nonce token check.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user (subscriber) could potentially execute actions that should be reserved for users with higher privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by interacting with the vulnerable plugin function that lacks proper access control mechanisms.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber (an unprivileged user) to the WordPress website.
