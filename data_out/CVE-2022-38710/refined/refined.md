- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the exposure of system and software version information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The exposed information could aid in further system attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not described beyond information disclosure, but implies a network based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the capability to access the exposed information, which would generally be through a network interface.
