Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
*   The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "Name of member" parameter, allowing injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The injected script is stored in the database and executed when the affected page is loaded, impacting other users who access that data.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application doesn't sanitize user-provided input, specifically the "Name of member" field in the "Racks" section.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Malicious scripts can steal sensitive information, such as session cookies, manipulate content on the page, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker can alter the appearance or functionality of the web application.
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can potentially hijack user sessions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attacker injects the malicious script through the web interface when adding or editing a member in the "Racks" section.
*   **Stored Payload:** The injected payload is stored in the database.
*   **Trigger:** The payload is triggered when a user views the modified data (e.g., in the "Borrowing" section when adding or editing a borrowing record).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to add or edit members in the "Racks" section.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker must know which parameters are vulnerable to XSS injection ("Name of member").
*   **Ability to Inject Malicious Code:** The attacker must be able to craft and inject malicious JavaScript into the vulnerable parameter.
*   **Access to Trigger:** The attacker needs to trigger the execution of the stored XSS payload on the affected page, such as by editing a book or adding a new borrowing record.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable parameter is the "Name of member" field.
*   The XSS payload is:  `"' test <img src="" onerror="alert()">` or `"' test <img src="" onerror="alert(1)">`

**Affected Versions:**
* All versions of Badaso below v2.9.7
