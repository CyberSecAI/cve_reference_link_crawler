## Description

# Vulnerability Description:

There are several ways that authenticated attackers can crash the Eternal Terminal, I have highlighted two here.

The first is by having a sequence number that is invalid (for example, a message with a sequence number higher than that contained in the `BackedReader` buffer).

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-24952
```

Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24952:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of sequence numbers within the Eternal Terminal (ET) protocol. Specifically, the `BackedReader` buffer doesn't handle invalid sequence numbers properly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or handle incoming sequence numbers correctly. A message with a sequence number higher than what's in the `BackedReader` buffer can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Denial-of-Service:** By sending crafted messages with invalid sequence numbers, an attacker can cause the ET server to crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service condition where the ET server crashes, terminating all active user sessions. Users will be disconnected from the server and unable to resume their sessions until the server is restarted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious messages to the ET server over the network via the ET protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the ET server, meaning they must have a valid clientid and passkey to connect to the server.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the ET server to send the malicious messages to port 2022.
