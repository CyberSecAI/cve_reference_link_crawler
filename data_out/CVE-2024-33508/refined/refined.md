- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command ('Command Injection') in the DAS component of FortiClientEMS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection (CWE-77). The application fails to properly sanitize input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying database.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can execute limited and temporary operations on the underlying database via crafted requests. Specifically, the impact includes the ability to execute unauthorized code or commands.
- **Attack vectors:** Crafted requests sent to the vulnerable FortiClientEMS component. This is an unauthenticated remote attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable FortiClientEMS component. No authentication is required.
