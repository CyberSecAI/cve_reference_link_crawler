Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `tpl_upload.html` file of Xinhu RockOA v2.6.3. Specifically, the `callback` parameter is directly concatenated into a `<script>` tag without any filtering or encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected via the `callback` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing cookies, potentially leading to account takeover.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the visual appearance of the web page.
    *   **Redirection:** Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive information.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Injecting code that downloads malware onto the user's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attack vector is the `callback` parameter in the URL: `/webmain/public/upload/tpl_upload.html`.  An attacker crafts a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameter containing JavaScript code and tricks the victim into visiting this URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to create malicious links:** The attacker needs to craft a URL containing the malicious JavaScript payload.
*   **Social engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to click the crafted malicious link.
*   **No authentication is mentioned:** the content does not explicitly state that authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided PoC demonstrates how an attacker can close existing Javascript code blocks to execute code within the `<script>` tag.

*  The github issue shows images of the injected payload in the browser.
