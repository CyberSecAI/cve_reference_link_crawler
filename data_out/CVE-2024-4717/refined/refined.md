**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The system is vulnerable to XSS attacks because it allows user-supplied input in the `name` parameter to be included in the webpage without proper encoding. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Website Compromise:** Successfully exploiting the XSS vulnerability can allow an attacker to turn a trusted website into a malicious one, causing harm to both users and the website's reputation.
*   **Various Attacks:** XSS can lead to various threats, including displaying inappropriate content or downloading malware onto the victim's system without their knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker sends a malicious payload within the `name` parameter via an HTTP request.
*   **Specific Endpoint:** The vulnerable endpoint is `/model/update_classroom.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable system.
*  **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** An attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter.

**Technical Details**

*   **Vulnerable parameter:** `name`
*   **Vulnerable File:** `/model/update_classroom.php`
