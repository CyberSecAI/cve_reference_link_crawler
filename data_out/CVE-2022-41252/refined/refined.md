Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2022-41252:

**CVE-2022-41252**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** CONS3RT Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 1.0.0 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** Missing permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.
*   **Weakness:** The plugin does not validate if a user has the necessary permissions to access certain endpoints.
*   **Impact:** An attacker with Overall/Read permission can enumerate (discover) the IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. These IDs could then be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to capture the actual credentials.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network access to Jenkins web interface.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Attacker needs Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.

**Summary**
The CONS3RT Plugin exposes multiple HTTP endpoints that lack permission checks. This allows an attacker with Overall/Read permissions to enumerate credential IDs stored in Jenkins. This vulnerability can be chained with other vulnerabilities to steal credentials.
