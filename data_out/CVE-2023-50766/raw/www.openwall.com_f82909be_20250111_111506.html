* Analysis Model API Plugin 11.13.0
* Nexus Platform Plugin 3.18.1-01
* Scriptler Plugin 344.v5a_ddb_5f9e685

Additionally, we announce unresolved security issues in the following
plugins:

* Deployment Dashboard Plugin
* Dingding JSON Pusher Plugin
* HTMLResource Plugin
* OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin
* PaaSLane Estimate Plugin

Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and

---

SECURITY-3327 / CVE-2023-5072
Analysis Model API Plugin 11.11.0 and earlier bundles versions of JSON-Java
vulnerable to CVE-2023-5072.

This may allow attackers able to control input to cause a Denial of Service
(DoS) by parsing a crafted JSON document.


SECURITY-3205 / CVE-2023-50764
Scriptler Plugin 342.v6a_89fd40f466 and earlier does not restrict a file
name query parameter in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Scriptler/Configure permission to delete
arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system.


SECURITY-3206 / CVE-2023-50765
Scriptler Plugin 342.v6a_89fd40f466 and earlier does not perform a
permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to read the contents of
a Groovy script by knowing its ID.


SECURITY-3204 / CVE-2023-50766 (CSRF) &amp; CVE-2023-50767 (missing permission check)
Nexus Platform Plugin 3.18.0-03 and earlier does not perform permission
checks in methods implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to send an HTTP request
to an attacker-specified URL and parse the response as XML.

Additionally, the plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML
external entity (XXE) attacks, so attackers can have Jenkins parse a
crafted XML response that uses external entities for extraction of secrets
from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.


SECURITY-3203 / CVE-2023-50768 (CSRF) &amp; CVE-2023-50769 (missing permission check)
Nexus Platform Plugin 3.18.0-03 and earlier does not perform permission
checks in methods implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an
attacker-specified HTTP server using attacker-specified credentials IDs
obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.


SECURITY-3168 / CVE-2023-50770
OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin provides an anti-lockout feature,
which allows administrators to define a local user account that can be used
to recover access to Jenkins.

In OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin 2.6 and earlier the password to
that account is stored in a recoverable format.

This allows attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system to
recover the plain text password of that account, likely gaining
administrator access to Jenkins.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-2979 / CVE-2023-50771
OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin 2.6 and earlier improperly determines
that a redirect URL after login is legitimately pointing to Jenkins.

This allows attackers to perform phishing attacks by having users go to a
Jenkins URL that will forward them to a different site after successful
authentication.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-3184 / CVE-2023-50772 (storage) &amp; CVE-2023-50773 (masking)
Dingding JSON Pusher Plugin 2.0 and earlier stores access tokens
unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of
its configuration.

These tokens can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission or
access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Additionally, the job configuration form does not mask these tokens,
increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture them.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-3183 / CVE-2023-50774
HTMLResource Plugin 1.02 and earlier does not require POST requests for an
HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to delete arbitrary files on the
Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-3092 / CVE-2023-50775
Deployment Dashboard Plugin 1.0.10 and earlier does not require POST
requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery
(CSRF) vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to copy jobs.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-3182 / CVE-2023-50776 (storage) &amp; CVE-2023-50777 (masking)
PaaSLane Estimate Plugin 1.0.4 and earlier stores PaaSLane authentication
tokens unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as
part of its configuration.

These tokens can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission or
access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Additionally, the job configuration form does not mask these tokens,
increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture them.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-3179 / CVE-2023-50778 (CSRF) &amp; CVE-2023-50779 (missing permission check)
PaaSLane Estimate Plugin 1.0.4 and earlier does not perform permission
checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an
attacker-specified URL using an attacker-specified token.

Additionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting
in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
