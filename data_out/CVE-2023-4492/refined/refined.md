Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-4492:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization of user-controlled inputs in the parameters of the `/addrbook.ghp` file within the Easy Address Book Web Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- The vulnerability affects multiple parameters in `/addrbook.ghp` including `firstname`, `homephone`, `lastname`, `middlename`, `workaddress`, `workcity`, `workcountry`, `workphone`, `workstate`, and `workzip`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject a malicious JavaScript payload.
- The injected JavaScript payload executes when the application is loaded in a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the application.
- The vulnerability has a confidentiality and integrity impact, with no impact on availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack over the network.
- Requires user interaction for successful exploitation (the victim has to load the page with the injected payload).
- The attack involves injecting the malicious JavaScript code via HTTP request parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable server (no authentication or special privileges are mentioned).
- The attacker must be able to persuade a user to access the manipulated page to execute the XSS payload.
