The provided content relates to CVE-2024-39681.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Cooked plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the AJAX action handler.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability, specifically lack of nonce validation on the AJAX action handler `cooked_save_default_bulk`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions, such as applying a template to all recipes. Specifically, they can modify the `default_content` template.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that, when opened by a logged-in user, submits a forged request to the vulnerable plugin's AJAX endpoint `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in WordPress user into opening a malicious webpage. They do not require any privileges on the target system other than the ability to entice a user to visit the malicious page.
