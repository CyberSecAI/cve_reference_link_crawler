Subject: CVE-2024-27322: Deserialization vulnerability in R before 4.4.0

<https://hiddenlayer.com/research/r-bitrary-code-execution/> reports:

> HiddenLayer researchers have discovered a vulnerability, CVE-2024-27322,

[...]

> Our team discovered that it is possible to craft a malicious RDS file that

[...]

> After some research, we found that if we created a promise where instead of

## R Programming Language implementations are vulnerable to arbitrary code execution during deserialization of .rds and .rdx files

#### Vulnerability Note VU#238194

Original Release Date: 2024-04-29 | Last Revised: 2024-05-03

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the R language that allows for arbitrary code to be executed directly after the deserialization of untrusted data has been discovered. This vulnerability can be exploited through RDS (R Data Serialization) format files and .rdx files. An attacker can create malicious RDS or .rdx formatted files to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's target device.

### Description

R supports data serialization, which is the process of turning R objects and data into a format that can then be deserialized in another R session. This will provide a copy of the R objects from the original session.

The RDS format, which mainly comprises .rds files, is used to save and load serialized R objects. These objects are utilized to share states and transfer data sets across programs. They are not expected to run code when they are loaded by an R implementation unless prompted by the user. R Packages use .rdx files, which contain a list of offsets, lengths, and names, and are accompanied by a .rdb file, which is used to extract more information about those offsets. .rdx and .rdb files contain RDS formatted data within themselves. A .rds file functions similarly to a .rdx file but only allows for storing a single R object. When loading a .rds or .rdx file, the readRDS function is utilized. An R implementation using the readRDS function given that information will then read the offsets and load the data.

R supports lazy evaluation. This can be implemented through a type called Promise, which can be represented in the RDS format as PROMSXP. This type is used to manage expressions that are called and completed in a asynchronous manner when their associated values are needed to be used by the program. When constructing an unserialized object in this context from the RDS format, the Promise object will require three pieces of data. These are the value of the Promise, the expression, and the environment. This information is loaded by the `eval` function. The `eval` function in R takes an expression, in this case the Promise, and evaluates it within the environment specified.

The vulnerability occurs when the `eval` function evaluates a promise type that has an unevaluated value. The Promise expression will not be properly evaluated and will execute the expression when it is referenced in the program that contains it. A threat actor can include malicious code within a .rds or .rdx file that is referenced by an unevaluated value. When an R implemention loads a package that contains an .rds or .rdx file and the promise value is reached, it will execute the referenced code. This code is arbitrary and will be executed prior to any opportunity for the victim to explore and see what functions or objects are within the file loaded.

### Impact

An attacker can create malicious .rds and .rdx files and use social engineering to distribute those files to execute arbitrary code on the victim's device. Projects that use readRDS on untrusted files are also vulnerable to the attack. Attackers can also leverage system commands to access resources available to the application and exfiltrate data from any environment available to the application on the target device. The code in the malicious files can also be used to access adjacent resources such other computers/devices, devices in a cluster and shared documents/folders available to the application.

### Solution

#### Apply Updates

R project has provided R Core Version 4.4.0, which addresses the vulnerability. R Core version 4.4.0 now restricts promises in the serialization stream so that they are not used for implementing lazy evaluation. Apply the update at your earliest convenience.

#### Secure or Sandbox RDS file usage

Protect and use untrusted/third-party .rds, rdb, and .rdx files either in Containers or in a Sandbox environment to prevent unexpected access to resources.

### [R Programing Language](#R%20Programing%20Language) Affected

Notified:  2024-04-08
Updated: 2024-04-29

**Statement Date:   April 19, 2024**

| **CVE-2024-27322** | Affected |
| --- | --- |

#### Vendor Statement

The report is correct; it has to be noted that a general purpose computational system such as R has always had interfaces to the underlying OS including possibilities to spawn sub processes, notably a shell with arbitrary "command line". This has been true for all such systems, APL, Matlab, Python, Julia, ... you name it.
In that sense R is "too powerful" the same as other such systems in any case.
The CVE-2024-27322 is just making use of this fact in a way that is very much hidden from the user.

Hence, indeed, R 4.4.0 which will be released April 24 (as source) and within a few days as Windows and Mac binaries (and eventually also redistributed via Linux distribution package systems) will no longer allow such R promises to become active in RDS files (and similar files containing serialized R objects).

------- Update (April 19):
Indeed, I've checked the following R code with a recent R 4.4.0 RC (RC = release cand.) of today and now get

```
> x <- readRDS("pwned.rds")
Error in readRDS("pwned.rds") : cannot return a promise (PROMSXP) object

> R.version.string
[1] "R version 4.4.0 RC (2024-04-16 r86444)"
>

```

which confirms that we have addressed the problem pretty generally.
Note that R 4.4.0 pre-releases are available
- in source from https://cran.r-project.org/ https://cran.r-project.org/src/base-prerelease/?C=M;O=D
- as binary installable on Windows from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rtest.html

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2024-bc590cb3f1
2024-05-09 01:48:06.404644
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : R
Product : Fedora 38
Version : 4.3.3
Release : 2.fc38
URL : <https://www.r-project.org>
Summary : A language for data analysis and graphics
Description :
This is a metapackage that provides both core R userspace and
all R development components.

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
R is similar to the award-winning S system, which was developed at
Bell Laboratories by John Chambers et al. It provides a wide
variety of statistical and graphical techniques (linear and
nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis,
classification, clustering, ...).

R is designed as a true computer language with control-flow
constructions for iteration and alternation, and it allows users to
add additional functionality by defining new functions. For
computationally intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked
and called at run time.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2024-07b7b83a4f
2024-05-09 02:03:54.881694
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : R
Product : Fedora 39
Version : 4.3.3
Release : 2.fc39
URL : <https://www.r-project.org>
Summary : A language for data analysis and graphics
Description :
This is a metapackage that provides both core R userspace and
all R development components.

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
R is similar to the award-winning S system, which was developed at
Bell Laboratories by John Chambers et al. It provides a wide
variety of statistical and graphical techniques (linear and
nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis,
classification, clustering, ...).

R is designed as a true computer language with control-flow
constructions for iteration and alternation, and it allows users to
add additional functionality by defining new functions. For
computationally intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked
and called at run time.

## Summary

HiddenLayer researchers have discovered a vulnerability, CVE-2024-27322, in the R programming language that allows for arbitrary code execution by deserializing untrusted data. This vulnerability can be exploited through the loading of RDS (R Data Serialization) files or R packages, which are often shared between developers and data scientists. An attacker can create malicious RDS files or R packages containing embedded arbitrary R code that executes on the victim’s target device upon interaction.

## Introduction

#### What is R?

R is an open-source programming language and software environment for statistical computing, data visualization, and machine learning. Consisting of a strong core language and an extensive list of libraries for additional functionality, it is only natural that R is popular and widely used today, often being the only programming language that statistics students learn in school. As a result, the R language holds a significant share in industries such as healthcare, finance, and government, each employing it for its prowess in performing statistical analysis in large datasets. Due to its usage with large datasets, R has also become increasingly popular in the AI/ML field.

To further underscore R’s pervasiveness, many R conferences are hosted around the world, such as the R Gov Conference, which features speakers from major organizations such as NASA, the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the US Army, and so on. R’s use within the biomedical field is also very established, with pharmaceutical giants like Pfizer and Merck & Co. [actively speaking about R at similar conferences](https://rinpharma.com/post/2023-10-21-on-demand/).

R has a dedicated following even in the open-source community, with projects like [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/about/) being referenced in their documentation, boasting over 42 million downloads and 18,999 active support site members last year. R users love R – which is even more evident when we consider the R equivalent to Python’s PyPI – CRAN.

The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) repository hosts over 20,000 packages to date. The R-project website also links to the project repository [R-forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/), which claims to host over 2,000 projects with over 15,000 registered users at the time of writing.

All of this is to say that the exploitation of a code execution vulnerability in R can have far-reaching implications across multiple verticals, including but not limited to vital government agencies, medical, and financial institutions.

So, how does an attack on R work? To understand this, we have to look at the R Data Serialization process, or RDS, for short.

#### What is RDS?

Before explaining what RDS is in relation to R, we will first give a brief overview of data serialization. Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a format that can be stored locally or transferred over a network. Conversely, serialized objects can be reconstructed (deserialized) for use as and when needed. As HiddenLayer’s SAI team has [previously written about](https://hiddenlayer.com/research/weaponizing-machine-learning-models-with-ransomware/#Exploiting-Serialization), the serialization and deserialization of data can often be vulnerable to exploitation when callable objects are involved in the process.

R has a serialization format of its own whereby a user can serialize an object using *saveRDS* and deserialize it using *readRDS*. It’s worth mentioning that this format is also leveraged when R packages are saved and loaded. When a package is compiled, a .rdb file containing serialized representations of objects to be included is created. The .rdb file is accompanied by a .rdx file containing metadata relating to the binary blobs now stored in the .rdb file. When the package is loaded, R uses the .rdx index file to locate the data stored in the .rdb file and load it into RDS format.

Multiple functions within R can be used to serialize and deserialize data, which slightly differ from each other but ultimately leverage the same internal code. For example, the *serialize()* function works slightly differently from the *saveRDS()* function, and the same is true for their counterpart functions: *unserialize()* and *readRDS()*; as you will see later, both of these work their way through to the same internal function for deserializing the data.

## Vulnerability Overview

Our team discovered that it is possible to craft a malicious RDS file that will execute arbitrary code when loaded and referenced. This vulnerability, assigned CVE-2024-27322, involves the use of promise objects and lazy evaluation in R.

#### R’s Interpreted Serialization Format

As we mentioned earlier, several functions and code paths lead to an RDS file or blob getting deserialized. However, regardless of where that request originated, it eventually leads to the *R\_Unserialize* function inside of *serialize.c*, which is what our team honed in on. Like most other formats, RDS contains a header, which is the first component parsed by the *R\_Unserialize* function.

The header for an RDS binary blob contains five main components:

* the file format
* the version of the file
* the R version that was used to serialize the blob
* the minimum R version needed to read the blob
* depending on the version number, a string representing the native encoding.

RDS files can be either an ASCII format, a binary format, or an XDR format, with the XDR format being the most prevalent. Each has its own magic numbers, which, while only needing one byte, are stored in two bytes; however, due to an issue with the ASCII format, files can sometimes have a magic number of three bytes in the header. After reading the two – or sometimes three – byte magic number for the format, the *R\_Unserialize* function reads the other header items, which are each considered an integer (4 bytes for both the XDR and binary formats and up to 127 bytes for the ASCII format). If the file version is 2, no header checks are performed. If the file version is 3, then the function reads another integer, checks its size, and then reads a string of the length into the *native\_encoding* variable, which is set to ‘UTF-8’ by default. If the version is neither 2 nor 3, then the writer version and minimum reader versions are checked. Once the header has been read and validated, the function tries to read an item from the blob.

The RDS format is interesting because while consisting of bytecode that gets parsed and run in the interpreter inside the *ReadItem* function, the instructions do not include a halt, stop, or return command. The deserialization function will only ever return one object, and once that object has been read, the parsing will end. This means that one technical challenge for an exploit is that it needs to fit naturally into an existing object type and cannot be inserted before or after the returned object. However, despite this limitation, almost all objects in the R language can be serialized and deserialized using RDS due to attributes, tags, and nested values through the internal CAR and CDR structures.

The RDS interpreter contains 36 possible bytecode instructions in the *ReadItem* function, with several additional instructions becoming available when used in relation to one of the main instructions. RDS instructions all have different lengths based on what they do; however, they all start with one integer that is encoded with the instruction and all of the flags through bit masking.

#### The Promise of an Exploit

After spending some time perusing the deserialization code, we found a few functions that seemed questionable but did not have an actual vulnerability, that is, until we came across an instruction that created the promise object. To understand the promise object, we need to first understand lazy evaluation. Lazy evaluation is a strategy that allows for symbols to be evaluated only when needed, i.e., when they are accessed. One such example is the *delayedAssign* function that allows a variable to be assigned once it has been accessed:

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://hiddenlayer.com/wp-content/uploads/RBlog_image1.png)

*Figure 1: DelayedAssign Function*

The above is achieved by creating a promise object that has both a symbol and an expression attached to it. Once the symbol ‘y’ is accessed, the expression assigning the value of ‘x’ to ‘y’ is run. The key here is that ‘y’ is not assigned the value 1 because ‘y’ is not assigned to ‘x’ until it is accessed. While we were not successful in gaining code execution within the deserialization code itself, we thought that since we could create all of the needed objects, it might be possible to create a promise that would be evaluated once someone tried to use whatever had been deserialized.

#### The Unbounded Promise

After some research, we found that if we created a promise where instead of setting a symbol, we set an unbounded value, we could create a payload that would run the expression when the promise was accessed:

```
Opcode(TYPES.PROMSXP, 0, False, False, False,None,False),
Opcode(TYPES.UNBOUNDVALUE_SXP, 0, False, False, False,None,False),
Opcode(TYPES.LANGSXP, 0, False, False, False,None,False),
Opcode(TYPES.SYMSXP, 0, False, False, False,None,False),
Opcode(TYPES.CHARSXP, 64, False, False, False,"system",False),
Opcode(TYPES.LISTSXP, 0, False, False, False,None,False),
Opcode(TYPES.STRSXP, 0, False, False, False,1,False),
Opcode(TYPES.CHARSXP, 64, False, False, False,'echo "pwned by HiddenLayer"',False),
Opcode(TYPES.NILVALUE_SXP, 0, False, False, False,None,False),
```

Once the malicious file has been created and loaded by R, the exploit will run no matter how the variable is referenced:

## R Supply Chain Attacks

#### ShaRing Objects

After searching GitHub, our team discovered that readRDS, one of the many ways this vulnerability can be exploited, is referenced in over 135,000 R source files. Looking through the repositories, we found that a large amount of the usage was on untrusted, user-provided data, which could lead to a full compromise of the system running the program. Some source files containing potentially vulnerable code included projects from R Studio, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, AWS, and other major software vendors.

#### R Packages

R packages allow for the sharing of compiled R code and data that can be leveraged by others in their statistical tasks. As previously mentioned, at the time of writing, the CRAN package repository claims to feature 20,681 available packages. Packages can be [uploaded to this repository](https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html) by anybody; there are criteria a package must fulfill in order to be accepted, such as the fact that the package must contain certain files (such as a description) and must pass certain automated checks (which do not check for this vulnerability).

To recap, R packages leverage the RDS format to save and load data. When a package is compiled, two files are created that facilitate this:

* **.rdb** file: objects to be included within the package are serialized into this file as binary blobs of data;
* **.rdx** file: contains metadata associated with each serialized object within the .rbd file, including their offsets.

When a package is loaded, the metadata stored in the RDS format within the .rdx file is used to locate the objects within the .rdb file. These objects are then decompressed and deserialized, essentially loading them as RDS files.

This means R packages are vulnerable to the deserialization vulnerability and can, therefore, be used as part of a supply chain attack via package repositories. For an attacker to take over an R package, all they need to do is overwrite the .rdx file with the maliciously crafted file, and when the package is loaded, it will automatically execute the code:

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://hiddenlayer.com/wp-content/uploads/RBlog_image3.png)

If one of the main system packages, such as compiler, has been modified, then the malicious code will run when R is initialized.

However, one of the most dangerous components of this vulnerability is that instead of simply replacing the .rdx file, the exploit can be injected into any of the offsets inside of the RDB file, making it incredibly difficult to detect.

## Conclusion

R is an open-source statistical programming language used across multiple critical sectors for statistical computing tasks and machine learning. Its package building and sharing capabilities make it flexible and community-driven. However, a drawback to this is that not enough scrutiny is being placed on packages being uploaded to repositories, leaving users vulnerable to supply chain attacks.

In the context of [adversarial AI](https://hiddenlayer.com/innovation-hub/adversarial-machine-learning-the-new-frontier/), such vulnerabilities could be leveraged to manipulate the integrity of machine learning models or exploit weaknesses in AI systems. To combat such risks, integrating an [AI security framework](https://hiddenlayer.com/innovation-hub/the-eu-ai-act-a-groundbreaking-framework-for-ai-regulation/) that includes robust defenses against adversarial AI techniques is critical to safeguarding both the software and the larger machine learning ecosystem.

R’s serialization and deserialization process, which is used in the process of creating and loading RDS files and packages, has an arbitrary code execution vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this by crafting a file in RDS format that contains a promise instruction setting the value to *unbound\_value* and the expression to contain arbitrary code. Due to lazy evaluation, the expression will only be evaluated and run when the symbol associated with the RDS file is accessed. Therefore if this is simply an RDS file, when a user assigns it a symbol (variable) in order to work with it, the arbitrary code will be executed when the user references that symbol. If the object is compiled within an R package, the package can be added to an R repository such as CRAN, and the expression will be evaluated and the arbitrary code run when a user loads that package.

Given the widespread usage of R and the *readRDS* function, the implications of this are far-reaching. Having followed our responsible disclosure process, we have worked closely with the team at R who have worked quickly to patch this vulnerability within the most recent release – R v4.4.0. In addition, HiddenLayer’s AISec Platform will provide additional protection from this vulnerability in its Q2 product release.
