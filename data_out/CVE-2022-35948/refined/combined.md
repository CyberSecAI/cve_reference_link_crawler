# CRLF Injection in Nodejs ‚Äòundici‚Äô via Content-Type

Moderate

[mcollina](/mcollina)
published
GHSA-f772-66g8-q5h3
Aug 9, 2022

## Package

npm

undici
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

=< 5.8.1

## Patched versions

5.8.2

## Description

### Impact

`=< undici@5.8.0` users are vulnerable to *CRLF Injection* on headers when using unsanitized input as request headers, more specifically, inside the `content-type` header.

Example:

```
import { request } from 'undici'

const unsanitizedContentTypeInput =  'application/json\r\n\r\nGET /foo2 HTTP/1.1'

await request('http://localhost:3000, {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      'content-type': unsanitizedContentTypeInput
    },
})

```

The above snippet will perform two requests in a single `request` API call:

1. `http://localhost:3000/`
2. `http://localhost:3000/foo2`

### Patches

This issue was patched in Undici v5.8.1

### Workarounds

Sanitize input when sending content-type headers using user input.

## For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [undici repository](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/issues)
* To make a report, follow the [SECURITY](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/HEAD/SECURITY.md) document

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
