Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28189:

**CVE-2024-28189:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of the `chown` command on an untrusted file within the sandbox environment. This command is used on a file named `run_script`. An attacker can exploit this by creating a symbolic link named `run_script` pointing to a file outside the sandbox, causing `chown` to operate on an arbitrary file outside of the intended scope.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Unsafe Use of `chown`:** The application uses `chown` on a file that can be controlled by an attacker through a symbolic link.
    *   **Symbolic Link Vulnerability:** The application doesn't validate or sanitize file paths, thus enabling the use of symlinks to target arbitrary files.
    *   **Privileged Docker Container:** The Docker container is run with the `privileged` flag, which allows for further privilege escalation on the host system.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Ownership Change:** Attackers can change the ownership of files outside the sandbox.
    *   **Code Execution:** By changing ownership of critical system files (like `/bin/rm`) and then overwriting them, an attacker can gain arbitrary code execution outside of the sandbox.
    *   **Full System Compromise:** Due to the privileged docker container, the attacker may be able to escalate privileges and achieve access to the host system, including the database and other internal components.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker uploads a zip archive containing a symbolic link named `run_script` pointing to an arbitrary file on the filesystem.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to submit code to the Judge0 system. No other privileges are required
    *  No user interaction is required

**Additional Notes:**
* This vulnerability is a bypass for a previous patch that tried to address a different vulnerability ([GHSA-h9g2-45c8-89cf/CVE-2024-28185]).
* The vulnerability is present in versions <= 1.13.0 of Judge0.
* The vulnerability is considered critical with a CVSS score of 10.0
* The weakness is categorized as CWE-61.
* A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating how to overwrite the `/bin/rm` binary to achieve code execution outside the sandbox.
* The fix for this issue involved removing the `chown` command before `rm`, as seen in commit `f3b8547`.
