Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-0372

**Vulnerability Description:**
The "Views for WPForms" plugin versions 3.2.2 and earlier contain a missing authorization vulnerability in the `get_form_fields` function. This allows authenticated users with subscriber access or higher to create form views.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the absence of a capability check within the `get_form_fields` function. This function retrieves form field data, which is used in the plugin's view creation process. Due to this oversight, any authenticated user, even those with minimal privileges like "subscriber," can trigger the function and potentially create or modify form views.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary weakness is the lack of an authorization check or capability check on the `get_form_fields` function. This allows unauthorized access to sensitive functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers with subscriber access can create form views which they should not be able to access. This could potentially allow them to view data that is normally only available to higher-level users or administrators.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network since it's an HTTP request.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site (subscriber or higher).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have an account on the target WordPress site.
*   The attacker's role must be at least "subscriber" level.
*   No special network position is required

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in version 3.2.3 of the plugin by adding authorization checks to the `create_view` and `save_view` functions.
*   The `readme.txt` file mentions that the vulnerability was fixed by adding authorization checks.
*   The provided diffs show the addition of capability checks (`current_user_can('manage_options')`) in the `class-wpforms-views-ajax.php` file for functions handling view creation and saving, along with a nonce check which should prevent CSRF attacks.
*   The `admin.js` file was also modified to include the nonce value when creating a new view.
*  The Wordfence article mentions that the `get_form_fields` function was missing a capability check. However, this does not appear in the diff files.
