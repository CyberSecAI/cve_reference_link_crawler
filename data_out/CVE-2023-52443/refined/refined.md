  "cveId": "CVE-2023-52443",
  "baseScore": "N/A",
  "impactScore": "N/A",
  "exploitabilityScore": "N/A",
  "report": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is caused by the `aa_splitn_fqname()` function in AppArmor, which can return `NULL` for the profile name (`tmpname`) while returning a non-NULL namespace (`tmpns`). This occurs when processing a packed profile with a name like `:samba-dcerpcd`, where `aa_splitn_fqname()` interprets it as only a namespace. Subsequently, when `aa_alloc_profile()` tries to allocate a new profile with a NULL name, it crashes.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Null pointer dereference: The crash happens due to a null pointer dereference within the `strlen` function called in `aa_alloc_profile`, as `aa_splitn_fqname` can return a `NULL` profile name.",
      "Improper handling of namespace-only profile names: The code does not properly handle the case where a fully-qualified profile name consists only of a namespace, leading to the NULL pointer dereference.",
       "Lack of input validation: User-provided profile names are not validated to prevent namespace-only names."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to a kernel crash when attempting to load a specially crafted AppArmor profile. The crash is a general protection fault, potentially affecting system stability.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Local Attack: An attacker needs to be able to write to the AppArmor policy file (usually through `apparmor_parser` or a similar mechanism)."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker must have the ability to load new AppArmor profiles or replace existing ones on the target system."
  },
  "patch": [
    "The fix involves adding a check in `unpack_profile()` to ensure that if `aa_splitn_fqname()` returns a non-NULL namespace (`tmpns`), it must also return a non-NULL profile name (`tmpname`). If the profile name is NULL, the profile set replacement is denied, an `EPROTO` error is returned, and an explaining message is provided."
