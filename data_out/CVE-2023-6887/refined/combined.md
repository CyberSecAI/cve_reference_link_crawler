**BUG\_Author:**

Daydust

**Vendor:**

<https://github.com/saysky/ForestBlog>

**Software:**

**Vulnerability File:**

ForestBlog-master/ForestBlog/src/main/java/com/liuyanzhao/ssm/blog/controller/admin/UploadFileController.java

**Description:**
ForestBlog Exists Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability on /admin/upload/img Interface

When the code processes the logic of file upload, the character after the last dot is used as the suffix name, and a series of judgment danger detection is performed on the suffix name

[![image-20231212223542659](/daydust/vuln/raw/main/ForestBlog/img/1.png)](/daydust/vuln/blob/main/ForestBlog/img/1.png)

In Windows system, we can upload any file by adding a "." after the file's name.In this case, the suffix value becomes a period, and allowSuffix contains a period, thus bypassing whitelist suffix detection

[![image-20231212235628456](/daydust/vuln/raw/main/ForestBlog/img/2.png)](/daydust/vuln/blob/main/ForestBlog/img/2.png)

Please note that as the front-end also has whitelist restrictions, it is necessary to upload a file in the style of xx.jpgxxxx, or upload a.jpg and modify the data package，For example, 1.jpg.jsp

When uploading, the corresponding address will be displayed, or right click on the saved avatar file, you can see the full address. Windows automatically deletes the dot at the end of the file. Therefore, delete the dot at the end of the file to successfully access the file。

Since this directory supports parsing JSP, we can upload the JSP Trojan to obtain the permissions of the target host
