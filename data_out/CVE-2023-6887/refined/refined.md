Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of file extensions during the upload process in the ForestBlog application. The application determines the file extension by taking the characters after the last dot in the filename. In Windows, adding a dot at the end of the filename is allowed, which is then interpreted as the extension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Extension Validation:** The application's logic for extracting the file extension is flawed. It relies on the last dot's presence and doesn't properly sanitize or validate the extension.
*   **Whitelist Bypass:** The application uses a whitelist to determine allowed file extensions, but appending a dot bypasses this check as the "extension" becomes "." which is likely allowed.
*   **Lack of Sanitization:** The application does not remove trailing dots from the filename which leads to this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker can upload any file type, including malicious ones such as JSP files, which can be parsed and executed by the server.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading and executing a JSP webshell, an attacker can gain remote code execution on the server, allowing them to take full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by crafting an HTTP POST request to the `/admin/upload/img` endpoint.
*   **Multipart Form Data:** The file is uploaded using multipart/form-data encoding, which is standard for file uploads.
*   **Modified Filename:** The attacker needs to upload a file with a modified filename that contains a trailing dot.
*  **Bypassing Front-end restrictions:** It is necessary to bypass front-end restrictions by either manipulating the filename in format "xx.jpgxxxx" or modify the data package such as "1.jpg.jsp."

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the admin panel:** The attacker needs to be able to access the admin panel of the ForestBlog application since the vulnerable upload endpoint is in the `/admin/` path.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the ForestBlog application.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker must know the `/admin/upload/img` endpoint is vulnerable.
*   **Basic knowledge of crafting HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft or modify the http request.

**Additional details:**
The provided content is more detailed than the generic CVE description. It provides specific details on how to exploit the vulnerability including:
* The vulnerable endpoint: `/admin/upload/img`
* The method to bypass file extension validation: appending a dot to the file name.
* An example of a JSP webshell that can be uploaded.
* An example HTTP request that shows how to exploit the vulnerability.
