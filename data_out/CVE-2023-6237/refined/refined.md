Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6237:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `EVP_PKEY_public_check()` function within OpenSSL's RSA key handling.
- When this function checks RSA public keys, it performs a computation to verify that the modulus (n) is composite (product of two or more primes). For valid keys, this is quick, but if 'n' is a large prime, the computation can take a very long time.
- There was no limit applied to RSA public key size and the number of Miller-Rabin algorithm rounds was unnecessarily high.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Lack of Input Validation:**  The `EVP_PKEY_public_check()` function did not have proper size limitations on the RSA modulus, allowing overly large (and potentially prime) values to be processed.
- **Excessive Computation:** The function used a high number of Miller-Rabin primality test rounds, which compounded the excessive time taken for very large prime inputs. This excessive computation led to the DoS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing an excessively large, invalid RSA public key from an untrusted source to an application using `EVP_PKEY_public_check()`, an attacker could cause the application to experience significant delays and potentially become unresponsive.
- The OpenSSL `pkey` command-line application is vulnerable if used with the "-pubin" and "-check" options on untrusted data.

**Attack vectors:**

- An attacker needs to supply a crafted, excessively large, invalid RSA public key to a vulnerable application that calls `EVP_PKEY_public_check()`.
- For the OpenSSL command line, the attacker would supply the crafted key using the "-pubin" option, in conjunction with the "-check" option.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker must be able to provide the malicious RSA public key to the target application. This could be through network requests, file uploads, or other input mechanisms.
- The attacker does not need elevated privileges, as the vulnerability is triggered by the processing of the malformed key data within the application.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in OpenSSL versions 3.0.13, 3.1.5 and 3.2.1.
- The fix limits the size of the RSA modulus to 16384 bits and reduces the number of Miller-Rabin primality test rounds.
