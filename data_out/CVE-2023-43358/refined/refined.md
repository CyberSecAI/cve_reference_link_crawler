Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Title" field of the "Content - News Menu" within CMSmadesimple v2.2.18. This lack of proper sanitization allows the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This means that the malicious script is stored within the application's database and executed when a user views the affected page.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or encode the input provided by the user in the "Title" field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser when they access the affected page. This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Displaying fake login forms to capture credentials.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the CMSmadesimple application.
- **"Content - News Menu" Title Field:** The vulnerable parameter is the "Title" field within the "Content - News Menu" section.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker is described as "local". This likely means the attacker needs to have an account with sufficient permissions to edit the "Content - News Menu" section within the CMSmadesimple admin panel.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must know that the "Title" field is vulnerable to XSS.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Script:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious JavaScript payload.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- **Proof of Concept (POC):** The provided POC demonstrates how to inject the JavaScript payload `'"><svg/onload=prompt('Title')>` into the title field and how this payload will execute when a user visits the affected page.
- **CMS Version:** The vulnerability is confirmed to be present in CMSmadesimple version 2.2.18
