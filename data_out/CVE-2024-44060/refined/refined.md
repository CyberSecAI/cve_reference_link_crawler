- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Filmix theme for WordPress, in versions 1.1 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This allows injection of malicious scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, HTML payloads) that will be executed when users visit the site. This can lead to various attacks such as user redirection, defacement, or stealing user information.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through the injection of malicious scripts into the website. The exact method of injection is not specified, but it is through user input or other injection vectors within the WordPress theme.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability. This suggests that the injection point is not limited to administrative users and can be triggered by general site visitors.
