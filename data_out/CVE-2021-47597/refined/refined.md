Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2021-47597.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `idiag_expires` field within the `inet_diag_msg` structure was not initialized for UDP sockets in the `inet_sk_diag_fill()` function. This resulted in the exposure of uninitialized kernel memory to user space.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Kernel Information Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a kernel information leak. Due to the uninitialized `idiag_expires` field, the kernel was leaking potentially sensitive data to user space.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An unprivileged user could potentially gain access to sensitive kernel information, such as data residing in memory, by triggering this vulnerability. This could be useful for an attacker to further exploit the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Netlink Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through the netlink interface, specifically when requesting diagnostic information about a UDP socket.
- **`inet_sk_diag_fill()` function:** The vulnerable code resides within the `inet_sk_diag_fill()` function, which is responsible for filling in the diagnostic information.
- **`sock_diag_rcv()`:** The vulnerable code path is reachable through the `sock_diag_rcv()` which is reached via netlink messages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Unprivileged user:** An unprivileged user is sufficient to trigger this vulnerability.
- **Ability to send netlink messages:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the netlink interface to request diagnostic information.
