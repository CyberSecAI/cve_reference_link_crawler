Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an improper certificate validation process within the FortiClient software during the establishment of a ZTNA (Zero Trust Network Access) tunnel. Specifically, the client fails to properly validate the server-side certificate.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **CWE-295:**  Improper Certificate Validation. The FortiClient does not properly verify the certificate presented by the server.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker, positioned as a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM), can intercept and potentially decrypt the communication between FortiClient and FortiGate. This could lead to information disclosure or manipulation of data transmitted through the ZTNA tunnel, though the impact is scored as a medium risk with no stated impact to system availability.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** The attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between the FortiClient and FortiGate.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Unauthenticated Remote Access:** The attacker doesn't require any specific credentials to perform the MitM attack.
    *   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the network path between FortiClient and FortiGate to intercept the communication.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   FortiClientLinux 7.2.0
*   FortiClientLinux 7.0.0 through 7.0.11
*   FortiClientMac 7.2.0 through 7.2.4
*   FortiClientMac 7.0.0 through 7.0.11
*   FortiClientWindows 7.2.0 through 7.2.2
*   FortiClientWindows 7.0.0 through 7.0.11

**Solution:**
Upgrade to the following versions or later:

*   FortiClientLinux 7.2.1 or above
*   FortiClientLinux 7.0.12 or above
*   FortiClientMac 7.2.5 or above
*   FortiClientMac 7.0.12 or above
*    FortiClientWindows 7.2.3 or above
*   FortiClientWindows 7.0.12 or above
