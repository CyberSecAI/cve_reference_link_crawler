```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Kadence Blocks Pro plugin does not properly restrict access to its shortcode functionalities, allowing users with at least the contributor role to leak arbitrary options from the database.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Broken Access Control (CWE-284), specifically, insufficient authorization checks when processing shortcode attributes that can be used to access arbitrary WordPress options.
- Impact of exploitation: A contributor can use a crafted shortcode to access and view sensitive site options they should not have access to. This can lead to information disclosure.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a shortcode with specific attributes and adding it to a post, then previewing the post to expose the content of WordPress options.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have at least a contributor role in the WordPress website.
