The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47529.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by memory leaks in the error handling path of the `iwl_uefi_reduce_power_section` function in the Intel iwlwifi driver. Specifically, when an error occurs due to an invalid TLV length or a memory allocation failure, the memory allocated to `reduce_power_data` is not freed before the function returns.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory Leak: The primary vulnerability is a memory leak. If the `reduce_power_data` is allocated and an error occurs afterward, the allocated memory isn't freed, leading to a leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Resource exhaustion: Repeated exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to resource exhaustion by leaking memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the process of loading the reduced power table from UEFI.
- An attacker might trigger this by providing malformed TLV data during this UEFI power table loading process, or causing an out-of-memory condition.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the loading of the reduced power table from UEFI. This typically means an attacker needs to have some level of control or influence over the system configuration related to UEFI.
