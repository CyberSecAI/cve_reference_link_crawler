- **Root cause:** Missing bounds check in the `eemgpu` component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local escalation of privilege. An attacker with system privileges can potentially escalate to a higher privilege level.
- **Attack vectors:** Local exploitation. An attacker would need to have already gained system privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have already obtained system privileges on the affected device. User interaction is not required for the exploit to occur.
