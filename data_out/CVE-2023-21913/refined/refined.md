      "data": "The provided document is an Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory for April 2023. It lists multiple CVEs and their corresponding affected products and versions. \n\nSpecifically, CVE-2023-21913 is listed in the \"Oracle MySQL Risk Matrix\" section:\n\n| CVE ID | Product | Component | Protocol | Remote Exploit without Auth.? | CVSS VERSION 3.1 RISK |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CVE-2023-21913 | MySQL Server | Server: Optimizer | MySQL Protocol | No | 4.9 |\n\nThis indicates that the vulnerability is present in the Optimizer component of MySQL Server. It is not remotely exploitable without authentication, meaning an attacker would need valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability. The CVSS score is 4.9, which is considered a medium severity.\n\nThere is also mention of CVE-2023-21913 in the \"Credit Statement\" section, where it is mentioned that \"Jie Liang of WingTecher Lab of Tsinghua University\" and \"Jingzhou Fu of WingTecher Lab of Tsinghua University\" and \"Zhiyong Wu of WingTecher Lab of Tsinghua University\" reported the vulnerability to Oracle.\n\nNetApp also released an advisory NTAP-20230427-0007, which addresses this CVE along with other MySQL vulnerabilities. It mentions:\n\n\"Certain MySQL versions are susceptible to multiple vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all of the MySQL Server accessible data, or to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server.\"\n\n\"Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may lead to unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all of the MySQL Server accessible data, or to a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server.\"\n\n\"CVE-2023-21913 | 4.9 (MEDIUM) | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H \"\n\nThe NetApp advisory confirms the medium severity and non-remotely exploitable characteristic of the vulnerability.\n",

          "**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the Optimizer component of MySQL Server.",
          "**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker with high privileges to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Other vulnerabilities listed in the same advisory have more severe impacts such as unauthorized takeover and data access.",
          "**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could result in a hang or frequent crash of the MySQL Server, leading to a denial of service.",
          "**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is over the network through the MySQL protocol. However, this specific vulnerability requires the attacker to have high privileges on the MySQL server.",
          "**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges on the MySQL server. Remote exploitation without authentication is not possible."
