## About

###

* #### 2018

  #### Our Humble Beginnings

  In 2018, ITFlow emerged as a new Managed Service Provider (MSP) focused on open-source technology, breaking away from standard proprietary solutions. Dissatisfied with the existing options, the team developed ITFlow, a comprehensive solution addressing diverse business needs in accounting, billing, and ticketing.
* #### March 2019

  #### ITFlow published on GitHub

  By March 2019, ITFlow was ready for a wider audience. Released on GitHub, it quickly captured the interest of the MSP community, showcasing its innovative approach and broad capabilities.
* #### May 2021

  #### Team Expansion

  In May 2021, ITFlow's development team expanded with the addition of Marcus and Andrei. This growth marked a significant acceleration in the project, strengthening its impact in the MSP sector.
* #### April 2023

  #### Recognition and Growth

  As of April 2023, ITFlow has garnered over 300 stars on GitHub, signaling widespread recognition and appreciation. The team is on the brink of releasing a stable version, highlighting the project's success and potential.

## Core Team

### Lets meet the people behind the curtain that make ITFlow so fantastically great!

#### Marcus

Project Manager / Senior Developer

Our team is a mix of IT professionals working together like a finely tuned ensemble. Although ITFlow isn't our primary job, our passion for it drives us to dedicate time outside our regular MSP work and leisure activities.
