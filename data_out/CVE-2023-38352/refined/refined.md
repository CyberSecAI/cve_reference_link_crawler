- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing SSL certificate validation in the update mechanism.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure update mechanism due to lack of SSL certificate validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned to perform a MitM attack between the software and the update server.
