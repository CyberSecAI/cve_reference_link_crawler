The provided content relates to CVE-2022-49009.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `devm_kcalloc` function in the `asus-ec-sensors` driver can return NULL if memory allocation fails. The code did not check for this NULL return, leading to a potential NULL pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- NULL pointer dereference vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A NULL pointer dereference can lead to a system crash or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the `asus_ec_probe` function in a situation where `devm_kcalloc` fails to allocate memory. This could happen under memory pressure conditions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to trigger the `asus-ec-sensors` driver loading and be in a state where memory allocation can fail. This could happen with a user that has the ability to load modules, or an administrator under very high memory load.
