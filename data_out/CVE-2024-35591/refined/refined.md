The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the O2OA Enterprise Application Development Platform.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of effective filtering and escaping of user-provided data when the application provides file upload and online preview functions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious scripts are stored on the server and executed when a user previews the uploaded file.
- Insufficient input validation: The application doesn't properly sanitize or escape user-provided data, allowing injection of malicious code within files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Stealing user accounts.
- Stealing user cookies and impersonating user identity.
- Hijacking user sessions and performing arbitrary operations.
- Browser manipulation, such as displaying ads or spreading worms.
- Potential for gaining high privileges by malicious users.

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading malicious PDF and HTML files through the application's file upload functionality.
- Specifically, through the notification announcement and file circulation features.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have access to the O2OA platform and be able to upload files.
- No special privileges needed beyond the ability to upload files to the system.
