- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unauthenticated custom TCP service running on port 5432 spins up a webserver on port 8023. When an invalid HTTP request (method or path) is made to this webserver, the invalid field is unsafely copied into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Buffer overflow: The code uses `%s` format identifier to copy an unvalidated HTTP request field into a fixed-size buffer, leading to an overflow when the input exceeds buffer size.
    - Lack of input validation: The application doesn't validate the length of HTTP request fields before copying them into a buffer.
    - Lack of authentication: The TCP service on port 5432 and the webserver on 8023 have no authentication, allowing anyone on the network to trigger the vulnerability.
    - Lack of stack canaries: Absence of stack canaries makes it easier to exploit the overflow and overwrite return addresses.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) with root privileges on the Vilo router.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request with an invalid method or path to the webserver running on port 8023.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be on the same network (LAN) as the Vilo router to exploit this vulnerability, as they need access to port 8023.
