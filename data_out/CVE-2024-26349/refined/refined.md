- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `/core/tools/delete_translation.php` endpoint in Flusity-CMS v2.33 lacks CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into deleting translations without their consent by crafting a malicious HTML page containing a form that sends a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that, when submitted by a logged-in administrator, will trigger the deletion of a translation through the `/core/tools/delete_translation.php` endpoint. The victim needs to visit the malicious page while being logged into the Flusity-CMS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious HTML file and trick a logged-in Flusity-CMS administrator into visiting this page while they are authenticated to the CMS.
