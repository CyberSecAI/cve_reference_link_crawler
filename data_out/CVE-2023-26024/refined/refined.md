- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause is a vulnerability related to insecure network communication leading to potential sharing of sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure network communication that can lead to sensitive information exposure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Sensitive information could be shared due to insecure network communication. The impact is classified as "Vulnerable".
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through insecure network communication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker would need to be in a position to intercept or participate in the insecure network communication.
