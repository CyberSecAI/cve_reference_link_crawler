Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1418:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the CGC Maintenance Mode plugin that fails to properly restrict access to protected content when maintenance mode is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The plugin does not prevent unauthenticated users from accessing protected posts via the WordPress REST API, even when maintenance mode is active. This lack of access control bypasses the intended restrictions of maintenance mode.
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Protected content that should be hidden during maintenance mode is exposed through the REST API, potentially revealing sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can bypass maintenance mode and access content meant to be hidden, including potentially sensitive information.
- **Loss of Confidentiality:** The vulnerability can lead to the exposure of information that was intended to be private.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **REST API:** The vulnerability is exploited through requests to the WordPress REST API.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or to be logged into the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
- The plugin has been closed as of March 7, 2024 due to this security issue and is not available for download.
- No patch is available, and the recommended mitigation is to uninstall the plugin.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on April 3, 2024.
- The affected versions are all versions up to and including 1.2.
