## Details

### Description

The USB-HID dissector could crash on Windows.

## Impact

# Crash in USB-HID dissector on Windows

## Summary

When dissecting a PCAP with USB-HID data, a crash can happen if the string "Keyboard 5 and %" is loaded from `https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/blob/master/epan/dissectors/packet-usb-hid.c#L827`. On Windows, the spurious '%' is treated as a format string identifier and crashes further down the line.

## Steps to reproduce

Using version 3.6.8 (64-bit) on Windows 10:

`tshark.exe -V -r minimal.pcap`

OR

`wireshark.exe minimal.pcap`

## What is the current bug behavior?

Tshark parses the first 5 frames, but crashes silently before finishing to output the 5th frame. Frame 6 doesn't get printed. Wireshark will crash without any error message or error report.

## What is the expected correct behavior?

Some weird, but somewhat valid, dissected USB-HID data. The example is minimized from a much larger file in order to reproduce. Wireshark should not crash.

## Sample capture file

minimal.pcap
