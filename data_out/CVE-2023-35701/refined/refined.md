Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-35701:

**Root Cause:** Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') vulnerability in the Apache Hive JDBC driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The Hive JDBC driver is vulnerable to code injection.
*   The vulnerability allows for arbitrary command execution via a malicious JDBC URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Arbitrary code execution on the machine/endpoint where the JDBC driver (client) is running.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker sets up a malicious HTTP server.
*   The attacker crafts a malicious JDBC URL pointing to the malicious HTTP server.
*   When the JDBC client attempts a connection, the malicious server provides a crafted response, leading to code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have sufficient permissions to specify/edit JDBC URLs in an endpoint that relies on the vulnerable Hive JDBC driver.
*   The JDBC client process must run under a privileged user for full exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to the JDBC driver component of Apache Hive.
*   The issue affects Apache Hive versions from 4.0.0-alpha-1 before 4.0.0.
*   The fix is implemented in Apache Hive 4.0.0
*   This issue is tracked as HIVE-27554
