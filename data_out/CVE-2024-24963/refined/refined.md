The content is related to CVE-2024-24963.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow in the `IMM_0F_FileSelect_Handler` function within the AutomationDirect P3-550E firmware. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the use of `strncat` to construct a file path without validating the length of the attacker-provided path against the size of the destination buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists because the `strncat` function copies data into a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking. Two variations of this vulnerability are described, one when the path does not contain a backslash (`\`), and another where the path contains a backslash.
-   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to overwrite the stack, potentially leading to remote code execution on the affected device.
-   **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted network packet to UDP port 9999 on the AutomationDirect P3-550E device. The specific packet should have the `IMM` field set such that the handler at offset `0xb6df0` is called, and the path length field should be greater than 0x100.
-   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send unauthenticated network packets to the target device on UDP port 9999. No prior authentication or specific privileges are needed.
