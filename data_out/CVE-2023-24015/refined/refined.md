- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of input. Specifically, the application fails to properly handle a null value for the report name when saving a report.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application allows a malicious authenticated user to save a report with a null name. This leads to a partial denial-of-service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The reports section becomes partially unavailable. The report list will be stuck on loading, preventing users from accessing and managing reports.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious authenticated user can exploit the vulnerability by forcing a report to be saved with a null name through the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a valid user with the ability to create and save reports.
