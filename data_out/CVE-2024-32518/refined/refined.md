Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a **Broken Access Control** issue. Specifically, it stems from a lack of proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks within a function of the "PeproDev Ultimate Invoice" plugin. This missing security measure allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should only be accessible to users with higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The primary weakness is the **lack of access control**. The plugin does not sufficiently verify user permissions before allowing actions to be performed, thus allowing unauthorized access and potential manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is that an unauthenticated user can perform actions that should only be done by privileged users. The specific impact depends on the function being called and the actions it performs. This could include the unauthorized modification of invoice data, access to sensitive information, or other malicious activities, depending on the context and function vulnerable.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the vulnerable function in the "PeproDev Ultimate Invoice" plugin. The lack of access controls allows an attacker to directly call this function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker does not need any authentication/privileges to exploit this vulnerability. They can be unauthenticated.

**Additional Details:**
