Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4789

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization and validation within the `send_demo_webhook()` function of the Cost Calculator Builder Pro plugin. This function allows sending requests to arbitrary URLs, creating a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The plugin allows an attacker to make requests to arbitrary URLs from the server hosting the WordPress site, leading to potential information disclosure, internal network scanning, or even internal system compromise.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially access sensitive information from internal services or resources not meant to be publicly exposed.
- **Internal Network Scanning:** An attacker can use the vulnerable function to scan the internal network for open ports and services, potentially leading to further attacks.
- **Modification of internal services**: An attacker can modify information in internal services.
- **Other Potential Impacts:** Depending on the internal services available, an attacker could potentially achieve further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `send_demo_webhook()` function, which is accessible to authenticated users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level access.
- **Access to the vulnerable function:** The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable `send_demo_webhook()` function, most likely via a crafted request or exploiting other plugin functionality that uses this function.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Cost Calculator Builder Pro plugin up to and including version 3.1.72.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 3.1.73.
- The vulnerability was discovered by haidv35 - VCS

This vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to make web requests to arbitrary locations, which can be used to query and modify information from internal services.
