Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `project_id` parameter when adding a project. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `project_id` parameter in `add_project.php`. This vulnerability is located in the "Project Selection Page" component specifically in the `project_selection.php` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    - Gain unauthorized access to the database.
    - Modify or delete data.
    - Potentially gain control over the server hosting the database if the database user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the application by manipulating the `project_id` parameter, specifically when adding a project.
- The attacker crafts a malicious SQL payload within the `project_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the web interface and manipulate HTTP requests.
- They do not need to be authenticated, meaning it can be exploited remotely.
- The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques and familiarity with tools like Burp Suite and sqlmap.
- The vulnerability is triggered when adding a project, which implies an interaction with the project creation functionality within the application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the "Project Worlds Student Project Allocation System."
- The vulnerable file is `/student/project_selection/project_selection.php` specifically within the project selection page.
- The injection point is the `project_id` parameter.
- The provided demonstration shows how to intercept the traffic with Burp Suite, modify the `project_id` parameter and use sqlmap to exploit the vulnerability.
- The exploit is demonstrated on the `add_project.php` endpoint by intercepting the traffic of the "Add" project function.
