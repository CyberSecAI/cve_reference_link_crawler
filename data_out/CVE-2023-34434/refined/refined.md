Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2023-34434:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability. The vulnerability arises due to a flaw in how Apache InLong handles the `allowLoadLocalInfileInPath` parameter in JDBC URLs, which allows for bypassing the intended logic.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Deserialization of Untrusted Data.
-  Improper input validation of the `allowLoadLocalInfileInPath` parameter.
- Logic bypass leading to arbitrary file reading.

**Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary file reading is possible. An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information by reading files on the server.

**Attack vectors:** By manipulating the JDBC URL to include malicious input within the `allowLoadLocalInfileInPath` parameter, an attacker can bypass the expected logic and trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the JDBC URL that is processed by the vulnerable Apache InLong instance.
