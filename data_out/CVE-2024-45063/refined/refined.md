- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ctl_write_buffer` function incorrectly set a flag, leading to a Use-After-Free condition when a command finished processing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-After-Free vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - In the context of bhyve hypervisor, malicious software in a guest VM can exploit the vulnerability to achieve code execution on the host in the bhyve userspace process, which typically runs as root. The bhyve process is sandboxed using Capsicum, so the malicious code execution is constrained by the available capabilities.
    - A malicious iSCSI initiator could achieve remote code execution on the iSCSI target host.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Guest virtual machines using virtio_scsi interface can send SCSI commands to the kernel driver, which exposes the vulnerability.
    - Malicious iSCSI initiators can send commands to the target.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - In the case of bhyve, the attacker needs to be able to run malicious software within a guest VM that has access to the virtio_scsi interface.
    - In the case of iSCSI target, the attacker needs to be able to send malicious commands to the iSCSI target.
