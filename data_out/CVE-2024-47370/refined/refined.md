- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Author Avatars List/Block Plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to inject scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website, which will be executed when guests visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious scripts into the plugin's functionality. The specific injection point is not detailed but it is within the scope of the plugin itself.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the privileges of a subscriber to inject the malicious script.
