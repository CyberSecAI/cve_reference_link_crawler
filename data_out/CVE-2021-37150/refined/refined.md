The provided content relates to CVE-2021-37150.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in header parsing of Apache Traffic Server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the way Apache Traffic Server handles header parsing, specifically when dealing with secure resources. This improper validation allows attackers to bypass security measures.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can request secure resources that they would otherwise be restricted from accessing. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or functionality.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests with maliciously formed headers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable instance of Apache Traffic Server.
