###### Functionality

We use BrainCert to deliver group classes to students all over the world. It has superior technology and has never encountered a problem.

###### Ease of use

I love how easy it is to use the product. The classes were launched on the same day after custom branding and SSL certificate were setup.

###### Support

We receive top-notch support through their chat and ticketing system. We always receive a quick response from support.

###### Documentation

BrainCert has an extensive knowledge base and API documentation. Our developer quickly added custom workflows to the Joomla plugin.

I used this to:
We deliver live classes every day to more than 200 students. All our classes are recorded and whiteboards are saved for students to review later. We love the free LaTex and Wolfram add-ons and the performance of the whiteboard.
