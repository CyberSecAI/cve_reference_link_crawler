Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The DedeCMS application, specifically version 5.7.113, fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. The `mnum` parameter in the `cards_make.php` script is directly used in the application's output without any form of encoding or filtering.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize or encode user input before displaying it on the web page.
*   **Direct Use of User Input:** The `mnum` parameter is directly used in the output without proper processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when the affected page is viewed.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can potentially steal user cookies, leading to session hijacking.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** The attacker could redirect the user to malicious websites, steal sensitive data, or deface the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious URL with a script in the `mnum` parameter.
*   **Specific Script:**  The vulnerable script is `cards_make.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Script:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable script (`cards_make.php`) and the affected parameter (`mnum`).
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker must be able to create a URL containing the malicious script payload.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided content includes Proof of Concept (POC) URLs demonstrating how to exploit the XSS vulnerability.
*   The content also shows case reproduction examples with a live instance.
*   The vulnerable parameter is initially reported as "typeid", but later corrected to "mnum".
*   The login credentials (admin/admin) for the test instance are exposed.
