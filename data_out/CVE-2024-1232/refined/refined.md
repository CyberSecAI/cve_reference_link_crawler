- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CM Download Manager plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks in certain areas, specifically when deleting downloads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  CSRF vulnerability, specifically the absence of CSRF protection when deleting downloads.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Attackers can trick logged-in administrators into deleting downloads without their consent.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed via a malicious URL.  An attacker would need to craft a malicious link to `/cmdownload/del/id/<download_id>` and trick a logged-in administrator into visiting this URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to persuade a logged-in administrator to click a specially crafted link.
