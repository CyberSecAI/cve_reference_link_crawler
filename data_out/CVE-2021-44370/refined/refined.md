- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `cgiserver.cgi` JSON command parser in Reolink RLC-410W does not properly validate the type of the "param" JSON element. It assumes that the "param" element is always a JSON object, but if a string or other non-object type is provided, the code will attempt to access it as an object, leading to an assertion failure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation. The application does not validate the type of data being processed, leading to an assertion failure when accessing the `param` element with the subscription operator when it is not a JSON object
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service condition, causing the `cgiserver.cgi` process to crash and the device to reboot.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request with a JSON body to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint. The JSON body should contain a command with a `param` value that is not a JSON object, but a string, or other non-object type.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. While most of these commands require authentication, it is noted that they can be called without authentication using a related vulnerability.
