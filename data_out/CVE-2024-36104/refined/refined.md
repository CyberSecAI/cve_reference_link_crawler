Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36104:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory," also known as a Path Traversal vulnerability. This means the application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing file paths, allowing an attacker to access or manipulate files or directories outside of the intended restricted directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal vulnerability, which can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can allow an attacker to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE). This means the attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable Apache OFBiz instance.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through manipulating the pathname used by the application. The specific method of manipulation is not detailed in this content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests that manipulate pathnames handled by the application. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as the provided text classifies this as a "pre-authN" vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Apache OFBiz versions before 18.12.14. It is fixed in version 18.12.14.
- The vulnerability was discovered by godspeed (AAA@ZJU).
- The fix was implemented with commits [d33ce31012](https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=ofbiz-framework.git;h=d33ce31012) and [474e806816](https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=ofbiz-framework.git;h=474e806816).
- It's classified as a "major" issue in the Jira tracker.
