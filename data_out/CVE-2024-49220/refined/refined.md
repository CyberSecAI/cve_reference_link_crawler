- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Cookie Scanner plugin <= 1.1 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack can allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the plugin, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or data manipulation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into executing it, usually through a link or embedded content in a webpage or email.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They need to be able to convince a logged-in user to trigger the crafted malicious request.
