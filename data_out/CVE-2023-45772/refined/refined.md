- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Proofreading Plugin (versions <= 1.0.11) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin contains an XSS vulnerability, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts will be executed when guests visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script into a vulnerable input field or parameter that will be reflected back on the webpage. The vulnerability is unauthenticated, meaning no user authentication is required to perform this attack.
