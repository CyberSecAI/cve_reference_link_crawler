Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5074

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a static key ("D-Link") to sign JWT tokens used for authentication in D-Link D-View 8. Additionally, the system does not properly validate API keys included in the JWT when no API key is configured for the user, particularly the default 'admin' user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Static JWT Key:** The hardcoded "D-Link" key allows attackers to forge valid JWT tokens.
2.  **Insufficient API Key Validation:** The system does not verify the API key provided in a JWT token if the corresponding user has not configured one, specifically the default admin user that doesn't come with an API key configured by default.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to protected APIs. The attacker can access user information and potentially perform administrative functions. The provided proof of concept shows how an attacker can access user information with a crafted JWT.

**Attack Vectors:**
A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a valid JWT token with the static key and then using it to access the APIs. This is done by creating a JWT token with the user id of the default 'admin' user and signing the token with the static key 'D-Link'.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have network access to the D-View 8 application. They need to know the default user ID for the 'admin' user, and the static key "D-Link" to create a valid JWT token.
