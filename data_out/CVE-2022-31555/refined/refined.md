**General Observations:**

*   **Common Weakness:** All of these CVEs highlight a common weakness which is the unsafe usage of the Flask's `send_file` function, a classic example of CWE-22 (Path Traversal) .
*   **Attack Pattern:**  The core problem is that user-provided input (typically a file path) is not properly sanitized before being passed to the `send_file` function. This allows an attacker to provide a malicious path that can access files and directories outside the intended scope.
*   **Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is present in the Flask application's code that uses the `send_file` function, which serves static content. 
*   **Impact:** The impact across all is that an attacker can read sensitive information outside of the intended directories, potentially leading to exposure of configuration files, application code, or other sensitive data, and in some cases may be able to overwrite the files.
*   **Mitigation:** The content suggests using `flask.safe_join` or replacing `flask.send_file` calls with `flask.send_from_directory` to prevent the path traversal.
*   **Unreviewed Status:** The high number of "Unreviewed" advisories indicates that this set of vulnerabilities was discovered through an automated analysis process and not necessarily by manual analysis of a software package, it is not clear if the identified vulnerabilities are exploitable in practice.

It is worth noting that all the CVEs mentioned are related to the same root cause with similar exploitation patterns. The core issue is with unsanitized user input combined with the use of flask `send_file` calls.
