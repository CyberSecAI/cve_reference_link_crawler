Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The MojoBox smart lock utilizes a vulnerable implementation of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication. Specifically, it does not properly implement replay protection for BLE commands used to unlock the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **BLE Replay Attack:** The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility to replay attacks. Captured BLE packets that trigger the lock mechanism can be replayed at any time to unlock the device without proper authentication. The device does not check for the uniqueness of the packet, making it possible to reuse the same packet for unlocking.
*   **Unobfuscated Code:** The Android mobile application code is not obfuscated, making reverse engineering and analysis easier. This allowed the researchers to extract the encryption key, encryption function and input parameters to generate valid unlock packets.
*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The application uses hardcoded encryption keys within the code.
*   **Insecure Data Storage:** Usernames and passwords are stored in an unencrypted SQLite database within the mobile application.
*   **Insecure Data Transmission:** The *user_code* parameter, which is used to retrieve user information is sent via GET request, exposing critical user data.
*   **Lack of Security Best Practices:** The device does not implement standard BLE security measures like pairing or encryption that could prevent such attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the MojoBox by replaying captured BLE packets. This means they can open the lock without the need for the correct PIN or access credentials.
*   **Privacy Breach:** Usernames and passwords stored in the database can be stolen if physical access to the device is obtained. This could lead to further unauthorized access of the userâ€™s account.
*   **Firmware Download:** Attackers can download the firmware for further analysis, potentially revealing further vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **BLE Sniffing:** Attackers can use BLE sniffing tools to capture the communication between the mobile application and the MojoBox. This allows them to obtain the necessary packets to replay.
*   **Mobile Application Reverse Engineering:** The lack of obfuscation allows for easy reverse engineering of the mobile application to understand the BLE communication, obtain encryption keys, and generate valid unlock requests.
*   **Physical Access to Mobile Device:**  An attacker with physical access to the mobile device running the application can extract the necessary packets from the app's logs via `adb`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity to Device:** The attacker must be within BLE range of the MojoBox to sniff and replay BLE traffic.
*   **Technical Skills:** The attacker needs knowledge of BLE communication, mobile application analysis (Android APK), and tools like Frida, `adb`, and Wireshark.
*   **Access to Mobile App:** The attacker can either use their own mobile device or use a compromised device to extract required information.
*   **Optional Physical Access:** Physical access to the mobile device is an optional vector that simplifies the extraction of the BLE packets from logs.
