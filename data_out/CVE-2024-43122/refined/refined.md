Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a **Broken Access Control** issue in the Robin image optimizer plugin. This means that certain functions lack proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The plugin fails to properly restrict access to certain functions or features, allowing unprivileged users (specifically, subscribers) to execute actions that should require higher privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The impact is described as "moderately dangerous and expected to become exploited".  The specific impact will vary depending on the vulnerable function, but could allow unauthorized actions. This is a general description of the vulnerability type, the content does not specify a specific impact for this CVE.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is not explicitly detailed but involves exploiting the broken access controls within the plugin. An attacker needs to find a function that does not properly enforce access restrictions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a **Subscriber** level user account, or lower.
