  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin insufficiently sanitizes input and escapes output, specifically within the style attributes.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Authenticated attackers with contributor access or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "By injecting malicious scripts through the style attributes.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor access or higher."
