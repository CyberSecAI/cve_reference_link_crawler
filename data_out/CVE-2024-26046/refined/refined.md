- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS) vulnerability, specifically a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input, which allows malicious scripts to be stored and later executed within the application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of a user's browser session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring low attack complexity (AC:L). It requires a low privileged attacker (PR:L), user interaction (UI:R), and the scope is changed (S:C) as the injected script is executed in a different context.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires low privileges and must be able to inject malicious script into the application which is later viewed by other users.
