# Detection: Splunk Unauthorized Experimental Items Creation

Updated Date: 2024-10-17
ID: 84afda04-0cd6-466b-869e-70d6407d0a34
Author: Rod Soto, Chase Franklin
[Type: Hunting](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

This hunting search provides information on finding possible creation of unauthorized items against /experimental endpoint.

### Search

```
1`splunkda` */experimental/* method=POST
2| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by clientip method uri_path uri status
3| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
4| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
5| `splunk_unauthorized_experimental_items_creation_filter`

```
### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [security\_content\_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml) | `convert timeformat="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" ctime($field$)` |
| splunk\_unauthorized\_experimental\_items\_creation\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_unauthorized_experimental_items_creation_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

Requires access to internal indexes.

### Known False Positives

Not all requests are going to be malicious, there will be false positives, however operator must find suspicious items that might have been created by an unauthorized user.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Possible unauthorized creation of experimental items from $clientip$ | 5 | 5 | 100 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.

**CVSSv3.1 Score:** 4.3, Medium

**CVSSv3.1 Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**CWE:** [CWE-862](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/862.html)

**Bug ID:** VULN-15941

## Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10 and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.1.2312.200 and 9.1.2308.207, a low-privileged user that does not hold the “admin” or “power” Splunk roles could create experimental items.

## Solution

Upgrade Splunk Enterprise to versions 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10, or higher.

Splunk is performing upgrades on Splunk Cloud Platform instances as part of Routine Maintenance for customers, as described in the Splunk Cloud Platform Maintenance Policy. In the meantime, Splunk is actively monitoring for potential issues that could arise from this vulnerability.
