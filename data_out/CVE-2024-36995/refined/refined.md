Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36995:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks in Splunk's REST API, specifically when handling requests to create "experimental items". This allows low-privileged users, who should not have the ability, to create these items.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control (CWE-862):** The primary weakness is the missing or inadequate authorization checks, allowing users without the required "admin" or "power" roles to perform actions they are not meant to do.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Modification:** Low-privileged users can create "experimental items," potentially leading to unintended configurations or manipulations within the Splunk environment. This could lead to unexpected behavior or security risks if these experimental features are not handled correctly.
- **Compromised Integrity:**  While the provided CVSS vector indicates a low impact on confidentiality and availability, the ability to modify system configurations, albeit through "experimental items", implies that the integrity of the system can be compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access (AV:N):** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network, using Splunk's REST API.
- **Low Privileged Access(PR:L):** An attacker needs to have low-privilege access to Splunk.
- **User Interaction not Required (UI:N):** No user interaction needed

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low-Privilege Account:** The attacker must have a valid Splunk user account, even one with limited privileges.
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to send requests to the Splunk instance's REST API.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a detection rule for identifying exploitation of this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Splunk Enterprise versions 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10 and Splunk Cloud Platform versions 9.1.2312.200 and 9.1.2308.207.
*   The associated detection rule's description mentions "unauthorized items against /experimental endpoint" which gives more context than CVE description.
