Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The School Fees Management System v1.0 lacks proper access controls, allowing users with insufficient privileges to access administrative functionalities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A regular user can directly access administrative URLs without proper authorization checks.
*   **Unrestricted Access to Admin Functionality:**  The system does not prevent unauthorized users from accessing administrative pages and performing privileged actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can gain administrator-level privileges.
*   **Administrative Actions:** Attackers can perform unauthorized administrative actions, including:
    *   Adding new user accounts.
    *   Deleting existing user accounts.
    *  Managing classes and terms
    *   Changing system settings.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** Attackers can bypass the intended user interface by directly accessing administrative URLs (e.g., `/ci_fms/admin/management/users`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account within the system (e.g., parent account).
*   **Knowledge of Admin URLs:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the administrative URLs.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the web application.
