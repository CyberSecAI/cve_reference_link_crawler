- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of displayed data when an administrator views managed device configurations in the installation revision history of the FortiManager GUI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute unauthorized code or commands within the context of the victim's browser session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when an administrator views the configuration of managed devices under revision history. An attacker would need to inject malicious code into the device configuration data, which is later displayed to the administrator.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to modify or inject malicious code into the configuration of a managed device. A low-privileged administrator account is enough to view the configuration history and trigger the vulnerability.
