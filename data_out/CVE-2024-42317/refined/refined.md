Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commits:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is that the kernel's huge page memory management allowed the creation of page caches larger than what the xarray data structure could handle. Specifically, on ARM64 systems with a 64KB base page size, it was possible to create 512MB page caches when collapsing huge pages, exceeding the `MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER` limitation enforced by the xarray. This limitation exists because the xarray doesn't support arbitrary page cache sizes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Page Cache Size Handling:** The kernel did not properly restrict the size of page caches created during huge page collapsing, allowing them to exceed the xarray's capacity.
- **Xarray Limitation:** The xarray data structure has a defined limit on the maximum supported page cache size (`MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER`), which was being violated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Warning/Error:** When a page cache larger than `MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER` was created and the xarray entry was split, a warning was raised in the kernel logs (`WARNING: CPU: ... at lib/xarray.c:1025 xas_split_alloc`).
- **Potential Instability:** Although the provided information only shows a warning, exceeding the intended size could lead to unexpected behavior, potential memory corruption, or other instability issues. The description of the fix mentions that the test program fails with `-EINVAL` which indicates an invalid operation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **`madvise()` System Call:** The vulnerability is triggered by using `madvise()` system call with the `MADV_HUGEPAGE` and `MADV_COLLAPSE` options to manipulate memory mappings into huge pages. 
- **File Operations (fallocate):** The test case uses `fallocate` with `FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE` to further trigger the issue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to execute code on the target system:** An attacker needs to be able to execute code to create a memory mapping, populate it, and use the `madvise` system call to collapse the mapping into huge pages.
- **Knowledge of file operations:** the attacker will need to perform file operations to trigger the bug
- **Privileges to call mmap, madvise and fallocate:** The attacker must have sufficient privileges to perform operations that manipulate the memory mappings and files.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided test code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability on an ARM64 system with a 64KB base page size.
- The fix involves modifying `THP_ORDERS_ALL` macro in `include/linux/huge_mm.h` and `__thp_vma_allowable_orders` function in `mm/huge_memory.c` to enforce page cache size restrictions, differentiating between DAX and non-DAX files. This fix prevents the creation of oversized page caches. The fix disallows 512MB page caches on non-DAX files on ARM64 systems with a 64KB base page size.
- The patch introduces a distinction between `THP_ORDERS_ALL_FILE_DAX` and `THP_ORDERS_ALL_FILE_DEFAULT`. DAX files are excluded from the MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER restriction since their folios are never split.
- The vulnerability is fixed by limiting the allowable orders for file-backed THP based on the `MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER` restriction.
