Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Unrestricted SQL injection vulnerability in the `fetch_genderit.php` file of the Online Graduate Tracer System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `request` parameter before using it in an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
   - Retrieval of sensitive information from the database (e.g., database name, user data).
   - Modification or deletion of data.
   - Compromise of the server if the database user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/tracking/admin/fetch_genderit.php` with a malicious SQL injection payload in the `request` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. The provided example demonstrates that the attacker does not need to be authenticated but needs to know the specific vulnerable endpoint and parameter.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided POC uses the `updatexml()` function in MySQL to extract the database name:
    ```sql
    request=1'+and+updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(database())),3)--+q
    ```
  - The `concat(0x7e,(database()))` part is used to concatenate the database name with a tilde (0x7e) so the output can be observed more easily by the attacker.
   - The `--+q` at the end of the payload is a comment to ensure the rest of the query does not interfere and the + sign allows the query to be URL encoded without being interpreted as a space.
