- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The cronjob file `clean_secbi_old_logs` is writable by all users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper file permissions (CWE-732). The cron job is executed as root, and the file is writable by all users which allows any user to modify the script to execute arbitrary commands as root.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Privilege escalation. Any user can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access. An attacker with a low-privileged account on the system can modify the cronjob file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system and have the ability to modify files.
