#### Description

Hi, developers, thank you for your checking. It seems the lock **thd->ctrl\_mutex** is not correctly released if it goes to the **error**, so there is a missing unlock in the \*error \*branch

| ``` 		pthread_mutex_lock(&thd->ctrl_mutex); ``` |
| --- |
| ```   ``` |
| ``` 		if (pthread_create(&thd->id, NULL, compress_worker_thread_func, ``` |
| ``` 				   thd)) { ``` |
| ``` 			msg("compress: pthread_create() failed: " ``` |
| ``` 			    "errno = %d", errno); ``` |
| ``` 			goto err; ``` |
| ``` 		} ``` |
| ``` 	} ``` |
| ```   ``` |
| ``` 	/* Wait for the threads to start */ ``` |
| ``` 	for (i = 0; i < n; i++) { ``` |
| ``` 		comp_thread_ctxt_t *thd = threads + i; ``` |
| ```   ``` |
| ``` 		while (thd->started == FALSE) ``` |
| ``` 			pthread_cond_wait(&thd->ctrl_cond, &thd->ctrl_mutex); ``` |
| ``` 		pthread_mutex_unlock(&thd->ctrl_mutex); ``` |
| ``` 	} ``` |
| ```   ``` |
| ``` 	return threads; ``` |
| ```   ``` |
| ``` err: ``` |
| ``` 	my_free(threads); ``` |
| ``` 	return NULL; ``` |
| ``` }  ``` |
