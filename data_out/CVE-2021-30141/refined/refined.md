Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-30141:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `/settings/userexport` path in Friendica was accessible to unauthenticated users.
- While the export functionality required a user ID, the lack of access control allowed unauthenticated users to trigger the export code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of authentication/authorization checks before allowing access to the `/settings/userexport` path.
- **Information Exposure (limited):** Although the export functionality was intended to provide user data, the vulnerability allowed an unauthenticated user to trigger the export, which lead to the system attempting to export data with `uid = 0`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Limited Information Disclosure:** An unauthenticated user could trigger an export of user data for `uid = 0`. This user corresponds to the dummy system account created on Friendica install. It exposed:
    - The dummy system user's cryptographic key pair, which is used when interacting with relay servers and fetching public content. This does not allow impersonating users or authenticate messages.
    - Public information about local and remote contacts with `uid=0`.
    - Information about public local and remote posts for `uid=0`.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The attempt to export data, especially contacts and all posts, could potentially lead to a PHP memory limit being hit on the server due to the size of data, causing a denial of service for the user attempting to export.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated HTTP Request:** An attacker could simply access the vulnerable path `.../settings/userexport` via a web browser or other HTTP client, without needing to log in.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker would only need network access to the Friendica instance. No prior authentication or special privileges are needed.
