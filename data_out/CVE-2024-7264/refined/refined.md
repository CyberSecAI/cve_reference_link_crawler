Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-7264

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `GTime2str()` function within libcurl's ASN.1 parser, used for parsing ASN.1 Generalized Time fields, has a flaw.
- When provided with a syntactically incorrect time field, the parser can calculate a length of -1 for the time fraction.
- This negative length is then used in a `strlen()` call on a heap buffer that is not null terminated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) due to the use of a negative length value and the subsequent call to `strlen()` on a non-null-terminated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a crash due to the invalid `strlen()` operation.
- In some cases, exploitation may also result in heap contents being leaked to the application when `CURLINFO_CERTINFO` is used, due to the out-of-bounds read.
- The curl command line tool is also affected.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by providing a malformed ASN.1 Generalized Time field during TLS handshake.
- The attack occurs after a successful TLS handshake (if the TLS library does not reject the malformed date string).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be in a position to supply a crafted ASN.1 Generalized Time field as part of a TLS handshake to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present only when curl is built with GnuTLS, Schannel, Secure Transport, or mbedTLS TLS backends.
- The bug was initially introduced in curl 7.32.0 but was used with a no-longer supported backend. It was later introduced to other backends, starting from:
    - GnuTLS: 7.42.0
    - Schannel: 7.50.0
    - Secure Transport: 7.79.0
    - mbedTLS: 8.9.0
- The vulnerability is fixed in curl 8.9.1
- The fix was a follow-up to a previous, incomplete fix.
- NetApp products have also been identified as affected by this vulnerability.
