Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-48715:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the names of releases were not properly escaped on the edition page of a release. Specifically, the `frs_show_release_popup2` function within `src/www/file/file_utils.php` was not sanitizing the 'release\_name' when building the select box.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS.  The lack of proper sanitization of the release name when rendering the HTML select dropdown allows a malicious actor to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable application. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the application
    - Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is network-based. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction, specifically a user with write permissions in the File Release System (FRS) accessing the release edit page.
- **Exploitation Steps:**
    1.  An attacker with FRS release creation rights creates a release with a malicious name containing a XSS payload (e.g., `"></select><img src=a onerror=alert(1)>`).
    2.  A victim with FRS write permissions edits another release. The malicious release name is loaded into the dropdown, which triggers the XSS when the page is rendered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create FRS releases, which means they require an account on the Tuleap instance.
- The attacker must entice a user with write permissions in FRS to view the vulnerable edit page.
- The attacker needs a low privilege account.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code was located in `src/www/file/file_utils.php` in the functions `frs_show_release_popup2`.
- The fix involved sanitizing the `name` and `package_name` variables using `htmlPurifier` before using them in HTML elements.

**Patch Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Tuleap Community Edition version 15.2.99.103.
- Tuleap Enterprise Edition versions 15.2-4 and 15.1-8 also contain the fix.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was identified through Psalm taint analysis, a static analysis tool.
- The fix was committed with commit hash `ea71ec7ee062aae8d1fa7a7325aaa759205c17d8`
