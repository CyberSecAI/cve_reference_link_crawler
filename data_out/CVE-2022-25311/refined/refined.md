- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The software does not properly check privileges between users during the same web browser session, leading to an unintended sphere of control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper privilege management (CWE-269).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated low-privileged user can achieve privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through a web browser session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated low-privileged user with access to the affected system. User interaction is required. If SSO is established and the user is authenticated in both Control and Operation, it's recommended to log out explicitly in both to avoid privilege escalation.
