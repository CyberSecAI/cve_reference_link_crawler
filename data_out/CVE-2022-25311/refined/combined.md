SSA-250085: Multiple Vulnerabilities in SINEC NMS and SINEMA
Server

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.3

2022-03-08
2023-10-10
V1.3

SUMMARY

SINEC NMS and SINEMA Server V14 contain multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary code on the system, arbitrary commands on the local database or achieve privilege
escalation.

Siemens has released several updates for SINEC NMS and recommends to update to the latest version.
Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• CVE-2022-25311: If SSO was established and user is authenticated in both Control and Operation,
it is recommended to logout explicitly in both Control and Operation to avoid privilege escalation
• Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to port 443/tcp, to trusted IP addresses only

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINEC NMS is a new generation of the Network Management System (NMS) for the Digital Enterprise.
This system can be used to centrally monitor, manage, and conﬁgure networks.

SINEMA Server is a network monitoring and management software designed by Siemens for use in
Industrial Ethernet networks.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-24281

A privileged authenticated attacker could execute arbitrary commands in the local database by sending
specially crafted requests to the webserver of the affected application.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

7.2
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an
SQL Command (’SQL Injection’)

Vulnerability CVE-2022-24282

The affected system allows to upload JSON objects that are deserialized to Java objects. Due to
insecure deserialization of user-supplied content by the affected software, a privileged attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted serialized Java object. This could allow the
attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device with root privileges.

CWE

7.2
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:T/RC:C
CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data

Vulnerability CVE-2022-25311

The affected software do not properly check privileges between users during the same web browser
session, creating an unintended sphere of control. This could allow an authenticated low privileged
user to achieve privilege escalation.
