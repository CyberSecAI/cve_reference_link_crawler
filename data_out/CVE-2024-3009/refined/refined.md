Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-3009:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `formWriteFacMac` function within the `/goform/WriteFacMac` file of Tenda FH1205 routers.
- The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `mac` argument.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection (CWE-77):** The application constructs a command using externally influenced input (`mac` parameter) without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands that will be executed by the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:**  Attackers can potentially access sensitive information stored on the router.
- **Integrity:**  Attackers can modify system settings and configurations.
- **Availability:** Attackers can disrupt the router's normal operation, potentially causing a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely, likely via HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface.
- No authentication is mentioned as required for exploitation in the vulnerability description, suggesting this vulnerability may be exploitable without prior authentication.
- A proof-of-concept exploit is publicly available, making exploitation easier.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Tenda FH1205 version 2.0.0.7(775).
- The vendor was contacted but did not respond.
- There are no known countermeasures available other than replacing the device.
- The vulnerability is considered easy to exploit.
- The vulnerability is tracked by MITRE ATT&CK technique T1202.
