The provided content relates to CVE-2024-35362.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists due to the improper handling of user-supplied input (`$_POST['cur_url']`) in `ecshop/article_cat.php`. The value is assigned to the variable `$search_url` without any filtering or sanitization. This `$search_url` variable is then directly concatenated into HTML form elements within the `ecshop/temp/compiled/article_cat.dwt.php` template, which is reflected back to the user, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
- Cookie theft and session hijacking
- Defacement of the website
- Redirection to malicious sites
- Unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker can craft a malicious URL or form that includes the malicious script in the `cur_url` parameter. The user has to visit the crafted URL or submit the crafted form data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and deliver malicious links or forms to the user. This can be achieved through social engineering, phishing campaigns or by compromising other parts of the web application.
- The attacker needs no special access to the server itself.
