```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks proper sanitization of the agent ID during the registration process, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the logs which are displayed in the admin panel.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Lack of input sanitization"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can achieve remote code execution (RCE) on machines controlled by the NorthStar C2 server by injecting malicious javascript into the logs, which will then execute when an operator visits the logs page. This allows the attacker to exfiltrate the operator's session cookie, hijack their active C2 sessions and transfer them to the attacker, effectively taking control of the compromised machines.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor sends crafted HTTP requests containing a specially crafted agent ID to the `login.php` endpoint, which will then be stored into the logs database.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the NorthStar C2 server. No authentication is required for exploitation, because the vulnerable endpoint is part of the agent registration process."
