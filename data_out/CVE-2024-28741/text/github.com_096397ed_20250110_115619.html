NorthStarC2 is an open-source command and control framework developed for penetration testing and red teaming purposes by [Engin Demirbilek](https://twitter.com/Nginthenoob).

NorthStar C2 Framework consists of two applications, a server-side GUI web application for managing sessions and a client-side stager to communicate with C2 server.

# Quick Installation

`git clone https://github.com/EnginDemirbilek/NorthStarC2.git`

`cd NorthStarC2/`

`chmod +x install.sh`

`sudo ./install.sh`

In order to install the NorthStar C2 properly and get the best experience possible, please refer to [Wiki page](https://github.com/EnginDemirbilek/NorthStarC2/wiki)

Client-Side: C # .NET

Server-Side: PHP, JS, HTML, CSS

Currently, the client-side application (NorthStar Stager) has the following functions:

* Connecting to the C2 Server via HTTP or HTTPS,
* Receiving commands from the server-side application and responding to the command via HTTP methods,
* Encrypting the communication traffic with XOR and obfuscating it with Base64,
* Copying itself to a different directory,
* Persistance through start-up folders and schtasks,
* Host Reconnaissance : Hostname, Username, Current Privileges, Exec Dir and Process ID,
* Privilege Escalation : UAC bypass through eventvwr.exe,
* Taking screenshots and saving them into a directory,
* Uploading any file to the victim machine,
* Downloading any file from the victim machine,
* SAM dump via reg save command,
* Changing the working directory,
* View the files and folders in the directory,
* Viewing the contents of the files,
* Deleting files,
* Send commands directly on cmd.exe.

Currently, server-side application has the following functions:

* User-Friendly GUI with everything needed to manage sessions opened by the stager.
