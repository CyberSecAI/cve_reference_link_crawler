Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3690:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer leak in the Undertow web server when handling incoming WebSocket PONG messages. If a WebSocket endpoint does not have a handler for `PongMessage` and sends PING messages, the server fails to properly release the buffer allocated for the incoming PONG response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Leak:** The core weakness is the failure to deallocate a buffer after receiving a WebSocket PONG frame, leading to memory exhaustion.
- **Missing Handler:** The vulnerability is triggered when a WebSocket endpoint doesn't register a message handler for `PongMessage`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer leak causes memory exhaustion, leading to `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Direct buffer memory` exceptions. This can cause the server to stop servicing any requests (including non-websocket connections), resulting in a denial of service.
- **Resource Exhaustion:**  The leak affects the `java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=direct` mbean, causing the memory used by the direct buffer pool to grow continuously until it exhausts the available memory.
- **Server Instability:** In the provided logs, the server throws  `XNIO001007` errors, and with leak detection enabled, "Buffer leak detected" errors are logged, indicating instability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **WebSocket Connection:** The vulnerability is triggered by establishing a WebSocket connection to a vulnerable server.
- **Sending PING Messages:** The server-side endpoint initiates the vulnerability by sending a PING message, which then receives a PONG response. If the server doesn't handle the PONG response correctly, a leak is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to establish a WebSocket connection to the target server to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Ability to Initiate Connections:** The attacker must be able to send an initial request to the server so that the server will then send PING messages to the client.

**Additional Details:**
- **Workaround:**  The issue can be mitigated by adding a `MessageHandler` for `PongMessage` in the `onOpen` method of the WebSocket endpoint, which handles the incoming PONG and prevents the leak by releasing the buffer.
- **Affected Versions:**  The provided information indicates that the vulnerability was resolved in Undertow versions 2.2.10.Final, 2.0.40.Final, and 1.4.18.SP13.
- **Patch:** A fix was implemented in the project and is available at  `<https://github.com/undertow-io/undertow/pull/1226>` and  `<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/undertow-io/undertow/-/merge_requests/112>`.
- **Red Hat Products Affected:** The vulnerability affects various Red Hat products including Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, Red Hat support for Spring Boot, Red Hat Single Sign-On, Red Hat Integration, Red Hat Fuse, and RHINT Camel-K. These products have received updates to address this vulnerability.
