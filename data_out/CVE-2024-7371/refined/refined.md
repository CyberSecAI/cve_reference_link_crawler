Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL Injection found in the `quiz_view.php` script of the Simple Realtime Quiz System.
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'id' parameter, allowing malicious SQL code to be injected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility of the `quiz_view.php` script to SQL injection attacks. This occurs because user-provided input via the `id` parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privileges:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a complete compromise of the application's database. This includes reading, modifying, and deleting sensitive data, potentially escalating privileges within the application, and gaining control of the database server in severe cases.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `/quiz_view.php`, by manipulating the value of the `id` parameter with malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server where the Simple Realtime Quiz System is hosted.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL to craft malicious SQL injection payloads.
- **Basic web request knowledge:** Attackers must be capable of sending a crafted HTTP request to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided `sqlmap` command shows that the vulnerability can be exploited using automated tools.
- The provided example of the HTTP request includes cookies and other parameters that may or may not be relevant for successful exploitation.
- The vulnerable software is "SourceCodester Simple Realtime Quiz System 1.0."
