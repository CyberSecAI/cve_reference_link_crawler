    "details": "The vulnerability is in the `Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` operation. Specifically, the code did not validate if the shape of filter_sizes was a vector which leads to an error. The fix adds a check to ensure that the shape of filter_sizes is a vector. A crafted input with a non-vector shape for filter_sizes would trigger this vulnerability and lead to a denial of service. This was resolved by adding a check to ensure filter_sizes is a vector."
