- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The IDAttend's IDWeb application version 3.1.013 is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts into the application that will be stored and executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected application.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to hijack the browsing session of a logged-in user. This could allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal sensitive information, or spread the attack further by compromising other users.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to inject malicious JavaScript code into a field that is later displayed to other users, without proper sanitization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs the ability to input data into the vulnerable application. The provided text doesn't elaborate further on specific roles or user positions that have this capability.
