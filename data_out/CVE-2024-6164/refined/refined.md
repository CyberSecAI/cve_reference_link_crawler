- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to insufficient sanitization of the `post_layout` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Local File Inclusion (LFI): An attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP files on the server by manipulating the `post_layout` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - Arbitrary PHP code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code by including malicious PHP files.
