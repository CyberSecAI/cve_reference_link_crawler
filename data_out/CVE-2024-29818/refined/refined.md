- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress WP Poll Maker Plugin <= 3.1 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts, including redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, which will be executed when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: Malicious scripts are injected into the website, which are then executed in the browsers of site visitors.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the plugin's vulnerable input fields, or other vulnerable areas of the website.  Administrator access is mentioned, but the document doesn't specify if that is required to inject the malicious code, or to make changes that would make the XSS execution successful.
