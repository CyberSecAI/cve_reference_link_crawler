The provided content is a security advisory for TYPO3 extension "powermail" and is related to CVE-2024-45232.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The extension fails to validate the "mail" parameter of the "confirmationAction", allowing unauthorized access to user-submitted data.
*   **Broken Access Control:** Missing or insufficient access checks in the "OutputController" allow direct calls to actions, leading to unauthorized data manipulation and export.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) due to lack of validation of the "mail" parameter.
*   Broken Access Control due to missing or insufficient access checks in the "OutputController".

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **IDOR:** An unauthenticated attacker can display user-submitted data from all forms persisted by the extension when the extension is configured to save submitted form data to the database.
*   **Broken Access Control:** An unauthenticated attacker can edit, update, delete, or export data of persisted forms, depending on the configuration of the "Powermail Frontend" plugins.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **IDOR:** Manipulating the "mail" parameter in the "confirmationAction" request.
*   **Broken Access Control:** Directly calling vulnerable actions in the "OutputController".

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **IDOR:** No authentication is needed. The attacker only needs to send a request to the vulnerable endpoint with a manipulated "mail" parameter
*   **Broken Access Control:** No authentication is needed. The attacker needs to send a request to the vulnerable actions of the `OutputController`. The "Powermail Frontend" plugins must be in use.

**Additional notes:**
* The vulnerability related to IDOR can be exploited only when the extension is configured to save submitted form data to the database (which is the default configuration)
* The Broken Access Control vulnerability can only be exploited when the "Powermail Frontend" plugins are used
* The "Export" and "RSS" functionality of the "Powermail Frontend" plugin have been removed as part of the fix.
* Updated versions of the extension (7.5.0, 8.5.0, 10.9.0, and 12.4.0) are available to address these vulnerabilities.
