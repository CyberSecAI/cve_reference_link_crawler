- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Motorola Solutions ACE1000 device utilizes hard-coded credentials for its SSH service. There are five preconfigured accounts, all with default, hard-coded credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of hard-coded credentials (CWE-798) for SSH service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to manipulate device configuration, achieve remote code execution, and cause a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access via SSH.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the affected device and no prior authentication is required since the credentials are hardcoded and publicly known.
