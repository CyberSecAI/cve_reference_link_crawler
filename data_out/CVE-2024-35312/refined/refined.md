- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A bug in the circuit construction logic where STUB circuits were not extended past the L2 vanguard due to a missing `else` branch in a conditional statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect circuit path construction, specifically for STUB circuits. The code does not handle the case where a circuit should be extended past the L2 vanguard when not using full vanguards.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  STUB circuits are limited to length 2. This is not the intended behavior.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when creating STUB circuits.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to influence the creation of STUB circuits.
