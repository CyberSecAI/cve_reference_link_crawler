Package        : git
Version        : 1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u8
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-1348 CVE-2019-1349 CVE-2019-1352 CVE-2019-1353
                 CVE-2019-1387

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in git, a fast, scalable,
distributed revision control system.

CVE-2019-1348

    It was reported that the --export-marks option of git fast-import is
    exposed also via the in-stream command feature export-marks=...,
    allowing to overwrite arbitrary paths.

CVE-2019-1387

    It was discovered that submodule names are not validated strictly
    enough, allowing very targeted attacks via remote code execution
    when performing recursive clones.

In addition this update addresses a number of security issues which are
only an issue if git is operating on an NTFS filesystem (CVE-2019-1349,
CVE-2019-1352 and CVE-2019-1353).

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u8.

We recommend that you upgrade your git packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
