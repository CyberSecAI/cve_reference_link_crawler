The provided content is related to CVE-2024-6055.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper removal of sensitive information during data source export.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the data source export feature of Devolutions Remote Desktop Manager where sensitive information, specifically PowerShell credentials configured on the data source, are not properly removed during export. This allows an attacker to recover these credentials by stealing the exported configuration file.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who obtains the exported settings file can recover PowerShell credentials configured within the data source. This could enable the attacker to gain unauthorized access to systems and resources managed using those credentials, leading to further compromise of the environment.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have access to the exported configuration file from the vulnerable instance of Remote Desktop Manager.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have compromised access to a Remote Desktop Manager instance to perform the data export. Then, they need to be able to steal the exported configuration file to recover the sensitive data.
