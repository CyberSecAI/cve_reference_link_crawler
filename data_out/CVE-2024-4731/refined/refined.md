**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application directly echoes user-supplied input (`slug` parameter) into the HTML output without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page.
- This can lead to various malicious actions like:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the web page.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/admin/role` with a malicious payload in the `slug` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint `/admin/role`.
- No special privileges are mentioned as required, suggesting any authenticated user can exploit this.
- It is implied that the attacker must have a valid session, as the provided request includes a `Cookie` header.

**Additional Details:**

- The specific vulnerable parameter is `slug`.
- The application is "Campcodes Legal Case Management System 1.0".
- The provided proof-of-concept payload is `<img src=1 onerror="alert(document.cookie)">`.
- The attack vector is a POST request.
- The provided Burp request shows the complete structure and relevant headers to trigger the vulnerability.
