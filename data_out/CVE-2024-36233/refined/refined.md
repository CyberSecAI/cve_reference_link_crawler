The provided content is related to CVE-2024-36233.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of CVE-2024-36233 is a stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability present is a stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, as defined by CWE-79.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (AV:N) with a low attack complexity (AC:L). An attacker with low privileges (PR:L) can inject malicious scripts that are stored and later executed in the context of another userâ€™s browser session. This requires user interaction (UI:R), and the scope is changed (S:C), affecting other users within the application context. The impact is rated as low for Confidentiality and Integrity, and there is no impact on availability (C:L/I:L/A:N).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs low privileges within the application (PR:L). The attacker needs to inject malicious code which is stored and later triggered when a user interacts with it (UI:R).
