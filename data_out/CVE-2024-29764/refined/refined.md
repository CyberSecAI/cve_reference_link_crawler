- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Molongui plugin for WordPress, versions 4.7.7 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin is susceptible to XSS attacks, allowing malicious actors to inject scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to the injection of malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts would then be executed when users visit the site, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts into the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to inject malicious scripts into the plugin's input. The specific means of injection isn't detailed, but an author-level privilege is mentioned, implying that those with author permissions or higher might be able to inject scripts.
