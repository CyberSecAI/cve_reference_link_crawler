## CVE-2022-40299: Singular interface unsafe /tmp usage

posted 2022-09-09

Product
[Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/)

Versions affected
4.3.0 and earlier
Published on
2022-09-09
Fixed in
commits [72df188](https://github.com/Singular/Singular/commit/72df188) and [5f28fbf0](https://github.com/Singular/Singular/commit/5f28fbf0), [version 4.3.1](https://github.com/Singular/Singular/releases/tag/Release-4-3-1)

Bug report
<https://github.com/Singular/Singular/issues/1137>

MITRE
[CVE-2022-40299](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-40299)

### Summary

The Singular interface (as opposed to its library of Singular code)
uses fixed paths under the world-writable /tmp
for log files and as scratch space for the debugger. [This
can be exploited in well-known ways](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Insecure_Temporary_File). In particular, an attacker
can make Singular overwrite files belonging to the Singular user, or
in rare cases, to execute code.

### Details

When Singular-4.3.0 and earlier are launched with the
--log flag, the input is logged to a
predictable path under /tmp unconditionally, as
can be seen in Singular/tesths.cc:

```
int main(          /* main entry to Singular */
    int argc,      /* number of parameter */
    char** argv)   /* parameter array */
{
  ...
  if (feOptValue(FE_OPT_LOG))
  {
    int pid=getpid();
    char buf[20];
    sprintf(buf,"/tmp/sing_log.%d",pid);
    File_Log=fopen(buf,"w");
  }
  ...
}
```

The Singular debugger sdb (Singular/sdb.cc),
when editing code in-place, will also use a predictable path under
/tmp:

```
void sdb_edit(procinfo *pi)
{
  char * filename = omStrDup("/tmp/sd000000");
  sprintf(filename+7,"%d",getpid());
  FILE *fp=fopen(filename,"w");
  ...
}
```

Both of these can be exploited in [familiar
ways](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Insecure_Temporary_File) to clobber files owned by the Singular user. The sdb
vulnerability can also lead to code execution if the attacker is
able to modify the code snippet as it is being loaded from the
scratch file back into Singular.

### Resolution

The logfile issue was resolved in commit [72df188](https://github.com/Singular/Singular/commit/72df188)
by making the `--log` flag take a mandatory parameter
specifying the filename. Presumably the user will not specify a
world-writable path. The sdb issue was resolved in commit [5f28fbf0](https://github.com/Singular/Singular/commit/5f28fbf0)
by using `mkstemp()` to create the scratch file.

| I just noticed commit [ed2fd9b](https://github.com/Singular/Singular/commit/ed2fd9bb8a4241c386b59a55bd8bbfb1d66ac174) which led me to `git grep /tmp` in the codebase. There are several places where a fixed (or at least predictable) path under `/tmp` is used for temporary storage. This creates a [general class of vulnerability](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Insecure_Temporary_File) that can usually be exploited by other users on the same machine.  For example, since `/tmp` is world-writable, anyone on the machine can create `/tmp/sing_log.1` through `/tmp/sing_log.65535`, making themselves the owner of those files. Later, singular will open and write to them as some other user, namely whoever is running singular. In an extreme case, if singular is running as root, and if the bad guy has created `/tmp/sing_log.N` as links pointing to important system files, then logging can erase (overwrite) those files.  I haven't tried to exploit them all, but in a few other cases, temporary files are used to store data or commands that are fed to other programs, which makes some level of code execution likely.  The `mkstemp()` function is a safe replacement within C, but would have to be exposed to the user somehow to avoid the same problem in singular code. |

| For the logs I think this is sufficient, but for the rest, the problem is much larger than just shell characters being injected. Here's a real example that takes advantage of the predictable files used by the sdb debugger.   1. First, if you're on linux and have this security option set, you'll have to turn it off for this particular example to work: `$ sudo sysctl fs.protected_regular=0` 2. As some other user (not your desktop user), create a bunch of files named `/tmp/sdX`, where `X` runs through enough integers to cover any PIDs that will be used in the near future. 3. As your normal user, run `singular --sdb`, hit an error or breakpoint, and then use `e` to enter edit mode. 4. Now sdb will have written some code to `/tmp/sdX` (for some `X`), but that file is controlled by the user who created it. 5. As the other user, edit the temporary file being used by sdb. 6. As your normal desktop user, close the editor. 7. The other user has now written a procedure that your normal desktop user will run.   There are more clever (and more automated) variants of this. The fundamental problem is that when using a predictable filename under `/tmp`, you may wind up using a file that someone else controls. Often, control of such a file can be exploited. |

| I see you fixed the sdb issue in [5f28fbf](https://github.com/Singular/Singular/commit/5f28fbf066626fa9c4a8f0e6408c0bb362fb386c), thanks =)  I think that leaves only the more difficult problem of obtaining temporary file and directory names within singular code. For example, in `gfan.lib`,  ``` string filename = "/tmp/gfanlib_secondaryFan_"+string(random(1,2147483647));  ```  is attempting to create the file safely -- at least without a collision -- but will not fail if someone has pre-created all 2147483647 possible files and made them writable.  Similarly, when you need to run several commands in a row as in `tropical.lib`,  ``` system("sh","cd /tmp; latex /tmp/newtonsubdivision"+string(rdnum)+".tex; dvips /tmp/newtonsubdivision"+string(rdnum)+".dvi -o; command rm newtonsubdivision"+string(rdnum)+".log;  command rm newtonsubdivision"+string(rdnum)+".aux;  command rm newtonsubdivision"+string(rdnum)+".ps?;  command rm newtonsubdivision"+string(rdnum)+".dvi; xdg-open newtonsubdivision"+string(rdnum)+".ps &");  ```  the shell will blindly proceed even if someone else has e.g. created a malicious dvi file beforehand, causing you to process his file after "latex" fails to write its output.  In the first case, you would like to obtain the temporary filename atomically, and fail if it cannot be done. In the second case, you'd like to run the latex pipeline all within one temporary directory, having obtained that temporary directory securely.  For those reasons I think it would be a good idea to wrap the C functions `mkstemp()` and `mkdtemp()`, making them available in singular code. That way all of the hand-written `/tmp` stuff that exists now could be replaced with calls to the wrappers and (a) it would be more secure against attackers (b) it would be more robust against bad luck and (c) the code would be a lot simpler. |

| [@orlitzky](https://github.com/orlitzky) Hey, I'm not too familiar with this code, but interested in Sage which consumes it. Is it all right if I take a stab at fixing this temporary file and directory issue? |

| [@orlitzky](https://github.com/orlitzky) Hey, I'm not too familiar with this code, but interested in Sage which consumes it. Is it all right if I take a stab at fixing this temporary file and directory issue?  Yeah of course! My earlier suggestion was to wrap the C functions `mkstemp()` and `mkdtemp()`, and then use the wrappers whenever a temporary file/directory is needed within Singular. I'm not familiar enough with Singular to know how easy that would be, but it's still my first guess if it helps. |
