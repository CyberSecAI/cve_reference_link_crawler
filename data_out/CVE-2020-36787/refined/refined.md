Based on the provided content, this CVE relates to a clock handling logic issue in the Aspeed video driver of the Linux kernel.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The video engine uses two clock sources, eclk and vclk. The reset control is coupled with eclk. The original clock enabling sequence was:
1. Enable eclk
2. De-assert Video Engine reset
3. 10ms delay
4. Enable vclk

This sequence caused an improper reset on the video engine hardware, leading to unexpected DMA memory transfers, which could corrupt memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   Incorrect order of clock enabling and reset de-assertion.
-   The reset de-assertion was happening before enabling both required clocks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   Unexpected DMA memory transfers leading to random memory corruption.
-   Critical kernel panics with varying signatures, making debugging difficult.
-   The issue can occur even when the video engine isn't actively used, as `udevd` briefly activates it during boot.

**Attack vectors:**

-   The vulnerability is triggered by the system boot process, due to the video engine initialization by udevd.
-   No specific user-initiated action or network access is needed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   An attacker would need to be able to execute code on a system utilizing affected Aspeed SoCs.
-   No special privileges are required as the faulty logic is triggered by the normal system operation.

The fix involves changing the clock handling logic such that reset de-assertion is triggered after enabling both eclk and vclk. Additionally, `clk_unprepare` calls were added to handle probe failures. The changes also include setting the Video Engine reset bit correctly, coupled with eclk, aligning with previous Aspeed SoCs.
