Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `delete_img` function within the `Master.php` file of the "Ingredients Stock Management System." This function allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path, which the function will then delete, without proper validation or sanitization of the input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The application is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to the lack of input validation on the `path` parameter. An attacker can provide a path to any file on the server accessible by the webserver and the application will attempt to delete it.
*   **Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** While not explicitly mentioned, the content implies that the `delete_img` function may not require proper authentication or authorization, allowing any user who can make a POST request to the script to trigger the vulnerability, or that the authentication might be bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Loss:** An attacker can delete critical system files, configuration files, or application data, leading to loss of functionality and data integrity.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By deleting essential files, an attacker can effectively render the application unusable.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** While the current exploit only deletes files, further exploitation could lead to compromise of system integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to `/isms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_img` with a `path` parameter specifying the file to be deleted.
*   **Direct Request:** The attacker directly crafts the HTTP request, including the `path` parameter with the full file path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the server where the application is hosted.
*   **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker must have knowledge of or be able to guess file paths that they intend to delete.
*   **No prior authentication:** Based on the information given it can be assumed that no prior authentication/authorization is needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The content provides a specific example of deleting a `shell.php` file, but any file that the webserver has write access to could be deleted.
*   The provided payload demonstrates how to craft the HTTP request to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerable software is "Ingredients Stock Management System v1.0 by oretnom23", which is available on sourcecodester.
*   The default credentials for the system are `admin/admin123`.
