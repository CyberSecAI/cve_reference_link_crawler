  "cve": "CVE-2023-52730",
  "description": "The provided content details a fix for resource leaks in the Linux kernel's SDIO (Secure Digital Input/Output) subsystem. Specifically, when `sdio_add_func()` or `sdio_init_func()` fail, the resources allocated for the SDIO function were not being released properly, leading to memory leaks. This occurs because `sdio_remove_func()` wouldn't call `of_node_put()` or `put_device()` in those error cases. The fix involves modifying `sdio_func_present()` to only control whether `device_del()` needs to be called and always call `of_node_put()` and `put_device()`. Additionally, the `get_device()` call was moved to `sdio_alloc_func()` and `put_device()` to `sdio_release_func()` to ensure balanced reference counting.",
  "affected_versions": "Linux kernel versions prior to the fix commit 605d9fb9556f8f5fb4566f4df1480f280f308ded",
  "root_cause": "Resource leaks due to improper handling of device and node references during error conditions in SDIO function initialization.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Resource Leak"
  ],
  "impact": "Memory leaks that could potentially lead to system instability or denial of service.",
  "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by errors during the initialization of an SDIO function, which can be indirectly influenced through fault injection during testing.",
  "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trigger specific error conditions during SDIO function initialization which is indirectly influenced by fault injection tests. No specific attacker capabilities, or position are mentioned other than triggering the error condition."
