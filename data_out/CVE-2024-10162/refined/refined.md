Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application constructs an SQL query using unsanitized input from the `mobilenumber` parameter when editing a subadmin profile.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89): The application does not properly neutralize special elements in the `mobilenumber` input, allowing an attacker to manipulate the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application can be affected.
- An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data, modify data, or disrupt the application's normal operation.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious payload within the `mobilenumber` parameter of the HTTP request when updating the subadmin profile.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the admin panel of the PHPGurukul Boat Booking System.
- They would need to intercept the request sent when updating a subadmin profile, and manipulate the `mobilenumber` parameter before sending it to the server.
- No special access is mentioned other than access to the admin panel which could be achieved through stolen credentials or other means.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `/admin/edit-subadmin.php` file.
- The vulnerable parameters include `sadminusername`, `fullname`, `emailid`, and specifically `mobilenumber`.
- The provided GitHub document outlines a step-by-step demonstration of exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability using Burp Suite and `sqlmap`.
