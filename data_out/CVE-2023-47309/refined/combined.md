**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: DO NOT REPORT VULNERABILITIES SOLELY TO THE AUTHOR OR MARKETPLACE.

We urge you to report any vulnerabilities directly to us. Our mission is to ensure the safety and security of the PrestaShop ecosystem. Unfortunately, many module developers may not always recognize or acknowledge the vulnerabilities in their code, whether due to lack of awareness, or inability to properly evaluate the associated risk, or other reasons.

Given the rise in professional cybercrime networks actively seeking out these vulnerabilities, it's crucial that any potential threats are promptly addressed and the community is informed. The most effective method to do this is by publishing a CVE, like the one provided below.

Should you discover any vulnerabilities, **please report them to us at: report[@]security-presta.org** or visit [https://security-presta.org](https://security-presta.org/) for more information.

Every vulnerability report helps make the community more secure, and we are profoundly grateful for any information shared with us.

# [CVE-2023-47309] Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation in Nukium - NKM GLS module for PrestaShop

In the module “NKM GLS” (nkmgls) up to version 3.0.1 from Nukium for PrestaShop, a guest (authenticated customer) can perform XSS injection of type 2 (stored XSS) from FRONT to BACK (F2B) of Category 2 within the funnel order in affected versions.

Note : To succeed in this exploit, the red team needs to pay to convert a cart into a valid order with GLS carrier and require the administrator of the PS to check a specific screen within its backoffice.

## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-47309](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-47309)
* **Published at**: 2023-11-14
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: nkmgls
* **Impacted release**: <= 3.0.1 (3.0.2 fixed the vulnerability)
* **Product author**: Nukium
* **Weakness**: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.0)

## Description

As all [XSS type 2 (Stored XSS) F2B (Front to Back)](https://security.friendsofpresta.org/modules/2023/02/07/stored-xss.html), there are two steps and a prerequisite.

Prerequisite :

* The field `phone_mobile` within table gls\_cart\_carrier suffers from a type varchar(255) which is large enough to allow dangerous XSS payloads.

Steps :

* The method `NkmGlsCheckoutModuleFrontController::displayAjaxSavePhoneMobile` does not properly clean the parameter `gls_customer_mobile`. pSQL is useless against XSS which exploits HTML tag attributes (Category 2 according to OWASP - pSQL only neutralized Category 1 thanks to its strip\_tags).
* The output in the backoffice is not escaped in the related smarty template that uses it.

## CVSS base metrics

* **Attack vector**: network
* **Attack complexity**: low
* **Privilege required**: low
* **User interaction**: required
* **Scope**: changed
* **Confidentiality**: high
* **Integrity**: high
* **Availability**: high

**Vector string**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Possible malicious usage

## Other recommendations

* It’s recommended to upgrade to the latest version of the module **nkmgls**.
* Systematically escape characters ‘ “ < and > by replacing them with HTML entities and applying strip\_tags - Smarty and Twig provide auto-escape filters :
  + Smarty: `{$value.comment|escape:'html':'UTF-8'}`
  + Twig:`{{value.comment|e}}`
* Limit to the strict minimum the length’s value in database - a database field that allow 10 characters (`varchar(10)`) is far less dangerous than a field that allows 40+ characters (use cases that can exploit fragmented XSS payloads are very rare)
* Configure CSP headers (content security policies) by listing external domains allowed to load assets (such as js files) or being called in XHR transactions (Ajax).
* If applicable: check against all your frontoffice’s uploaders, uploading files that will be served by your server that mime type application/javascript (like every .js natively) must be strictly forbidden as it must be considered as dangerous as PHP files.
* Activate OWASP 941’s rules on your WAF (Web application firewall) - be warned that you will probably break your frontoffice/backoffice and you will need to preconfigure some bypasses against this set of rules.
