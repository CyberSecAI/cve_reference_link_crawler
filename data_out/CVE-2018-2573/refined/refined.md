Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-2573:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an unspecified vulnerability within the GIS (Geographic Information System) component of the MySQL server. This implies a flaw in how the server handles GIS-related operations or data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability resides in the GIS component of the MySQL server. The specifics of the flaw are not detailed in the provided text, but it is related to how GIS functions are implemented within the database server.
*   The vulnerability is not further specified, but could involve a buffer overflow, logic error, or other programming mistake within the GIS functions of MySQL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in:
    *   Unauthorized read or modification access to MySQL server data.
    *   A denial-of-service (DoS) condition causing the MySQL server to hang or crash repeatedly. This is listed as a potential "partial or complete DoS."
*   The impact is considered to be of "Important" severity according to Red Hat, while the CVSS score given by Oracle is 6.5 which is considered as medium

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is accessed through the MySQL Protocol. This implies an attack vector that involves sending specially crafted requests to the MySQL server via the network using the MySQL protocol.
*   Exploitation does not require user interaction and requires low privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to communicate with the MySQL server over the network using the MySQL protocol.
*   The attacker requires low level privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
*   No user interaction is required.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in MySQL versions 5.5.59, 5.6.39, and 5.7.21 and later.
*   The fix involves upgrading affected MySQL packages in Red Hat Software Collections and other products.

In summary, CVE-2018-2573 is a vulnerability in the GIS component of MySQL that can lead to data access violations, unauthorized modification and denial-of-service. The attacker requires low privileges and network access to exploit it by sending crafted requests using the MySQL protocol.
