Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input sanitization within the FortiNDR v1.4.0 GUI. Specifically, a vulnerability exists in the "diagnose" command handling.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** OS command injection vulnerability due to lack of proper input validation when processing the "diagnose" command. This allows for the execution of arbitrary commands.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an authenticated user to gain system shell access on the affected FortiNDR device. This would allow for unauthorized code or command execution, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the FortiNDR GUI. An authenticated user can inject malicious payloads into the "diagnose" command input field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the FortiNDR device. This implies that the attacker has already gained some level of access to the system through legitimate or illegitimate means.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in FortiNDR 1.4 all versions.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Fortinet PSIRT.
- A patch is available for the vulnerability in v1.5.0 and greater of FortiNDR firmware
- The CVSSv3 score is 7.4, categorized as High Severity.
