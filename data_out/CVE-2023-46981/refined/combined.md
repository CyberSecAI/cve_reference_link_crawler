# Vulnerability Submitter

Name：Qinruiqi

GitHub address：<https://github.com/JunFengDeng/qinruiqi/blob/main/20231027/vuln/readme.md>

# SQL injection vulnerability exists in novel-plus v4.2.0

Affected version: v4.2.0

official website: <https://novel.xxyopen.com/index.htm>

github: <https://github.com/201206030/novel-plus>

## Vulnerability Overview

SQL injection vulnerability in Novel-Plus v.4.2.0 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted script to the sort parameter in /common/log/list.

## Vulnerability details

Vulnerability route: /common/log/list

Vulnerable parameter: sort

### **Vulnerability source file path 1:**

novel-plus-develop\_xxy\novel-admin\src\main\java\com\java2nb\common\controller

[![1698330555839](/JunFengDeng/Cve-List/raw/main/novel-plus/20231027/img/1.png)](/JunFengDeng/Cve-List/blob/main/novel-plus/20231027/img/1.png)

#### **Vulnerability source file path 2:**

novel-plus-develop\_xxy\novel-admin\src\main\java\com\java2nb\common\utils\Query.java

[![1698330643839](/JunFengDeng/Cve-List/raw/main/novel-plus/20231027/img/2.png)](/JunFengDeng/Cve-List/blob/main/novel-plus/20231027/img/2.png)

#### **Vulnerability source file path 3:**

novel-plus-develop\_xxy\novel-admin\src\main\java\com\java2nb\common\service\LogService.java

[![1698331147638](/JunFengDeng/Cve-List/raw/main/novel-plus/20231027/img/3.png)](/JunFengDeng/Cve-List/blob/main/novel-plus/20231027/img/3.png)

In the LogController class, the @GetMapping("/list") annotation indicates that this method handles GET requests and returns a PageDO object.
In this method, the params parameters obtained from the @RequestParam annotation will be used to construct a Query object and passed to the logService.queryList(query) method for querying.

#### **Vulnerability source file path 4:**

novel-plus-develop\_xxy\novel-admin\src\main\resources\mybatis\common\LogMapper.xml

[![1698332190078](/JunFengDeng/Cve-List/raw/main/novel-plus/20231027/img/4.png)](/JunFengDeng/Cve-List/blob/main/novel-plus/20231027/img/4.png)

It can be seen that the sort parameter is not verified, filtered, and escaped. An attacker can use malicious input to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**POC**

"Login to the backend using the default account username/password 'admin/admin' to obtain the administrator cookie."
