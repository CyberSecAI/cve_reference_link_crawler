Here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-5573 based on the provided documents:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly check received Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) packets.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Insufficient validation of JDWP packets. This lack of proper checks allows an attacker to potentially send arbitrary commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could send debugging commands to a Java program.
*   This could potentially allow them to take control of the application.
*    The vulnerability can allow bypassing of Java sandbox restrictions which could lead to further system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send debugging commands.
*   An attacker needs to make a victim's browser send HTTP requests to the JDWP port of the debugged application
*    Exploitation via Java applets could be done without direct user interaction.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The targeted Java application must have debugging enabled.
*   The attacker must be in a position to influence HTTP requests. This is indicated by the document noting the attacker would need to "make victim's browser send HTTP requests to the JDWP port of the debugged application."
*   An attacker must be able to make the victim visit a malicious website containing a malicious Java Applet.

**Additional Information:**
*  The vulnerability was patched in the following versions:
    * OpenJDK 6, 7, and 8.
    * IBM Java 1.6, 1.7.1, and 1.8.0.

*  The vulnerability affects various products from Red Hat, Oracle, and NetApp.

*  The vulnerability can bypass Java sandbox restrictions, allowing for further system compromise.
