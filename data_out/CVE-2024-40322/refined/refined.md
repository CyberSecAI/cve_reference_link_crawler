{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application retrieves the table name from a Div object based on the provided 'divId' parameter. The application allows users to create custom Div objects and set the 'tableName' field, enabling an attacker to inject malicious SQL statements into the 'tableName'.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Lack of input sanitization"
     ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, data modification, or denial of service. In this specific case, the example demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
       "HTTP GET request to /admin/div_data/data with a crafted 'divId' parameter"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated with administrator credentials to create the custom div objects. Once created, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability via the web application. "
