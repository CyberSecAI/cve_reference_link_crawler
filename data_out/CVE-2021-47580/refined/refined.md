{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `min_t` macro was used with the `int` type, leading to sign extension of values, which could result in a larger value being used than intended, causing a stack out-of-bounds write.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect type usage in `min_t` macro",
      "Potential for stack-based buffer overflow due to incorrect size calculation"
    ],
    "impact": "A stack out-of-bounds write, which could lead to a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via SCSI commands processed by the `scsi_debug` driver.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker with the ability to send crafted SCSI commands to a vulnerable system can trigger this vulnerability. This would typically require a user with access to the scsi device."
