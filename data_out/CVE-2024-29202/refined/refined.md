- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Jinja2 template injection in Ansible within JumpServer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsanitized user-controlled input used in Jinja2 templates, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Remote code execution within the Celery container, which runs with root privileges.
    - Potential for sensitive information theft from all hosts due to Celery's database access.
    - Manipulation of the database.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network-based attack.
    - Malicious playbook templates are created and executed in the "Job > Template" and "Job > Job list" sections of the Workbench.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Low-privilege user account within JumpServer.
    - Ability to access the "Job > Template" and "Job > Job list" features in the Workbench.
