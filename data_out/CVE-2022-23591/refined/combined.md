# Stack overflow due to self-recursive function in `GraphDef`

High

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-247x-2f9f-5wp7
Feb 2, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.8.0

## Patched versions

2.5.3, 2.6.3, 2.7.1

## Description

### Impact

The `GraphDef` format in TensorFlow does not allow self recursive functions. The runtime assumes that this invariant is satisfied. However, a `GraphDef` containing a fragment such as the following can be consumed when loading a `SavedModel`:

```
  library {
    function {
      signature {
        name: "SomeOp"
        description: "Self recursive op"
      }
      node_def {
        name: "1"
        op: "SomeOp"
      }
      node_def {
        name: "2"
        op: "SomeOp"
      }
    }
  }

```

This would result in a stack overflow during execution as resolving each `NodeDef` means resolving the function itself and its nodes.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [448a16182065bd08a202d9057dd8ca541e67996c](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/448a16182065bd08a202d9057dd8ca541e67996c).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

It is likely that no recursivity is supported, but we should handle this separately.
