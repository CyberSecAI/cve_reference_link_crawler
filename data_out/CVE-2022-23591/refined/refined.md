Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23591:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of validation for self-recursive functions within the `GraphDef` format in TensorFlow. The runtime incorrectly assumes that `GraphDef` will not contain self-recursive functions, leading to a stack overflow when a malicious `GraphDef` with such a structure is loaded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Absence of checks for self-recursive function definitions within `GraphDef`.
- The runtime's assumption that `GraphDef` will not contain self-recursive functions.
- Failure to properly handle the recursive function calls during the resolution of nodes in the graph.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A stack overflow during the execution of the model, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- The application using TensorFlow can crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafting a malicious `GraphDef` containing a self-recursive function definition.
- Loading the crafted `GraphDef` using `SavedModel` loading mechanisms in TensorFlow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious `GraphDef` to the TensorFlow runtime. This could be through supplying a specifically crafted SavedModel, which when loaded triggers the vulnerability.
- No specific position/privileges are mentioned, so ability to supply input model is the only requirement.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.8.0. Patches have been backported to 2.5.3, 2.6.3, and 2.7.1
- The vulnerability is addressed by adding a check in `tensorflow/cc/saved_model/loader.cc` that prevents self-recursive functions.
- The provided code snippet highlights a function `ValidateFunctionNotRecursive` which is added to prevent this issue from happening.
- The fix is available in the GitHub commit [448a16182065bd08a202d9057dd8ca541e67996c](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/448a16182065bd08a202d9057dd8ca541e67996c).
