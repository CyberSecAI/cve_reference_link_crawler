The ShopLentor (formerly WooLentor) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the purchased_new_products function in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view all products purchased in the past week, along with the users that purchased them.
