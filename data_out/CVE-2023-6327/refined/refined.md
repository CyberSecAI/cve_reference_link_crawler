Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-6327

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `purchased_new_products` function within the ShopLentor (formerly WooLentor) WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of proper capability checks on the `purchased_new_products` function. This allows unauthenticated users to trigger the function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve sensitive information, including:
    *   A list of all products purchased within the past week.
    *   Details of the users (buyers) who purchased these products. This includes first name, last name, city, state and country, depending on plugin settings.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by any unauthenticated user.
*   **Direct Function Call:** Attackers can exploit this by directly calling the vulnerable `purchased_new_products` AJAX function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Special Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any specific role on the WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only requires network access to the WordPress site to make the malicious requests.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** All versions of the ShopLentor (formerly WooLentor) plugin up to and including 2.8.7 are affected.
*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.8.8.
*  **Code Reference:** The vulnerable code is located in the `class.sale_notification.php` file within the plugin, specifically within the `purchased_new_products` function. The provided diff shows that the nonce check was present but it wasn't checking for any user capabilities, thus allowing any user (including unauthenticated users) to call the function and retrieve the data.
*   **Wordfence:** The vulnerability was identified by Francesco Carlucci of Wordfence.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.3 (Medium).
