- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `warp-cli set-custom-endpoint` command allows setting a custom endpoint for the Cloudflare WARP client. Using this command with an unreachable endpoint causes the WARP client to disconnect.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the fact that disconnecting the WARP client bypasses configured Zero Trust Secure Web Gateway policies.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows bypassing administrative restrictions on a Zero Trust enrolled endpoint, potentially granting access to restricted resources.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have local access to the machine running the vulnerable Cloudflare WARP client.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low privileges and be able to interact with the system. User interaction is required to execute the command, indicating the need for a user or administrator to be tricked or compromised.
