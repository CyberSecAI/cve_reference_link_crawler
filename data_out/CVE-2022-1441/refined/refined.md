  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2022-1441",
    "description": "MP4Box is a component of GPAC-2.0.0. When MP4Box tries to parse a MP4 file, it calls the function `diST_box_read()` to read from video. In this function, it allocates a buffer `str` with fixed length. However, content read from `bs` is controllable by user, so is the length, which causes a buffer overflow.",
    "root_cause": "The `diST_box_read()` function in GPAC allocates a fixed-size buffer (`str`) on the stack but reads user-controlled data into it without proper bounds checking.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-119",
      "CWE-125"
    ],
    "impact": "A stack buffer overflow can occur, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a crafted MP4 file to the MP4Box tool.",
        "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create or modify a malicious MP4 file with an oversized data segment that exceeds the fixed buffer size in the vulnerable function. The attacker needs to convince a user to process this malicious file using the vulnerable software. This is a local attack vector, requiring the attacker to have access to the vulnerable system.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerable code snippet is:\n```c\nchar str[1024];\ni=0;\nstr[0]=0;\nwhile (1) {\n    str[i] = gf_bs_read_u8(bs);\n    if (!str[i]) break;\n    i++;\n}\n```\nThis code reads bytes from a bitstream `bs` into the `str` buffer until a null byte is encountered. The loop does not check if `i` exceeds the buffer's capacity, leading to the overflow."
