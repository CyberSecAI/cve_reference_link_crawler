### **[xidoo123](/xidoo123)** commented [Apr 16, 2022](#issue-1206053267) • edited Loading

| Description When GPAC tries to parse a MP4 file, it calls the function `diST_box_read()` to read from video. In this funtion, it allocates a buffer `str` with fixed length. However, content read from `bs` is controllable by user, so is the length, which causes a buffer overflow.  ``` char str[1024];  i=0; str[0]=0; while (1) {     str[i] = gf_bs_read_u8(bs);     if (!str[i]) break;     i++; }  ``` Impact Since video content is absolutely controllable by users, an unlimited length will cause stack overflow, corrupting canary or even get shell. Mitigation We can just set a length limit to it, making it less than 1024 byte. See pull request [#2174](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/pull/2174) . Reproduce On Ubuntu 2004, make with this.  ``` ./configure --static-bin make  ```  Run the following command with POC.mp4.  ``` $ MP4Box -info ./POC.mp4  ```  You may get a stack smashing detectde error, which indicates that CANARY is crashed.  ``` [BS] Attempt to overread bitstream *** stack smashing detected ***: terminated Aborted  ```  GDB  ``` *** stack smashing detected ***: terminated  Program received signal SIGABRT, Aborted. 0x0000000000aa31eb in raise ()  pwndbg> bt #0  diST_box_read (s=0xdf4b00, bs=0xdf71e0) at isomedia/box_code_3gpp.c:1130 #1  0x000000000052e8c9 in gf_isom_box_read (bs=0xdf71e0, a=0xdf4b00) at isomedia/box_funcs.c:1832 #2  gf_isom_box_parse_ex (outBox=outBox@entry=0x7fffffff8540, bs=<optimized out>, bs@entry=0xdf71e0, parent_type=parent_type@entry=0, is_root_box=is_root_box@entry=GF_TRUE) at isomedia/box_funcs.c:264 #3  0x000000000052f070 in gf_isom_parse_root_box (outBox=outBox@entry=0x7fffffff8540, bs=0xdf71e0, box_type=box_type@entry=0x0, bytesExpected=bytesExpected@entry=0x7fffffff8590, progressive_mode=progressive_mode@entry=GF_FALSE) at isomedia/box_funcs.c:38 #4  0x0000000000536af8 in gf_isom_parse_movie_boxes_internal (mov=mov@entry=0xdf6fc0, boxType=boxType@entry=0x0, bytesMissing=bytesMissing@entry=0x7fffffff8590, progressive_mode=progressive_mode@entry=GF_FALSE) at isomedia/isom_intern.c:373 #5  0x0000000000538287 in gf_isom_parse_movie_boxes (progressive_mode=GF_FALSE, bytesMissing=0x7fffffff8590, boxType=0x0, mov=0xdf6fc0) at isomedia/isom_intern.c:852 #6  gf_isom_open_file (fileName=0x7fffffffe67d "../../../../crashes/1.mp4", OpenMode=<optimized out>, tmp_dir=0x0) at isomedia/isom_intern.c:972 #7  0x0000000000414dd4 in mp4boxMain (argc=<optimized out>, argv=<optimized out>) at main.c:5968 #8  0x0000000000a94000 in __libc_start_main () #9  0x0000000000402e6e in _start () at main.c:6585  ``` Credits xdchase POC [POC.zip](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/files/8499537/POC.zip) |
