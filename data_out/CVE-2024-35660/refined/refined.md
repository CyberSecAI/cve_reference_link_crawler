- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin has a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated user could perform actions that require higher privileges. Specific impacts vary on a case by case basis.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable function without needing to be logged into an account.
