- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An incorrect user management vulnerability in the FortiManager VDOM creation component. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when the super_admin profiled admin account is deleted, and new VDOMs are created.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control, specifically related to user management during VDOM creation after deleting the super_admin account.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain access to a FortiGate without needing a password through newly created VDOMs.

- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through the FortiManager VDOM creation component.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires high privileges (PR:H) and must be an authenticated user of the FortiManager system. It also requires some user interaction (UI:R) and the attacker must be on the same network segment (AV:A).
