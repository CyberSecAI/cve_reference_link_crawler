- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The wpCentral plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site. Specific actions depend on the plugin's functionality, but could include configuration changes, data manipulation, or other administrative tasks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious request (typically embedded in a website, email, or other means) that is then sent to the vulnerable WordPress site by a logged-in user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated but needs a logged-in user to visit the malicious site/link to trigger the attack.
