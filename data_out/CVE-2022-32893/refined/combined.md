Package        : wpewebkit
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-32893

The following vulnerabilities have been discovered in the WPE WebKit
web engine:

CVE-2022-32893

    An anonymous researcher discovered that processing maliciously
    crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution. Apple is
    aware of a report that this issue may have been actively
    exploited.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.36.7-1~deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wpewebkit packages.

According to Apple's security advisories for this (e.g. [1]), this
issue is tracked on the Webkit Bugzilla as 243557 [2] which was opened
on 2022-08-04. A few minutes after that bug was opened, a pull request
on GitHub was linked [3] with a patch which also seems to add unit
tests. So, it appears to me that this issue was public since at least
August 4th, and even more widely publicized with Apple's security
advisories on August 17.

WebKit-2.36.6 was released shortly after the first bug report, on
2022-08-07, and WebKit-2.36.7 was released yesterday, on 2022-08-25.

With this bug seemingly being publicly known to be an actively
exploited code execution issue, why did it take several weeks and 2
WebKit releases to get this issue fixed and a WSA released?

I don't know the reason.

But I suspect it maybe has something to do how bugzilla works, since the
whole "Security" category on the WebKit bugzilla is private.
And I'm unsure if Bugzilla allows access to a private issue based on the
age and status (closed/open) of the issue.

We have considered using the same stable branches that them, but in the
end it didn't fit well our release process. We aim at a 6-month release
cadence for major stable releases in order to align with the GNOME
release process. And Apple has a differente release cadence than that.

We also monitor patches landing on master (main) that are tagged as
security releated and sometimes we backport them even when those don't
have (still) assigned a CVE.

In the case of this CVE (CVE-2022-32893) the patch fixing it was not
marked as security related.

Apple's released new security advisories yesterday, with 4 WebKit
security fixes, two of which are code execution issues, but all 4 of
which have public bugzilla bugs and public patches, since as early as
late June (<https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213442>):

<https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=242278>
<https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=241969>
<https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=242762>
<https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=243236>

Is Apple fixing WebKit security issues in public while obfuscating the
impact? This pattern seems to be potentially putting downstream WebKit
users at a lot of risk, now that 2 code execution bugs (with patches!)
are public (and have been for *months*, albeit without knowledge of
security impact), and users need to wait weeks for remediation.

We (maintainers of Linux WebKit ports) don't have access to the security
issues affecting Apple products until those issues are made public by them.

So, we didn't knew until August 17th of this issue. Also you can see
that the bug report itself or the patch doesn't has any indication that
it fixes a security-related problem.

Therefore, the time it took us to notice the issue, backport the fix and
do a new release was just 7-8 days (from 17th to 24-25th of August).
Which, honestely, it is quite good taking into account that: 1)
back-porting the fix was not straightforward since it required
back-porting also a few previous patches in order to be able to merge it
properly and that 2) we are in August and people is usually on holidays.

On the other hand, I don't know if this issue was or is exploited on
Linux WebKit users. All I known is that Apple said they are aware of a
report that this issue was actively exploited (on Apple/WebKit users).
So I assume this can also affect Linux WebKit users. But I don't have a
confirmation that this is actually the case, neither I'm aware of any
PoC demonstrating the issue.

Regards.
