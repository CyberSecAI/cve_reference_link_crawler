Based on the provided information, all of the content relates to the same vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability exists in the `cifs_stats_proc_write()` function within the Linux kernel's CIFS client implementation. This occurs when iterating through the list of SMB sessions (`server->smb_ses_list`) because sessions that are in the process of being torn down (status `SES_EXITING`) are not skipped.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free (UAF): The code accesses the `ses` structure after it has been freed when the session is in the `SES_EXITING` state.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could lead to a crash, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `/proc/fs/cifs/stats` file is written to.
- An attacker can trigger this by manipulating the SMB session lifecycle and writing to `/proc/fs/cifs/stats` at a specific point, allowing them to reach the vulnerable code path with an invalid session.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to interact with the CIFS client and trigger the `cifs_stats_proc_write()` function which usually requires root access.
- They need to be able to manipulate the state of SMB sessions.

**Additional notes:**
- The fix implemented in all provided patches is to skip sessions that are in the process of being torn down. The added check `if (cifs_ses_exiting(ses)) continue;` prevents the UAF condition.
- This vulnerability is present in the Linux kernel's CIFS client implementation
- The fix has been backported to stable kernel branches.
