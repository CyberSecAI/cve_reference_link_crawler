Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the 'aux_gmaps' shortcode of the "Shortcodes and extra features for Phlox theme" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-controlled input used as shortcode attributes, which allows for the injection of malicious web scripts. This injected script is stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.
- **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation:** The plugin doesn't neutralize user input during web page generation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the compromised page.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Defacing websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is the 'aux_gmaps' shortcode. By crafting a malicious shortcode with XSS payloads in its attributes, an attacker can inject malicious scripts.
- This can be done in any page or post where shortcodes are processed and rendered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least "contributor-level" access.
- This level of access allows the user to create or modify pages or posts containing the vulnerable shortcode.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.15.7.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.15.8.
- The vulnerable code is located in the `includes/elements/gmap.php` file of the plugin. Specifically, the `auxin_widget_gmaps_callback` function is responsible for outputting the Google Map element and its associated JavaScript code, and does not properly handle the `style` and `marker_info` attributes.
- The `style` parameter is meant to allow users to customize the map's appearance using JSON, and the `marker_info` parameter is meant to display text within a map marker info window. However, due to lack of proper sanitization and escaping, they both are vulnerable.
- The fix includes proper encoding of the `marker_info` attribute and JSON validation of the `style` attribute.
