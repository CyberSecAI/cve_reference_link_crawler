- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when handling DDNS error codes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attacker. The device must be configured to use the Comexe DDNS service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the vulnerable device. Authentication is not required. The device has to be configured to use the Comexe DDNS service.
