Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2024-27309:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Incorrect access control enforcement during the migration of an Apache Kafka cluster from ZooKeeper (ZK) mode to KRaft mode. Specifically, when removing an ACL from a resource that has two or more other ACLs, Kafka incorrectly treats the resource as having only one ACL, leading to incorrect access control evaluation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper ACL handling during the ZK to KRaft migration.
- Failure to correctly account for multiple ACLs associated with a resource after an ACL removal operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** If only ALLOW ACLs were in place, the impact is primarily an availability issue.
- **Data Modification/Addition:** If DENY ACLs were configured, the impact is more severe. During the migration, these DENY ACLs might be ignored, potentially allowing unauthorized data access, modification or addition, which may lead to confidentiality and integrity issues. The exact impact depends on the specific DENY ACLs in place.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the migration process from ZK to KRaft mode.
- The attack vector involves removing an ACL from a resource that has at least two other ACLs associated. This specific action triggers the incorrect access control logic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be in a position to interact with the Kafka cluster during the ZK to KRaft migration and trigger the ACL removal on a resource with multiple ACLs.
- This typically requires having an administrative role or other authorized access to manage ACLs in the Kafka environment.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is temporary and only exists during the migration period.
- The incorrect condition is cleared by removing all brokers in ZK mode or adding a new ACL to the affected resource.
- Once the migration is completed, the metadata is corrected, and ACLs are correctly enforced, thus no metadata loss occurs.
- The vulnerability affects Apache Kafka versions 3.5.0, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, 3.6.0, and 3.6.1.
- NetApp has acknowledged the vulnerability and lists the affected Apache Kafka versions used in their products.
