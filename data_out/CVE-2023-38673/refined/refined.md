The provided content is a security advisory for CVE-2023-38673.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of `os.system` in the `fs.py` file, which allows for command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The use of `os.system` without proper sanitization or input validation enables arbitrary command execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system where the vulnerable code is running.
- **Attack vectors:** The `mkdirs` function in the `LocalFS` class takes user-controlled input, which is then passed to `os.system` without proper sanitization, making it vulnerable to command injection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to call the `mkdirs` method of the `LocalFS` class with a crafted string to inject malicious commands. The provided PoC demonstrates this.
