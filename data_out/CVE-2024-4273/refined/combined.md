### Description

The Essential Real Estate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'ere\_property\_map' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

The plugin is great, and all features are working perfectly except for the gallery images. If someone edits the images and updates the property page, the images don’t get updated. There seems to be an issue with the post attachment update code. Other than that, everything else is working well.

Who would think of removing a link as important as: “Remove link author property”, What update or improvement is that?

I had submitted this review a few days ago and now I see that they have release a revised version, so I went on and checked and when checking the details it is telling me that even the latest version of this plugin is still NOT compatible with the latest version of wordpress. I went ahead and updated and the same issues still exists, it breaks the CSS on the site, changes all the colors on the Beyot theme running by itself, plus a bunch of other issues. My conclusion is that they do not know how to generate a new update without messing up the CSS that does not need updating. They parse every file while updating which is very unprofessional.So I am still not recommending this plugin and their Beyot them at all….zero rating!!!
This plugin comes with a few different themes of this author which are also primitive and miss a lot of modern themes functions.Every time they update this plugin, they manage to screw up something and it messes up your website and you end up spending hours and hours trying to fix their booboo.I just check and the latest version of this plugin is still not compatible with the current version of WP.Also we are still using the 3.9.5 version of this plugin which is a couple of years old and have turned off auto update because if it updates you wake up to a website that its CSS is totally garbled and it the real estate setting reverts to its default setting and you lose everything.I would not recommend this thing at all. Ask me and I have the screenshots to prove to you that this thing is garbage.

Constant blunders, waiting for correction for a long time. Additional functions do not work. I wrote it a month ago and it’s no use. The plugin’s functionality is weak… Still, this is a serious moment!

I had been using ERE since 2020. Outstanding guys. Keep it going.
Let G5 customise to your needs at a minimum fee. Yes they provided free loadings but every1 has their preferences. They are not expensive guys. They worked out all these, they are worth the extra dollar to keep them going. I am not linked or affiliated to G5 however I really appreciate these people for establishing ERE. It is indeed the most useful plugin in the realtors’ world.
