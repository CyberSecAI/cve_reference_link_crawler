- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Community by PeepSo plugin (versions <= 6.0.9.0) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions while they are authenticated.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor can craft a request that is then executed by an authenticated user, without their knowledge or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or opening a malicious page, to trigger the CSRF attack. The attacker does not require any specific privileges on the target website.
