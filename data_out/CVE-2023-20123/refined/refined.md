- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists because session credentials used in offline access mode of Cisco Duo Two-Factor Authentication for macOS and Duo Authentication for Windows Logon and RDP do not properly expire.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper expiration of session credentials, leading to replay attacks.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to an affected macOS or Windows device by replaying previously used multifactor authentication (MFA) codes, bypassing MFA protection.
- **Attack Vectors:** Physical access to the target device is required. The attacker needs to replay previously used MFA codes.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs physical access to the device and the ability to replay captured MFA credentials. The attacker is unauthenticated.
