Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `formexeCommand` function of the Tenda FH1203 router firmware. Specifically, the `cmdinput` parameter's value is assigned to the `cmd_buf` variable without proper sanitization. This variable is then directly used in the `doSystemCmd` function, allowing for the execution of arbitrary commands.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation and sanitization on the `cmdinput` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject system commands into the router's command execution mechanism.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the vulnerable device. This could lead to a variety of malicious outcomes such as:
    *   Full control of the router
    *   Data exfiltration
    *   Denial of service
    *   Installation of malware
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/exeCommand` endpoint. The malicious command is injected via the `cmdinput` parameter in the POST data.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the router, typically requiring being on the same network as the device. The provided PoC uses the `requests` library indicating an attacker sends a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
