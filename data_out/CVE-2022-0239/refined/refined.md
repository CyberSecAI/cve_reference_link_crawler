The provided content relates to CVE-2022-0239.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of secure processing enabled when parsing XML, specifically in the `XMLUtils.java` file of the `stanfordnlp/CoreNLP` project.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the usage of `SchemaFactory` without explicitly setting the `FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING` feature to `true`. This allows potentially malicious XML schemas to cause issues like denial-of-service attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in the schema processing logic.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially exploit this by crafting a malicious XML schema. This can cause a variety of issues including:
- Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in the schema processing
- XML External Entity (XXE) injection

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves providing a malicious XML schema to the affected application. When the application processes this schema without secure processing enabled, it becomes vulnerable to exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious XML schema to the `getValidatingXmlParser` function.
