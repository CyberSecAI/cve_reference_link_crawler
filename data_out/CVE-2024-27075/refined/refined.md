{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `stv0367_writereg` function in the DVB frontend driver was causing stack overflow warnings due to large stack frame sizes when compiled with clang and KASAN_STACK enabled. This was caused by the creation of temporary i2c_msg structures on the stack when KASAN_STACK was enabled.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack overflow vulnerability due to large stack frame size in the stv0367_writereg function.",
       "Inefficient handling of temporary i2c_msg structures leading to stack duplication with KASAN enabled"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability itself does not directly lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, or information leak. However, it can cause compilation failures due to the stack overflow warning. It is also possible that the root cause of this vulnerability (large stack frame size) could be exploited to cause a denial of service or other undefined behavior.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker cannot directly exploit this vulnerability since it is a compilation issue, not a runtime issue. However, the root cause (large stack frame size) can be triggered by an attacker sending malformed data to the DVB driver.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to somehow trigger the vulnerable code path. In practice, this is more of a compilation problem that can be encountered during the development process of the Linux kernel."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The `stv0367_writereg` function was simplified to avoid large stack frame sizes.",
    "The `stv0367_writereg` and `stv0367_readreg` functions were marked as `noinline_for_stack` to prevent duplication of temporary `i2c_msg` structures on the stack when `KASAN_STACK` is enabled."
