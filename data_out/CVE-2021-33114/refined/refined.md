**Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the software. This weakness allows for unintended behavior when processing malicious or malformed input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can potentially disrupt the normal operation of the affected system, rendering it unavailable or unstable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Adjacent Access: The attacker needs to be in close proximity to the target device, likely within the range of the Wi-Fi signal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Authenticated User: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the same network (e.g. connected to the same Wi-Fi network)
*   Adjacent Network: The attacker needs to be within the Wi-Fi range of the vulnerable device.
*   The attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability using the adjacent access network.
