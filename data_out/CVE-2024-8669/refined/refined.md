### CVE-2024-8669

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the 'options' parameter within the `backuply_wp_clone_sql()` function. This lack of proper escaping on user-supplied input and inadequate preparation of the existing SQL query allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input.
- The `backuply_wp_clone_sql()` function does not properly sanitize the 'options' parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can append malicious SQL queries to existing ones.
- Sensitive information can be extracted from the database.
- The vulnerability allows for unauthorized access and modification of data within the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the 'options' parameter passed to the `backuply_wp_clone_sql()` function.
- The vulnerable function is accessible via a web request to the WordPress plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with administrator-level access or above in WordPress.
- They require the ability to send requests to the WordPress plugin with a crafted 'options' parameter.
