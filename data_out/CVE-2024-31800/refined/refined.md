{
  "vulnerability_1": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2024-31798",
    "root_cause": "Exposed UART port transmits Wi-Fi credentials in clear text during the boot process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cleartext storage of sensitive information",
      "Lack of authentication on the UART port"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with physical access can obtain Wi-Fi credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the network and other connected devices.",
    "attack_vector": "Physical access to the device and connection to the UART port.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Physical access to the device is required, and the ability to connect to the exposed UART port."
  },
   "vulnerability_2": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2024-31799",
      "root_cause": "Bypass of the interactive shell login prompt via bootloader settings manipulation.",
    "weaknesses": [
     "Insecure bootloader configuration",
      "Lack of proper access controls for bootloader settings"
   ],
    "impact": "An attacker with physical access can bypass the login prompt and gain root shell access, allowing them full control over the camera.",
    "attack_vector": "Physical access to the device and manipulation of bootloader settings through the UART port.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Physical access to the device and ability to interact with the UART port and modify bootloader settings."
  },
  "vulnerability_3": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2024-31800",
    "root_cause": "Use of the same root password across multiple devices.",
    "weaknesses": [
     "Weak default credentials",
      "Lack of unique device configuration"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who has physical access to one camera and can obtain the root password can potentially gain access to other cameras of the same type.",
    "attack_vector": "Physical access to one of the devices and then leveraging the UART connection.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Physical access to at least one device and knowledge of how to exploit vulnerabilities to gain root access."
