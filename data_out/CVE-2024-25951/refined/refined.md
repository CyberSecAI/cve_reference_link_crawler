- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious authenticated user could gain control of the underlying operating system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is in local RACADM, meaning the attacker needs local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the system.
