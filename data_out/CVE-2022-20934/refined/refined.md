Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to improper input validation for specific CLI commands in Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software and Cisco FXOS Software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Command Injection (CWE-77): The software fails to properly validate input, allowing an attacker to inject operating system commands into legitimate CLI commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Arbitrary command execution: A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted command prompt and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as root.
*   Escalation of privileges: The vulnerability can be exploited to regain access to the expert mode command prompt, which should no longer be available in certain deployments.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Local access: The attacker needs local access to the vulnerable device.
*   CLI: The vulnerability is exploited through the CLI of the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Authentication: The attacker must have valid *Administrator* credentials to access the CLI.
*   Local access: The attacker must be able to connect locally to the device

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is more dangerous in deployments where administrator access to expert mode is restricted.
* There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
* The vulnerability was found by Brandon Sakai of Cisco during internal security testing.
* Cisco has released software updates to address the issue.
