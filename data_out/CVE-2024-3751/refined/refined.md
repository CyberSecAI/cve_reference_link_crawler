- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings, which will then be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, defacing, or redirecting the user to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with high privileges (Admin+) can inject malicious JavaScript code through the plugin's onboarding screen, specifically in the "What's the name of your show?" field. The XSS is triggered when a user views an episode associated with the crafted podcast name.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user, such as an administrator, to access the onboarding screen where the malicious payload is injected. They need to be able to create and view podcasts using the plugin. The vulnerability is triggered through the initial onboarding flow.
