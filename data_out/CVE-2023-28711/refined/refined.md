- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient control flow management in the Hyperscan Library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from inadequate control flow management, leading to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack can be performed locally by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the system where the vulnerable Hyperscan Library is used.
