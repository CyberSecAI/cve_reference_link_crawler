- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The LearnPress WordPress plugin lacks sufficient protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unintended actions while authenticated. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page that would then execute the unwanted action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need prior authentication. They need to be able to trick a logged-in user into performing the malicious action.
