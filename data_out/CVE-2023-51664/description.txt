tj-actions/changed-files is a Github action to retrieve all files and directories. Prior to 41.0.0, the `tj-actions/changed-files` workflow allows for command injection in changed filenames, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code and potentially leak secrets. This issue may lead to arbitrary command execution in the GitHub Runner. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 41.0.0. Users are advised to upgrade.
