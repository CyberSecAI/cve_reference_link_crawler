## Description

Testimonial Slider shows the testimonials and feedbacks submitted by your Happy Customers in a clean, responsive and beautiful Slider format. The ‚ÄúTestimonials‚Äù are a Custom Post Type so it is very easy to add, modify and delete testimonials. You can enter the Customer‚Äôs Image/Avatar, Name, Company, Website in the Custom Fields for the Testimonial and the actual Testimonial text in the ‚ÄúDescription‚Äù. It is as simple as that!

#### Important notice about this plugin‚Äôs maintainership and future

This plugin is (October 2018) under new maintainership. The previous maintainer (whom we sincerely thank for his work) was no longer working on it. Security issues had been discovered, and not fixed, and the wordpress.org repository had closed the plugin. We have taken over maintainership *solely for the purposes of keeping the plugin alive* (since we were using it on our own live sites) and secure. No future feature developments are planned, though, you are welcome to send in new code for us to evaluate for inclusion if you are interested yourself. As such, we *do not particularly recommend* using this plugin on new sites, as it has no planned future of new features, only of being kept alive. Accordingly, whilst users are of course welcome and encouraged to support eachother in the wordpress.org forums, we will be quite likely to pass over anything found there except significant bug reports.

#### Features:

* 5 Stylish Skins
* Create Unlimited Testimonials Slider Settings
* Add List View of Slider Quickly
* Add only specific ‚ÄúTestimonials‚Äù to Custom Slider
* Show ‚ÄúCategory‚Äù specific Testimonials
* Show ‚ÄúRecent‚Äù testimonials auto fetched by the slider
* Show the Testimonials List using Template tag or Shortcode
* Shortcodes and Widgets available
* Multiple Sliders, Multiple Settings and Multiple transition effects supported.
* Language Files Available

  + Spanish
  + Dutch
  + French

### Usage

**Option 1 ‚Äì Widget**

* Use Testimonial Slider ‚Äì Simple Widget, Testimonial Category Widget or Testimonial Recent Slider Widget to insert the Slider in the Widgetized area of your WordPress theme

**Option 2 ‚Äì Manual Insertion of Shortcode**

* To insert the Testimonial Slider, paste the below shortcode in the content section of your WordPress post/page:

  [testimonialslider]
* Category Shortcode

  [testimonialcategory catg\_slug=‚Äùsupport‚Äù]
* Recent Testimoniials in Slider

  [testimonialrecent]
* Testimonials List

  [testimonialList]

**Please refer the [Testimonial Slider Documentation](http://guides.slidervilla.com/testimonial-slider/) for more details.** N.B. The linked site is maintained by a previous maintainer. We cannot guarantee it will remain operative into the future.

## Changelog

#### 1.3.3 ‚Äì (2024/May/02)

* SECURITY: Previous releases (going back to before we took over the plugin) allowed a WordPress user who had permission to author content to include unfiltered HTML within that content via the testimonialcategory shortcode, a permission which is only intended to be possible for site owners. This means that if your site has non-admin users with privileges to create content using shortcodes, then they could include unwanted HTML (including JavaScript). Thanks to Krzysztof ZajƒÖc for the responsible disclosure.

#### 1.3.2 ‚Äì (2022/Dec/16)

* SECURITY: Previous releases (for at least several years before we took over the plugin) included a targeted CSRF/XSS vulnerability due to a missing nonce check: if an attacker could persuade the site owner to click on a personally-targetted link whilst logged in, then the attacker could input arbitrary HTML into the plugin‚Äôs admin area page
* TWEAK: Add output escaping functions in many places
* TWEAK: Update jQuery document ready style to the one not deprecated in jQuery 3.0
* TWEAK: Fix an SQL error in testimonial\_carousel\_posts\_on\_slider()

#### 1.3.1 ‚Äì (2020/Nov/06)

* FIX: Some graphical elements (rarely used) were missing

#### 1.3.0 (2018/Oct/18)

* MAINTAINERSHIP: The plugin has a new maintainer, since it had become unmaintained and closed due to unfixed security issues. Our sole aim is to keep it functioning. We have no aim to add new features.
* SECURITY FIXES: Various actions were not protected by WordPress nonces, making targetted attacks against logged-in administrators possible. There were also unsanitised inputs.
* COMPATIBILITY: The ‚Äúrequires at least‚Äù field has been updated to WordPress 4.2+. Nothing in particular has been changed to stop it working on earlier versions (the previous value was 3.5+). We just lack resources to support earlier versions.
* PERFORMANCE: Pass the already existing WP\_Post object to get\_permalink(), saving one SQL query per slide
* TWEAK: Minor code-styling tweaks.
* TWEAK: Prevent direct access to files.
* TWEAK: Replacethe deprecated PHP function create\_function()

#### 1.2.5 (05/15/2017)

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
