- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape certain settings, specifically within the "Message for show during form submission" field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (e.g., Editor role in WordPress) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users viewing the affected page. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's settings page, specifically "Popup4Phone > Settings > Form".
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least "Editor" privileges on the WordPress website. They must also be able to access and modify plugin settings.
