Any good reasons why the version numbers are pinned (which prevents some security and patch updates)?

Them SemVer selector `^` should be not problematic.

Besides this, if you want to pin the version of all dependencies and their dependencies, there is npm-shrinkwrap. Otherwise users would have to install with `npm i cross-fetch --save-exact` or similar. See also <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install>

Sorry, something went wrong.
