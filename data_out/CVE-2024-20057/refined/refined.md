Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-20057:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing bounds check within the `keyInstall` function. This lack of validation allows for an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write:** The core issue is the absence of a proper check on the input to `keyInstall`, which can lead to writing data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** Successful exploitation could lead to local privilege escalation. An attacker with system privileges can leverage this vulnerability to gain further access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local exploitation: The attacker needs to have already obtained system privileges on the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have achieved System level privileges on the vulnerable device.
- No user interaction is required for exploitation once the attacker has the required privileges.

**Affected Chipsets:**
- MT6761, MT6765, MT6768, MT6779, MT6781, MT6785, MT6789, MT6833, MT6835, MT6853, MT6855, MT6873, MT6877, MT6879, MT6883, MT6885, MT6886, MT6889, MT6893, MT6895, MT6897, MT6983, MT8321, MT8385, MT8755, MT8765, MT8766, MT8768, MT8771, MT8781, MT8786, MT8788, MT8789, MT8791T, MT8792, MT8795T, MT8796

**Affected Software Versions:**
- Android 12.0, 13.0, 14.0

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is reported to be internal, which means it was discovered by MediaTek's own security team.
- No user interaction is needed for exploitation.
