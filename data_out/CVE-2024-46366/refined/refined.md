{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Client-side Template Injection (CSTI) vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application is vulnerable to Client-side Template Injection (CSTI), specifically during the lead creation process. This vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly sanitize or escape user-supplied input before rendering it within client-side templates.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary client-side template code. This can lead to privilege escalation, potentially granting the attacker elevated permissions within the CRM system when the malicious payload is executed.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by injecting a malicious payload during the lead creation process.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a remote attacker capable of injecting malicious payloads during the lead creation process."
