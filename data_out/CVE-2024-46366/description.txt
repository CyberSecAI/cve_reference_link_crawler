A Client-side Template Injection (CSTI) vulnerability in Webkul Krayin CRM 1.3.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary client-side template code by injecting a malicious payload during the lead creation process. This can lead to privilege escalation when the payload is executed, granting the attacker elevated permissions within the CRM system.
