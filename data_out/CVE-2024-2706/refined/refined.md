- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formWifiWpsStart` function of the Tenda AC10U v1.0 Firmware V15.03.06.49.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `index` parameter from a POST request is directly used in a `sprintf` function without proper bounds checking. This allows an attacker to provide a large value for `index` and overwrite the stack, including the return address.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can overwrite the return address of the function, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted POST request to the `/goform/WifiWpsStart` endpoint with a large value for the `index` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device.
