Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the direct concatenation of user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or the use of parameterized queries. Specifically, the `$id` variable is used directly in `DELETE` and `UPDATE` statements in the `delete_category/delete_inv/delete_laundry/delete_supply/delete_user/save_inv/save_user` functions, within `admin_class.php`. Additionally, user-supplied `username` and `password` values are used in a login query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can manipulate the SQL queries by injecting malicious code through the vulnerable input parameters. This can lead to unauthorized access, data modification, or data exfiltration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially:
    - Gain unauthorized access to the database.
    - Modify or delete sensitive data.
    - Extract sensitive information from the database.
    - Potentially execute arbitrary code on the database server, depending on database configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerable parameters are primarily the `id` parameter in the following `ajax.php` actions: `delete_category`, `delete_inv`, `delete_laundry`, `delete_supply`, `delete_user`.
- The `login` action is vulnerable through `username` and `password` parameters.
- The `save_inv` action is vulnerable through the `id` parameter.
- The `save_user` action is vulnerable through the `id` parameter.
- These parameters are passed via HTTP POST requests to `/ajax.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server, specifically to the `/ajax.php` endpoint.
- They must be able to manipulate the parameters such as `id` in delete actions or `username` and `password` in the login action.
- The attacker needs to have access to the application, including the login page and administrative pages, to exploit these injection points.
- No special network position is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located within the `admin_class.php` file where the `Action` class's methods are defined.
- The code snippets confirm the lack of parameterized queries and direct use of the `$id` variable in SQL queries.
- The provided proof of concept shows different attack vectors, and the use of sqlmap to confirm the SQL injection vulnerability.
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in multiple functions, not just delete actions as stated in some of the descriptions.
