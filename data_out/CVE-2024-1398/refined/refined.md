Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1398:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the 'heading.php' template of the Ultimate Bootstrap Elements for Elementor plugin. Specifically, the `heading_title_tag` and `heading_sub_title_tag` parameters are not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS because it does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it on the page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of a user's browser when they view a page containing the vulnerable heading element.
-  Data theft: The injected script could potentially steal sensitive user data, such as cookies or session tokens.
- Defacement: Attackers could modify the content of the affected pages.
- Redirection to malicious sites: The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites.
- Privilege escalation:  In some cases, XSS can be used to escalate privileges within a web application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `heading_title_tag` and `heading_sub_title_tag` parameters of the plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated attacker: An attacker needs to have at least contributor-level permissions on the WordPress site to be able to inject the malicious scripts.
- Access to the Elementor editor: The attacker would need to have the capability to edit pages using the Elementor page builder, to be able to manipulate these settings in the plugin.
