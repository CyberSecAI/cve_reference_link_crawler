- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by a high-privilege user (e.g., admin) by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. The injected script is then executed when a user views the affected part of the site (e.g., the widget).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have admin-level or similar high-privilege access to the WordPress site.
