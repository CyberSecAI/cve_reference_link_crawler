Based on the provided information, this commit fixes a memory leak in the `mt7915` driver of the Linux kernel.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from incorrect ordering of operations within the `mt7915_unregister_device` function. Specifically, `mt7915_tx_token_put()` was being called after `mt76_free_device()`, which could lead to a memory leak. `mt7915_tx_token_put` frees tx tokens allocated, and `mt76_free_device` frees the pending txwi which might have those tokens, meaning tokens could have been freed twice.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory Leak: Failure to properly free resources resulting in memory not being returned to the system, potentially leading to system instability if the leak is significant enough.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion due to the leak, leading to degraded system performance or crashes.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the device unregistration (e.g. through unloading the driver) will trigger the vulnerable code. The attacker needs to be able to control the device or driver lifecycle to trigger this issue

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to unload the mt7915 module to trigger the memory leak. Typically this would require root privileges, but could possibly be a more limited user if the relevant modules were built in or are dynamically loaded by other software.
