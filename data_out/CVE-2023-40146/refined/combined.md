# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1868

## Peplink Smart Reader /bin/login privilege escalation vulnerability

##### April 17, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-40146

##### SUMMARY

A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the /bin/login functionality of Peplink Smart Reader v1.2.0 (in QEMU). A specially crafted command line argument can lead to a limited-shell escape and elevated capabilities. An attacker can authenticate with hard-coded credentials and execute unblocked default busybox functionality to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Peplink Smart Reader v1.2.0 (in QEMU)

##### PRODUCT URLS

Smart Reader - <https://www.peplinkworks.com/Smart-Reader.asp>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

6.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-77 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command (‘Command Injection’)

##### DETAILS

The Peplink Smart Reader is the access-control hardware associated with the PepXIM Time-Logging and Security System. It is used to manage access to buildings, workstations and public transit, as well as for employee time management.

The device utilizes a custom `/bin/login` binary for authentication to the device via serial console. This custom implementation of `/bin/login` adds several undocumented “accounts” to the device, each of which will trigger different binaries when successfully authenticated.

These accounts are named `qctest`, `cli`, `wificli` and `iot`, and they map to the following commands.

```
qctest  -> /usr/sbin/qctest
cli     -> /bin/cli
wificli -> /bin/wireless_cli.sh
iot     -> `cd /tmp; /bin/iotsh`

```

This all occurs within the `main` function of `/bin/login`, beginning at offset `0x401788`. A decompilation is included below for reference.

```
...
if (strcmp(tty, "ttyS0") == 0 || strcmp(tty, "console")) {
    if (strcmp(password, "qctest") == 0 && strcmp(username, "qctest") == 0) {
        puts("\n");
        system("/usr/bin/qctest");
    }
}
if (strcmp(password, "cli") == 0 && strcmp(username, "cli") == 0) {
    puts("\n");
    system("/bin/cli");
} else if (strcmp(password, "wificli") == 0 && strcmp(username, "wificli") == 0) {
    puts("\n");
    system("/bin/wireless_cli.sh");
} else if (strcmp(password, "iot") == 0 && strcmp(username, "iot") == 0) {
    puts("\n");
    system("cd /tmp ; /bin/iotsh");
}
...

```

Of interest is the `iot` account, as `/bin/iotsh` is a custom-built busybox which, when executed as `iotsh`, limits the applets that can be executed to the following: `cm, exit, ifconfig, iperf, modem_connect_enable, ping, route, tcpdump, traceroute`. It does not limit access to all busybox builtins, one of which is `exec`. An attacker who can connect to the serial console of the device can authenticate as the `iot` user and escape the limited shell by running `exec /bin/sh`, which grants them an uninhibited root shell.
