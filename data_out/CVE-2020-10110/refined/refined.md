{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Citrix Gateway web-based solution uses a caching system that includes the 'Age' header in HTTP responses, revealing how long a response has been in the cache.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information Exposure Through Caching (CWE-512). The 'Age' header in HTTP responses discloses how long a response has been cached.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Information Disclosure. An attacker can potentially infer information about the frequency of resource access or other system activities based on the cache age. The information is limited to how long a response has been cached.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending an HTTP request to a resource handled by the caching system, an attacker can observe the 'Age' header.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Citrix Gateway instance."
