# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1442

## Lansweeper WebUserActions.aspx Stored XSS vulnerability

##### February 28, 2022

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-21145

### Summary

A stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in the WebUserActions.aspx functionality of Lansweeper lansweeper 9.1.20.2. A specially-crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary Javascript code injection. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Lansweeper lansweeper 9.1.20.2

### Product URLs

lansweeper - <https://www.lansweeper.com/>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.1 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-80 - Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)

### Details

Lansweeper is an IT Asset Management solution that gathers hardware and software information of computers and other devices on a computer network for management, compliance and audit purposes.

An exploitable stored xss vulnerability is related with an action: `Configuration -> Website Settings` and is located inside `\LS\CF\WebUserActions.cs` file.
Let us take a close look at the vulnerable source code :

```
Line 147	else if (current.Request["action"] == "loginlayout")
Line 148	{
Line 149		JsReturnObject jsReturnObject4 = new JsReturnObject();
Line 150		try
Line 151		{
Line 152			string text4 = current.Request["value"].Trim();
Line 153			string text5 = new Regex("[^a-zA-Z0-9 -]").Replace(current.Request["name"], "");
(...)
Line 240        DB.ExecuteDataset("UPDATE TsysCustomLayout SET " + text5 + " = @p1", DB.NewDBParameter("@p1", (text5 == "loginmessage" || text5 == "loginfootertext") ? HtmlSanitizer.SanitizeHtml(text4) : text4));

```

An attacker controlling parameters `value` and `name` is able to set new values for table fields such as `loginmessage` and `loginfootertext`. There is a sanitization attempt for both mentioned fields in `line 240` before they get updated with a value of parameter `value == text4`.
Unfortunately this check is not proper, and we can simply bypass it by setting e.g value of `name == text5` to e.g `Loginmessage` or ` loginmessage`. In such a way, none of the characters used by us will be removed in` line 153`. Simultaneously, we bypass the check` text5 == loginmessage`. As a consequence we can insert controlled data into the database without any sanitization.
To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker needs to be authenticated and have permissions to change` loginlayout` fields.
Injected code will be automatically triggered each time when a user visits the lansweeper login page.

### Exploit Proof of Concept
