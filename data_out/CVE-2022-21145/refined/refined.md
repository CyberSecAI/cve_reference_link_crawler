Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-21145

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input in the `WebUserActions.aspx` page, specifically when updating the `loginmessage` and `loginfootertext` fields of the `TsysCustomLayout` table. The application attempts to sanitize the input using `HtmlSanitizer.SanitizeHtml` but this can be bypassed by manipulating the `name` parameter of the HTTP request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected and stored in the database, which is then executed when a user visits the login page.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize the input provided through the `name` and `value` parameters allowing an attacker to bypass the sanitization attempt in `line 240` of the code.
- **Lack of Proper Input Validation:** The vulnerability highlights the absence of adequate input validation when parameters `name` and `value` are processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Code Injection:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the Lansweeper login page.
- **Account Compromise:** By executing malicious JavaScript, an attacker could potentially steal user credentials, session cookies, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of legitimate users.
- **Phishing/Malware Distribution:**  The injected script could be used to redirect users to phishing pages or serve malware.
- **Defacement:** The injected code could alter the visual appearance of the login page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/configuration/WebUsers/WebUserActions.aspx?action=loginlayout` endpoint.
- **Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the `name` and `value` parameters in the HTTP request to bypass the sanitization attempt.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated Lansweeper user with permissions to change `loginlayout` fields (Configuration -> Website Settings).
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Lansweeper server.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `\LS\CF\WebUserActions.cs` file.
- The sanitization logic is in `line 240` of the code, specifically the `text5 == "loginmessage" || text5 == "loginfootertext"` check.
- The vulnerability can be bypassed by manipulating the `name` parameter to be "Loginmessage" or " loginmessage" allowing the attacker to insert unsanitized data to the database through the value parameter.
- The injected code is executed each time a user visits the Lansweeper login page.
