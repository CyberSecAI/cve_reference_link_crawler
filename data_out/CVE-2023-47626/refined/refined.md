- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided data when displaying or editing a user's personal tokens. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities. The CVSS metrics indicate a high impact on confidentiality and a low impact on integrity.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks, where the attacker injects malicious code through the user interface, targeting the display or edit functions of user personal tokens.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs low privileges, suggesting the need for an authenticated user. User interaction is not required as the attack executes upon displaying the malicious token.
