The provided content relates to CVE-2024-38277.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the QR login key and the auto-login key for the Moodle mobile app were generated as the same key instead of separate keys.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure key generation: The same key was used for two different functionalities (QR login and auto-login), creating a potential security issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
If the same key is used for both functionalities, and one of the keys is compromised, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access through both methods.

**Attack vectors:**
- If either the QR login key or the auto-login key is obtained by an attacker, they can use it to login through other method.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to obtain a user's login key (either QR or auto-login) from one method to exploit the vulnerability in the other method.
