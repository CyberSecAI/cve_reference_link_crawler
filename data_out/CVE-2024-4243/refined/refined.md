{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a stack buffer overflow in the `formwrlSSIDset` function, specifically due to the `ssidIndex` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The stack buffer overflow can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.",
   "Attack vectors": [
    "Sending a crafted request to the `/goform/wifiSSIDset` endpoint with an overly long `ssidIndex` parameter"
   ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
     "The attacker must be able to send requests to the device's web interface."
   ]
