- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of a single round of SHA-512 hashing on the cleartext password and salt in OpenSlides 4.0.15.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Weak password hashing algorithm due to the use of a single round of SHA-512, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers who obtain the hashed passwords can quickly calculate the original cleartext passwords.
- **Attack vectors:** Access to the hashed passwords is required for exploitation. Attackers can then use massively-parallel computing, including cloud computing, and specialized hardware (GPU, ASIC, or FPGA) to crack the passwords.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have acquired the hashed passwords from the system to be able to perform a brute-force attack.
