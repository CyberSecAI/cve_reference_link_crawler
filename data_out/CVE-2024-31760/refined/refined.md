Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-31760:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient session expiration in `flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin`. The application fails to properly invalidate user sessions when a user is deleted or disabled by an administrator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Session Expiration (CWE-613):** Existing user sessions are not terminated upon user deletion or disabling. This allows a deleted or disabled user to continue using the application as if their account is still active.
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The system does not properly enforce access control by failing to revoke access for deleted or disabled users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A deleted or disabled user can retain their previous privileges and continue performing actions within the system.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Deleted or disabled users can continue to access the application and its data.
- **Data Manipulation/Deletion:** If the deleted user is an admin, they can potentially perform actions like adding or deleting other users, gaining full access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
1. A user logs into the `gin-vue-admin` application.
2. An administrator logs in through a separate session.
3. The administrator deletes or disables the user's account.
4. The previously logged-in user's session remains active, allowing them to continue using the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs a valid user account to log in initially.
- An administrator must delete or disable this user account while the user has an active session.
- The user must still be in an active session after account deletion or disabling to exploit the vulnerability.
