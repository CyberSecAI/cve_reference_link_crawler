| gin-vue-admin 版本 2.4.5 Node 版本 v14.16.0 Golang 版本 go 1.16 是否依旧存在 可以 bug描述 First, a user login gin-vue-admin in one page. Then the admin deletes or disables the user in another page. But the user is still able to do any operations inside gin-vue-admin. Notice that refreshing the page does not force users to login again.  We have report it on <https://huntr.dev/bounties/49ee5f87-3e84-46ec-b8d3-8a57d4886db5/> 21days ago through qimiaojiangjizhao@gmail.com but do not receive feedback. 修改建议 invalid all the user session once the user is deleted. |

| We have comments for this situation in the JWT code. If necessary, you can open that comment yourself. Currently, it is only for the purpose of reducing database read and write, and this detection has not been done. |
