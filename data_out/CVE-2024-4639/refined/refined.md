**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** Malicious users can execute unauthorized commands on the device.
*   This is described as being able to cause "a denial-of-service attack, remote code execution, and information disclosure", however for CVE-2024-4639 the impact listed is command execution with partial confidentiality and integrity impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker sends crafted input to the web service of the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted input to the web service, which implies network access to the device.
