Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2752

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling order meta data within the "Where Did You Hear About Us Checkout Field for WooCommerce" plugin. Specifically, the plugin was not properly sanitizing the "wc_customer_source_checkout_field" and "wc_customer_source_checkout_other_field" meta values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious scripts can be injected into the order meta data, which are then displayed on pages where this data is used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts execute when a user accesses the affected page (e.g., order details), leading to various malicious actions, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection.
*  **Privilege escalation/information disclosure:** The attacker may be able to perform actions as the user accessing the page, potentially gaining access to sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Order Meta Injection:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code through the "Where Did You Hear About Us" checkout fields during order placement or through the order editing interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** Attackers must have at least "Shop Manager" level permissions within the WordPress/WooCommerce environment. This indicates that the attacker needs to have an account with the ability to manage orders.

**More Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of the "Where Did You Hear About Us Checkout Field for WooCommerce" plugin up to and including 1.3.1.
*   The fix involves using `wp_strip_all_tags()` to sanitize the meta data before displaying it. This ensures that any HTML or JavaScript tags injected by an attacker are removed.
*   The patched version of the plugin is 1.3.2.
