### Description

The Where Did You Hear About Us Checkout Field for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via order meta in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with shop manager-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
