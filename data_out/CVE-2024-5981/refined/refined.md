Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `manage_user.php` file of the "Online House Rental System Project In PHP With Source Code" project.
- The vulnerability exists because the application directly uses the "id" parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is susceptible to SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the `id` parameter is directly used in the SQL queries without proper validation or sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- Attackers can modify or delete data.
- Attackers can access sensitive information.
- Attackers can potentially achieve complete system control.
- Service interruption is also a potential risk.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the `manage_user.php` file.
- Attackers can inject malicious SQL code via this parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `manage_user.php` script, and they must have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter (`id`).
- No special privileges are needed beyond the ability to send HTTP requests to the application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated in order to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability is a boolean-based blind SQL injection.
- A Proof of Concept (POC) payload was provided: `id=1 AND 7032=7032`.
- SQLmap was used to identify and exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerable software is "Itsourcecode Online House Rental System Project In PHP With Source Code" version 1.0
- The vulnerability exists in the `manage_user.php` file.
- Remediation suggestions include using prepared statements with parameter binding, input validation and filtering, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.
