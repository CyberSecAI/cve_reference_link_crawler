- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "restore configuration" feature of Softing Secure Integration Server is vulnerable to a directory traversal when processing zip files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23). The application does not properly validate file paths within the uploaded zip file, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can craft a zip file to load an arbitrary dll and execute code on the server. This could lead to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can upload a malicious zip file containing a path traversal file through the "restore configuration" feature of the software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs high privileges to use the restore configuration feature, but otherwise requires no special position or capabilities.
