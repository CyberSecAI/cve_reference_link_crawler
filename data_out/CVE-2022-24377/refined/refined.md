Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24377:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `writeFileToTmpDirAndOpenIt` function of the `cycle-import-check` package. This function does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a shell command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization. The `writeFileToTmpDirAndOpenIt` function constructs a shell command using user-provided input (`filename`), without proper escaping or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious shell commands by manipulating the `filename` parameter. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system where the vulnerable package is used.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:** According to the CVSS score from Snyk, a successful attack could result in high impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs local access to execute code which uses the vulnerable function.
- Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by calling `writeFileToTmpDirAndOpenIt` function with a malicious string as the first argument.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code which uses the vulnerable function in the `cycle-import-check` library.
- No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
- User interaction is not required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable function constructs shell commands using template literals, concatenating user-supplied input with static strings.
- The Proof of Concept (PoC) provided demonstrates how an attacker can inject the command `touch JHU` by passing `& touch JHU` as the filename parameter. This results in creation of a file named `JHU`.
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the package `<1.3.2`. The fix is to update to version `1.3.2` or higher.
- The GitHub commit referenced in Snyk ([https://github.com/Soontao/cycle-import-check/commit/1ca97b59df7e9c704471fcb4cf042ce76d7c9890](https://github.com/Soontao/cycle-import-check/commit/1ca97b59df7e9c704471fcb4cf042ce76d7c9890)) is the commit that introduced this vulnerability and is not a fix for this issue.
