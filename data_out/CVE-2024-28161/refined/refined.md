**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation by default.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker could potentially intercept and modify communications between the Jenkins server and the Data Control Tower due to the disabled certificate validation, leading to information disclosure or tampering.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based man-in-the-middle attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the Jenkins server and the Data Control Tower.
- No specific user interaction is needed.
