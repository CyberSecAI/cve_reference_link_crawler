The provided content contains information about multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the Online Food Ordering System v1.0.  Specifically, it details the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-45325.

**CVE-2023-45325**

*   **Root Cause:** The 'address' parameter in the `routers/add-users.php` resource does not validate or sanitize user input before using it in an SQL query, leading to SQL injection.
*   **Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated SQL Injection (SQLi). The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into an SQL query without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database. This can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete compromise of the database and potentially the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** By sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/routers/add-users.php` with malicious SQL code in the 'address' parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated, thus can be any remote user.
*   **Technical Details:**
    ```php
    $username = $_POST['username'];
    $password = $_POST['password'];
    $name = $_POST['name'];
    $email = $_POST['email'];
    $contact = $_POST['contact'];
    $address = $_POST['address'];
    $role = $_POST['role'];
    $verified = $_POST['verified'];
    $deleted = $_POST['deleted'];
    $sql = "INSERT INTO users (username, password, name, email, contact, address, role, verified, deleted) VALUES ('$username', '$password', '$name', '$email', $contact, '$address', '$role', $verified, $deleted)";
    if($con->query($sql)==true)
    ```
    The code snippet shows that the `$address` variable, directly derived from user input `$_POST['address']`, is incorporated into the SQL query without any sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code using the `address` parameter.
