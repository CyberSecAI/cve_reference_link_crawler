# Session leak in cache

Moderate

[NyanKiyoshi](/NyanKiyoshi)
published
GHSA-52cq-c7x7-cqw4
Mar 20, 2024

## Package

saleor/saleor-storefront
(GitHub)

## Affected versions

<=b5ce60693d9015a12d3001ea4a067a4fb037c14d

## Patched versions

>b5ce60693d9015a12d3001ea4a067a4fb037c14d

## Description

### Impact

When any user authenticates in the storefront, anonymous users are able to access their data.

The session is leaked through cache and can be accessed by anyone.

### Patches

* <https://github.com/saleor/storefront/commit/579241e75a5eb332ccf26e0bcdd54befa33f4783.patch>

### Workarounds

We strongly recommend upgrading to the latest versions, in case of inability to upgrade straight away, a possible workaround is to temporarily disable authentication by changing the usage of `createSaleorAuthClient()`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
