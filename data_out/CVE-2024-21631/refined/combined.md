# Integer overflow in URI leading to potential host spoofing

Moderate

[0xTim](/0xTim)
published
GHSA-r6r4-5pr8-gjcp
Jan 3, 2024

## Package

swift

vapor
([Swift](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Aswift))

## Affected versions

<= 4.89.3

## Patched versions

4.90.0

## Description

Vapor's `vapor_urlparser_parse` function uses `uint16_t` indexes when parsing a URI's components, which may cause integer overflows when parsing untrusted inputs.

This vulnerability does not affect Vapor directly but could impact applications relying on the URI type for validating user input.

The URI type is used in several places in Vapor. A developer may decide to use URI to represent a URL in their application (especially if that URL is then passed to the HTTP Client) and rely on its public properties and methods. However, URI may fail to properly parse a valid (albeit abnormally long) URL, due to string ranges being converted to 16-bit integers. An attacker may use this behaviour to trick the application into accepting a URL to an untrusted destination.

By padding the port number with zeros, an attacker can cause an integer overflow to occur when the URL authority is parsed and, as a result, spoof the host.

### Impact

Users attempting to treat untrusted input as a URI are vulnerable to a host spoofing attack due to an integer overflow.

### Workarounds

Validate user input before parsing as a URI or, if possible, use Foundation's `URL` and `URLComponents` utilities.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
