Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-2112

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flaw in the "desktop component service" which improperly handles session status functions. This allows for "lateral movement between sessions".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The service does not properly restrict access to session-related functionality, allowing unauthorized actions to occur across user sessions. Specifically, the launch session status function is vulnerable.
-  **CAPEC-1 Accessing Functionality Not Properly Constrained by ACLs**: This CAPEC (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification) entry highlights the specific nature of the vulnerability, which involves accessing functionality without proper ACLs (Access Control Lists) in place.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Lateral Movement:** An attacker could move between different user sessions on the same system.
- **Confidentiality Impact (Low):**  The attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information in other user sessions.
- **Integrity Impact (Low):** The attacker could potentially modify data within other user sessions.
- **Availability Impact (None):** The vulnerability does not directly lead to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access (AV:L):** The attack requires local access to the affected system.
- **Complex Exploit Conditions(AC:H):** The attack is considered to have a high complexity, although the specifics are not detailed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges (PR:L):** An attacker would need only low-level user privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction (UI:N):** The attack can be performed without requiring any interaction from a user.

**Affected Products:**
- M-Files Desktop before version 23.4.12455.0

**CVSS Score:**
- 3.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information is consistent with the CVE description, providing more specific details about the vulnerable component (desktop component service) and the nature of the flaw.
- The specific mechanism of the "lateral movement" between sessions is not fully detailed.
