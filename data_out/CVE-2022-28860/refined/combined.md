This new version CT-IM 2021R1 (composed of the server-based software V9.1R2E1.P1 and the edge-based application V2.2R2E1.P2) of our solution is available from October 18, 2021.  In addition to a number of patches and enhancements in this version, we have focused in particular on improving the cyber security of the AID system as a whole.  Earlier versions present two vulnerability risks that can vary depending on the overall environment in which the AID system is embedded: https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-28860 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-28861   If you are running a version released before October 2021, we suggest you get in touch with your usual Citilog project manager (or contact us via our support platform https://citilogsupport.freshdesk.com ) to arrange a meeting or video-conference to assess together the best way to secure your AID system.   Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.   Christophe Colombel, Product Manager, Citilog SAS
