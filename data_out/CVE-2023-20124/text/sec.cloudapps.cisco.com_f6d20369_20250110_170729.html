This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user input within incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain *root*-level privileges and access unauthorized data. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have valid administrative credentials on the affected device.  Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, administrators may disable the affected feature as described in the [Workarounds](#workarounds) section.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sb-rv01x_rv32x_rce-nzAGWWDD>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco RV Series Small Business Routers:    + RV016 Multi-WAN VPN Routers   + RV042 Dual WAN VPN Routers   + RV042G Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers   + RV082 Dual WAN VPN Routers   + RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers   + RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers   Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco RV Series Small Business Routers:    + RV160 VPN Routers   + RV160W Wireless-AC VPN Routers   + RV260 VPN Routers   + RV260P VPN Routers with PoE   + RV260W Wireless-AC VPN Routers   + RV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers   + RV340W Dual WAN Gigabit Wireless-AC VPN Routers   + RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers   + RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit PoE VPN Routers  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  To mitigate this vulnerability on Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Routers, disable remote management. To mitigate this vulnerability on Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, and RV082 Routers, disable remote management and block access to ports 443 and 60443. The routers will still be accessible through the LAN interface after the mitigation has been implemented. Disable Remote Management To disable remote management, do the following:    1. Log in to the web-based management interface for the device.   2. Choose **Firewall > General**.   3. Uncheck the **Remote Management** check box.Block Access to Ports 443 and 60443 First, add a new service to the access rules of the device for port 60443. It is not necessary to create a service for port 443 because it is predefined in the services list.    1. Log in to the web-based management interface for the device.   2. Choose **Firewall > Access Rules**.   3. Click **Service Management**.   4. In the **Service Name** field, enter **TCP-60443**.   5. From the **Protocol** drop-down list, choose **TCP**.   6. In both of the **Port Range** fields, enter **60443**.   7. Click **Add to List**.   8. Click **OK**. Next, create access rules to block ports 443 and 60443. To create an access rule to block port 443, do the following:    1. Log in to the web-based management interface for the device.   2. Choose **Firewall > Access Rules**.   3. Click **Add**.   4. From the **Action** drop-down list, choose **Deny**.   5. From the **Service** drop-down list, choose **HTTPS (TCP 443-443)**.   6. From the **Log** drop-down list, choose **Log packets match this rule**.   7. From the **Source Interface** drop-down list, choose the option that matches the WAN connection on the device.   8. From the **Source IP** drop-down list, choose **Any**.   9. From the **Destination IP** drop-down list, choose **Single**.   10. In both of the **Destination IP** fields, enter the WAN IP address.   11. Click **Save**. To create an access rule to block port 60443, repeat the preceding steps, but for Step 5, choose **HTTPS (TCP 60443-60443)** from the **Service** drop-down list.  **Note**: If a second WAN port is being used, two additional ACL rules need to be set up using the WAN number and IP address for the second WAN port.  While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has not released and will not release software updates to address the vulnerability described in this advisory.
