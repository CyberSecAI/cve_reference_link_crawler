# OpenAI’s ChatGPT Mac app was storing conversations in plain text

# OpenAI’s ChatGPT Mac app was storing conversations in plain text

## After the security flaw was spotted, OpenAI updated its desktop ChatGPT app to encrypt the locally stored records.

Until Friday, OpenAI’s recently launched ChatGPT macOS app had a potentially worrying security issue: it wasn’t hard to find your chats stored on your computer and read them in plain text. That meant that if a bad actor or malicious app had access to your machine, they could easily read your conversations with ChatGPT and the data contained within them.

As demonstrated [by Pedro José Pereira Vieito on Threads](https://www.threads.net/%40pvieito/post/C85NVV6hvF6?xmt=AQGz0o3JtBOwk1nfUgk8lvxQoIV8E92xz1vK1IP8VC6zhA), the ease of access meant it was possible to have another app access those files and show you the text of your conversations right after they happened. Pereira Vieito shared the app he made with me, and I used it to make a video showing how the app can read my ChatGPT conversations with the click of a button. I was also able to find the files on my computer and see the text of conversations just by changing the file name.

After *The Verge* contacted OpenAI about the issue, the company released an update that it says encrypts the chats. “We are aware of this issue and have shipped a new version of the application which encrypts these conversations,” OpenAI spokesperson Taya Christianson says in a statement to *The Verge*. “We’re committed to providing a helpful user experience while maintaining our high security standards as our technology evolves.”

After downloading the update, Pereira Vieito’s app no longer works for me, and I can’t see my conversations in plain text.

I asked Pereira Vieito how he discovered the original issue. “I was curious about why [OpenAI] opted out of using the app sandbox protections and ended up checking where they stored the app data,” he said. OpenAI only offers the [ChatGPT macOS app](/2024/6/25/24186032/openai-chatgpt-mac-app-advanced-voice-mode-delayed) through [its own website](https://openai.com/chatgpt/mac/), meaning the app doesn’t have to follow Apple’s sandboxing requirements that apply to software distributed via the Mac App Store.

# ChatGPT’s much-heralded Mac app was storing conversations as plain text

The app was updated to address the issue after it gained public attention.

OpenAI announced its Mac desktop app for ChatGPT with a lot of fanfare a few weeks ago, but it turns out it had a rather serious security issue: user chats were stored in plain text, where any bad actor could find them if they gained access to your machine.

As Threads user Pedro José Pereira Vieito [noted earlier this week](https://www.threads.net/%40pvieito/post/C85NVV6hvF6?xmt=AQGz0o3JtBOwk1nfUgk8lvxQoIV8E92xz1vK1IP8VC6zhA), "the OpenAI ChatGPT app on macOS is not sandboxed and stores all the conversations in plain-text in a non-protected location," meaning "any other running app / process / malware can read all your ChatGPT conversations without any permission prompt."

He added:

> macOS has blocked access to any user private data since macOS Mojave 10.14 (6 years ago!). Any app accessing private user data (Calendar, Contacts, Mail, Photos, any third-party app sandbox, etc.) now requires explicit user access.
>
> OpenAI chose to opt-out of the sandbox and store the conversations in plain text in a non-protected location, disabling all of these built-in defenses.

OpenAI has now [updated the app](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/3/24191636/openai-chatgpt-mac-app-conversations-plain-text), and the local chats are now encrypted, though they are still not sandboxed. (The app is only available as a direct download from OpenAI's website and is not available through Apple's App Store where more stringent security is required.)

Many people now use ChatGPT like they might use Google: to ask important questions, sort through issues, and so on. Often, sensitive personal data could be shared in those conversations.

It's not a great look for OpenAI, which recently entered into a [partnership](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/apple-integrates-chatgpt-into-siri-ios-and-mac-os/) with Apple to offer chat bot services built into Siri queries in Apple operating systems. Apple detailed some of the security around those queries at WWDC last month, though, and they're more stringent than what OpenAI did (or to be more precise, didn't do) with its Mac app, which is a separate initiative from the partnership.

If you've been using the app recently, be sure to update it as soon as possible.
