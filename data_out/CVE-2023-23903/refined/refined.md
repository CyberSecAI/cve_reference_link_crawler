- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of the SAML configuration file format uploaded by an authenticated administrator.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not check the correct format of the uploaded SAML configuration file, allowing for an incorrectly formatted file to be uploaded. This leads to a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The entire application becomes unusable, rendering all application requests as errors until manual console intervention.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated administrator uploads a maliciously crafted SAML configuration file via the web management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator of the Guardian or CMC application.
