{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation or sanitization in the application, allowing for arbitrary directory creation and enumeration.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary Directory Creation",
      "Directory Enumeration"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can create arbitrary directories on the server and enumerate existing directories, potentially leading to further exploitation or data exposure.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is likely through a web interface or API that allows directory-related operations without proper input sanitization.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the vulnerable interface, possibly requiring some form of authentication or access to the application's endpoints."
