Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:** An invalid memory access in the `zzip_disk_entry_to_file_header` function within the `mmapped.c` file of the zziplib library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The vulnerability stems from an attempt to access memory outside the allocated buffer, specifically during the process of converting a disk entry to a file header. This occurs when processing a specially crafted zip file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The invalid memory access leads to a segmentation fault (SEGV), causing the application using the vulnerable library to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious ZIP file:** An attacker can craft a malicious ZIP file that, when processed by an application using a vulnerable version of the zziplib library, triggers the memory access violation.
*   **`unzzip-mem` executable:** Specifically, the provided information shows the vulnerability being triggered by the `unzzip-mem` executable, which processes ZIP files from memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to supply a crafted ZIP file:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable application with a specially crafted zip file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was initially reported for zziplib version 0.13.69.
*   The AddressSanitizer (ASAN) tool identified a segmentation fault in the `zzip_disk_entry_to_file_header` function.
*   A proof-of-concept (POC) zip file named `zip_poc.zip` was provided, which triggers the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-18770.
*   A fix has been implemented which does a pre-check on the header trailer magic, and has been merged as of commit 803f49a.
