{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A segmentation fault occurs within the `parser_parse_class` function due to an attempt to write to a null address (0x000000000010). The issue is triggered by a specific JavaScript code snippet that involves a class expression within a switch case statement.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is a memory corruption issue that manifests as a segmentation fault when parsing a crafted JavaScript code using JerryScript.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a crash or denial of service of the JerryScript engine due to the segmentation fault. This could potentially be triggered remotely by an attacker providing malicious Javascript code.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves providing a crafted JavaScript code snippet to the JerryScript engine. The specific code involves a class expression being part of a switch case condition. This code, when parsed by the vulnerable parser, triggers the segfault.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted JavaScript code to be processed by the vulnerable JerryScript engine."
