- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `get_image_base64` function in `PublicController.php` of the CRMEB open source mall system does not properly validate the `image/code` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary file read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, including source code, configuration files, and user data.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the `image/code` parameter within the `get_image_base64` function in `PublicController.php`, an attacker can specify the path of a file they wish to read.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be able to send a request to the vulnerable endpoint.
