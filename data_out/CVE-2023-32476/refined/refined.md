- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Hard-coded secrets are present in javascript files within Dell Hybrid Client version 2.0.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive Data Exposure. The hardcoded secrets can be accessed by malicious users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated malicious user can access hard coded secrets, potentially leading to compromise of the affected system with high impact to Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the affected device. The CVSS score also indicates High Privileges are needed, but the description states an unauthenticated user can perform the exploit, which is confusing.
