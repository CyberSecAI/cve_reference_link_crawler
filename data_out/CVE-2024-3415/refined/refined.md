Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `branches_name` parameter in `addbranches_process.php` is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before storing it in the database. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- The vulnerability is a *stored XSS*, meaning the malicious payload is stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Taking control of the user's browser.
    - Stealing user information (e.g., session cookies).
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacing the web page.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a web request to the `addbranches_process.php` script, specifically through the `branches_name` parameter.
- The attacker sends a POST request containing the malicious JavaScript payload within the `branches_name` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No specific privilege requirements are mentioned in the provided text, which would indicate the attacker needs to be logged into the application to submit this request.
- It is likely the attacker needs access to the vulnerable application's form for adding branches.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable application is the "Human Resource Information System" version 1.0, available from SourceCodester.
- The vulnerability was tested on PHP, Apache, and MySQL.
- The vulnerability was found by "LIU WEIYU".
- The provided exploit code shows a simple `alert(1)` payload as proof of concept.
-  A specific vulnerable file and parameter, along with a detailed request, have been identified.
