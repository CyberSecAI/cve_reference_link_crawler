- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization checks on REST API calls within the InstaWP Connect plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization leading to arbitrary option updates and administrative user creation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated attackers can connect the site to InstaWP API, edit arbitrary site options and create administrator accounts, potentially taking full control of the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through unauthenticated REST API calls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs no authentication and can be remote (network access).
