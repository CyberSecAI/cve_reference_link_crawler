- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress WP Reroute Email plugin versions 1.4.6 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force authenticated users to execute unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to perform actions they did not intend.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to craft a malicious request that targets a vulnerable action within the plugin, and then trick an authenticated user into triggering the request, typically via a link or embedded content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in user to click a crafted malicious link or interact with attacker-controlled content that executes the malicious request. The attacker does not need prior authentication to the WordPress site.
