Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `LibraryController` in Audiobookshelf lacked a proper role-based access control (RBAC) check in the `create` function. Specifically, it did not verify if the user making the request had admin privileges before allowing them to create a new library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Path Traversal / Arbitrary Directory Creation:**  The lack of admin check allows a non-admin user to create a library with a specified folder path.  Crucially, the application resolves relative paths using `Path.resolve()`, allowing a malicious user to provide a path anywhere in the file system.
- **Missing RBAC Check**: The primary vulnerability is the missing access control check in the `create` function, which allows non-admin users to perform actions intended only for administrators.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File System Write:**  A non-admin user can create directories anywhere on the server's filesystem where the application has write permissions. This could be abused to create files, potentially leading to denial of service, data corruption, or even code execution if improperly placed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network through the application's API.
- **API Endpoint:** The vulnerable endpoint is the `POST /api/libraries` endpoint used to create new libraries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileged User Account:**  The attacker needs a valid user account, but it does not require admin privileges.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application server.
- **API Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a request to the `/api/libraries` endpoint with a malicious folder path.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Versions:** Audiobookshelf versions 2.12.3 and earlier are affected.
- **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.13.0.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 5.4 (Moderate) with the vector string: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L`
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC demonstrates how to create a user with no permissions and then send a crafted POST request to create a new library with a path that is outside of the intended library directory.
- **Mitigation:** The fix involves adding an admin-level check to the `create` function, similar to checks in other controllers, which will prevent non-admin users from being able to make these types of requests.
