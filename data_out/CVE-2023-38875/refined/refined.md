- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `validator` parameter in `/reset-password` is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the web browser of a user.
- **Attack vectors**: By including a malicious payload into the `validator` parameter in `/reset-password`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the JavaScript payload and then trick a user into accessing it.
