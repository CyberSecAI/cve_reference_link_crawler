# Lack of size check and buffer overflow in RIOT /sys/net/application\_layer/cord/lc/cord\_lc.c

High

## Package

RIOT

## Affected versions

<= 2023.10

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

I spotted the lack of a size check that may lead to a buffer overflow in RIOT source code at:

<https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/sys/net/application_layer/cord/lc/cord_lc.c#L218>

### Details

The `_on_rd_init()` function does not implement a size check before copying data to the `_result_buf` static buffer. If an attacker can craft a long enough payload, they could cause a buffer overflow.

Please refer to the marked line below:

```
static void _on_rd_init(const gcoap_request_memo_t *memo, coap_pkt_t *pdu,
                       const sock_udp_ep_t *remote)
{
    (void)remote;

    thread_flags_t flag = FLAG_NORSC;

    if (memo->state == GCOAP_MEMO_RESP) {
        unsigned ct = coap_get_content_type(pdu);
        if (ct != COAP_FORMAT_LINK) {
            DEBUG("cord_lc: error payload not in link format: %u\n", ct);
            goto end;
        }
        if (pdu->payload_len == 0) {
            DEBUG("cord_lc: error empty payload\n");
            goto end;
        }
        memcpy(_result_buf, pdu->payload, pdu->payload_len); // VULN: lack of size check and potential buffer overflow
        _result_buf_len = pdu->payload_len;
        _result_buf[_result_buf_len] = '\0';
        flag = FLAG_SUCCESS;
    } else if (memo->state == GCOAP_MEMO_TIMEOUT) {
        flag = FLAG_TIMEOUT;
    }

end:
    if (flag != FLAG_SUCCESS) {
        _result_buf = NULL;
        _result_buf_len = 0;
    }
    thread_flags_set(_waiter, flag);
}
```

Note that the `_on_lookup()` function [in the same file](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/sys/net/application_layer/cord/lc/cord_lc.c#L105) does implement such an explicit size check:

```
static void _on_lookup(const gcoap_request_memo_t *memo, coap_pkt_t *pdu,
                       const sock_udp_ep_t *remote)
{
    (void)remote;

    thread_flags_t flag = FLAG_ERR;

    if (memo->state == GCOAP_MEMO_RESP) {
        unsigned ct = coap_get_content_type(pdu);
        if (ct != COAP_FORMAT_LINK) {
            DEBUG("cord_lc: unsupported content format: %u\n", ct);
            thread_flags_set(_waiter, flag);
        }
        if (pdu->payload_len == 0) {
            flag = FLAG_NORSC;
            thread_flags_set(_waiter, flag);
        }
        if (pdu->payload_len >= _result_buf_len) { // CHECK
            flag = FLAG_OVERFLOW;
            thread_flags_set(_waiter, flag);
        }
        memcpy(_result_buf, pdu->payload, pdu->payload_len);
        memset(_result_buf + pdu->payload_len, 0,
               _result_buf_len - pdu->payload_len);
        _result_buf_len = pdu->payload_len;
        flag = FLAG_SUCCESS;
    } else if (memo->state == GCOAP_MEMO_TIMEOUT) {
        flag = FLAG_TIMEOUT;
    }

    thread_flags_set(_waiter, flag);
}
```
### Impact

If the unchecked input above is attacker-controlled and crosses a security boundary, the impact of the buffer overflow vulnerability could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
