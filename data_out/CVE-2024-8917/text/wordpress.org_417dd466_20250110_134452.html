Funciona bien, pero cada vez que se actualiza el navegador web deja de funcionar hasta que liberen una nueva versión. En las estadisticas de partidos si pones 0 tarjetas amarillas en un partido, aunque el rival tenga 1 no sale en las estadísticas.

first of all your plugin in beautiful, but i would like to request an addition, i created a full league on my site, a functioning fake league because i like to fully test plugins before usage, but i was wondering if i could have users log in and predict results, or create a draft team and join leagues and compete with others based on the performance of my preset league created on sport press? like the English premier league and fantasy premier league like fan victor but without the API stress
