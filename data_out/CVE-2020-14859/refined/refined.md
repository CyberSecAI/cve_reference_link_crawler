{
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the handling of the T3 protocol within Oracle WebLogic Server. Specifically, crafted data within a T3 protocol message can trigger the deserialization of untrusted data.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Deserialization of untrusted data"
  ],
  "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the service account, potentially gaining full control of the affected server.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Network-based exploitation via the T3 protocol."
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability. They need to craft a malicious T3 protocol message. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network."
