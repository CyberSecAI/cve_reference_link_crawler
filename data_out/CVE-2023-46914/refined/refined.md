- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the "Booking Calendar" module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the `ics_export.php` script and other files have SQL calls that can be exploited via HTTP to perform SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection (CWE-89) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Obtain admin access.
    - Steal or remove data from the associated PrestaShop database.
    - Expose sensitive data like tokens by copying them to the front-end, thus unlocking admin's ajax scripts
    - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks via HTTP calls to vulnerable scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific user privileges are required. The attacker can be an unauthenticated guest user.  However, it is mentioned that this is a critical vulnerability if the module is not installed, or if a specific configuration (`BOOKINGCALENDAR_ics_export`) doesn't exist or is empty. In the common case that the configuration is set, the severity is reduced, but still exploitable by an attacker having the secret from the setting.

The provided content includes patch diffs for versions 2.7.9 and 2.5.6. It also provides additional recommendations, such as deleting the module, upgrading PrestaShop, changing database prefix, and activating OWASP rules on WAF. The timeline for the vulnerability discovery and advisory publication is also included.
