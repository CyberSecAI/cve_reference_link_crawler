- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The MultiParcels Shipping For WooCommerce plugin lacks proper authorization checks when deleting a shipment.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization leading to broken access control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Any authenticated user (even a subscriber) can delete arbitrary shipments.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a specific HTTP request to the `admin-post.php` endpoint with the `multiparcels_delete_shipping` action and a targeted shipment ID.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have an account on the affected WordPress site with at least a subscriber role.
