Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50767:

**CVE-2023-50767**

*   **Root Cause:** Missing permission checks in methods implementing form validation within the Nexus Platform Plugin.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin fails to verify if the user has the necessary permissions before executing form validation methods.
    *   **XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Attackers with Overall/Read permission can send an HTTP request to an attacker-specified URL and parse the response as XML.
    *   By exploiting the XXE vulnerability, attackers can potentially extract secrets from the Jenkins controller or perform server-side request forgery.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Sending a crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable endpoint.
    *   Crafting a malicious XML response that uses external entities.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Jenkins server.

**Additional Details:**
The advisory mentions that this vulnerability is related to a CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2023-50766), indicating that the vulnerable methods also do not require POST requests, leading to CSRF exposure.
