### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Nexus Platform Plugin allow XXE

**SECURITY-3204
/
CVE-2023-50766 (CSRF), CVE-2023-50767 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`nexus-jenkins-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/nexus-jenkins-plugin)**

**Description:**

Nexus Platform Plugin 3.18.0-03 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to send an HTTP request to an attacker-specified URL and parse the response as XML.

Additionally, the plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks, so attackers can have Jenkins parse a crafted XML response that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

Nexus Platform Plugin 3.18.1-01 configures its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

Additionally, POST requests and Overall/Administer permission are required for the affected HTTP endpoints.

|  | Nexus Platform Plugin is not currently distributed by the Jenkins Project due to licensing issues. The fixed version can be downloaded from the [Sonatype website](https://help.sonatype.com/iqserver/product-information/download-and-compatibility#DownloadandCompatibility-Jenkins). |

**Affected plugin:
[`nexus-jenkins-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/nexus-jenkins-plugin)**

**Description:**

Nexus Platform Plugin 3.18.0-03 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified HTTP server using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

Nexus Platform Plugin 3.18.1-01 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation methods.

|  | Nexus Platform Plugin is not currently distributed by the Jenkins Project due to licensing issues. The fixed version can be downloaded from the [Sonatype website](https://help.sonatype.com/iqserver/product-information/download-and-compatibility#DownloadandCompatibility-Jenkins). |
