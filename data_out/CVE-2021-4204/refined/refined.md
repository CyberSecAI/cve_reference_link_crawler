Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-4204:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **improper input validation** within the Linux kernel's eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) subsystem. Specifically, the `bpf_ringbuf_submit` and `bpf_ringbuf_discard` helper functions do not properly validate the size of memory being passed, which can lead to out-of-bounds memory access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access:** Due to the lack of proper size validation in the eBPF helper functions, an attacker can potentially access memory outside the intended bounds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker with the ability to execute low-privileged code can exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The OOB access can lead to system crashes.
*   **Information Leakage:** The vulnerability can also be exploited to leak internal kernel memory information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system.
*   **eBPF Programs:** The attacker crafts malicious eBPF programs to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Code Execution:** The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
*   **Special Privilege:**  As noted, unprivileged eBPF is often disabled by default, implying that the attacker might require some level of privilege to load/execute eBPF programs.

**Affected Versions:**

* Linux kernel versions 5.8 and later (specifically mentioned 5.8 - 5.16).
* Red Hat bugzilla indicates versions are unspecified

**Mitigations:**

*  Disable unprivileged eBPF by setting `kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled` to 1. Note that unprivileged eBPF is disabled by default in many distributions.
* Patch the kernel to address the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is related to how the eBPF verifier handles memory size checks for specific helper functions like  `bpf_ringbuf_submit` and `bpf_ringbuf_discard`.
*  Exploit code was released on January 18, 2022.
*  Patches have been released by multiple vendors, including Red Hat, Ubuntu, SUSE and NetApp.

This information is more detailed than the standard CVE description, which mainly focuses on the "Improper Input Validation" leading to "out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access".
