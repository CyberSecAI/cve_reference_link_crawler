# time-limited-regular-expressions

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/apostrophecms/time-limited-regular-expressions/tree/main.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/apostrophecms/time-limited-regular-expressions/tree/main)

## Why?

You want to let end users enter their own regular expressions. But regular expressions can lead to [catastrophic backtracking](https://medium.com/%40nitinpatel_20236/what-are-evil-regexes-7b21058c747e). This can take up hours of CPU time. In Node.js this means no other code can execute. It is a Denial of Service (DOS) attack vector, whether intentionally or by accident.

This module lets you test regular expressions with a time limit to mitigate the pain.

## Usage

```
//Â SetÂ aÂ 1-secondÂ limit.Â DefaultÂ isÂ 0.25Â secondsconstÂ regExpÂ =Â require('time-limited-regular-expressions')({Â limit:Â 1Â });Â //Â AÂ commonÂ emailÂ addressÂ validatorÂ withÂ potentiallyÂ evilÂ characteristics//Â (catastrophicÂ backtracking)constÂ evilÂ =Â /^([a-zA-Z0-9])(([\-.]|[_]+)?([a-zA-Z0-9]+))*(@){1}[a-z0-9]+[.]{1}(([a-z]{2,3})|([a-z]{2,3}[.]{1}[a-z]{2,3}))$/;Â (asyncÂ ()Â =>Â {Â Â //Â RunÂ aÂ potentiallyÂ slowÂ regularÂ expressionÂ onÂ short,Â matchingÂ inputÂ Â constÂ realEmailÂ =Â 'test@test.com';Â Â constÂ realEmailResultÂ =Â awaitÂ regExp.match(evil,Â realEmail);Â Â //Â NormalÂ behavior,Â mayÂ beÂ truthyÂ orÂ falsyÂ accordingÂ toÂ match,Â Â //Â returnsÂ theÂ sameÂ arrayÂ resultÂ asÂ regularÂ regexpÂ match()Â callsÂ Â console.log(realEmailResult);Â Â //Â ThisÂ inputÂ isÂ longÂ enoughÂ toÂ triggerÂ catastrophicÂ backtrackingÂ andÂ Â //Â couldÂ takeÂ hoursÂ toÂ evaluateÂ Â constÂ evilEmailÂ =Â 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA';Â Â tryÂ {Â Â Â Â constÂ evilEmailResultÂ =Â awaitÂ regExp.match(evil,Â evilEmail);Â Â Â Â //Â WeÂ willÂ notÂ getÂ here,Â exceptionÂ willÂ beÂ thrownÂ Â }Â catchÂ (e)Â {Â Â Â Â console.log(e.name);Â //Â WillÂ beÂ 'timeout'Â Â }})();
```
## Notes

"Why is `match` an async function?" It runs in a separate process because that is the only way to avoid starving the Node.js application and implement a portable timeout on the regular expression.

"How bad is the performance overhead?" Communication with a separate worker process makes it slower of course, but the process is reused by later calls, so the hit is not serious.

Flags, for instance the `g` flag, are supported.

You can pass the regular expression as a string, but regular expression literals (what you are used to typing) are easier to get right because you don't have to double-escape anything.

# [Don't Block the Event Loop (or the Worker Pool)](#dont-block-the-event-loop-or-the-worker-pool)

## [Should you read this guide?](#should-you-read-this-guide)

If you're writing anything more complicated than a brief command-line script, reading this should help you write higher-performance, more-secure applications.

This document is written with Node.js servers in mind, but the concepts apply to complex Node.js applications as well.
Where OS-specific details vary, this document is Linux-centric.

## [Summary](#summary)

Node.js runs JavaScript code in the Event Loop (initialization and callbacks), and offers a Worker Pool to handle expensive tasks like file I/O.
Node.js scales well, sometimes better than more heavyweight approaches like Apache.
The secret to the scalability of Node.js is that it uses a small number of threads to handle many clients.
If Node.js can make do with fewer threads, then it can spend more of your system's time and memory working on clients rather than on paying space and time overheads for threads (memory, context-switching).
But because Node.js has only a few threads, you must structure your application to use them wisely.

Here's a good rule of thumb for keeping your Node.js server speedy:
*Node.js is fast when the work associated with each client at any given time is "small"*.

This applies to callbacks on the Event Loop and tasks on the Worker Pool.

## [Why should I avoid blocking the Event Loop and the Worker Pool?](#why-should-i-avoid-blocking-the-event-loop-and-the-worker-pool)

Node.js uses a small number of threads to handle many clients.
In Node.js there are two types of threads: one Event Loop (aka the main loop, main thread, event thread, etc.), and a pool of `k` Workers in a Worker Pool (aka the threadpool).

If a thread is taking a long time to execute a callback (Event Loop) or a task (Worker), we call it "blocked".
While a thread is blocked working on behalf of one client, it cannot handle requests from any other clients.
This provides two motivations for blocking neither the Event Loop nor the Worker Pool:

1. Performance: If you regularly perform heavyweight activity on either type of thread, the *throughput* (requests/second) of your server will suffer.
2. Security: If it is possible that for certain input one of your threads might block, a malicious client could submit this "evil input", make your threads block, and keep them from working on other clients. This would be a [Denial of Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) attack.

## [A quick review of Node](#a-quick-review-of-node)

Node.js uses the Event-Driven Architecture: it has an Event Loop for orchestration and a Worker Pool for expensive tasks.

### [What code runs on the Event Loop?](#what-code-runs-on-the-event-loop)

When they begin, Node.js applications first complete an initialization phase, `require`'ing modules and registering callbacks for events.
Node.js applications then enter the Event Loop, responding to incoming client requests by executing the appropriate callback.
This callback executes synchronously, and may register asynchronous requests to continue processing after it completes.
The callbacks for these asynchronous requests will also be executed on the Event Loop.

The Event Loop will also fulfill the non-blocking asynchronous requests made by its callbacks, e.g., network I/O.

In summary, the Event Loop executes the JavaScript callbacks registered for events, and is also responsible for fulfilling non-blocking asynchronous requests like network I/O.

### [What code runs on the Worker Pool?](#what-code-runs-on-the-worker-pool)

The Worker Pool of Node.js is implemented in libuv ([docs](http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/threadpool.html)), which exposes a general task submission API.

Node.js uses the Worker Pool to handle "expensive" tasks.
This includes I/O for which an operating system does not provide a non-blocking version, as well as particularly CPU-intensive tasks.

These are the Node.js module APIs that make use of this Worker Pool:

1. I/O-intensive
   1. [DNS](https://nodejs.org/api/dns.html): `dns.lookup()`, `dns.lookupService()`.
   2. [File System](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_threadpool_usage): All file system APIs except `fs.FSWatcher()` and those that are explicitly synchronous use libuv's threadpool.
2. CPU-intensive
   1. [Crypto](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html): `crypto.pbkdf2()`, `crypto.scrypt()`, `crypto.randomBytes()`, `crypto.randomFill()`, `crypto.generateKeyPair()`.
   2. [Zlib](https://nodejs.org/api/zlib.html#zlib_threadpool_usage): All zlib APIs except those that are explicitly synchronous use libuv's threadpool.

In many Node.js applications, these APIs are the only sources of tasks for the Worker Pool. Applications and modules that use a [C++ add-on](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) can submit other tasks to the Worker Pool.

For the sake of completeness, we note that when you call one of these APIs from a callback on the Event Loop, the Event Loop pays some minor setup costs as it enters the Node.js C++ bindings for that API and submits a task to the Worker Pool.
These costs are negligible compared to the overall cost of the task, which is why the Event Loop is offloading it.
When submitting one of these tasks to the Worker Pool, Node.js provides a pointer to the corresponding C++ function in the Node.js C++ bindings.

### [How does Node.js decide what code to run next?](#how-does-nodejs-decide-what-code-to-run-next)

Abstractly, the Event Loop and the Worker Pool maintain queues for pending events and pending tasks, respectively.

In truth, the Event Loop does not actually maintain a queue.
Instead, it has a collection of file descriptors that it asks the operating system to monitor, using a mechanism like [epoll](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html) (Linux), [kqueue](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/FSEvents_ProgGuide/KernelQueues/KernelQueues.html) (OSX), event ports (Solaris), or [IOCP](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365198.aspx) (Windows).
These file descriptors correspond to network sockets, any files it is watching, and so on.
When the operating system says that one of these file descriptors is ready, the Event Loop translates it to the appropriate event and invokes the callback(s) associated with that event.
You can learn more about this process [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9csgxBgaZ8).

In contrast, the Worker Pool uses a real queue whose entries are tasks to be processed.
A Worker pops a task from this queue and works on it, and when finished the Worker raises an "At least one task is finished" event for the Event Loop.

### [What does this mean for application design?](#what-does-this-mean-for-application-design)

In a one-thread-per-client system like Apache, each pending client is assigned its own thread.
If a thread handling one client blocks, the operating system will interrupt it and give another client a turn.
The operating system thus ensures that clients that require a small amount of work are not penalized by clients that require more work.

Because Node.js handles many clients with few threads, if a thread blocks handling one client's request, then pending client requests may not get a turn until the thread finishes its callback or task.
*The fair treatment of clients is thus the responsibility of your application*.
This means that you shouldn't do too much work for any client in any single callback or task.

This is part of why Node.js can scale well, but it also means that you are responsible for ensuring fair scheduling.
The next sections talk about how to ensure fair scheduling for the Event Loop and for the Worker Pool.

## [Don't block the Event Loop](#dont-block-the-event-loop)

The Event Loop notices each new client connection and orchestrates the generation of a response.
All incoming requests and outgoing responses pass through the Event Loop.
This means that if the Event Loop spends too long at any point, all current and new clients will not get a turn.

You should make sure you never block the Event Loop.
In other words, each of your JavaScript callbacks should complete quickly.
This of course also applies to your `await`'s, your `Promise.then`'s, and so on.

A good way to ensure this is to reason about the ["computational complexity"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity) of your callbacks.
If your callback takes a constant number of steps no matter what its arguments are, then you'll always give every pending client a fair turn.
If your callback takes a different number of steps depending on its arguments, then you should think about how long the arguments might be.

Example 1: A constant-time callback.

```
app.get('/constant-time', (req, res) => {
  res.sendStatus(200);
});

```
JavaScriptCopy to clipboard

Example 2: An `O(n)` callback. This callback will run quickly for small `n` and more slowly for large `n`.

```
app.get('/countToN', (req, res) => {
  let n = req.query.n;

  // n iterations before giving someone else a turn
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    console.log(`Iter ${i}`);
  }

  res.sendStatus(200);
});

```
JavaScriptCopy to clipboard

Example 3: An `O(n^2)` callback. This callback will still run quickly for small `n`, but for large `n` it will run much more slowly than the previous `O(n)` example.

```
app.get('/countToN2', (req, res) => {
  let n = req.query.n;

  // n^2 iterations before giving someone else a turn
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      console.log(`Iter ${i}.${j}`);
    }
  }

  res.sendStatus(200);
});

```

### [How careful should you be?](#how-careful-should-you-be)

Node.js uses the Google V8 engine for JavaScript, which is quite fast for many common operations.
Exceptions to this rule are regexps and JSON operations, discussed below.

However, for complex tasks you should consider bounding the input and rejecting inputs that are too long.
That way, even if your callback has large complexity, by bounding the input you ensure the callback cannot take more than the worst-case time on the longest acceptable input.
You can then evaluate the worst-case cost of this callback and determine whether its running time is acceptable in your context.

### [Blocking the Event Loop: REDOS](#blocking-the-event-loop-redos)

One common way to block the Event Loop disastrously is by using a "vulnerable" [regular expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions).

#### [Avoiding vulnerable regular expressions](#avoiding-vulnerable-regular-expressions)

A regular expression (regexp) matches an input string against a pattern.
We usually think of a regexp match as requiring a single pass through the input string --- `O(n)` time where `n` is the length of the input string.
In many cases, a single pass is indeed all it takes.
Unfortunately, in some cases the regexp match might require an exponential number of trips through the input string --- `O(2^n)` time.
An exponential number of trips means that if the engine requires `x` trips to determine a match, it will need `2*x` trips if we add only one more character to the input string.
Since the number of trips is linearly related to the time required, the effect of this evaluation will be to block the Event Loop.

A *vulnerable regular expression* is one on which your regular expression engine might take exponential time, exposing you to [REDOS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) on "evil input".
Whether or not your regular expression pattern is vulnerable (i.e. the regexp engine might take exponential time on it) is actually a difficult question to answer, and varies depending on whether you're using Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, JavaScript, etc., but here are some rules of thumb that apply across all of these languages:

1. Avoid nested quantifiers like `(a+)*`. V8's regexp engine can handle some of these quickly, but others are vulnerable.
2. Avoid OR's with overlapping clauses, like `(a|a)*`. Again, these are sometimes-fast.
3. Avoid using backreferences, like `(a.*) \1`. No regexp engine can guarantee evaluating these in linear time.
4. If you're doing a simple string match, use `indexOf` or the local equivalent. It will be cheaper and will never take more than `O(n)`.

If you aren't sure whether your regular expression is vulnerable, remember that Node.js generally doesn't have trouble reporting a *match* even for a vulnerable regexp and a long input string.
The exponential behavior is triggered when there is a mismatch but Node.js can't be certain until it tries many paths through the input string.

#### [A REDOS example](#a-redos-example)

Here is an example vulnerable regexp exposing its server to REDOS:

```
app.get('/redos-me', (req, res) => {
  let filePath = req.query.filePath;

  // REDOS
  if (filePath.match(/(\/.+)+$/)) {
    console.log('valid path');
  } else {
    console.log('invalid path');
  }

  res.sendStatus(200);
});

```
JavaScriptCopy to clipboard

The vulnerable regexp in this example is a (bad!) way to check for a valid path on Linux.
It matches strings that are a sequence of "/"-delimited names, like "/a/b/c".
It is dangerous because it violates rule 1: it has a doubly-nested quantifier.

If a client queries with filePath `///.../\n` (100 /'s followed by a newline character that the regexp's "." won't match), then the Event Loop will take effectively forever, blocking the Event Loop.
This client's REDOS attack causes all other clients not to get a turn until the regexp match finishes.

For this reason, you should be leery of using complex regular expressions to validate user input.

#### [Anti-REDOS Resources](#anti-redos-resources)

There are some tools to check your regexps for safety, like

* [safe-regex](https://github.com/davisjam/safe-regex)
* [rxxr2](https://github.com/superhuman/rxxr2).

However, neither of these will catch all vulnerable regexps.

Another approach is to use a different regexp engine.
You could use the [node-re2](https://github.com/uhop/node-re2) module, which uses Google's blazing-fast [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2) regexp engine.
But be warned, RE2 is not 100% compatible with V8's regexps, so check for regressions if you swap in the node-re2 module to handle your regexps.
And particularly complicated regexps are not supported by node-re2.

If you're trying to match something "obvious", like a URL or a file path, find an example in a [regexp library](http://www.regexlib.com) or use an npm module, e.g. [ip-regex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ip-regex).

### [Blocking the Event Loop: Node.js core modules](#blocking-the-event-loop-nodejs-core-modules)

Several Node.js core modules have synchronous expensive APIs, including:

* [Encryption](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html)
* [Compression](https://nodejs.org/api/zlib.html)
* [File system](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)
* [Child process](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html)

These APIs are expensive, because they involve significant computation (encryption, compression), require I/O (file I/O), or potentially both (child process). These APIs are intended for scripting convenience, but are not intended for use in the server context. If you execute them on the Event Loop, they will take far longer to complete than a typical JavaScript instruction, blocking the Event Loop.

In a server, *you should not use the following synchronous APIs from these modules*:

* Encryption:
  + `crypto.randomBytes` (synchronous version)
  + `crypto.randomFillSync`
  + `crypto.pbkdf2Sync`
  + You should also be careful about providing large input to the encryption and decryption routines.
* Compression:
  + `zlib.inflateSync`
  + `zlib.deflateSync`
* File system:
  + Do not use the synchronous file system APIs. For example, if the file you access is in a [distributed file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustered_file_system#Distributed_file_systems) like [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System), access times can vary widely.
* Child process:
  + `child_process.spawnSync`
  + `child_process.execSync`
  + `child_process.execFileSync`

This list is reasonably complete as of Node.js v9.

### [Blocking the Event Loop: JSON DOS](#blocking-the-event-loop-json-dos)

`JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify` are other potentially expensive operations.
While these are `O(n)` in the length of the input, for large `n` they can take surprisingly long.

If your server manipulates JSON objects, particularly those from a client, you should be cautious about the size of the objects or strings you work with on the Event Loop.

Example: JSON blocking. We create an object `obj` of size 2^21 and `JSON.stringify` it, run `indexOf` on the string, and then JSON.parse it. The `JSON.stringify`'d string is 50MB. It takes 0.7 seconds to stringify the object, 0.03 seconds to indexOf on the 50MB string, and 1.3 seconds to parse the string.

```
let obj = { a: 1 };
let niter = 20;

let before, str, pos, res, took;

for (let i = 0; i < niter; i++) {
  obj = { obj1: obj, obj2: obj }; // Doubles in size each iter
}

before = process.hrtime();
str = JSON.stringify(obj);
took = process.hrtime(before);
console.log('JSON.stringify took ' + took);

before = process.hrtime();
pos = str.indexOf('nomatch');
took = process.hrtime(before);
console.log('Pure indexof took ' + took);

before = process.hrtime();
res = JSON.parse(str);
took = process.hrtime(before);
console.log('JSON.parse took ' + took);

```

There are npm modules that offer asynchronous JSON APIs. See for example:

* [JSONStream](https://www.npmjs.com/package/JSONStream), which has stream APIs.
* [Big-Friendly JSON](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bfj), which has stream APIs as well as asynchronous versions of the standard JSON APIs using the partitioning-on-the-Event-Loop paradigm outlined below.

### [Complex calculations without blocking the Event Loop](#complex-calculations-without-blocking-the-event-loop)

Suppose you want to do complex calculations in JavaScript without blocking the Event Loop.
You have two options: partitioning or offloading.

#### [Partitioning](#partitioning)

You could *partition* your calculations so that each runs on the Event Loop but regularly yields (gives turns to) other pending events.
In JavaScript it's easy to save the state of an ongoing task in a closure, as shown in example 2 below.

For a simple example, suppose you want to compute the average of the numbers `1` to `n`.

Example 1: Un-partitioned average, costs `O(n)`

```
for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) sum += i;
let avg = sum / n;
console.log('avg: ' + avg);

```
JavaScriptCopy to clipboard

Example 2: Partitioned average, each of the `n` asynchronous steps costs `O(1)`.

```
function asyncAvg(n, avgCB) {
  // Save ongoing sum in JS closure.
  let sum = 0;
  function help(i, cb) {
    sum += i;
    if (i == n) {
      cb(sum);
      return;
    }

    // "Asynchronous recursion".
    // Schedule next operation asynchronously.
    setImmediate(help.bind(null, i + 1, cb));
  }

  // Start the helper, with CB to call avgCB.
  help(1, function (sum) {
    let avg = sum / n;
    avgCB(avg);
  });
}

asyncAvg(n, function (avg) {
  console.log('avg of 1-n: ' + avg);
});

```
JavaScriptCopy to clipboard

You can apply this principle to array iterations and so forth.

#### [Offloading](#offloading)

If you need to do something more complex, partitioning is not a good option.
This is because partitioning uses only the Event Loop, and you won't benefit from multiple cores almost certainly available on your machine.
*Remember, the Event Loop should orchestrate client requests, not fulfill them itself.*
For a complicated task, move the work off of the Event Loop onto a Worker Pool.

##### [How to offload](#how-to-offload)

You have two options for a destination Worker Pool to which to offload work.

1. You can use the built-in Node.js Worker Pool by developing a [C++ addon](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html). On older versions of Node, build your C++ addon using [NAN](https://github.com/nodejs/nan), and on newer versions use [N-API](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html). [node-webworker-threads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webworker-threads) offers a JavaScript-only way to access the Node.js Worker Pool.
2. You can create and manage your own Worker Pool dedicated to computation rather than the Node.js I/O-themed Worker Pool. The most straightforward ways to do this is using [Child Process](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html) or [Cluster](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html).

You should *not* simply create a [Child Process](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html) for every client.
You can receive client requests more quickly than you can create and manage children, and your server might become a [fork bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb).

##### [Downside of offloading](#downside-of-offloading)

The downside of the offloading approach is that it incurs overhead in the form of *communication costs*.
Only the Event Loop is allowed to see the "namespace" (JavaScript state) of your application.
From a Worker, you cannot manipulate a JavaScript object in the Event Loop's namespace.
Instead, you have to serialize and deserialize any objects you wish to share.
Then the Worker can operate on its own copy of these object(s) and return the modified object (or a "patch") to the Event Loop.

For serialization concerns, see the section on JSON DOS.

##### [Some suggestions for offloading](#some-suggestions-for-offloading)

You may wish to distinguish between CPU-intensive and I/O-intensive tasks because they have markedly different characteristics.

A CPU-intensive task only makes progress when its Worker is scheduled, and the Worker must be scheduled onto one of your machine's [logical cores](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_cpus).
If you have 4 logical cores and 5 Workers, one of these Workers cannot make progress.
As a result, you are paying overhead (memory and scheduling costs) for this Worker and getting no return for it.

I/O-intensive tasks involve querying an external service provider (DNS, file system, etc.) and waiting for its response.
While a Worker with an I/O-intensive task is waiting for its response, it has nothing else to do and can be de-scheduled by the operating system, giving another Worker a chance to submit their request.
Thus, *I/O-intensive tasks will be making progress even while the associated thread is not running*.
External service providers like databases and file systems have been highly optimized to handle many pending requests concurrently.
For example, a file system will examine a large set of pending write and read requests to merge conflicting updates and to retrieve files in an optimal order.

If you rely on only one Worker Pool, e.g. the Node.js Worker Pool, then the differing characteristics of CPU-bound and I/O-bound work may harm your application's performance.

For this reason, you might wish to maintain a separate Computation Worker Pool.

#### [Offloading: conclusions](#offloading-conclusions)

For simple tasks, like iterating over the elements of an arbitrarily long array, partitioning might be a good option.
If your computation is more complex, offloading is a better approach: the communication costs, i.e. the overhead of passing serialized objects between the Event Loop and the Worker Pool, are offset by the benefit of using multiple cores.

However, if your server relies heavily on complex calculations, you should think about whether Node.js is really a good fit. Node.js excels for I/O-bound work, but for expensive computation it might not be the best option.

If you take the offloading approach, see the section on not blocking the Worker Pool.

## [Don't block the Worker Pool](#dont-block-the-worker-pool)

Node.js has a Worker Pool composed of `k` Workers.
If you are using the Offloading paradigm discussed above, you might have a separate Computational Worker Pool, to which the same principles apply.
In either case, let us assume that `k` is much smaller than the number of clients you might be handling concurrently.
This is in keeping with the "one thread for many clients" philosophy of Node.js, the secret to its scalability.

As discussed above, each Worker completes its current Task before proceeding to the next one on the Worker Pool queue.

Now, there will be variation in the cost of the Tasks required to handle your clients' requests.
Some Tasks can be completed quickly (e.g. reading short or cached files, or producing a small number of random bytes), and others will take longer (e.g reading larger or uncached files, or generating more random bytes).
Your goal should be to *minimize the variation in Task times*, and you should use *Task partitioning* to accomplish this.

### [Minimizing the variation in Task times](#minimizing-the-variation-in-task-times)

If a Worker's current Task is much more expensive than other Tasks, then it will be unavailable to work on other pending Tasks.
In other words, *each relatively long Task effectively decreases the size of the Worker Pool by one until it is completed*.
This is undesirable because, up to a point, the more Workers in the Worker Pool, the greater the Worker Pool throughput (tasks/second) and thus the greater the server throughput (client requests/second).
One client with a relatively expensive Task will decrease the throughput of the Worker Pool, in turn decreasing the throughput of the server.

To avoid this, you should try to minimize variation in the length of Tasks you submit to the Worker Pool.
While it is appropriate to treat the external systems accessed by your I/O requests (DB, FS, etc.) as black boxes, you should be aware of the relative cost of these I/O requests, and should avoid submitting requests you can expect to be particularly long.

Two examples should illustrate the possible variation in task times.

#### [Variation example: Long-running file system reads](#variation-example-long-running-file-system-reads)

Suppose your server must read files in order to handle some client requests.
After consulting the Node.js [File system](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) APIs, you opted to use `fs.readFile()` for simplicity.
However, `fs.readFile()` is ([currently](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/17054)) not partitioned: it submits a single `fs.read()` Task spanning the entire file.
If you read shorter files for some users and longer files for others, `fs.readFile()` may introduce significant variation in Task lengths, to the detriment of Worker Pool throughput.

For a worst-case scenario, suppose an attacker can convince your server to read an *arbitrary* file (this is a [directory traversal vulnerability](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Path_Traversal)).
If your server is running Linux, the attacker can name an extremely slow file: [`/dev/random`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/random.4.html).
For all practical purposes, `/dev/random` is infinitely slow, and every Worker asked to read from `/dev/random` will never finish that Task.
An attacker then submits `k` requests, one for each Worker, and no other client requests that use the Worker Pool will make progress.

#### [Variation example: Long-running crypto operations](#variation-example-long-running-crypto-operations)

Suppose your server generates cryptographically secure random bytes using [`crypto.randomBytes()`](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_randombytes_size_callback).
`crypto.randomBytes()` is not partitioned: it creates a single `randomBytes()` Task to generate as many bytes as you requested.
If you create fewer bytes for some users and more bytes for others, `crypto.randomBytes()` is another source of variation in Task lengths.

### [Task partitioning](#task-partitioning)

Tasks with variable time costs can harm the throughput of the Worker Pool.
To minimize variation in Task times, as far as possible you should *partition* each Task into comparable-cost sub-Tasks.
When each sub-Task completes it should submit the next sub-Task, and when the final sub-Task completes it should notify the submitter.

To continue the `fs.readFile()` example, you should instead use `fs.read()` (manual partitioning) or `ReadStream` (automatically partitioned).

The same principle applies to CPU-bound tasks; the `asyncAvg` example might be inappropriate for the Event Loop, but it is well suited to the Worker Pool.

When you partition a Task into sub-Tasks, shorter Tasks expand into a small number of sub-Tasks, and longer Tasks expand into a larger number of sub-Tasks.
Between each sub-Task of a longer Task, the Worker to which it was assigned can work on a sub-Task from another, shorter, Task, thus improving the overall Task throughput of the Worker Pool.

Note that the number of sub-Tasks completed is not a useful metric for the throughput of the Worker Pool.
Instead, concern yourself with the number of *Tasks* completed.

### [Avoiding Task partitioning](#avoiding-task-partitioning)

Recall that the purpose of Task partitioning is to minimize the variation in Task times.
If you can distinguish between shorter Tasks and longer Tasks (e.g. summing an array vs. sorting an array), you could create one Worker Pool for each class of Task.
Routing shorter Tasks and longer Tasks to separate Worker Pools is another way to minimize Task time variation.

In favor of this approach, partitioning Tasks incurs overhead (the costs of creating a Worker Pool Task representation and of manipulating the Worker Pool queue), and avoiding partitioning saves you the costs of additional trips to the Worker Pool.
It also keeps you from making mistakes in partitioning your Tasks.

The downside of this approach is that Workers in all of these Worker Pools will incur space and time overheads and will compete with each other for CPU time.
Remember that each CPU-bound Task makes progress only while it is scheduled.
As a result, you should only consider this approach after careful analysis.

### [Worker Pool: conclusions](#worker-pool-conclusions)

Whether you use only the Node.js Worker Pool or maintain separate Worker Pool(s), you should optimize the Task throughput of your Pool(s).

To do this, minimize the variation in Task times by using Task partitioning.

## [The risks of npm modules](#the-risks-of-npm-modules)

While the Node.js core modules offer building blocks for a wide variety of applications, sometimes something more is needed. Node.js developers benefit tremendously from the [npm ecosystem](https://www.npmjs.com/), with hundreds of thousands of modules offering functionality to accelerate your development process.

Remember, however, that the majority of these modules are written by third-party developers and are generally released with only best-effort guarantees. A developer using an npm module should be concerned about two things, though the latter is frequently forgotten.

1. Does it honor its APIs?
2. Might its APIs block the Event Loop or a Worker?
   Many modules make no effort to indicate the cost of their APIs, to the detriment of the community.

For simple APIs you can estimate the cost of the APIs; the cost of string manipulation isn't hard to fathom.
But in many cases it's unclear how much an API might cost.

*If you are calling an API that might do something expensive, double-check the cost. Ask the developers to document it, or examine the source code yourself (and submit a PR documenting the cost).*

Remember, even if the API is asynchronous, you don't know how much time it might spend on a Worker or on the Event Loop in each of its partitions.
For example, suppose in the `asyncAvg` example given above, each call to the helper function summed *half* of the numbers rather than one of them.
Then this function would still be asynchronous, but the cost of each partition would be `O(n)`, not `O(1)`, making it much less safe to use for arbitrary values of `n`.

## [Conclusion](#conclusion)

Node.js has two types of threads: one Event Loop and `k` Workers.
The Event Loop is responsible for JavaScript callbacks and non-blocking I/O, and a Worker executes tasks corresponding to C++ code that completes an asynchronous request, including blocking I/O and CPU-intensive work.
Both types of threads work on no more than one activity at a time.
If any callback or task takes a long time, the thread running it becomes *blocked*.
If your application makes blocking callbacks or tasks, this can lead to degraded throughput (clients/second) at best, and complete denial of service at worst.

To write a high-throughput, more DoS-proof web server, you must ensure that on benign and on malicious input, neither your Event Loop nor your Workers will block.

| Hi, I'm not using loader-utils directly in my package.json, but may be it has transitive dependency, and currently I'm using react-script v5, but now I'm getting Security Vulnerabilities issue as  A Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) flaw was found in Function interpolateName in interpolateName.js in webpack loader-utils 2.0.0 via the resourcePath variable in interpolateName.js  and also I ran npm ls loader-utils, so the result is:  `-- react-scripts@5.0.1 +-- @pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin@0.5.8 |` -- loader-utils@2.0.2 +-- @svgr/webpack@5.5.0 | `-- loader-utils@2.0.2 deduped +-- babel-loader@8.2.5 |` -- loader-utils@2.0.2 deduped +-- file-loader@6.2.0 | `-- loader-utils@2.0.2 deduped +-- react-dev-utils@12.0.1 |` -- loader-utils@3.2.0 `-- resolve-url-loader@4.0.0 +-- adjust-sourcemap-loader@4.0.0 |` -- loader-utils@2.0.2 deduped `-- loader-utils@2.0.2 deduped  could you please give me the suggestion how to fix this.  Thanks Sowjanya |

| So if somebody have an example of this exploit - PR welcome or write me on `sheo13666q @ gmail.com`, I am glad to fix it, but can't find a way how it is possible to use reproduce (that is why I think there is a problem with security tools) |

| Hello, left comments on other Issues, this Issue Looks Open, so here is the information for fixing both of the vulnerabilities shown in the OSS index: The Vulnerabiliies:  * [[CVE-2022-37603](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3rfm-jhwj-7488 "CVE-2022-37603")] A Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) flaw was found in Function interpolateName in interpolateName.js in webpack loader-utils 2.0.0 via the url variable in interpolateName.js.    + Description: A Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) flaw was found in Function interpolateName in interpolateName.js in webpack loader-utils 2.0.0 via the url variable in interpolateName.js. * [[CVE-2022-37599](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hhq3-ff78-jv3g "CVE-2022-37599")] CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')    + Description: A Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) flaw was found in Function interpolateName in interpolateName.js in webpack loader-utils 2.0.0 via the resourcePath variable in interpolateName.js.  The Problem  * The main issues around Regex DOS attacks is in badly formed queries that are not strict enough, and no exit condition involving a time limit for processing. If you ensure that the query is perfectly formed or at least add an exit condition based on a time limit (a few seconds) then this should resolve the issue. More information here: <https://www.regular-expressions.info/redos.html#Handling%20Regexes%20Provided%20by%20The%20User>. I believe this is still a legitimate vulnerability in v 3.x as well  The Fix  * multiple options listed under the CWE listing (<https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html>, under Potential Mitigations section) * update the regex to remove vulnerabilities * add a timeout wrapper to prevent a malicious regex string from causing failures, dos, or resource overloads   ex of fix:   * timeout wrapper   + <https://www.npmjs.com/package/time-limited-regular-expressions>     - source code: <https://github.com/apostrophecms/time-limited-regular-expressions/blob/main/index.js>   + <https://www.josephkirwin.com/2016/03/12/nodejs_redos_mitigation/>   + (node.js documentation) <https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/dont-block-the-event-loop/> * updated regex (mocha npm package update to remove same finding)   + Code Change: <https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/pull/4770/files>   + unit test: <https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/pull/4917/files> * escape string wrapper   + <https://rules.sonarsource.com/javascript/tag/cwe/RSPEC-2631>   I believe this would mitigate the findings |

| Have you evaluated this line as the possible culprit?   [loader-utils/lib/interpolateName.js](https://github.com/webpack/loader-utils/blob/52cd134fc94721f62c9c882651aad24f33e6d6a8/lib/interpolateName.js#L79)  Line 79 in [52cd134](/webpack/loader-utils/commit/52cd134fc94721f62c9c882651aad24f33e6d6a8)   |  | /\[(?:([^:\]]+):)?(?:hash|contenthash)(?::([a-z]+\d\*))?(?::(\d+))?\]/gi, | | --- | --- |      I ran the Regex on that line through an [online ReDoS checker](https://devina.io/redos-checker) and it came out vulnerable.  I believe this can be fixed by changing the Regex to `/\[(?:([^\[:\]]+):)?(?:hash|contenthash)(?::([a-z]+\d*))?(?::(\d+))?\]/gi`  The interpolateName.js tests pass with this change, but I don't know enough about what this section of your code is doing to be sure it wouldn't create any problems. If this seems like it will fix the ReDoS issue without breaking anything I can submit pull requests for the three versions. Our projects need versions 2.x and 1.x (loader-utils is a transitive dependency in multiple packages). |

| Sorry for not getting back sooner and thank you for getting to this so quickly. So, if I understand this correctly, here is some information:   * The [CVE-2022-37603](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3rfm-jhwj-7488 "CVE-2022-37603") finding has been resolved in version 3.2.1 (backported fixes available for versions 2.0.4 and 1.4.2 THANK YOU FOR THOSE!!!!)   + OSSIndex shows the resultant fix: (old version 3.2.0 shows vulnerability): [https://ossindex.sonatype.org/component/pkg:npm/loader-utils@3.2.0](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/component/pkg%3Anpm/loader-utils%403.2.0), (new version 3.2.1 no longer has that vulnerability): [https://ossindex.sonatype.org/component/pkg:npm/loader-utils@3.2.1](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/component/pkg%3Anpm/loader-utils%403.2.1)   + Owasp Dependency Checker Shows this as no longer an issues as well.   + Reporting Agencies that show vulnerability still exists: ( it may help to open and resolve [[CVE-2022-37603]/ReDoS found in interpolateName.js #213](https://github.com/webpack/loader-utils/issues/213) to show merged or some status that would satisfy the auto bot that opened it as that issue is watched by NVD it appears? not sure on that, but may help?)     - Snyk: <https://security.snyk.io/package/npm/loader-utils>     - NVD: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37603>     - CVE: <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37603>   + This issue should no longer be showing as a problem for the versions listed above. To help expedite this, I have sent requests via tickets to NVD/NIST, CVE, and Snyk to update the configuration strings/reports/etc to show the version that has the fix and stop reporting false positives (I will update here once I get responses from those entities). That may take time (and depending on what software you are using to run scans, you may still see this is an issue). In the meantime. The content provided here should be enough to verify that the issue is a false positive if you are on the correct version.   There is still an issue for <https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2022-37599?component-type=npm&component-name=loader-utils> that will need to be addressed though.  Hopefully this helps and I will look at getting a PR for [CVE-2022-37599](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hhq3-ff78-jv3g "CVE-2022-37599") asap, but may be awhile until I have the free time needed. |

| so I believe changing line 83  from this: `directory = resourcePath.replace(/\\/g, '/').replace(/\.\.(\/)?/g, '_$1');`  to this: `directory = resourcePath.replaceAll(/\\/g, '/').replaceAll(/\.\.(\/)?/g, '_$1');`  should fix the issue: Ex of difference between replace and replace all and how the call to the Regex constructor behind the scenes on replace can be dangerous: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replaceAll#description>  I am not positive that this will resolve the issue, but it should allow for a safer open ended regex run against an unknown string with the built in processing of replaceAll at least. If not, I would look at adding a timer wrapper around the evaluation to fail if it takes longer than x seconds as a catch all.

| to update the thread, on PR [#227](https://github.com/webpack/loader-utils/pull/227), the PR has been closed given the following information:  from looking at the various tickets, issues, and vulnerabilities, there are 3 vulnerabilities that have been discussed:   * [[CVE-2022-37601](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-76p3-8jx3-jpfq "CVE-2022-37601")] - an older critical issue that was addressed in 2.0.3 and backported to 1.4.1 as well (addressed directly by [fix: Resolve potential prototype polution exploit #217](https://github.com/webpack/loader-utils/pull/217)) * [[CVE-2022-37603](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3rfm-jhwj-7488 "CVE-2022-37603")] - a more recent high finding that was just addressed in 3.2.1 and backported to 2.0.4 and 1.4.2 (quoted as a problem against the url variable in this file) (addressed directly by [fix: ReDoS problem #224](https://github.com/webpack/loader-utils/pull/224))   lastly   * [[CVE-2022-37599](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hhq3-ff78-jv3g "CVE-2022-37599")] - a more recent high finding that has not yet been addressed in some systems (quoted as a problem against the resourcePath variable in this file) (no direct fix provided).   I did not see an issue with the current code either as there are no wildcard characters that are exploitable and this regex itself is simple and has no known redos issues currently either (in reference to line 83 as defined in the finding). But given that as of the day I posted this PR, OSSIndex still showed this as a valid finding, as was Snyk, NVD, etc. and as of yesterday at 11:22am cst, multiple security scans were still showing this as a finding as well.  Given that, there is a difference behind the scenes for replace vs. replace all, that I was hoping this would address, and would address the remaining open finding from the various security agencies that were still reporting this as an active issue.  But as of now, the scans we are running show this package as compliant and the finding appears to be considered addressed by OSS (not the other agencies yet). I already do have tickets open to Snyk, NVD and Mitre for the CVE to update these to show the issues as fixed, and have added this CVE to those tickets, not just the [CVE-2022-37603](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3rfm-jhwj-7488 "CVE-2022-37603") issue.  Given all of that, as of now, this PR does not seem to be needed and there does not appear to be an issue with the code, as the parts replaceAll targets as issues for replace are not being used here.  It may take time for the various security tools to update and not show these findings as valid, (and correct me if I am wrong [@alexander-akait](https://github.com/alexander-akait) ), but as long as you are on the latest versions(1.4.2, 2.0.4, 3.2.1), you should be able to site this issue as verification that these are false positives. Thank you loader-utils team for addressing this so quickly! my team appreciates it a lot! |

| <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37599> has now been updated as well.  With these updates, Sonatype's OSS INDEX, NIST's NVD, NPM Github Advisory, and Snyk's Reports have all been updated and all known vulnerabilities have been handled and backported for all major versions. I think this issue should be good to consider closed. I still have pending CVEs to be updated, but those normally take awhile.  For anyone tracking this issue that still is showing vulnerabilities in their scans, please give it another 24 hours for the agencies to push to feeds, and other agencies to update from those feeds to rerun your scans, after that, you should no longer see these issues as long as you are on the correct versions.  Thank you again to the loader-utils team and please let me know if I can be of any help in future. |

| Please migrate to 3 version, 2 version is deprecated and doesn't supported, thank you  From what I can see `loader.getOptions()` was removed in version `3` and the loader `this. getOptions()` was introduced `webpack@5` meaning there is no solution here for `webpack@4` and earlier.  I accept that updating to version `3` is not much of an ask but updating older projects to `webpack@5` is a stretch. Is there some other workaround? |

| This issue is linked in an npm advisory for version 3.2.0 of this library. This occurs on a clean new angular project.  ``` # npm audit report  loader-utils  ≤ 3.2.0 A Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) flaw was found in Function interpolateName in interpolateName.js in webpack loader-utils 2.0.0 via the resourcePath variable in interpolateName.js. - https://github.com/webpack/loader-utils/blob/d9f4e23cf411d8556f8bac2d3bf05a6e0103b568/lib/interpolateName.js#L38,https://github.com/webpack/loader-utils/blob/d9f4e23cf411d8556f8bac2d3bf05a6e0103b568/lib/interpolateName.js#L83,https://github.com/webpack/loader-utils/issues/211 fix available via `npm audit fix --force` Will install @angular-devkit/build-angular@13.0.4, which is a breaking change node_modules/loader-utils   @angular-devkit/build-angular  >=13.1.0-next.0   Depends on vulnerable versions of loader-utils   node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular  ```  I'm a bit confused - this issue here is closed and only talks about version 2. Is version 3.2.0 affected, too? Will there be a fix for it? Or is the advisory wrong?  **Edit:** I see this has been reported already in [#214 (comment)](https://github.com/webpack/loader-utils/issues/214#issuecomment-1277642122). It's probably an npm bug where npm gets confused about the dependency path. There's been tons of these issues around npm since version 8... (or the advisory for this package actually states that it affects 3.2.0. It states <= 3.2.0, is that a typo and should have been < 3.2.0?) |

| The main issues around Regex DOS attacks is in badly formed queries that are not strict enough, and no exit condition involving a time limit for processing. If you ensure that the query is perfectly formed or at least add an exit condition based on a time limit (a few seconds) then this should resolve the issue. More information here: <https://www.regular-expressions.info/redos.html#Handling%20Regexes%20Provided%20by%20The%20User>. I will drop this information on the other threads as I believe this is still a legitimate vulnerability in v 3.x as well |

## Mitigating Catastrophic Backtracking in Node.js RegExp

Recently I’ve been learning a bit about Node.js

The issue of [catastrophic backtracking](http://www.rexegg.com/regex-explosive-quantifiers.html) is a plague on regex, and can be a pain to test as it can only happen with certain input that may not be covered during testing.

Libraries like [node-rsa](https://github.com/rzcoder/node-rsa/issues/30) on npm have had issues where a catastrophic backtrack can cause a full denial of service (DOS) of the node process. My angle of interest is from the information security side, where a malicious adversary may craft a payload such as this with the intent to actually DOS your server-side JavaScript.

As the RegExp constructor in JavaScript doesn’t have a timeout feature (which it should!) I thought of a trick using Node.js’s core [vm](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html) module. (available in v0.12.x, v4.x and v5.x branches)

```
const util = require('util');
const vm = require('vm');

var sandbox = {
    result: null
};

var context = vm.createContext(sandbox);
console.log('Sandbox initialized: ' + vm.isContext(sandbox));

var script = new vm.Script('result = /^(A+)*B/
    .test(\'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC\');');

try{
    // One could argue if a RegExp hasn't processed in a given time.
    // then, its likely it will take exponential time.
    script.runInContext(context, { timeout: '1000' }); // milliseconds
} catch(e){
    console.log('ReDos occurred'); // Take some remedial action here...
}

console.log(util.inspect(sandbox)); // Check the results

```

Ideally using JavaScript’s [protatypal inheritance](http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html) one would overload the RegExp() constructor to include a timeout to tidy away all this code. I didn’t go to those lengths here, but perhaps I would in future.

# Preventing Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)

The previous topic explains [catastrophic backtracking](catastrophic.html) with practical examples from the perspective of somebody trying to get their regular expressions to work and perform well on their own PC. You should understand those examples before reading this topic.

It’s annoying when catastrophic backtracking happens on your PC. But when it happens in a server application with multiple concurrent users, it can really be catastrophic. Too many users running regexes that exhibit catastrophic backtracking will bring down the whole server. And “too many” need only be as few as the number of CPU cores in the server.

If the server accepts regexes from the user, then the user can easily provide one that exhibits catastrophic backtracking on any subject. If the server accepts subject data from the user, then the user may be able to provide subjects that trigger catastrophic backtracking in regexes used by the server, if those regexes are predisposed to catastrophic backtracking. When the user can do either of those things, the server is susceptible to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS). When enough users (or one actor masquerading as many users) provide malicious regexes and/or subjects to match against, the server will be spending nearly all its CPU cycles on trying to match those regexes.

## Handling Regexes Provided by The User

If your application allows the user to provide their own regexes, then your only real defense is to use a [text-directed regex engine](engine.html). Those engines don’t backtrack. Their performance depends on the length of the subject string, not the complexity of the regular expression. But they also don’t support features like [backreferences](backref.html) that depend on backtracking and that many users expect.

If your application uses a backtracking engine with user-provided regexes, then you can only mitigate the consequences of catastrophic backtracking. And you’ll really need to do so. It’s very easy for people with limited regex skills to accidentally craft one that degenerates into catastrophic backtracking.

You’ll need to use a regex engine that aborts the match attempt when catastrophic backtracking occurs rather than running until the script crashes or the OS kills it. You can easily test this. When the regex (x\w{1,10})+y is attempted on an ever growing string of x’s there should be a reasonable limit on how long it takes for the regex engine to give up. Ideally your engine will allow you to configure this limit for your purposes. The .NET engine, for example, allows you to pass a timeout to the Regex() constructor. The PCRE engine allows you to set recursion limits. The lower your limits the better the protection against ReDoS, but higher the risk of aborting legitimate regexes that would find a valid match given slightly more time. Low recursion limits may prevent long regex matches. Low timeouts may abort searches through large files too early.

If your regex engine has no such features, you could implement your own timeout. Spawn a separate thread to execute the regular expression. Wait on the thread with a timeout. If the thread finishes before the wait times out, process its result. Otherwise, kill the thread and tell the user the regex is too complex. The [safe\_regexp](https://github.com/grosser/safe_regexp) package implements this for Ruby.

## Reviewing Regexes in The Application

If the server only uses regexes that are hard-coded in your application, then you can prevent regex-based denial of service attacks entirely. You need to make sure that your regexes won’t exhibit catastrophic backtracking regardless of the subjects they’re used on. This isn’t particularly difficult for somebody with a solid grasp of regular expressions. But it does require care and attention. It’s not enough to just test that the regex matches valid subjects. You need to make sure, by looking at the regex independently of any subject data, that it is not possible for multiple permutations of the same regex to match the same thing.

Permutations occur when you give the regular expression a choice. You can do this with [alternation](alternation.html) and with [quantifiers](repeat.html). So these are the regex tokens you need to inspect. [Possessive](possessive.html) quantifiers are excepted, because they never backtrack.

## Alternation

Alternatives must be mutually exclusive. If multiple alternatives can match the same text then the engine will try both if the remainder of the regex fails. If the alternatives are in a group that is repeated, you have catastrophic backtracking.

A classic example is (.|\s)\* to match any amount of any text when the regex flavor does not have a “[dot matches line breaks](dot.html)” mode. If this is part of a longer regex then a subject string with a sufficiently long run of spaces will break the regex. The engine will try every possible combination of the spaces being matched by . or \s. For example, 3 spaces could be matched as ..., ..\s, .\s., .\s\s, \s.., \s.\s, \s\s., or \s\s\s. That’s 2^N permutations. The fix is to use (.|\n)\* to make the alternatives mutually exclusive. Even better to be more specific about which characters are really allowed, such as [\r\n\t\x20-\x7E]\* for ASCII printables, tabs, and line breaks.

It is acceptable for two alternatives to partially match the same text. [0-9]\*\.[0-9]+|[0-9]+ is perfectly fine to match a floating point number with optional integer part and optional fraction. Though a subject that consists of only digits is initially matched by [0-9]\* and does cause some backtracking when \. fails, this backtracking never becomes catastrophic. Even if you put this inside a group in a longer regex, the group only does a minimal amount of backtracking. (But the group mustn’t have a quantifier or it will fall foul of the rule for nested quantifiers.)

## Quantifiers in Sequence

Quantified tokens that are in sequence must either be mutually exclusive with each other or be mutually exclusive with what comes between them. Otherwise both can match the same text and all combinations of the two quantifiers will be tried when the remainder of the regex fails to match. A token inside a group with alternation is still in sequence with any token before or after the group.

A classic example is a.\*?b.\*?c to match 3 things with “anything” between them. When c can’t be matched the first .\*? expands character by character until the end of the line or file. For each expansion the second .\*? expands character by character to match the remainder of the line or file. The fix is to realize that you can’t have “anything” between them. The first run needs to stop at b and the second run needs to stop at c. With single characters a[^b]\*b[^c]\*c is an easy solution. The negated character classes guarantee the repetition stops at the delimiter. If your regex flavor supports [possessive quantifiers](possessive.html) then you can use a[^b]\*+b[^c]\*+c to further increase performance.

For a more complex example and solution, see [matching a complete HTML file](catastrophic.html#example) in the previous topic. This explains how you can use atomic grouping to prevent backtracking in more complex situations.

## Nested Quantifiers

A group that contains a token with a quantifier must not have a quantifier of its own unless the quantified token inside the group can only be matched with something else that is mutually exclusive with it. That ensures that there is no way that fewer iterations of the outer quantifier with more iterations of the inner quantifier can match the same text as more iterations of the outer quantifier with fewer iterations of the inner quantifier.

The regex (x\w{1,10})+y matches a sequence of one or more codes that start with an x followed by 1 to 10 word characters, all followed by a y. All is well as long as the y can be matched. When the y is missing, backtracking occurs. If the string doesn’t have too many x’s then backtracking happens very quickly. Things only turn catastrophic when the subject contains a long sequence of x’s. x and x are not mutually exclusive. So the repeated group can match xxxx in one iteration as x\w\w\w or in two iterations as x\wx\w.

To solve this, you first need to consider whether x and y should be allowed in the 1 to 10 characters that follow it. Excluding the x eliminates most backtracking. What’s left won’t be catastrophic. You could exclude it with [character class subtraction](charclasssubtract.html) as in (x[\w-[x]]{1,10})+y or with [character class intersection](charclassintersect.html) as in (x[\w&&[^x]]{1,10})+y. If you don’t have those features you’ll need to spell out the characters you want to allow: (x[a-wyz0-9\_]{1,10})+y.

If the x should be allowed then your only solution is to disallow the y in the same way. Then you can make the group atomic or the quantifier possessive to eliminate the backtracking.

If both x and y should be allowed in the sequences of 1 to 10 characters, then there is no regex-only solution. You can’t make the group atomic or the quantifier possessive as then \w{1,10} matches the final y which causes y to fail.

## Other Defensive Techniques

In addition to preventing catastrophic backtracking as explained above, you should make your regular expressions as strict as possible. The stricter the regex, the less backtracking it does and thus the better it performs. Even if you can’t measure the performance difference because the regex is used infrequently on short strings, proper technique is a habit. It also reduces the chance that a less experienced developer introduces catastrophic backtracking when they extend your regex later.

Make groups that contain alternatives atomic as much as you can. Use \b(?>one|two|three)\b to match a list of words.

Make quantifiers possessive as much as you can. If a repeated token is mutually exclusive with what follows, enforce that with a possessive quantifier.

Use (negated) character classes instead of the dot. It’s rare that you really want to allow “anything”. A double-quoted string, for example, can’t contain “anything”. It can’t contain unescaped double quotes. So use "[^"\n]\*+" instead of ".\*?". Though both find exactly the same matches when used on their own, the latter can lead to catastrophic backtracking when pasted into a longer regex. The former never backtracks regardless of anything else the regex needs to match.

## Why Use Regexes at All?

Some would certainly argue that the above only shows that regexes are dangerous and that they should not be used. They’ll then force developers to do the job with procedural code. Procedural code to match non-trivial patterns quickly becomes long and complicated, increasing the chance of bugs and the cost to develop and maintain the code. Many pattern matching problems are naturally solved with recursion. And when a large subject string can’t be matched, runaway recursion leads to stack overflows that crash the application.

Developers need to learn to correctly use their tools. This is no different for regular expressions than for anything else.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Why is this an issue?

## How can I fix it?

## More Info

Regular expression injections occur when the application retrieves untrusted data and uses it as a regex to pattern match a string with it.

Most regular expression search engines use *backtracking* to try all possible regex execution paths when evaluating an input. Sometimes this
can lead to performance problems also referred to as *catastrophic backtracking* situations.

### What is the potential impact?

In the context of a web application vulnerable to regex injection:
 After discovering the injection point, attackers insert data into the
vulnerable field to make the affected component inaccessible.

Depending on the application’s software architecture and the injection point’s location, the impact may or may not be visible.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker exploiting the vulnerability.

#### Self Denial of Service

In cases where the complexity of the regular expression is exponential to the input size, a small, carefully-crafted input (for example, 20 chars)
can trigger *catastrophic backtracking* and cause a denial of service of the application.

Super-linear regex complexity can produce the same effects for a large, carefully crafted input (thousands of chars).

If the component jeopardized by this vulnerability is not a bottleneck that acts as a single point of failure (SPOF) within the application, the
denial of service might only affect the attacker who initiated it.

Such benign denial of service can also occur in architectures that rely heavily on containers and container orchestrators. Replication systems
would detect the failure of a container and automatically replace it.

#### Infrastructure SPOFs

However, a denial of service attack can be critical to the enterprise if it targets a SPOF component. Sometimes the SPOF is a software architecture
vulnerability (such as a single component on which multiple critical components depend) or an operational vulnerability (for example, insufficient
container creation capabilities or failures from containers to terminate).

In either case, attackers aim to exploit the infrastructure weakness by sending as many malicious payloads as possible, using potentially huge
offensive infrastructures.

These threats are particularly insidious if the attacked organization does not maintain a disaster recovery plan (DRP).
