The provided content is related to CVE-2022-2376.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an AJAX action in the Directorist plugin that discloses email addresses of all users. This action is accessible without authentication, meaning anyone can trigger it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive user information. Specifically, the AJAX action `directorist_author_pagination` does not require authentication.
- **Information Disclosure:** User email addresses are exposed through an unauthenticated AJAX endpoint.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can retrieve email addresses of all users of the WordPress site. This information can be used for spam campaigns, phishing attacks, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network access:** The attacker can access the vulnerable endpoint via a web browser or a script, as it is publicly accessible.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges. The vulnerability can be exploited with a simple HTTP GET request to the provided endpoint.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable endpoint is `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=directorist_author_pagination`. This URL should be adjusted to match the actual domain where the vulnerable WordPress site is located.
- The vulnerability is present in Directorist plugin versions prior to 7.3.1.
