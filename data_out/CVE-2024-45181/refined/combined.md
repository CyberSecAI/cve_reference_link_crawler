Security Advisory
WIBU-94453

Mitigations for affected versions

Following measures are recommended to reduce the risk until the fixed version can be installed. Please
be aware that not all mitigations apply to every possible product configuration, so please check which
of these could be relevant or applicable in your case:

ï·  As  local  access  is  needed  to  exploit  the  vulnerabilities,  it  is  recommended  to  take  strict
measures  to  control  the  access  to  the  systems  where  the  vulnerable  WibuKey  driver  is
installed.
If  a  Windows  server  is  currently  used  as  WibuKey  network  license  server,  you  can  setup  a
WibuKey network license server on Linux or macOS instead. When using a Windows server, be
sure that the local access is restricted.

ï·

General security best practices can help to protect systems from local and network attacks.
