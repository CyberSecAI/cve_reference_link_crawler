body-parser is Node.js body parsing middleware. body-parser <1.20.3 is vulnerable to denial of service when url encoding is enabled. A malicious actor using a specially crafted payload could flood the server with a large number of requests, resulting in denial of service. This issue is patched in 1.20.3.
