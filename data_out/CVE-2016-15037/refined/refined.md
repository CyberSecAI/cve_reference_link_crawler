The provided content relates to CVE-2016-15037.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data before rendering it in HTML, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in multiple locations where user-provided data is directly rendered into HTML without proper escaping. Specifically:
    - `app/views/results/metadata/_vulnerability.html.erb`: The `note` attribute of a vulnerability vector was not being escaped before being used in the `title` attribute of a tooltip.
    - `app/views/task_types/_options_fields.html.erb`: The `description` attribute of a task option was not being escaped before being used in the `title` attribute of a tooltip.
    - `app/views/tasks/index.html.erb`: The `_last_status_message` from task metadata was not being escaped before being included in the message displayed for a task.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into task names, options, or vulnerability notes. When other users view this information in the application, the attackerâ€™s script would execute in their browsers. This could be used to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect users to malicious sites.
- While the commit message states this is "exploitable only by admins", the XSS is reflected, meaning any user viewing the affected data would be vulnerable.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to create tasks with crafted names containing malicious JavaScript or provide malicious data in vulnerability notes and/or task options/descriptions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to have the ability to create or modify tasks in the application, or be able to influence the data used in vulnerability reports or options.
