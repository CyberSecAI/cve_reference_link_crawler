Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `id` parameter used in the `/admin/inventory/view_inventory` page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive data directly from the backend database.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request Manipulation:** The attacker can inject malicious SQL queries by modifying the `id` parameter in a GET request to the vulnerable URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL to craft malicious queries.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable URL is `/admin/?page=inventory/view_inventory&id=2`.
- The specific vulnerable file is `/admin/inventory/view_inventory`.
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the "Online Eyewear Shop Website".
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided which demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting a crafted SQL query into the `id` parameter, allowing the attacker to extract data.
- The Gist also includes screenshots of a successful exploit using Burp Suite and SQLMap, further confirming the vulnerability.
