Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2964:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies within the OpenJDK's Concurrency subsystem, where there's an issue in how it handles stack consumption during the processing of regular expressions. Specifically, the `Pattern` class was found to not properly bound the stack usage, which can lead to excessive recursion or stack exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Overflow/Exhaustion:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper bounds checking or resource management during the processing of regular expressions, allowing a specially crafted regular expression to cause unbounded stack growth, potentially leading to a stack overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The main impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial of service, manifesting as an application crash. By providing a specially crafted regular expression, an attacker can cause the application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Regular Expressions:** The attack vector involves providing a carefully crafted regular expression to the `Pattern` processing functionality within OpenJDK.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply Regular Expression:** An attacker needs to be able to supply or control the regular expressions processed by the vulnerable application. The specific position required will depend on how the vulnerable code path is reached in the specific application (could be local or remote, depending on the app).
*   **No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability once a user-controlled regex is executed by a vulnerable application.**

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in OpenJDK 7 and 8.
*   The fix is included in security updates for various Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions and Ubuntu, as well as in IBM Java SE updates for impacted RHEL.
*  Multiple other CVEs are included in the same security advisories as this vulnerability, indicating that this is part of a larger set of fixes to OpenJDK.
* This vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" or "Important" by affected vendors depending on the application environment.
