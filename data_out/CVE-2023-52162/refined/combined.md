# Advisory

## Story

I went to a local store to buy some targets. I found a cheap Mercusys (MW325R EU V3) router.

I found multiple vulnerabilities during the reverse engineering process, and I reported them to the Vendor.
You can find more information here about CVE-2023-46297: <https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-46297.html>

In this part, I will focus on CVE-2023-52162 only.

## Vulnerability Description

An authenticated user, by modifying the Access Control List, can add new devices to the whitelist/blacklist.
However, the name parameter passed is not adequately validated on the server side, resulting in a buffer overflow vulnerability. Exploiting the vulnerability is not straightforward, but it is possible to execute arbitrary code.

* Hardware model: Mercusys MW325R EU V3
* Firmware: MW325R(EU)\_V3\_1.11.0 Build 221019
* Authentication required: YES
* It works with LAN and WAN
* Security->Access Control -> White List/Black List -> Add device.

### Access Control List

Note: The PC register contains 41414141. :P

## Preparation

If you are more interested in the preparations, you can read more about it here as well:

<https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/mercusys-mw325r-reverse-engineering-part-2>

The following screenshot contains a high-level overview of the reverse engineering process.

![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/100.png)
### The firmware

In general, there are multiple ways to obtain the firmware. There are easier and harder cases. Here are some examples:

* Download it from the vendor
* Exporting the binary from the device
* Firmware update + network traffic analysis
* Hardware tools
* Debug interface

Note that even if you have the firmware, sometimes it is encrypted.

However the firmware can be downloaded from the vendor.
I have a new chip reader, which was the main reason for the project so I used it.
The model was KeeYees SOP8 SOIC8 Test Clip  and CH341A USB Programmer Flash for Most of 24 25 Series BIOS Chip. This is what it looks like:

![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/101.png)

It is an awesome device and there are multiple test clips in it. It looks like complicated, but it is not that difficult to use.
Suppose you choose the correct test clip and connect it to the chip. There is a marker on the chip (a dot), it is the place of the "red cable".
The other part goes to a USB port. The programmer works with Windows, so I used my old ThinkPad.

If you set it correctly, the program automatically detects the chip. If it does not work, check the markers and hats and reconnect the whole thing.

![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/102.png)

The programmer looks like this:

![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/103.png)

It is possible to read and write the contents of a chip.
It supports a lot of vendors and devices and reading from a soldered chip is also possible by changing the clips and the hats.

A soldered chip refers to an integrated circuit (IC) or microchip that is permanently attached to a printed circuit board (PCB) using solder.
Solder is a fusible metal alloy that, when heated,
melts and creates an electrically conductive and mechanically strong bond between the chip's metal contacts (leads) and the PCB's pads or traces.

### Basic reverse engineering tools (binwalk, strings, xxd, ...)

Binwalk is a popular tool used for analyzing embedded files and firmware images. Its primary uses include:

* Analyzing File Structures: Binwalk can identify and extract various file types and data formats within a given binary file. This is particularly useful for examining firmware images, which often contain different filesystems, compressed data, and other embedded content.
* Data Extraction and Decryption: Binwalk can easily extract compressed or encrypted data. It recognizes various compression algorithms and encryption methods, attempting to automatically decompress or decode them.
* Firmware Analysis and Modification: Binwalk allows for in-depth analysis of firmware images, helping to uncover security flaws, modify firmware, or study embedded systems by reverse engineering them.

Binwalk is a powerful and versatile tool widely used by cybersecurity professionals,
firmware developers, and security researchers for detailed analysis and examination of embedded systems and binary files.

Unfortunately, binwalk does not work with all binary.
I found multiple LZMA compressed data, but there was a problem with the sizes. The following screenshot contains the errors:

![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/104.png)

I use traditional tools like xxd and dd to disassemble the binary in these cases.

```

$ binwalk -E mw325v3-up-noboot_2022-10-19_11.03.08.bin

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     ENTROPY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1024          0x400           Rising entropy edge (0.977327)
803840        0xC4400         Falling entropy edge (0.653670)
818176        0xC7C00         Rising entropy edge (0.973007)
1614848       0x18A400        Falling entropy edge (0.199398)

```
![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/105.png)

The binary was encrypted. With basic commands, I tried to collect as much information as possible about the binary.

Sometimes we can extract important and sensitive information from the binary this way, including hardcoded passwords.

First I tried with "strings":

![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/106.png)

The "xxd" tool is used for creating a hex dump of a given file or for converting a hex dump back into its original binary form.

![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/109.png)

In firmware, a bin file is a binary file containing executable code or data for the embedded device.
So, if I say "I gathered the bin files from the firmware," it means I collected certain binary files from the firmware,
which may contain executable code, configuration data, or other important information for the embedded device.
This is important because examining these binary files allows me to better understand the firmware's operation and content,
and possibly discover security vulnerabilities or other interesting details.

![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/110.png)

PEM files are commonly used for storing cryptographic keys, certificates, and other sensitive information in a text format.
They often contain encoded data in Base64 format, which may include private keys, public keys, certificates, certificate signing requests (CSRs),
and other cryptographic information.

Gathering PEM files can be beneficial for several reasons:

* Certificate Management: PEM files often contain SSL/TLS certificates used for securing web servers, email servers, or other network services. By collecting PEM files, you can manage and keep track of all the certificates used within your infrastructure.
* Key Management: PEM files may also contain private keys, which are crucial for asymmetric encryption and authentication. Collecting these files allows you to securely store and manage your private keys, ensuring their availability when needed.
* Security Analysis: Analyzing PEM files can help identify potential security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in your cryptographic infrastructure. For example, you can check for expired certificates, weak key lengths, or insecure cryptographic algorithms.
* Backup and Recovery: By gathering PEM files, you can create backups of your cryptographic keys and certificates, ensuring that you can recover them in case of accidental deletion, hardware failure, or other emergencies.

Overall, collecting PEM files helps improve the management, security, and reliability of your cryptographic infrastructure
by centralizing and organizing sensitive cryptographic assets.

![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/113.png)

I found some file names, and probably directory names.

Based on the "xxd" output at the end of each filename there is a null byte. I did not know, how the content was stored exactly.

These files seemed interesting:

```

```

I found this link, maybe it is useful: [https://deviwiki.com/wiki/TP-LINK\_Archer\_C24\_v1.x\_(EU)](https://deviwiki.com/wiki/TP-LINK_Archer_C24_v1.x_%28EU%29).

I found no information about the boot process.

### UART SHELL, and the boot process

Using the "screen" command, I accessed my previously established UART shell.

```

screen -L /dev/tty.USB0 115200

```
![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/114.png)

I checked the output of the boot process. It uses U-Boot:

```

U-Boot 1.1.3 (Dec 17 2021 - 18:17:52)

Board: Ralink APSoC DRAM:   8 MB
relocate_code Pointer at: 807c4000
flash manufacture id: 1c, device id 70 15
find flash: EN25QH16B

```

There were multiple boot modes, and the content was encrypted. The "0xbc00d000" was where the image starts.

```

Please choose the operation or press ctrl + c to stop auto boot:
   1: Load system code to SDRAM via TFTP.
   2: Load system code then write to Flash via TFTP.
   3: Boot system code via Flash (default).
   9: Load Boot Loader code then write to Flash via TFTP.

3: System Boot system code via Flash.
## Booting image at bc00d000 ...

### Operating system

It was a debugging environment, and the help command described the basic information about the commands. It took time to use these programs properly (more or less).

![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/116.png)

The most important commands were:

* mem
* task
* flash
* fs
* system
* debug

I tried to gather as much information as possible using the built-in commands.
The following screenshots contain the most important gathered information:

### Summary until now

Flash layout: We have the Flash layout.

* Operating system: No Linux, "TPOS 1.0.0".
* Filesystem: There were no classical commands like cd, but it is possible to dump files.
* Programs: No real programs, there are tasks.
* Memory: There was free space where I could dump things.
* Open ports: "net show"

### Dumping the flash via the debugging interface

I tried to use the TFTP command and the atfpd/ptftpd TFTP servers, but I had no luck with it.

Decryption occurs when the system starts. After boot when the system is running, the files can be used. I can use this to access additional information via the debug interface. It is important to understand the Flash Layout.

I made a small Python3 script. It connected to the serial console and used the built-in commands to dump the flash content.

Notes:

* It is slow and ugly, but it works.
* There are cases when random "\r\n" characters appear in the output.
* I used 4KB chunks during the dump.
* Sometimes the output was not correct. In these cases, I removed the first few bytes of the current line.
* I used this address to store the dumps for each iteration: 0x807E9000
* In some cases, you should execute the script multiple times. If you understand how it works, it is easy to modify it.
* It is also possible to dump other flash regions.

"dump\_flash\_via\_uart\_commands\_mw325r.py":

```

#!/usr/bin/python3

import serial, sys, os, time

BAUD_RATE = 115200
# you can use this, if you have problems.
DELAY = 9

mem_addr = 0x807E9000
max_dump_size = 4
max_dump_size_bytes = max_dump_size * 1024

s = serial.Serial("/dev/ttyUSB0", BAUD_RATE)
f = open("flash_manual_full.dump", "wb")

addresses = [ hex(i) for i in range(0,2097152,4096) ]

for current_address in addresses:
    print(current_address)
    CONFIG_addr = int(current_address,16)
    CONFIG_length = max_dump_size * 1024

    flash_read_cmd = "flash -read %02x %02x %02x\r\n" % (CONFIG_addr, max_dump_size_bytes, mem_addr)
    s.write(flash_read_cmd.encode("utf-8"))

    dump_mem_cmd = "mem -dump %02x %02x\r\n" % (mem_addr, max_dump_size_bytes)
    s.write(dump_mem_cmd.encode("utf-8"))
    s.readline().decode("utf-8")
    s.readline().decode("utf-8")
    s.readline().decode("utf-8")
    s.readline().decode("utf-8")

    L = int(max_dump_size_bytes / 16)
    for i in range(0,L):
        line = s.readline()

        if b"# \x1b[s# \x1b[s" in line:
            line = line[10:]

        if len(line) != 83:
            print(b"!" + line)

        f.write(line)

f.close()
s.close()

```

The format of the "flash\_manual\_full.dump" was the following:

```

cat flash_manual_full.dump | head -n 10
807E9000:  FF 00 00 10 00 00 00 00 - FD 00 00 10 00 00 00 00      ........ ........
807E9010:  34 03 00 10 00 00 00 00 - 32 03 00 10 00 00 00 00      4....... 2.......

807E9060:  20 03 00 10 00 00 00 00 - 1E 03 00 10 00 00 00 00       ....... ........
807E9070:  1C 03 00 10 00 00 00 00 - 1A 03 00 10 00 00 00 00      ........ ........
807E9080:  18 03 00 10 00 00 00 00 - 16 03 00 10 00 00 00 00      ........ ........

```

So I wrote another helper script "dump2bin.py", which restores the "bin" file.

```

#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys, io

BYTES_IN_LINE = 0x10 # Number of bytes to expect in each line
c_addr = None
hex_to_ch = {}
ascii_stdin = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdin.buffer, encoding='ascii', errors='strict')

Usage:

```

cat flash_manual_full.dump | ./dump2bin.py > flash.bin

```

Earlier we didn't have boot information in the binary, but this time we have the following:

```

## Tehnical details

I published the technical details on vsociety: <https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/mercusys-mw325r-reverse-engineering-part-3-authenticated-remote-code-execution-cve-2023-52162>

### Preparation

The device, the UART shell, and debugging options were presented in the previous sections. There, I

* performed the initial setup of the router
* connected the laptop to the router (LAN1)
* connected the router to a network (WAN)
* obtained a UART shell

Burp + Proxy

I configured the Burp proxy on my laptop, so it is possible to manipulate web requests.

![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/201.png)

I configured Firefox to use the Proxy.

![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/202.png)

The better the environment, the easier it is to reproduce the behavior. Something may need to be restarted often, so I typically use some Python automation.
It pays to prepare in the long run.In this case, I had only 3 days.

I examined the router quite a bit before. I understand the technology, the device, and the internal components.
The buffer overflow type of vulnerability is quite typical for these solutions.
It's an iterative process, I poke a little bit and see what happens.
The UART shell and the log part of the web interface will contain everything. If the router crashes, it is worth investigating further.

I recommend manually reviewing the functions, especially the exciting ones requiring user input.
This helps to understand the internal workings.

### Referer check

There is a security feature, it is called Referer check.
It is what the name suggests, the Referer header is checked when the device receives a request.
It must be set correctly or the requests will not accepted.

![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/204.png)

Example "Referer" header in Burp:

![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/205.png)

The Device path is:

```

Security -> Access Control -> White List/Black List -> Add device

```
![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/206.png)

The original request was the following:

![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/207.png)

The device uses special parameter management, which is good news, the chance of vulnerabilities is even greater.
The interesting part is the 14th line, and the "name" parameter.

I changed the name parameter to a series of "A" characters.

![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/208.png)

After submitting the payload, the web interface became unavailable.
After a short time, it was possible to log in again.
From the behavior and analysis of the logs, it can be seen that an exception occurred and the router restarted.

The log window contained the following:

![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/209.png)
### What is the "PC" register?

The "PC" abbreviation for an ARM processor stands for "Program Counter", which represents the instruction pointer.
This register holds the memory address of the currently executed instruction or the address from which the next instruction starts.

From an exploitation perspective, the "PC" register is crucial as attackers can manipulate it
to control the execution flow of the target program. For instance, an attacker may find an opportunity to exploit faulty program inputs,
enabling them to modify the "PC" register's value to make the program execute their chosen code snippet, such as malicious code.
This technique is commonly known as a buffer overflow attack and is one of the most frequently used methods for exploiting software security vulnerabilities.

More information here: <https://developer.arm.com/documentation/107656/0101/Registers/Registers-in-the-register-bank/R15--Program-Counter--PC->

Note: 0x41 = 65 (decimal) - the ASCII code of "A".

The UART shell contained the following:

![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/211.png)

My original payload length was 289.

### A high-level overview of the vanilla buffer overflow Exploitation

* Identify Vulnerable Program: Start by identifying a program susceptible to buffer overflow. Typically, this involves programs written in languages like C or C++, which may lack proper input validation.
* Understand Memory Layout: Understand the program's memory layout, particularly the stack and heap (if heap is used). The aim is to overflow a buffer on the stack to overwrite critical data, such as the return address stored in the PC (Program Counter) register.
* Craft Payload: Create a payload, often in the form of a string, that exceeds the buffer's size. This payload usually includes shellcode, malicious code that you want to execute. The payload must be crafted carefully to ensure it reaches the return address stored in the PC register.
* Calculate Offset: Determine the correct offset needed to reach the return address in the stack frame. This offset ensures that the overwritten return address points to the beginning of the crafted payload, enabling the execution of the shellcode.
* Trigger Overflow: Input the crafted payload into the vulnerable program, causing it to overflow the buffer. By correctly calculating the offset, you ensure that the overwritten return address points to the shellcode within the payload.
* Exploit Control Flow: Due to the overflow, critical data, such as the return address in the PC register, gets overwritten with the address of the shellcode. As a result, when the function returns, the program jumps to the shellcode instead of its intended location.
* Execute Malicious Code: With the manipulated control flow, the program executes the shellcode inserted into the payload. This grants the attacker control over the system, potentially leading to privilege escalation, remote code execution, or other malicious activities.

Understanding the PC register's role in controlling program execution and calculating the correct offset is crucial for crafting successful buffer overflow exploits. Failure to calculate the offset accurately may result in the exploit failing to execute the intended malicious code or causing the program to crash unpredictably.

In this case, we have it relatively easy as finding the correct offset can be done using elementary tools like Metasploit's "pattern\_create" and "pattern\_offset".
These tools allow us to generate a unique pattern of characters, which we can input into the vulnerable program.
By identifying where this pattern is overwritten in the program's memory,
we can determine the exact offset required to reach the return address stored in the PC register.

I used the old pattern\_create to create the payload and reproduced the crash. The PC this time contained "41326651".
With the pattern\_offset tool, I found the correct offset:

![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/213.png)

I created a new payload and inserted "C"-s into the appropriate locations.
If the payload is correct, "43" (decimal 67 - C character) will appear in the PC register.

![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/214.png)

My beautiful 43 bytes were in the PC register:

![](https://k4m1ll0.com/cve-2023-52162/215.png)
### How can you continue from here?

It depends on what the goal is.

You can use the contiguous free areas at the end of the memory for data storage.
You can store the real payload in memory with some tricks.
You must find the address belonging to useful functions and parameterize them properly.

Here are some possibilities:

* You can start another SSH server.
* You can reuse an open-source telnet client.
* You can write your ARM reverse shell.
* You can use the TFTP command to download and store something. Maybe with an older version, it works fine. (The problem was with my setup.)

In my opinion, the best way is to use the features provided by the system to download, store, and run the code.

A qualified exploit writer can write what is missing from here. It is a nice way to learn exploit writing if you write it yourself.
This device is not a good starting device. If you are a newbie, I recommend TP-Link routers e.g. TL-WR840N first.

C and ARM assembly knowledge is required, maybe the MediaTek SDK will be useful too.

## Update: 2024.06.08

I gave a presentation on the vulnerabilities discovered. Several people have asked about whether other models are affected or whether there are other vulnerabilities.

* In my opinion, several models are affected by the revealed vulnerabilities. This information is available to the manufacturer, not to me.
* If I had to guess, I'd say there are additional vulnerabilities in these devices. This is just an opinnion, not a fact.

If you have further questions, you should get in touch with the vendor.
