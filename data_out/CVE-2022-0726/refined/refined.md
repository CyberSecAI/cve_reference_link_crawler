Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the changes made in the commit `6ea9295b8f5dd7cc254202a79aad61c666cc4259` in the `chocobozzz/peertube` repository:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The commit addresses a vulnerability related to access control when creating comments and ratings on videos. Specifically, the issue was that the application was not properly checking if a user had the right to access a video before allowing them to create comments or ratings. This could lead to unauthorized users being able to interact with private videos, which they should not have access to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary vulnerability was the lack of proper access control checks before allowing users to comment or rate videos. The system was not verifying if a user had permission to interact with a specific video, especially private ones.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could create comments or rates on videos that should be private or inaccessible to them. This could potentially lead to exposure of sensitive content or harassment if attackers use the commenting feature on videos they shouldn't have access to.
*   **Data tampering:** While not explicitly stated, unauthorized users could manipulate the system by adding comments or ratings on videos they are not authorized to access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Manipulation:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by directly making API requests to comment or rate a video. By crafting requests targeting private videos, they could bypass the intended access restrictions.
*   **Lack of Validation:** The application's failure to validate the user's permissions was the core of the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker would need to be an authenticated user of the system. The provided changes specifically address how authenticated users could access private videos they should not have access to, not unauthenticated users.
*   **API Access:** The attacker would need the ability to make direct API requests to the server.

**Technical Details:**

The commit focuses on modifications to several files:

*   `server/middlewares/validators/videos/video-comments.ts`: This file was modified to add checks to ensure that a user can see the video before allowing them to create a comment thread or reply. Specifically, the `checkCanSeeVideoIfPrivate` function is used to prevent unauthorized access to private videos.

    ```typescript
    if (!await checkCanSeeVideoIfPrivate(req, res, res.locals.videoAll)) {
        return res.fail({
          status: HttpStatusCode.FORBIDDEN_403,
          message: 'Cannot access to this ressource'
        })
      }
    ```

*   `server/middlewares/validators/videos/video-rates.ts`: This file had similar changes, adding access checks before allowing users to rate videos using the `checkCanSeeVideoIfPrivate` function.

    ```typescript
    if (!await checkCanSeeVideoIfPrivate(req, res, res.locals.videoAll)) {
        return res.fail({
          status: HttpStatusCode.FORBIDDEN_403,
          message: 'Cannot access to this ressource'
        })
      }
    ```

*   `server/tests/api/check-params/video-comments.ts`: Includes new tests designed to verify that the new access controls are correctly working for video comments.

*   `server/tests/api/check-params/videos.ts`: Similarly, includes new tests for rating access control.

In summary, this commit adds access control to ensure users can only create comments or rates on videos that they are authorized to access, preventing unauthorized interaction with private videos, which addresses the inadequate access control issue.
