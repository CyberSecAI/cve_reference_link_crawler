The provided content relates to CVE-2024-22014.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of symbolic links within 360 Total Security.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is that the software does not properly validate or sanitize symbolic links, allowing a malicious user to create a link that points to an arbitrary file.

**Impact of exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, a local attacker can delete arbitrary files on the system. This allows for local privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:** A local attacker can create a symbolic link to a file they wish to delete, then trigger 360 Total Security to follow that link, causing it to delete a target file outside of its intended scope.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to create symbolic links.
