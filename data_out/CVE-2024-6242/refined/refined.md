- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the affected products that allows a threat actor to bypass the Trusted® Slot feature in a ControlLogix® controller. This bypass allows unauthorized execution of CIP commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the "Trusted Slot" feature, which is designed to restrict access to sensitive controller functions and configurations. This can be categorized as an "Unprotected Alternate Channel" (CWE-420).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute CIP commands. This could allow them to modify user projects, alter device configurations on the Logix controller, and potentially cause significant disruption to industrial control processes.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). The vulnerability can be exploited over the network, requiring a low level of privilege (PR:L) and no user interaction (UI:N). The attacker needs to have access to the network where the affected devices reside.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires network access to the affected device, and a low level of access privileges (PR:L). The attacker must be able to send CIP commands to the affected modules.
