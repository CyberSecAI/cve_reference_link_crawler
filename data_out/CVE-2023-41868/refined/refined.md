Root cause of vulnerability: The WordPress Stagtools plugin, versions 2.3.7 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of malicious scripts in the victim's browser, which could redirect users, display unwanted advertisements, or perform other unauthorized actions.

Attack vectors: An attacker can inject malicious scripts through a vulnerable input field within the plugin, these scripts are then executed when a user visits the affected page.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
