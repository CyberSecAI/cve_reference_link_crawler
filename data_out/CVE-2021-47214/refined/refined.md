The provided content describes a patch for a bug in the Linux kernel's hugetlb subsystem related to userfaultfd.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of reservation restoration during userfaultfd operations in the `hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte()` function. Specifically, when the `is_continue` case bails out due to `idx >= size` or `!huge_pte_none()`, the code incorrectly calls `restore_reserve_on_error()`, leading to a reservation deletion. Subsequently, `remove_inode_hugepages()` increments `h->resv_hugepages`, resulting in a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect conditional logic in `hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte()` leads to calling `restore_reserve_on_error()` when it shouldn't be.
- This incorrect call to `restore_reserve_on_error()` deletes a reservation and increments the `h->resv_hugepages`, leading to a memory leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory leak in the hugetlb subsystem
- The memory leak is described as 100% reproducible.

**Attack vectors:**
- User-space application triggering a userfaultfd operation on hugetlb memory, specifically in the `is_continue` case in `hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte()`.
- The specific conditions include bailing out due to `idx >= size` or `!huge_pte_none()`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute code in user space, capable of making userfaultfd calls.
- Triggering a userfaultfd operation within the hugetlb subsystem, causing a fault in the `is_continue` path.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger specific conditions within the hugetlb code to reach the faulty code path.

The patch addresses this by treating the `is_continue` case similar to adding a page into the pagecache. By setting `page_in_pagecache` to `true`, the code indicates that no reservation needs to be restored, preventing the memory leak. The variable `new_pagecache_page` is also renamed to `page_in_pagecache` to reflect its actual role.
