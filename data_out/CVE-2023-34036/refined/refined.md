- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of `X-Forwarded-*` headers in Spring HATEOAS when used with WebFlux. If an application using Spring HATEOAS to generate links in hypermedia responses is not behind a trusted proxy or lacks other mechanisms to handle or discard forwarded headers, malicious clients can inject these headers. This can lead to the generation of incorrect links in the response, potentially redirecting users to malicious sites or performing other unintended actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability is due to a lack of input sanitization or proper handling of forwarded headers, allowing attackers to control the generated links.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can manipulate the generated links in hypermedia responses, potentially redirecting users to malicious sites or causing unintended actions.
- **Attack vectors:**  Attackers send HTTP requests with crafted `X-Forwarded-*` headers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The application must be using Spring WebFlux and Spring HATEOAS. Additionally, there must be an absence of a trusted proxy or other mechanisms for handling forwarded headers.
