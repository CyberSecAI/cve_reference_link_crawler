Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-41946:

**CVE-2023-41946**

*   **Root Cause:** The Frugal Testing Plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints. Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** Several HTTP endpoints within the Frugal Testing Plugin lack proper permission checks. This allows unauthorized users to access functionalities they should not have access to.
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The affected endpoints do not require POST requests, making them vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *  Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to Frugal Testing using attacker-specified username and password.
    *   Attackers can retrieve test IDs and names from Frugal Testing if a valid credential corresponds to the attacker-specified username.
    *   CSRF vulnerability could allow attackers to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their consent.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can directly access the vulnerable HTTP endpoints and execute actions.
    *  **CSRF:** An attacker could trick a logged-in user into making a request to a vulnerable endpoint, leading to unintended actions being performed on the server. This could be achieved by embedding malicious links or forms on a website or email.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
    *   For CSRF attacks, the attacker needs to trick a logged-in Jenkins user into interacting with the crafted malicious request.
    
**Affected Plugin:** Frugal Testing Plugin 1.1 and earlier

**Fix:** No fix is available as of the publication of the advisory.
