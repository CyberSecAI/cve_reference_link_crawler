Affected CVE

CVE-2024-5460

| **Brocade Security Advisory ID** | BSA-2024-2596 |
| --- | --- |
| **Component** | SNMPv1 |
|  |  |

**Summary**

A vulnerability in the default configuration of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) feature of Brocade Fabric OS versions before v9.0.0 could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read data from an affected device via SNMP. The vulnerability is due to hard-coded, default community string in the configuration file for the SNMP daemon. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the static community string in SNMP version 1 queries to an affected device.

**Products Affected**

Brocade Fabric OS versions prior to v9.0.0 that continue to run with the default SNMP community string and SNMPv1 enabled.

Brocade Directors and Switches that were originally shipped with a version of Brocade Fabric OS prior to v9.0.0 that have not had their default community strings updated, and continue to have SNMPv1 enabled even after upgrading to a Fabric OS version v9.0.0 or later.

**Products Confirmed Not Affected**

Brocade Directors and Switches that were shipped with Brocade v9.0.0 or later versions of Fabric OS.

**Detail**

SNMPv1 remains a configurable option to support legacy customer environments. The administrator controls SNMPv1 usage and can fully disable the use of SNMPv1 if it is not required within the customer environment.

Default community strings and SNMPv1 are both disabled by default, starting with Fabric OS v9.0.0.

**Solution**

For supported Brocade Fabric OS versions v8.2.3x firmware that still contains default community strings, the following remediation steps should be followed:

* Clear the default community strings by using “snmpconfig –default snmpv1”
* Disable SNMPv1 if not required within the customer environment

The above recommendations and configuration steps are documented within the Brocade Fabric OS administration and command reference guides. For further assistance, please contact your Service Provider.
