{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from two issues: insufficient sanitization of uploaded image filenames and the lack of access control for direct access to images.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Injection attacks due to insufficient sanitization of image filenames.",
    "Lack of access control for direct image access."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can exploit the filename injection vulnerability and potentially access images that are not intended to be publicly available by guessing or discovering the image path and filename.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves uploading image files with malicious filenames and/or attempting to access image files through direct URL access based on predictable filename/paths.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to upload images in the system to exploit the filename injection, and knowledge or the ability to guess image paths and filenames for unauthorized access.  This is described as having 'access to uploading images'."
