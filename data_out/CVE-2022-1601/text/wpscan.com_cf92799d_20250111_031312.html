## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# User Access Manager < 2.2.18 - IP Spoofing

### Description

The plugin prioritizes getting a visitor's IP from certain HTTP headers over PHP's REMOTE\_ADDR, which makes it possible for attackers to access restricted content in certain situations.

### Proof of Concept

Set HTTP\_X\_REAL\_IP which is used in checkUserGroupAccess() to use an IP from the allowlist.
