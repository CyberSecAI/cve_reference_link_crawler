Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization within the Pagekit CMS v1.0.18 when handling widget content. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then stored in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious scripts are not immediately executed upon input but are stored and executed when the data is later displayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser who views the affected pages.
- **Account Hijacking:** By injecting malicious scripts, an attacker could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information, leading to account hijacking.
- **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could perform actions on behalf of the victimized user.
- **Website Defacement:** Injecting malicious content can also lead to website defacement or alteration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the widget creation/editing interface in the Pagekit CMS admin panel.
- The attacker injects the malicious payload when creating or editing a widget.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative access to the Pagekit CMS to create or modify widgets.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable area (the widget configuration) and ability to insert HTML/javascript code.
- The attacker needs the ability to access the admin panel of the CMS.

**Technical Details:**
The provided attack steps show the attacker:
1. Navigates to the widget creation/edit interface within the admin panel.
2. Inserts a malicious JavaScript payload into a widget configuration field.
3. The payload is saved. When a page with the widget is loaded, the payload gets executed on the frontend. Also, when a user views the widget details in the backend, the payload will be executed.
