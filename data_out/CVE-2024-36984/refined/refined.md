Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36984:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of an authenticated user to execute a crafted query that serializes untrusted data within Splunk Enterprise on Windows. This happens through the use of the `collect` SPL command that writes a file within the Splunk Enterprise installation. This file can then be leveraged to introduce a serialized payload that allows for arbitrary code execution when deserialized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsafe Deserialization: The core issue is the deserialization of untrusted data. Specifically, the `collect` command in Splunk allows an attacker to write a file that can contain a serialized payload. When this payload is processed, it can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- Lack of Input Validation: The application fails to properly validate the data being serialized and subsequently deserialized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the Splunk Enterprise server by exploiting this vulnerability. This allows them to take control of the system and perform any actions they want.
- Complete System Compromise: Successful RCE allows the attacker to potentially exfiltrate sensitive data, install malware, and disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attack is network-based, as the attacker would interact with Splunk Web to execute the malicious query.
- Authenticated User: The attacker must be an authenticated user within Splunk Enterprise.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to Splunk Web Interface: The attacker needs to have an account with valid login credentials for Splunk Web.
- Ability to execute queries: The attacker needs permissions to run queries in Splunk, specifically using the collect SPL command.
- Knowledge of Splunk: The attacker needs to understand how to craft a malicious serialized payload and use the collect command to leverage it.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Splunk Enterprise installations on Windows.
- The provided detection (Splunk Command and Scripting Interpreter Risky Commands) can help identify potential exploit attempts by monitoring the usage of the `collect` command along with other risky commands.
- Disabling Splunk Web on indexers where it is not needed is a valid mitigation strategy.
- The exploit requires the use of the `collect` command and the execution of code within the payload after deserialization.
