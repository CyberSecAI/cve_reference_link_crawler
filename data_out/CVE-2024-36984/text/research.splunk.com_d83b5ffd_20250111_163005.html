# Detection: Splunk Command and Scripting Interpreter Risky Commands

Updated Date: 2024-10-17
ID: 1cf58ae1-9177-40b8-a26c-8966040f11ae
Author: Michael Haag, Splunk
[Type: Hunting](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

The following analytic identifies the execution of risky commands within the Splunk platform, such as `runshellscript`, `delete`, and `sendemail`. It leverages the Search\_Activity data model to detect ad hoc searches containing these commands, excluding those run by the splunk-system-user. This activity is significant because it may indicate attempts at data exfiltration, deletion, or other unauthorized actions by a malicious user. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to data loss, unauthorized data transfer, or system compromise, severely impacting the organization's security posture.

### Search

### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [security\_content\_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml) | `convert timeformat="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" ctime($field$)` |
| splunk\_command\_and\_scripting\_interpreter\_risky\_commands\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_command_and_scripting_interpreter_risky_commands_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

To successfully implement this search acceleration is recommended against the Search\_Activity datamodel that runs against the splunk \_audit index. In addition, this analytic requires the Common Information Model App which includes the Splunk Audit Datamodel <https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1621/>. Splunk SOAR customers can find a SOAR workbook that walks an analyst through the process of running these hunting searches in the references list of this detection. In order to use this workbook, a user will need to run a curl command to post the file to their SOAR instance such as "curl -u username:password <https://soar.instance.name/rest/rest/workbook_template> -d @splunk\_psa\_0622.json". A user should then create an empty container or case, attach the workbook, and begin working through the tasks.

### Known False Positives

False positives will be present until properly filtered by Username and search name.

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A risky Splunk command has ran by $user$ and should be reviewed. | 20 | 50 | 40 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
