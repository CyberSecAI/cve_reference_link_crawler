- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Faktory web dashboard is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the way it handles the `days` URL query parameter. The value of this parameter is used directly to create a string slice without any validation or checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Improper input validation
  - Resource exhaustion due to uncontrolled memory allocation.
  - Lack of authorization for the web dashboard which makes it accessible to anyone with internet access
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - Denial of service (DoS) due to server crash
  - Server unavailability
- **Attack vectors:**
  - Sending a crafted HTTP request to the Faktory web dashboard with a very large value for the `days` query parameter. For example, `http://localhost:7420/?days=922337`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs network access to the Faktory web dashboard (default port 7420).
  - No authentication is required as the vulnerability is present on the web dashboard which does not require any authorization.
