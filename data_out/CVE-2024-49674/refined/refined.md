- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The EKC Tournament Manager WordPress plugin, in versions 2.2.1 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability, which allows attackers to force higher privileged users to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack can lead to unauthorized actions being performed by a user with elevated privileges. The specific impact varies depending on the actions that can be triggered.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack, where a malicious actor tricks an authenticated user into performing actions they did not intend to.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges into making a crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
