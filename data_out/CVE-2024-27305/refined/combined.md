# SMTP smuggling

Moderate

[Dreamsorcerer](/Dreamsorcerer)
published
GHSA-pr2m-px7j-xg65
Mar 12, 2024

## Package

aiosmtpd
(all)

## Affected versions

all

## Patched versions

1.4.5

## Description

### Summary

aiosmtpd is vulnerable to inbound SMTP smuggling. SMTP smuggling is a novel vulnerability based on not so novel interpretation differences of the SMTP protocol. By exploiting SMTP smuggling, an attacker may send smuggle/spoof e-mails with fake sender addresses, allowing advanced phishing attacks. This issue also existed in other SMTP software like Postfix (<https://www.postfix.org/smtp-smuggling.html>).

### Details

Detailed information on SMTP smuggling can be found in the full blog post (<https://sec-consult.com/blog/detail/smtp-smuggling-spoofing-e-mails-worldwide/>) or on the Postfix homepage (<https://www.postfix.org/smtp-smuggling.html>). (and soon on the official website <https://smtpsmuggling.com/>)

### Impact

With the right SMTP server constellation, an attacker can send spoofed e-mails to inbound/receiving aiosmtpd instances.

### Severity

Moderate

More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
