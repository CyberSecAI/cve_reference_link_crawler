Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-21535

**Root Cause:** The `markdown-to-jsx` package is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to improper input sanitization of the `src` property. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize the `src` attribute within iframe tags allowing for malicious code injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application.
*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The application does not adequately sanitize the `src` property of `iframe` elements when processing markdown.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser by injecting a malicious iframe element.
*   **Cookie Theft/Session Hijacking:**  The injected script can be used to steal cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The vulnerability can be used to expose sensitive user information.
*   **Access to Privileged Services/Functionality:** Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to privileged services and functionality.
*   **Malware Delivery:**  XSS can also be used to deliver malware to users.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Markdown Input:** An attacker injects a malicious `<iframe>` tag with a `javascript:` URI within the `src` attribute into the markdown content. This input is then processed by `markdown-to-jsx` without proper sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Inject Markdown:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious markdown content into an application that uses the vulnerable `markdown-to-jsx` package.
*   **Network Access:** The attack is performed over the network (Network vector).
*   **No Privileges Required:** No special privileges are needed for the attack to succeed.
*   **Partial User Interaction:**  The user needs to load/view the markdown content.
* **No special requirements:** No special conditions are required to execute the attack.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Package:** `markdown-to-jsx` versions before 7.4.0 are affected.
*   **Proof of Concept:** A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating the injection of `javascript:alert()` within an iframe tag's src attribute.
*  **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed by sanitizing the `src` property, using the `sanitizeUrl()` function, as shown in the commit diff provided.

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade to `markdown-to-jsx` version 7.4.0 or higher.
*  Ensure data input is properly sanitized before rendering.

This vulnerability is a classic example of an XSS attack stemming from inadequate input sanitization and can have serious consequences, including the ability for attackers to run arbitrary code in the context of the user's browser.
