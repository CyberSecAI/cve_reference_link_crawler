blocked tries to reconnect hundreds of times per second but on different ports.

implementation based on the code from USBC which does not generate errors in Windows
Reliability Monitor.

with the window size so that the user can see more entries in the list.

- New: New Security tab was added in the Main Panel which contains the Secure Boot
and the new improved Secure Rules feature which automatically removes the rules that
are added to a different Group than the defined list of authorized group names. This

deleted anymore by WFC because Secure Rules was enabled. Also, unwanted firewall rules
that may have been added before the start of WFC service can be detected this way.
- Updated: The internal logging mechanism was simplified and updated to offer more
information about the events that are logged.
- Updated: A new rule created from the notification dialog without customizing it,

to improve the speed when loading the most recent entries.

in Connections Log for some operating systems which are not in English language.
