The provided content describes multiple XSS vulnerabilities in the "Employees Payroll Management System" PHP application. This aligns with the possibility of CVE-2023-23022 referring to an XSS vulnerability within that system.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Lack of input sanitization/validation of user-supplied data before rendering in HTML.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Second-order XSS:** Data such as `code`, `title`, `from_date`, and `to_date` submitted via POST requests in the `/payroll_edit` function is stored in the database, and later retrieved and displayed in the `edit.php` view without proper sanitization, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
- **First-order XSS:** Data submitted through POST requests in functions like `user_add` and `department_add` are directly rendered into the HTML of the `add.php` view without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application through vulnerable input fields.
- This could lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of other users' browsers, potentially stealing session cookies, performing actions on behalf of the user, redirecting to malicious websites, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Submitting malicious payloads through the vulnerable input fields via POST requests (e.g., in forms for editing payroll data, adding user data, or adding department data).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application and have the ability to submit POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
- For second-order XSS, the attacker needs the ability to cause other users to view the malicious stored content.
- For first-order XSS, the attacker needs the ability to have the injected content be rendered in a user's browser.
