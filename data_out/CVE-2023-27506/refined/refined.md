- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper buffer restrictions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Buffer restrictions are not properly implemented in the Intel(R) Optimization for Tensorflow software, leading to a potential for out-of-bounds access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can potentially escalate their privileges on the local system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated user with local access to the system is required. User interaction is also required.
