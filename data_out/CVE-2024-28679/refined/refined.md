- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within the Photo collection component of DedeCMS v5.7, where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code, such as `<img onerror="alert(1)" src="1" />`, via the Photo collection component. This injected code is then executed when a user views the page containing the vulnerable component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious code into the Photo collection component, likely via a form or field. An attacker would need to find a user input field in the Photo Collection feature which would allow them to insert the malicious payload.
