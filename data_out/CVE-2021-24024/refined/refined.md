- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Plain text storage of sensitive information (passwords) into a log file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext storage of passwords in log files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, authenticated attacker can read other local users' passwords from log files. This leads to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote access to the system, requiring an attacker to be authenticated.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the FortiADCManager or FortiADC to gain access to the log files.
