# Missing normalization of the protocol in URLs allows bypassing forbidden protocols

Moderate

[edemaine](/edemaine)
published
GHSA-3wc5-fcw2-2329
Mar 24, 2024

## Package

npm

katex
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>= 0.11.0, < 0.16.10

## Patched versions

0.16.10

## Description

### Impact

Code that uses KaTeX's `trust` option, specifically that provides a function to block-list certain URL protocols, can be fooled by URLs in malicious inputs that use uppercase characters in the protocol. In particular, this can allow for malicious input to generate `javascript:` links in the output, even if the `trust` function tries to forbid this protocol via `trust: (context) => context.protocol !== 'javascript'`.

### Patches

Upgrade to KaTeX v0.16.10 to remove this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

* Allow-list instead of block protocols in your `trust` function.
* Manually lowercase `context.protocol` via `context.protocol.toLowerCase()` before attempting to check for certain protocols.
* Avoid use of or turn off the `trust` option.

### Details

KaTeX did not normalize the `protocol` entry of the `context` object provided to a user-specified `trust`-function, so it could be a mix of lowercase and/or uppercase letters.

It is generally better to allow-list by protocol, in which case this would normally not be an issue. But in some cases, you might want to block-list, and the [KaTeX documentation](https://katex.org/docs/options.html) even provides such an example:

> Allow all commands but forbid specific protocol: `trust: (context) => context.protocol !== 'file'`

Currently KaTeX internally sees `file:` and `File:` URLs as different protocols, so `context.protocol` can be `file` or `File`, so the above check does not suffice. A simple workaround would be:

> `trust: (context) => context.protocol.toLowerCase() !== 'file'`

Most URL parsers normalize the scheme to lowercase. For example, [RFC3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.1) says:

> Although schemes are case-insensitive, the canonical form is lowercase and documents that specify schemes must do so with lowercase letters. An implementation should accept uppercase letters as equivalent to lowercase in scheme names (e.g., allow "HTTP" as well as "http") for the sake of robustness but should only produce lowercase scheme names for consistency.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
