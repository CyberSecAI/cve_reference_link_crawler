Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28246:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of normalization of the URL protocol within the `trust` function in KaTeX. Specifically, the `context.protocol` value, which is passed to the user-defined trust function, is not converted to lowercase. This allows a bypass of security policies that attempt to block specific protocols by using uppercase characters within the protocol string (e.g., `JavaScript:` instead of `javascript:`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Case-sensitivity in protocol handling:** The code does not normalize the URL protocol to lowercase before checking it against a blocklist or allowlist defined in the `trust` function.
- **Bypass of trust function:**  Attackers can bypass the security checks in the `trust` function by providing URLs with uppercased protocols, which would be treated as different protocols by the vulnerable code. This defeats the intended security mechanism of the trust function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** By crafting a malicious URL with a `javascript:` protocol, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code if the `trust` function fails to block it due to case mismatch.
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** The ability to inject and execute JavaScript can lead to XSS vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to steal sensitive information, manipulate web pages, or redirect users.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious input:** The primary attack vector is through user-controlled input that includes URLs with manipulated (uppercased) protocols within the KaTeX rendering context, specifically with `\href` or `\url` commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to control the input that is processed by KaTeX. This could be in the form of user-submitted content, data read from external sources, or other methods depending on the application that uses KaTeX.
- The attacker needs to understand that the target application uses a trust function with a blocklist and is vulnerable to the case sensitivity issue.
- No special privileges are needed to exploit this.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in KaTeX versions >= 0.11.0 and < 0.16.10.
- The fix was implemented in version 0.16.10 by normalizing the protocol to lowercase before applying the trust checks.
- The provided commit details show the code changes to address this vulnerability, including:
   - Lowercasing the protocol in `src/utils.js`
   - Updating tests and snapshots to reflect the changes
- The severity is classified as Moderate with a CVSS score of 5.5
