  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A heap buffer overflow occurs in the `CIccXmlArrayType::ParseText` function due to a missing or incorrect bounds check within a parsing loop.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "The heap buffer overflow can lead to potential crashes or undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds memory access.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted XML file as input to the `iccFromXML` tool.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted XML file that, when parsed by the vulnerable function, causes a buffer overflow. No special privileges are required."
