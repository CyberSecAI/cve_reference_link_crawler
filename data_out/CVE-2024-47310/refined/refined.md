Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the ARI Fancy Lightbox WordPress plugin. This typically arises from insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data that is later output in a web page. The specific vulnerable area of the code is not provided.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into a website.
- When users visit the affected page, the injected scripts are executed in their browsers.
- The impact can vary depending on the specific script injected but could include session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would inject malicious scripts through a vulnerable entry point in the plugin. The specific vector is not provided but this is generally achieved by injecting malicious code into a field or parameter that is later displayed on the page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to find an entry point within the plugin that allows the injection of malicious code.
- The attacker typically does not need any special privileges beyond the ability to interact with a vulnerable part of the application and inject their malicious script. The provided content states that the required privilege is "Author".

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.5, with a low severity rating.
- The vulnerable versions are those equal to or less than 1.3.17.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.3.18.
- The vulnerability is classified as an injection vulnerability according to OWASP Top 10 (A3).
