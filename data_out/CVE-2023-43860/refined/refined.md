Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities described:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The core issue is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability present in multiple functions of the D-Link DIR-619L B1 2.02 firmware. This arises because the `websGetVar` function fetches the `curtime` parameter from user-supplied input (web page parameters) and uses `sprintf` to store this data on the stack without proper bounds checking.
*   **Weaknesses:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation on the `curtime` parameter. Specifically, the `sprintf` function, used to copy the input into a fixed-size stack buffer, does not verify the length of the input string.
*   **Impact:** The vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by overflowing the stack buffer. Although not explicitly mentioned, given that it is a stack overflow, it could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through specially crafted web page parameters, specifically by providing an overly long `curtime` parameter. This suggests that exploitation is possible through HTTP requests.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device, which typically means they must be on the same network as the device or have network access to the device's web interface. No authentication is mentioned in the provided text, which could mean that an unauthenticated attacker on the local network or, depending on the configuration, from the internet can trigger this vulnerability.

**Vulnerable Functions (as listed in the document):**

1.  `formSetWAN_Wizard534`
2.  `formSetWAN_Wizard55`
3.  `formSetWAN_Wizard56`
4.  `formSetWAN_Wizard7`
5.  `formSetWanDhcpplus`
6.  `formSetWanNonLogin`
7.  `formSetWanPPPoE`
8.  `formSetWanPPTP`
9.  `formSetWanL2TP`
10. `formLanguageChange`

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided document includes multiple Proof of Concept (POC) screenshots for each vulnerable function, demonstrating the vulnerability. These images show the HTTP request parameters with a large "curtime" value.
* The vulnerability is located in the web interface of the router, making it remotely exploitable if the web interface is exposed to the Internet.
