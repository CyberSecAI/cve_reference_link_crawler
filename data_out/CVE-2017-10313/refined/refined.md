Root cause of vulnerability: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Oracle MySQL database server.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
- Vulnerabilities in the MySQL server's pluggable authentication, replication, optimizer, full-text search (FTS), performance schema, stored procedure, InnoDB engine, data manipulation language (DML), group replication, Memcached, client programs and data definition language (DDL) components.
- Vulnerabilities related to Apache Tomcat.
- Vulnerabilities in MySQL connectors.
- Some of the vulnerabilities involve missing authorization checks or improper input validation.
- Vulnerabilities related to OpenSSL.

Impact of exploitation:
- Complete or partial denial of service (DoS).
- Unauthorized reading or modification of MySQL accessible data.
- In some instances, unauthorized modification of data or full access to the system is possible

Attack vectors:
- Network-based attacks.
- Exploitation via the MySQL protocol.
- Some vulnerabilities can be exploited via HTTP.
- Some vulnerabilities may be exploited locally.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Some vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable without authentication.
- Other vulnerabilities require a high level of privileges or interaction with the user or require the attacker to be on the same network or have local access.
