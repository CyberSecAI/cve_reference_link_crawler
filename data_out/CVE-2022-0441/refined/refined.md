{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not properly validate some parameters during new account registration, allowing unauthenticated users to register as administrators.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unauthenticated admin account creation",
    "Improper parameter validation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can create a new admin account without authentication, leading to complete control of the WordPress site.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is accessed via a POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They only require access to the website in order to send the malicious POST request. The nonce value must be retrieved from the ajax page. "
