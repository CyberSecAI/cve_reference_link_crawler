- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in FortiOS that allows admin users to elevate their profile to super\_admin by restoring modified configurations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Privilege escalation through restoring modified configurations.  The vulnerability occurs when a user's profile has both "Administrator Users" and "Maintenance" privileges set to "read-write". In VDOM mode, the profile scope must also be set to "global".
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an admin user to elevate their privileges to super\_admin.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack vector involves an admin user restoring modified configurations while their account has the vulnerable permissions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have admin access with a vulnerable profile configuration on the FortiOS device. Specifically, the "Administrator Users" and "Maintenance" privileges must be set to "read-write". In VDOM mode, the user's profile scope also needs to be set to "global".
