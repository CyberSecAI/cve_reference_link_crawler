- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application allows users to manage their own users, but a local authenticated user with this privilege can modify users outside of their own scope and escalate privileges due to improper access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Improper access control: The application does not properly restrict user management privileges, allowing users to modify accounts outside of their intended scope.
  - Privilege escalation: The vulnerability allows a local user to escalate their privileges to gain broader access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can modify user accounts and escalate privileges. This includes potentially gaining administrative privileges or access to sensitive data outside their intended scope.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user with the privilege to manage their own users.
