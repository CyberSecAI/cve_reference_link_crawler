Subject: 5 CVEs fixed in Go 1.22.1 and Go 1.21.8, 1 CVE fixed in
 google.golang.org/protobuf

<https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/5pwGVUPoMbg> announces the
releases of Go 1.22.1 and Go 1.21.8 containing fixes for 5 CVEs:

 >- crypto/x509: Verify panics on certificates with an unknown public key
 >  algorithm
 >
 >  Verifying a certificate chain which contains a certificate with an
 >  unknown public key algorithm will cause Certificate.Verify to panic.
 >
 >  This affects all crypto/tls clients, and servers that set Config.ClientAuth
 >  to VerifyClientCertIfGiven or RequireAndVerifyClientCert. The default
 >  behavior is for TLS servers to not verify client certificates.
 >
 >  Thanks to John Howard (Google) for reporting this issue.
 >
 >  This is CVE-2024-24783 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65390>.
 >
 >- net/http: memory exhaustion in Request.ParseMultipartForm
 >
 >  When parsing a multipart form (either explicitly with
 >  Request.ParseMultipartForm or implicitly with Request.FormValue,
 >  Request.PostFormValue, or Request.FormFile), limits on the total size of
 >  the parsed form were not applied to the memory consumed while reading a
 >  single form line. This permitted a maliciously crafted input containing
 >  very long lines to cause allocation of arbitrarily large amounts of memory,
 >  potentially leading to memory exhaustion.
 >
 >  ParseMultipartForm now correctly limits the maximum size of form lines.
 >
 >  Thanks to Bartek Nowotarski for reporting this issue.
 >
 >  This is CVE-2023-45290 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65383>.
 >
 >- net/http, net/http/cookiejar: incorrect forwarding of sensitive headers
 >  and cookies on HTTP redirect
 >
 >  When following an HTTP redirect to a domain which is not a subdomain match
 >  or exact match of the initial domain, an http.Client does not forward
 >  sensitive headers such as "Authorization" or "Cookie". For example, a
 >  redirect from foo.com to www.foo.com will forward the Authorization header,
 >  but a redirect to bar.com will not.
 >
 >  A maliciously crafted HTTP redirect could cause sensitive headers to be
 >  unexpectedly forwarded.
 >
 >  Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost for reporting this issue.
 >
 >  This is CVE-2023-45289 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65065>.
 >
 >- html/template: errors returned from MarshalJSON methods may break template
 >  escaping
 >
 >  If errors returned from MarshalJSON methods contain user controlled data,
 >  they may be used to break the contextual auto-escaping behavior of the
 >  html/template package, allowing for subsequent actions to inject unexpected
 >  content into templates.
 >
 >  Thanks to RyotaK (<https://ryotak.net>) for reporting this issue.
 >
 >  This is CVE-2024-24785 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65697>.
 >
 >- net/mail: comments in display names are incorrectly handled
 >
 >  The ParseAddressList function incorrectly handles comments (text within
 >  parentheses) within display names. Since this is a misalignment with
 >  conforming address parsers, it can result in different trust decisions
 >  being made by programs using different parsers.
 >
 >  Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost and Slonser
 >  (<https://github.com/Slonser>) for reporting this issue.
 >
 >  This is CVE-2024-24784 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65083>.

Separately, one more CVE fix was reported in
<https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/ArQ6CDgtEjY/m/oLMrdq_GBQAJ> :

 > Version v1.33.0  of the google.golang.org/protobuf module fixes a bug in
 > the google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson package which could cause
 > the Unmarshal function to enter an infinite loop when handling some invalid
 > inputs. This condition could only occur when unmarshaling into a message
 > which contains a google.protobuf.Any value, or when the
 > UnmarshalOptions.UnmarshalUnknown option is set. Unmarshal now correctly
 > returns an error when handling these inputs.
 >
 > This is CVE-2024-24786.

Though note the followup message on that page:

 > A small correction: This vulnerability applies when the
 > UnmarshalOptions.DiscardUnknown option is set (as well as when unmarshaling
 > into any message which contains a google.protobuf.Any). There is no
 > UnmarshalUnknown option.
 >
 > In addition, version 1.33.0 of google.golang.org/protobuf inadvertently
 > introduced an incompatibility with the older github.com/golang/protobuf
 > module. (<https://github.com/golang/protobuf/issues/1596>) Users of the older
 > module should update to <https://github.com/golang/protobuf/releases/tag/v1.5.4>

When deciding whether to forward cookies or sensitive headers
across a redirect, do not attempt to interpret an IPv6 address
as a domain name.

Avoids a case where a maliciously-crafted redirect to an
IPv6 address with a scoped addressing zone could be
misinterpreted as a within-domain redirect. For example,
we could interpret \"::1%.www.example.com\" as a subdomain
of \"www.example.com\".

# Vulnerability Report: GO-2024-2600

standard library

* CVE-2023-45289
* Affects:
  net/http, net/http/cookiejar
* Published: Mar 05, 2024
* Modified: May 20, 2024

When following an HTTP redirect to a domain which is not a subdomain match or exact match of the initial domain, an http.Client does not forward sensitive headers such as "Authorization" or "Cookie". For example, a redirect from foo.com to www.foo.com will forward the Authorization header, but a redirect to bar.com will not.
A maliciously crafted HTTP redirect could cause sensitive headers to be unexpectedly forwarded.

Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.22.1 and 1.21.8, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 5 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* crypto/x509: Verify panics on certificates with an unknown public key algorithm

  Verifying a certificate chain which contains a certificate with an unknown public

  key algorithm will cause Certificate.Verify to panic.

  This affects all crypto/tls clients, and servers that set Config.ClientAuth to

  VerifyClientCertIfGiven or RequireAndVerifyClientCert. The default behavior is

  for TLS servers to not verify client certificates.

  Thanks to John Howard (Google) for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2024-24783 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65390>.
* net/http: memory exhaustion in Request.ParseMultipartForm

  When parsing a multipart form (either explicitly with Request.ParseMultipartForm or implicitly with Request.FormValue, Request.PostFormValue, or Request.FormFile), limits on the total size of the parsed form were not applied to the memory consumed while reading a single form line. This permitted a maliciously crafted input containing very long lines to cause allocation of arbitrarily large amounts of memory, potentially leading to memory exhaustion.

  ParseMultipartForm now correctly limits the maximum size of form lines.

  Thanks to Bartek Nowotarski for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2023-45290 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65383>.
* net/http, net/http/cookiejar: incorrect forwarding of sensitive headers and cookies on HTTP redirect

  When following an HTTP redirect to a domain which is not a subdomain match or exact match of the initial domain, an http.Client does not forward sensitive headers such as "Authorization" or "Cookie". For example, a redirect from [foo.com](http://foo.com) to [www.foo.com](http://www.foo.com) will forward the Authorization header, but a redirect to [bar.com](http://bar.com) will not.

  A maliciously crafted HTTP redirect could cause sensitive headers to be unexpectedly forwarded.

  Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2023-45289 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65065>.
* html/template: errors returned from MarshalJSON methods may break template escaping

  If errors returned from MarshalJSON methods contain user controlled data, they

  may be used to break the contextual auto-escaping behavior of the html/template

  package, allowing for subsequent actions to inject unexpected content into

  templates.

  Thanks to RyotaK (<https://ryotak.net>) for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2024-24785 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65697>.
* net/mail: comments in display names are incorrectly handled

  The ParseAddressList function incorrectly handles comments (text within parentheses) within display names. Since this is a misalignment with conforming address parsers, it can result in different trust decisions being made by programs using different parsers.

  Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost and Slonser (<https://github.com/Slonser>) for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2024-24784 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65083>.

View the release notes for more information:

<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.22.1>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go website:

<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.22.1` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Michael and Carlos for the Go team
