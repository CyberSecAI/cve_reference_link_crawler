Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-7028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in the password reset functionality of GitLab. The system incorrectly processes the email address when multiple email addresses are provided in an array format, which is not the intended way to use the password reset form.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The system fails to validate and sanitize the format of the email address, allowing an attacker to submit an array of email addresses in the 'user[email]' field.
- **Incorrect Email Handling:** When multiple emails are included, the system mistakenly sends the password reset link to all emails within the array instead of only the user associated with the account.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** An attacker can gain complete control of a victim's GitLab account by resetting the password using a reset link sent to the attacker's email address. This allows the attacker to access sensitive data, modify configurations, and potentially compromise other linked services.
- **Lack of User Interaction:** The attack requires no interaction from the victim beyond having their email address known by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Password Reset Form:** The attack is executed through the standard "Forgot Your Password?" form on the GitLab login page.
- **Manipulated HTTP Request:** The attacker modifies the HTTP request using a tool like Burp Suite, changing the email parameter to include an array of emails (including attacker's address) within the JSON body of the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Target Email Address:** The attacker needs to know the email address associated with the victim's GitLab account.
- **Ability to Intercept HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests, using tools such as Burp Suite.
- **Access to a GitLab Instance:** The attacker requires access to a vulnerable GitLab instance.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported through HackerOne.
- GitLab versions 16.1 to 16.7.1 were affected by the issue.
- GitLab released patches to address this vulnerability.
