# Account Takeover via Password Reset without user interactions

## Report

##### Summary

I found a way to change the password of a GitLab account via the password reset form and successfully retrieve the final reset link without user interactions, using just its email address.

##### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to "[Forgot Your Password?](https://gitlab.com/users/password/new)" link
2. Then right-click on the HTTP Editor inside Burp Suite and select Extensions -> Content-Type Converter -> Convert to JSON (make sure to have the Content-Type Converter plugin installed from the BApp Store)
3. Enter the victim's email and intercept the submit request via Burp Suite .
4. Now replace this converted JSON line `"user[email]":"victim@gmail.com",` to
   ```
    "user": {
        "email": [
                 "victim@gmail.com",
                 "attacker@gmail.com"
          ]
    },
   ```
5. Forward the requests and you should get an email containing the reset link that was send to both emails (victim@gmail.com and attacker@gmail.com) .
6. Click on the reset link, change the password and done, you can now login as the victim using the new password.

#### Impact

By just knowing the victim email address used on GitLab, you can takeover his account by changing his password without user interaction since the attacker get the same email as the victim.
