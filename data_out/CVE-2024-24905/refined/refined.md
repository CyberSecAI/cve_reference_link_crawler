Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-24905:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the Dell Secure Connect Gateway (SCG) Policy Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application allows a high-privileged attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the application's data store. This malicious code is then executed in the victim's browser when the victim accesses the data store.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could lead to:
    *   Information disclosure
    *   Session theft
    *   Client-side request forgery

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Adjacent Network:** The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable system.
*   **High Privileges:** The attacker requires high privileges within the Dell Secure Connect Gateway (SCG) Policy Manager.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim must access the stored malicious code through their browser for the XSS payload to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have high-privileged access to the Dell Secure Connect Gateway (SCG) Policy Manager.
*   The attacker must be positioned on the same network as the vulnerable system.

**Summary of CVE-2024-24905:**

CVE-2024-24905 is a Stored XSS vulnerability in the Dell Secure Connect Gateway (SCG) Policy Manager. A high-privileged attacker on the same network can inject malicious code into the application's data store, which executes in the browser of a victim accessing the same data. This could lead to information theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions on behalf of the user.
