# Insufficient escaping of whitespace

High

[ericcornelissen](/ericcornelissen)
published
GHSA-44vr-rwwj-p88h
Jul 15, 2022

## Package

npm

shescape
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>=1.4.0 < 1.5.8

## Patched versions

1.5.8

## Description

### Impact

This only impacts users that use the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions with the `interpolation` option set to `true`. Example:

```
import cp from "node:child_process";
import * as shescape from "shescape";

// 1. Prerequisites
const options = {
  shell: "bash",
  // Or
  shell: "dash",
  // Or
  shell: "powershell.exe",
  // Or
  shell: "zsh",
  // Or
  shell: undefined, // Only if the default shell is one of the affected shells.
};

// 2. Attack (one of multiple)
const payload = "foo #bar";

// 3. Usage
let escapedPayload;
shescape.escape(payload, { interpolation: true });
// Or
shescape.escapeAll(payload, { interpolation: true });

cp.execSync(`echo Hello ${escapedPayload}!`, options);
// _Output depends on the shell being used_
```

The result is that if an attacker is able to include whitespace in their input they can:

1. Invoke shell-specific behaviour through shell-specific special characters inserted directly after whitespace.
   * Affected shells: *Bash*, *Dash*, *Zsh*, *PowerShell*
2. Invoke shell-specific behaviour through shell-specific special characters inserted or appearing after line terminating characters.
   * Affected shells: *Bash*
3. Invoke arbitrary commands by inserting a line feed character.
   * Affected Shells: *Bash*, *Dash*, *Zsh*, *PowerShell*
4. Invoke arbitrary commands by inserting a carriage return character.
   * Affected Shells: *PowerShell*

### Patches

Behaviour number 1 has been patched in [v1.5.7](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.5.7) which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required.

Behaviour number 2, 3, and 4 have been patched in [v1.5.8](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.5.8) which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required.

### Workarounds

The best workaround is to avoid having to use the `interpolation: true` option - in most cases using an alternative is possible, see [the recipes](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape#recipes) for recommendations.

Alternatively, you can strip all whitespace from user input. Note that this is error prone, for example: for PowerShell this requires stripping `'\u0085'` which is not included in JavaScript's definition of `\s` for Regular Expressions.
