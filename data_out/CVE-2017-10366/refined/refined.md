  {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Deserialization vulnerability in the monitor service.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The PeopleSoft monitor service is vulnerable to remote code execution due to insecure deserialization of Java objects.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server where PeopleSoft is running.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/monitor/%SITE_NAME%` endpoint, containing a serialized Java object payload.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the PeopleSoft server. The attacker needs to know or brute-force the PeopleSoft site name."
