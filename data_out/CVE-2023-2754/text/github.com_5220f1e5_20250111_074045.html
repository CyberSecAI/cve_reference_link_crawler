# Plaintext transmission of DNS requests in Windows 1.1.1.1 WARP client

High

[ncabetecf](/ncabetecf)
published
GHSA-mv6g-7577-vq4w
Aug 3, 2023

## Package

Cloudflare WARP Client
(Windows)

## Affected versions

<2023.7.160.0

## Patched versions

2023.7.160.0 (stable)

## Description

### Impact

The Cloudflare WARP client for Windows assigns loopback IPv4 addresses for the DNS Servers, since WARP acts as local DNS server that performs DNS queries in a secure manner, however, if a user is connected to WARP over an IPv6-capable network, te WARP client did not assign loopback IPv6 addresses but Unique Local Addresses, which under certain conditions could point towards unknown devices in the same local network which enables an Attacker to view DNS queries made by the device.

**Requirements**

* The victim's device would need to be connected to a rogue Wi-Fi network, that announces support for IPv6, and assigns itself the same IPv6 address that WARP Client sets the IPv6 DNS server as.

### Patches

Version 2023.7.160.0 for WARP Client (Windows)

### Workarounds

Disabling IPv6 support in local devices

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
