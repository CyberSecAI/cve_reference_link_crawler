{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Cloudflare WARP client for Windows, when connected over an IPv6 network, incorrectly assigned Unique Local Addresses for IPv6 DNS servers instead of loopback addresses.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Plaintext transmission of DNS requests due to the client not using loopback IPv6 addresses, enabling potential interception of DNS queries."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially view DNS queries made by a device if they are on the same local network, especially on a rogue Wi-Fi network that announces IPv6 support and has the same IPv6 address configured as the DNS server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attack via a rogue Wi-Fi network with IPv6 support."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the victim, control the network (e.g., a rogue Wi-Fi hotspot), have knowledge of the IPv6 address that the WARP client is configured to use, and be in a position to capture network traffic. The network must announce support for IPv6."
