### Impact

These vulnerabilities can be exploited by unauthenticated remote

attackers on the same broadcast domain (local network) and, in some

cases, by attackers on remote networks. They are exploitable on systems

that have the PXE boot option enabled. Although this option is disabled

by default, it is very common to see it enabled on server nodes in

datacenters and HPC environments. We also have reports that some laptop

computes have PXE boot enabled by default, although as the last option

in the boot order.

The impact of these vulnerabilities include denial of service,

information leakage, remote code execution, DNS cache poisoning and

network session hijacking. Exploitation of bugs 02, 06 and 07 for remote

code execution is deemed straight forward as EDK2 does not officially

employ mitigations such as stack cookies or address space layout

randomization.

### Mitigation release plan

Patch files for vulnerabilities 1-7 are available now via <https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4518>. These patches were integrated in the Feb 2024 EDK2 release ([edk2-stable202402](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/releases/tag/edk2-stable202402)).

Patch files for vulnerabilities 8-9 are available now via <https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4541> and <https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4542>. These patches were integrated in the May 2024 EDK2 release ([edk2-stable202405](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/releases/tag/edk2-stable202405)).

We are not aware of any exploits for vulnerabilities 8 and 9, either in the wild or in the lab. Exposure is limited to PXE boot or HTTP boot on an untrusted network, which is not a recommended usage for the UEFI network stack.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
