| This has been fixed, thank you. It is caused by inconsistent MCU sizes. |

| Have you built libjpeg with address sanitizer? The heap-overflow is detectable by address sanitizer.  I build it this way:  ``` ./configure CC="gcc -fsanitize=address" CXX="g++ -fsanitize=address" make  ``` |

The issue is that the affected codestream communicates two incompatible MCU sizes, and the upsampler allocates using one size, though uses then a different size. This cannot work. Unfortunately, the description of the hierarchical process in the specs is so sketchy, it's hard to make a robust implementation from it. Nobody had much interest in this process back then. |
