The provided content relates to a race condition vulnerability in the DisplayPort (DP) driver within the Linux kernel, specifically within the `dp_aux_isr` function.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `dp_aux_isr` function, which handles interrupts related to DisplayPort auxiliary (AUX) channel transactions, was prematurely completing `dp_aux_cmd_fifo_tx()` even when the interrupt was not related to an AUX transaction. This occurred because the function did not verify if the interrupt was for aux read/write before completing the transaction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Race Condition:** A race condition existed where the `dp_aux_isr` function might complete `dp_aux_cmd_fifo_tx()` prematurely.
- **Incorrect Interrupt Handling:** The interrupt service routine was not properly checking the interrupt source and was always completing the aux transaction, even if it was not an aux related interrupt.
- **Premature Data Retrieval:** The premature completion of the aux command could cause the driver to read data from the aux hardware buffer before the sink had completed transferring all data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Corruption:** The primary impact of this vulnerability was data corruption during AUX transactions. Specifically, when reading data from the DisplayPort AUX channel, the host's receiving buffer could contain unexpected and incomplete data.
- **EDID Corruption:** A specific case of this data corruption was observed during system boot, where the Extended Display Identification Data (EDID) was corrupted. This could prevent the system from correctly identifying the connected display, resulting in display issues.
- **System Instability**: EDID corruption can lead to other system instability issues

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by specific interrupt timing during DisplayPort AUX transactions.
- The attacker would need to trigger a non-aux related interrupt while an aux transfer is in progress.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No specific attacker position is needed; the vulnerability is exploitable on a system that is actively using a DisplayPort connection.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger other types of DisplayPort interrupts (e.g., VIDEO_READY) while an AUX transaction is ongoing.
