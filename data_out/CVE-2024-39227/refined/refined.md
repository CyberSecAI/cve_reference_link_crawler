{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `glc` binary does not properly sanitize the JSON data it receives, allowing path traversal sequences such as `../` within the `object` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Path traversal vulnerability",
    "Insufficient input sanitization",
    "Direct access via HTTP to /cgi-bin/glc"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution, manipulation of the router.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending crafted HTTP requests to `/cgi-bin/glc` with path traversal sequences in the `object` parameter.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Network access to the vulnerable device."
