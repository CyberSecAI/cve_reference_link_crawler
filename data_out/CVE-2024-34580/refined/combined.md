# Exploited Ivanti Connect SSRF vulnerability traced back to 'xmltooling' OSS library

February 05, 2024

Over the past few weeks, vulnerabilities in proprietary Ivanti products, in particular Ivanti Connect Secure, Policy Secure, and ZTA gateways, have [been making headlines](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ivanti-warns-of-new-connect-secure-zero-day-exploited-in-attacks/) for their active exploitation in the wild.

Last month, U.S. CISA issued its first [emergency directive](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-emergency-directive-mitigate-ivanti-zero-days-immediately/) for 2024 asking federal agencies to promptly mitigate Ivanti zero-days, primarily in response to mass exploitation of these vulnerabilities by different threat actors. After all, just as of last week, Shodan listed upwards of 22,000 internet-exposed Ivanti devices, and Shadowserver tracked more than [460 compromised Ivanti VPNs](https://twitter.com/Shadowserver/status/1749390385346994613) as of January 30, 2024. Threat actors [continue to target](https://twitter.com/Shadowserver/status/1754145361029960189) vulnerable devices as of today.

![Internet-exposed Ivanti appliances](https://www.sonatype.com/hs-fs/hubfs/DevSecOpsDays.com%20master/Imported_Blog_Media/Shodan%20-%20Internet-exposed%20Ivanti%20appliances.jpg?width=749&height=279&name=Shodan%20-%20Internet-exposed%20Ivanti%20appliances.jpg)
## xmltooling: The open source connection

It might be a little known fact that one of the high severity zero-days found in Ivanti devices is actually present in an open source component that the company has deployed in its products. The average modern application contains anywhere [between 128](https://www.sonatype.com/hubfs/Q3%202021-State%20of%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chain-Report/SSSC-Report-2021_0913_PM_2.pdf) and [500](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/dependency-problems-increase-for-open-source-components) open source [dependencies](/resources/articles/what-are-software-dependencies), and Ivanti's proprietary products, that also use OSS components, are no exception.

Tracked as [CVE-2024-21893](https://attackerkb.com/topics/FGlK1TVnB2/cve-2024-21893/rapid7-analysis), the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the SAML component used by Ivanti Connect Secure, Policy Secure, and ZTA gateways can be exploited by threat actors to access restricted resources without authentication.

Thanks to [Assetnote's](https://www.assetnote.io/resources/research/ivantis-pulse-connect-secure-auth-bypass-round-two) Dylan Pindur and Rapid7's principal security researcher, Stephen Fewer, we now know that CVE-2024-21893 is an alias for [CVE-2023-36661](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36661) — an SSRF vulnerability present in the open source Shibboleth 'xmltooling' library, which was disclosed in June 2023.

"The SSRF, as we found it, is actually an n-day in the xmltooling library, patched out around June 2023 and assigned CVE-2023-36661," [writes](https://twitter.com/stephenfewer/status/1753507673742405636) Fewer. "The SSRF can be chained to [CVE-2024-21887](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21887) for unauthenticated command injection with root privileges."

CVE-2023-36661 is a high-severity SSRF flaw present in the Shibboleth XMLTooling versions prior to 3.2.4, as used in OpenSAML and Shibboleth Service Provider.

Shibboleth's [official advisory](https://shibboleth.net/community/advisories/secadv_20230612.txt) notes that the flaw can be exploited by threat actors including malicious content in the KeyInfo element of the input XML that gets parsed by the library. The problematic URI, in such a case, will get resolved by the shibd process resulting in either Denial of Service (DoS) and possibly "more serious vulnerabilities."

A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) [exploit](https://attackerkb.com/topics/FGlK1TVnB2/cve-2024-21893/rapid7-analysis) shared by Rapid7, for example, demonstrates how this SSRF flaw can be leveraged by threat actors who may additionally chain it with other vulnerabilities to obtain unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) on vulnerable Ivanti Connect Secure appliances:

![](https://www.sonatype.com/hs-fs/hubfs/DevSecOpsDays.com%20master/Imported_Blog_Media/image-png-Feb-05-2024-08-35-02-2870-AM.png?width=1666&height=510&name=image-png-Feb-05-2024-08-35-02-2870-AM.png)![](https://www.sonatype.com/hs-fs/hubfs/DevSecOpsDays.com%20master/Imported_Blog_Media/image-png-Feb-05-2024-08-37-25-4085-AM.png?width=1676&height=622&name=image-png-Feb-05-2024-08-37-25-4085-AM.png)

## Mitigations for the xmltooling flaw

Shibboleth patched CVE-2023-36661 in xmltooling v3.2.4 and above last year, but warned at the time that "this issue is not specific to the V3 XMLTooling software and is believed to impact all versions prior to v3.2.4."

The project has addressed the flaw by restricting resolution of unsafe URIs present in the XML input by adding a "BlockingXSECURIResolver" class as a part of the fix, that should thwart exploits like the one shown above.

![](https://www.sonatype.com/hs-fs/hubfs/DevSecOpsDays.com%20master/Imported_Blog_Media/image-png-Feb-05-2024-07-59-25-4275-AM.png?width=1570&height=586&name=image-png-Feb-05-2024-07-59-25-4275-AM.png)

Note, fixed v3.2.4 and higher of the XMLTooling (C++) library do not (yet) exist on the [Fedora/EPEL](https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=9386) repository. As such, it may be wiser for users relying on the repository for the xmltooling component to manually incorporate the [fix commit](https://git.shibboleth.net/view/?p=cpp-xmltooling.git;a=commitdiff;h=6080f6343f98fec085bc0fd746913ee418cc9d30) (where applicable) provided on the upstream repository to patch the flaw. According to the project, the commit may also be "in general terms applicable to V2 of the library."

![](https://www.sonatype.com/hs-fs/hubfs/DevSecOpsDays.com%20master/Imported_Blog_Media/image-png-Feb-05-2024-08-26-36-4931-AM.png?width=1350&height=806&name=image-png-Feb-05-2024-08-26-36-4931-AM.png)

Upgrading the component on Linux and similar platforms will additionally require restarting the shibd process to mitigate the flaw. Shibboleth's Service Provider Windows software v3.4.1.3 and higher also contain patched version of the library.

Ivanti's ongoing vulnerability disclosures — this one in particular, underlines the importance of employing automation for streamlining your dependency and artifact management needs as well as for preventing known vulnerable components from entering your software builds.

Security expert Will Dormann further unveiled dated open source components used by Ivanti VPN appliances as recent as 2023, hinting at other known vulnerabilities that may be exploitable in these devices.

"This is just a spot check of a few execuables on the system. I didn't even look at any of the libraries," [writes](https://twitter.com/wdormann/status/1754582569490788742) Dormann. "If customers knew what they were purchasing, do you think they'd go through with the purchase? Imagine a complete SBOM for everything on the box..."

# Apache XML Security for C++ Library Allows for Server-Side Request Forgery

April 9, 2024

##### Mandiant

Written by: Jacob Thompson

---

The Apache XML Security for C++ library, code named `xml-security-c`, is part of the Apache Santuario project. The library implements the XML Digital Signature and the XML Signature specifications, making them available to C++ developers. By default, the library resolves references to external URIs passed in Extensible Markup Language (XML) signatures, allowing for server-side request forgery (SSRF). There is no way to disable this feature through configuration alone, and there is no patch available; the developer must either scan their codebase to find every usage of `xml-security-c` and override the URI resolver to avoid SSRF, or manually patch and recompile the library to remove the capability entirely. We recommend that C++ developers using XML audit their code bases for usage of this library and determine whether they have introduced a security vulnerability, and if so, modify their code to avoid SSRF.

## Background

Server-side request forgery (SSRF) is a class of security vulnerability in which an untrusted party tricks a server into making an HTTP request by passing the server a malicious input. Although the attacker usually cannot view the response, requests to the loopback interface (`127.0.0.1`), RFC 1918 addresses (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8` or `192.168.0.0/16`), or any other destination occur from the point of view of the server, allowing requests that would otherwise be restricted by firewall rules or that would be impossible to perform externally. Consider the obvious consequences if a server's uninterruptible power supply offers a web service bound to `127.0.0.1:8080` without authentication and that accepts a GET request `http://127.0.0.1:8080/ups/changePowerState?state=off`—and what happens if this service is reachable via server-side request forgery.

The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is complex and contains many optional features that are not suitable or even useful in the common case of a server accepting untrusted XML documents on an external interface. Some allow cross-site request forgery just by initializing an XML parser in its default configuration and passing an untrusted document. For example, XML External Entities allow a document to define custom entity values (analogous to `&lt;` meaning `<` in HTML) to be replaced by the response from an external URL or the contents of a local file rather than a static string. Despite no real-world relevance to a server accepting and parsing untrusted, potentially malicious documents, this feature was enabled by default in many parsers and plagued the 2010s decade; XML External Entity Injection was promoted to an item in the [OWASP Top Ten in 2017](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/Top_10). Current versions of many XML parsers have now been hardened to treat support for external entities, document-type definitions, schemas, and so forth as an opt-in feature that is disabled by default. In this post, we present a different form of server-side request forgery affecting XML documents. We have found this issue being actively exploited; it was recently addressed by Ivanti in [CVE-2024-21893](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21893).

## XML Signatures External URI Feature

The XML Signature specification standardizes a way to digitally sign XML documents. The specification includes features that, from a security perspective, introduce additional paths to server-side request forgery into XML, beyond XML External Entity Injection. The [XML Signature Syntax and Processing Version 2.0 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core2/#sec-URI) states that "We RECOMMEND XML Signature applications be able to dereference URIs in the HTTP scheme," which, absent other protections such as egress firewall rules, allows for SSRF. This recommendation is carried over from [version 1.1 of the specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core1/#sec-URI) and therefore version 1.x signatures are also affected.

Figure 1 shows a simple XML document that, when parsed by `xml-security-c` version 2.0.4 and earlier, causes the parser to make an HTTP request to `http://www.example.com/ssrf`.

Figure 1: Sample XML document to trigger SSRF in affected xml-security-c library

## Prior Work

Other open-source projects have already identified and modified their software to work around this issue. The Shibboleth `xmltooling` project reported a server-side request forgery vulnerability as CVE-2023-36661 and [implemented a workaround](https://git.shibboleth.net/view/?p=cpp-xmltooling.git;a=blobdiff;f=xmltooling/XMLToolingConfig.cpp;h=dd5634d8055c9cb971cc99e5b1e5fc56a76c595f;hp=4bd5b11a0ca688f0b8fa2ed1b4997038202e4314;hb=6080f6343f98fec085bc0fd746913ee418cc9d30;hpb=40dcc327cd67e9e84f95b4f19087eae2397958b1) in the `xmltooling` code to override the default, non-secure URI resolver in `xml-security-c` with a custom one that does nothing. While this mitigation is sufficient to resolve the issue in `xmltooling`—so long as every possible instance of `xml-security-c` is located and fixed—the root cause arguably lies in the `xml-security-c` library not being [secure by default](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign). Fixing the issue in `xmltooling` rather than upstream did not help other users of `xml-security-c` who were not aware of the need to reconfigure it.

Dangerous XML features such as the ability to make external network requests just by parsing a document should, in our view, be disabled in the default configuration and then only enabled when parsing documents from a trusted source. In fact, a different library under the Apache Santuario project, Apache XML Security for Java, has a "[secure validation](https://santuario.apache.org/javafaq.html#java_faq-4.SecureValidation)" feature that is enabled by default. Among other characteristics, the secure validation feature "[d]oes not allow a Reference to call the ResolverLocalFilesystem or the ResolverDirectHTTP (references to local files and HTTP resources are forbidden)." Thus, Java developers, unlike C++ developers, are already protected against SSRF in the default configuration of the Java port of the library. The secure validation feature never made it to the C++ version.

## Disclosure

Mandiant reported the non-secure default configuration in `xml-security-c` to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). As external URI resolution is a legitimate feature in the XML Digital Signature specification, the ASF did not issue a CVE or a new release of `xml-security-c`.  The Apache Santuario project did add a [new disclaimer](https://santuario.apache.org/cindex.html) for `xml-security-c` shown in Figure 2, suggesting that XML Signatures and XML Encryption are difficult to implement securely; that `xml-security-c` is not secure by default and does not provide hardening configuration options; and that the library is not modular, making it difficult to ever add such features. Going forward, Apache Santuario is no longer supported as a standalone library, and the Shibboleth project will be taking over the project as a component of Shibboleth only. The developers suggest finding another solution.

Figure 2: Apache Santuario added a disclaimer suggesting to not use the xml-security-c library

## Recommendations

C++ developers should first scan their projects to determine if they use the Apache `xml-security-c` library. If so, the software may have a server-side request forgery vulnerability unless the code is patched.

In some cases, usage of `xml-security-c` may be very limited, or it may be inconvenient to recompile the library when it is obtained in binary form. If developers can pinpoint each use of the `XSECProvider` class, they can call the `setDefaultURIResolver` method on the `XSECProvider` object, passing a custom implementation of `XSECURIResolver` that simply does nothing. This avoids the need to recompile `xml-security-c` and ensures the software remains secure if it is ever linked against the stock `xml-security-c`.

An alternative, and in our view superior approach, is to patch the `xml-security-c` library to make it secure by default with regard to URI resolution. Mandiant developed a patch to supersede the vulnerable `XSECURIResolverXerces` with a new default `XSECURIResolverNoop` that does nothing, thus fixing the SSRF. By applying the patch and recompiling, the library will not be susceptible to this form of SSRF. Note that any legitimate uses of external URIs would need to be changed to manually specify `XSECURIResolverXerces` as the default URI resolver.

The [patch is available for download now](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/xml-security-c-2.0.4.patch.zip) (note: the download is a ZIP file, which contains the patch as a TXT file).

# Notes on [CVE-2024-21893](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21893)

## Summary

A vulnerability created partly by a specification is inherited through a supply chain by Ivanti VPN product(s).

CVE-2024-21893: SSRF in "...Ivanti Connect Secure (9.x, 22.x) and Ivanti Policy Secure (9.x, 22.x) and Ivanti Neurons for ZTA." This is due to using (at the time, an unpatched or out-of-date version of) Shibboleth XMLTooling, and arguably could been framed as "These Ivanti products are vulnerable to CVE-2023-36661" instead of assigning a new CVE ID.

CVE-2023-36661: "Shibboleth XMLTooling before 3.2.4, as used in OpenSAML and Shibboleth Service Provider, allows SSRF via a crafted KeyInfo element." [[secadv\_20239612.txt](https://shibboleth.net/community/advisories/secadv_20230612.txt)] This is due partly to use of Apache XML Security for C++, maintenance of which is being transfered to Shibboleth. [[XML Security for C++ announcement](https://santuario.apache.org/cindex.html)]

CVE-2024-34580: Apache XML Security for C++, originally developed and maintained by the Apache Santuario project, implements the XML-Signature Syntax and Processing specification, including a recommended but optional mechanism by which to retrieve key information from a remote URL. Google has provided a [patch](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/xml-security-c-2.0.4.patch.zip) in their much more [comprehensive write up](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/apache-library-allows-server-side-request-forgery) of this issue.

CVE-2024-34581: The XML-Signature Syntax and Processing specification (RFC 3275) includes a recommended but optional mechanism by which to retrieve key information from a remote URL. An [XML Signature Best Practices Working Group Note](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-xmldsig-bestpractices-20130411/) dated 2013-04-11 points out SSRF-related security concerns in Best Practice 7. [XML Signature Syntax and Processing Version 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core2/#sec-RetrievalMethod) (dated 2015-07-23) notes that "The KeyInfoReference element is preferred over use of RetrievalMethod as it avoids use of Transform child elements that introduce security risk and implementation challenges."

CVE-2024-34581 creates a significant opportunity for implementations, by default, to create SSRF vulnerabilities. CVE-2024-34580 propagates this issue by implementing the specification faithfully. In CVE-2023-36661, SSRF is addressed in a downstream implementation. CVE-2024-21893 appears to be a matter of using an out-of-date library that is still vulnerable to CVE-2023-36661, but it's hard to say for certain.

Verify releases It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded files using the PGP signatures. Digest verification ensures the file was not corrupted or tampered with but provides no real verification of authenticity. PGP verification ensures that the file is authentic. In practice, PGP verification is **much** more important and makes checksum verification redundant. PGP Signature The PGP signatures can be verified using [PGP](http://www.pgpi.org/) or [GPG](http://www.gnupg.org/). First download the Apache Santuario [KEYS](https://downloads.apache.org/santuario/KEYS) as well as the \*.asc signature file for the particular distribution. It is important that you get these files from the ultimate trusted source - the main ASF distribution site, rather than from a mirror. Then verify the signatures using:  ``` % pgpk -a KEYS % pgpv xml-security-bin-1_4_4.zip.asc  or % pgp -ka KEYS % pgp xml-security-bin-1_4_4.zip.asc  or % gpg --import KEYS % gpg --verify xml-security-bin-1_4_4.zip.asc  ``` Checksums To verify the SHA checksum on the files, you need to use a program called sha1sum (or sha256sum, etc.), which is included in many unix distributions. It is also available as part of [GNU Textutils](http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/textutils.html). Windows users can get binary digest programs from [here](http://www.slavasoft.com/fsum/) or an openssl client from [here](http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html).  ``` % sha1sum xml-security-X.Y.tar.gz   ... output should match the string in xml-security-X.Y.tar.gz.sha1  ```  We strongly recommend you verify your downloads with PGP. | | --- | --- | |  | |

NOTE: The below applies solely to the C++ code base formerly hosted under the Apache Santuario project. The Java xmlsec library remains an active project there and the warnings below do NOT apply to it.

## TL;DR

The C++ xml-security-c library has been retired at Apache and is now solely maintained by the Shibboleth Project for our use only. Use by any other project, while permitted freely under the license, is ill-advised and unsupported by the Shibboleth Project. While we continue to publish a fork of the code in our repository, and will accept [bug reports](https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/CPPXSEC "https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/CPPXSEC") and certainly security reports, we do not promise any responsiveness to third parties, and urge that no other projects rely on this code. Existing users should seek alternatives or consider forking the code for their own use.

## Longer version

The Apache Santuario project is the home of the Java xmlsec library, and formerly hosted the C++ version (xml-security-c). The C++ version is the basis of the security code in the Shibboleth SP software.

After about a decade of no other committers appearing to help maintain that code, and no response to a call for objections, a decision was taken by the Santuario PMC to retire the C++ library. If you have concerns or objections over this, you are directed to register those concerns with the Apache Santuario project.

The only maintainer (us) expects to retire our usage within the coming 5-7 years at most, and retiring the Apache version and forking the code for our use allows us to more clearly signal that no other projects should consider adopting this code without also choosing to fork it for their own use. It also frees us from the obligation to make changes in response to others' needs, or to address issues that do not impact our use of the code. In fact this may result in a major revision of the library to exclude features we do not use and were thus unable to maintain to begin with. (Examples of this include the NSS and Windows crypto support, XSLT and XPath support via Xalan, and XKMS support.)

As the longtime maintainer of the original library, we have taken the liberty of retaining the library name and versioning history, and we have converted the original subversion repository to support this. Others choosing to fork the code should rename it for their own use. The Apache license attached to the code remains the same, and we seek no changes to either copyright or license in this transition.
