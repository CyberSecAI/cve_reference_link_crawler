Obtain the Apache Santuario™ distribution The **Apache Santuario™** project is aimed at providing implementation of the primary security standards for XML.  Apache XML Security for Java - This library includes a mature Digital Signature and Encryption implementation. It also includes the standard JSR 105 (Java XML Digital Signature) API. Applications can use the standard JSR 105 API or the Apache Santuario API to create and validate XML Signatures. to download Use the links below to download a distribution of Apache Santuario from one of our mirrors. It is good practice to verify the integrity of the distribution files.

Verify releases It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded files using the PGP signatures. Digest verification ensures the file was not corrupted or tampered with but provides no real verification of authenticity. PGP verification ensures that the file is authentic. In practice, PGP verification is **much** more important and makes checksum verification redundant. PGP Signature The PGP signatures can be verified using [PGP](http://www.pgpi.org/) or [GPG](http://www.gnupg.org/). First download the Apache Santuario [KEYS](https://downloads.apache.org/santuario/KEYS) as well as the \*.asc signature file for the particular distribution. It is important that you get these files from the ultimate trusted source - the main ASF distribution site, rather than from a mirror. Then verify the signatures using:  ``` % pgpk -a KEYS % pgpv xml-security-bin-1_4_4.zip.asc  or % pgp -ka KEYS % pgp xml-security-bin-1_4_4.zip.asc  or % gpg --import KEYS % gpg --verify xml-security-bin-1_4_4.zip.asc  ``` Checksums To verify the SHA checksum on the files, you need to use a program called sha1sum (or sha256sum, etc.), which is included in many unix distributions. It is also available as part of [GNU Textutils](http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/textutils.html). Windows users can get binary digest programs from [here](http://www.slavasoft.com/fsum/) or an openssl client from [here](http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html).  ``` % sha1sum xml-security-X.Y.tar.gz   ... output should match the string in xml-security-X.Y.tar.gz.sha1  ```  We strongly recommend you verify your downloads with PGP. | | --- | --- | |  | |
