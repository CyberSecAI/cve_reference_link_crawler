Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1582:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `wpgmza` shortcode of the WP Go Maps (formerly WP Google Maps) plugin. Specifically, the `classname` attribute of the shortcode was not properly sanitized, allowing the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious scripts can be injected via the `classname` attribute of the `wpgmza` shortcode and stored in the WordPress database. When a page containing the injected shortcode is viewed, the malicious script executes in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Account Takeover:** Attackers could potentially steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers insert the malicious XSS payload using the vulnerable `classname` attribute of the `wpgmza` shortcode.
- **Web Page Access:** The injected code executes when a user views the web page containing the malicious shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site, allowing them to create or edit posts/pages and insert the malicious shortcode.

**Additional Details (from provided content):**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of WP Go Maps up to and including 9.0.32.
- The patched version is 9.0.33, which includes fixes to sanitize the shortcode attributes by using `esc_attr()`.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Richard Telleng of Wordfence.
- There was also another XSS vulnerability fixed within this changeset related to the Custom CSS Block.
- The changeset also made improvements to shortcode attribute security by escaping attributes further based on recent security reports.
