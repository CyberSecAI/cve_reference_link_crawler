Based on the provided data, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `mtk_drm_gem_init` function in the MediaTek DRM driver lacked a check to ensure that the size of the Graphics Execution Manager (GEM) object being allocated was not zero. This resulted in a kernel panic when a userspace application tried to create a zero-sized GEM buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation: The driver did not validate the size of the GEM object before attempting allocation.
- Kernel panic: Attempting to allocate a zero-sized GEM object led to a kernel panic, which can cause a denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: A malicious or buggy userspace application could trigger a kernel panic by attempting to allocate a zero-sized GEM object, leading to a system crash and denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Userspace application: An attacker could craft a userspace application to call the DRM ioctl that attempts to allocate a GEM object with size 0.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute code in userspace: The attacker needs to be able to run code that can interact with the DRM subsystem through ioctls.

**Additional notes:**
The fix adds a check to return `-EINVAL` if `size` is 0, preventing the kernel panic. The vulnerability was tested by attempting to allocate a 0x0 GBM buffer on an MT8188 and verifying that the driver now returns `EINVAL`. This patch was backported to numerous stable kernel branches.
