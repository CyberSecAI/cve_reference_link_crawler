Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the `idno` parameter in the `listofcourse.php` file of the "Online Student Enrollment System Project In PHP".
*   The application directly uses the `idno` parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code through the `idno` parameter.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable using both boolean-based and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain access to the database without proper authorization.
*   **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information stored in the database.
*   **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
*   **System Control:** Attackers could potentially gain comprehensive control over the system.
*   **Service Interruption:** Attackers could cause service disruptions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable through the `idno` parameter in the `listofcourse.php` file.
*   Attackers can manipulate the `idno` parameter in the URL to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No specific user privileges are mentioned, suggesting the vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Lanxiy7th.
*   The affected software is "Online Student Enrollment System Project In PHP" version 1.0.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited using SQLMap.
*   The provided screenshots showcase the use of SQLMap to extract database information.
*   The suggested fixes include using prepared statements, input validation, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.
