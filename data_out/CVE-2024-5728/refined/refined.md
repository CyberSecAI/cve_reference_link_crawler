- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back into the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites. The vulnerability is particularly dangerous when exploited against high-privilege users such as administrators.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL containing a script in the `pid` parameter, specifically within the `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=animated_al_show&active=0&pid=[MALICIOUS_SCRIPT]` path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to trick a user into clicking a specially crafted URL. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
