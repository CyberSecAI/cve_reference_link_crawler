Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-16739:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the web interface's file browser functionality. Specifically, directory traversal is possible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The file browser, intended for displaying file server content, allows reading, writing, and listing files/directories outside the designated file server directory.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `fileread`, `filewrite`, and `sdstate` endpoints do not properly validate file paths, allowing attackers to use `../../` or absolute paths to access arbitrary locations on the file system.
*   **Root Privileges:** The file browser operations are performed with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read/Write:** Attackers can read any file on the system, including sensitive configuration files and user data. Attackers can also write arbitrary files to the system, potentially overwriting existing files or injecting malicious code.
*   **Command Execution:** By writing a malicious script to the CGI scripts directory and then executing it via the web interface, an attacker can achieve remote code execution with root privileges.
*   **Complete System Takeover:** Attackers can achieve complete control over the camera, allowing them to modify its configuration, disable it, or use it as a platform for further attacks on the local network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through specially crafted requests to the web interface's file-related CGI scripts (`/cgi-bin/admin/fileread`, `/cgi-bin/admin/filewrite`, `/cgi-bin/admin/sdstate`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the web interface to exploit the directory traversal vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how an attacker can write a shell script to the cgi-bin directory and execute it, thereby achieving code execution.
*   The exploit code also highlights that because command execution is blind, the output of executed commands must be written to a log file that can be read to confirm successful exploitation and retrieve results.
* The article mentions that devices are often sold with default admin credentials, which, if not changed, could facilitate access to the web interface.
