- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly protect some of its REST API routes, which allows unauthenticated attackers to exploit an Object Injection vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs because user-supplied data is unserialized without proper sanitization, leading to potential execution of malicious code if a suitable gadget chain is present.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unprotected REST API routes.
    - Object Injection vulnerability due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially compromising the entire site.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Sending a PUT request to the vulnerable REST API endpoint with a crafted serialized payload.
    - Triggering the unserialization process via a request to another vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
    - They need to know the path of vulnerable REST API endpoints and be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
    - Must be able to create a valid serialized payload using a gadget chain.
