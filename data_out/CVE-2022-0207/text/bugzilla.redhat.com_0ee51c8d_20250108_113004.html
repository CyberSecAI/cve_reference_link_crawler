| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2033697#c0)  Milan Zamazal    2021-12-17 16:29:03 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Current implementation of logging and hiding secret values in the logs allows a race that can result in logging the actual secret value instead of the asterisks placeholder. Code like the following    log.info("Data: %s", protected_secret_value)   plain = unprotect_passwords(protected_secret_value)  can result in the plain value occurring in the logs although a wrapped value is passed to the logger.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  4.50, probably present since 4.30.1.  How reproducible:  There is currently no known reproducer.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2033697#c1)  Polina    2022-05-04 07:55:59 UTC  ``` File /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/vdsm/common/password.py with the presented by [https://gerrit.ovirt.org/c/vdsm/+/118025/](https://gerrit.ovirt.org/c/vdsm/%2B/118025/) change  is part of the version ovirt-engine-4.5.0.5-0.7.el8ev.noarch, vdsm-4.50.0.13-1.el8ev.x86_64   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2033697#c2)  Arik    2022-05-08 10:27:53 UTC  ``` We haven't noticed leaks of secrets with the fix   ``` |  |
