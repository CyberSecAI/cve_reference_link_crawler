- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unprotected text file and an unprotected `download.php` script within the "Orders (CSV, Excel) Export PRO" module allows unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Information Exposure (CWE-200): The module exposes sensitive information, such as FTP credentials, to unauthorized actors due to lack of access controls on a text file and a PHP script.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Data leaks: Sensitive information, including FTP credentials, can be accessed by unauthorized individuals. This could lead to further compromise of the PrestaShop installation and potentially the server where it is hosted.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker does not require any special privileges and does not need to interact with the application. They only need to know the location of the vulnerable file or script.

This advisory provides more specific information than the official CVE description, detailing that the exposed sensitive information includes FTP credentials, and that this is due to an unprotected text file and download.php script. It also includes the steps taken to remediate the issue.
