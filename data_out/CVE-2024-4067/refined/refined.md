{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` within `index.js`. The regular expression `/\\{.\\*\\}/` uses a greedy quantifier `.*` which can lead to excessive backtracking when processing specially crafted input strings, causing a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity (CWE-1333)"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious payload with many nested braces can cause the application to hang or slow down due to excessive backtracking during regex matching, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `micromatch.braces()` function which contains a malicious pattern with many nested braces."

      "description": "The regex `/\\{.\\*\\}/` was made lazy, changing to `/\\{.\\*?\\}/`. This reduces the risk of a ReDoS but does not completely fix it."
