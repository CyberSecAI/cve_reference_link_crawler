# Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in micromatch

Severity Medium

Score 5.3/10

## Summary

The NPM package "micromatch" prior to 4.0.8 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The vulnerability occurs in "micromatch.braces()" in "index.js" because the pattern ".\*" will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue still persists. This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to its greedy matching.

## CWE-1333 - Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
