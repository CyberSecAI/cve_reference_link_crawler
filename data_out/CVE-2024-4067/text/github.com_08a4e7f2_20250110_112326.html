|  |  | - more accurate matching (passes 100% of Bash 4.3 of the brace expansion and extglob unit tests, as well as all Bash glob tests that are relevant to node.js usage, all minimatch tests, all brace-expansion tests, and also passes a couple of tests that bash fails) |

|  |  | - we have improved parser accuracy to such a degree that some implementors using invalid globs have noted change in behavior. If this is the case for you, please check that you are using a valid glob expression before logging a bug with this library |
