Hello, and thanks for contributing to micromatch!

## tldr

There are three main goals in this document, depending on the nature of your pr:

* [description](#description): please tell us about your pr
* [checklist](#checklist): please review the checklist that is most closly related to your pr

The following sections provide more detail on each.

**Improve this document**

Please don't hesitate to [ask questions](../../issues) for clarification, or to [make suggestions](../../issues) (or a pull request) to improve this document.

## Description

To help the project's maintainers and community to quickly understand the nature of your pull request, please create a description that incorporates the following elements:

* what is accomplished by the pr
* [] if there is something potentially controversial in your pr, please take a moment to tell us about your choices

## Checklist

Please use the checklist that is most closely related to your pr *(you only need to use one checklist, and you can skip items that aren't applicable or don't make sense)*:

* fixing typos
* documentation
* bug fix
* new feature
* other

### Fixing typos

* Please review the readme advice section before submitting changes

### Documentation

* Please review the [readme advice](#readme-advice) section before submitting changes

### Bug Fix

* All existing unit tests are still passing (if applicable)

* Update the readme (see [readme advice](#readme-advice))

Thanks for contributing!

## Readme advice

Please review this section if you are updating readme documentation.

**Readme template**

This project uses [verb](https://github.com/verbose/verb) for documentation. Verb generates the project's readme documentation from the [.verb.md](../.verb.md) template in the root of this project.

Make all documentation changes in `.verb.md`, and please *do not edit the readme.md directly*, or your changes might accidentally get overwritten.

**Code comments**

Please add code comments (following the same style as existing comments) to describe any code changes or new code introduced by your pull request.

**Optionally build the readme**

Any changes made `.verb.md` and/or code comments will be automatically incorporated into the README documentation the next time `verb` is run.

We can take care of building the documentation for you when we merge in your changes, or feel free to run [verb](https://github.com/verbose/verb) yourself. Whatever you prefer is fine with us.

| [@jonschlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert) can this be merged? it will fix this issue:  CVE Detailed Information Credit: Checkmarx Published: Jan 24, 2024 The NPM package "micromatch" is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The vulnerability occurs in "micromatch.braces()" in "index.js" because the pattern ".\*" will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. This issue could be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to its greedy matching. |

| Hello [@RobinGiel](https://github.com/RobinGiel) [@jonschlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert),  Thank you for the mention.  We have analyzed this and concluded that the issue is not fully solved even with the lazy regex. In the tests we did, we were still able to cause backtracking by opening various braces, and the execution will hang for longer as the number of braces provided increases.  We see you mentioned "CVE" so we would like to know if you requested CVEs yourself. We don't want to create duplicate entries.  Thank you for your time.  Best regards, Mário Teixeira |

| [@MarioTeixeiraCx](https://github.com/MarioTeixeiraCx) Thanks for publishing the CVEs. I was wondering how the [7.5 score](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) for [CVE-2024-4068](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-4068) was calculated, and was thinking that you could also specify the `Modified Availability` factor. I believe that the actual impact of the vulnerability has been proven to be low, so perhaps a MA score of Low might be in order? The vector string would then be: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L/MA:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L/MA:L) which would drop the issue to a 5.3 score? |

| Hi [@koesper](https://github.com/koesper), I understand your query, but please let me clarify the situation.  According to the official [Specification Document for version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/specification-document) , "Availability" is defined as `High` whenever the impact results in fully denying access to resources in the impacted component, such as a Denial of Service. This is the situation here because exploiting the vulnerability will crash the application. Since this is the default scenario that you will be able to observe in a simple Proof-of-Concept, the score that was initially calculated must represent this scenario.  In the same way that some individuals will have the worst-case scenario, it's indeed possible that in specific situations, the impact will be lower if the Availability is not affected to the point of becoming inaccessible. In these cases, as you mentioned well, it would make sense to rely on the Environmental Metrics group, such as the "MA" metric, to adjust the score. However, these metrics must be filled by the end consumer and not by the score provider because they will only apply to specific use cases with the consumer's assets. The tools won't even allow us to add those in the calculation when assigning the CVSS to the CVE.  For additional information, please consult the [official documentation](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/):  These metrics enable the analyst to customize the CVSS score depending on the importance of the affected IT asset to a user’s organization, measured in terms of complementary/alternative security controls in place, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.  Regards, Mário Teixeira |

| Hi [@MarioTeixeiraCx](https://github.com/MarioTeixeiraCx) [@jonschlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert) I noticed that this was intended to be a part of 4.0.6 but for some reason this one is not included in the final release, as index.js in the stable releases `4.0.6` and `4.0.7` does not contain the fix. See: (`d1641` is the commit that supposed to fix the redos)   [micromatch/index.js](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/blob/d1641baf261e42ea437f3750c44f20cec0b33e1b/index.js#L448)  Line 448 in [d1641ba](/micromatch/micromatch/commit/d1641baf261e42ea437f3750c44f20cec0b33e1b)   |  | if ((options && options.nobrace === true) || !/\{.\*?\}/.test(pattern)) { | | --- | --- |     <https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/blob/4.0.6/index.js#L457> <https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/blob/4.0.7/index.js#L448>   Can you review? |
