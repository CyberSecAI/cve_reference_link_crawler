Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of SQL parameters within the `Tickets::getsearchedtickets()` method of the "Help Desk - Customer Support Management System" module for PrestaShop. Specifically, user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query, allowing for SQL injection.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The module is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into SQL queries.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Admin Access:** Attackers could potentially gain administrative access to the PrestaShop installation.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Data within the PrestaShop database could be removed or modified.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data could be copied and exposed via the frontend, potentially including tokens and admin AJAX scripts.
    *   **Email Hijacking:** SMTP settings could be modified to intercept or manipulate email communications.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network.
    *   **HTTP Request:** Exploitation occurs through a standard HTTP request, making it easily accessible.
    *   **Front Controller:** The exploit utilizes a PrestaShop front controller, potentially hiding the exploit path in standard logs.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Low Privilege:**  Attackers require minimal privileges (a "low" privilege level).
    *   **No User Interaction:** The attack can be performed without any interaction from the victim.
    *   **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PrestaShop instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory highlights that standard frontend logs might not reveal the specific exploit path, as it may appear as a generic "POST /" request.
*   The use of a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with OWASP rules is recommended, although it may require specific bypass configurations for PrestaShop's backend.
*   The advisory suggests upgrading to the latest version of the module and PrestaShop itself.
*   The advisory includes a warning regarding the limitations of changing the default database prefix `ps_`
