Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `parseSWF_TEXTRECORD` function within `util/parser.c`. Specifically, memory is allocated for `brec->GlyphEntries` using `malloc` based on `brec->GlyphCount` but is never freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary issue is a memory leak. The allocated memory for `brec->GlyphEntries` is not released after use. Repeated calls to `parseSWF_TEXTRECORD` with different text records can exhaust memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can craft a malicious SWF file that triggers the `parseSWF_TEXTRECORD` function multiple times, leading to memory exhaustion and a denial of service. The program eventually crashes due to excessive memory usage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted SWF File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted SWF file that includes text records designed to trigger the memory leak in `parseSWF_TEXTRECORD`. The PoC file `poc.zip` demonstrates how the vulnerability can be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Malicious SWF File:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable application with the crafted SWF file.
- **No Special Privileges:** No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability if the application is already processing the untrusted input.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided information includes code snippets from the vulnerable function (`parseSWF_TEXTRECORD`) and the output showing the memory leak detected by LeakSanitizer.
- The issue was found on libming v0.4.8.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of SWF files.
- The provided log outputs show out-of-sync stream errors, which may also be a separate issue related to the crafted SWF, but is indicative of the problem when parsing the malformed file.
- The `stderr` output shows that the program encounters "sudden file end" and "extra garbage" after parsing the SWF, indicating incorrect parsing behavior, possibly triggering memory leaks.
