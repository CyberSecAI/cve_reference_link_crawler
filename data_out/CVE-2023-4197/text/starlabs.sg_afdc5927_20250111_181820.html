## Product Overview:[#](#product-overview)

Dolibarr ERP CRM is a web-based software that provides management for the target organization’s activities, such as contacts, suppliers, invoices, orders, stocks, agenda, etc. It is an open-source software suite designed for small, medium or large companies, foundations and freelancers. Administrators can use the fine grained permissions manager to grant permissions to various users based on their operational requirements.

Dolibarr ERP CRM operates as an all-in-one suite, which allows customizability based on the usage needs of the organization. It is highly modular as the administrators simply have to enable modules that they need and disable the ones they do not require. Almost every component is a module, which also means that Dolibarr ERP CRM is highly extensible in terms of features.

## Vulnerability Summary:[#](#vulnerability-summary)

Users can be granted privileges to add and modify pages in the websites module. Even though there are security settings to only allow HTML/JavaScript/CSS, this can be subverted. Existing checks being to detect PHP content from user-supplied input are insufficient as it only checks for `<?php` and `<?=`, allowing usage of the `<?` short tag for executing PHP code. As a result, an adversary is able to inject unsanitized PHP content into these web pages and achieve code execution via PHP.

## Vulnerability Details:[#](#vulnerability-details)

There are two ways to exploit this vulnerability, one is to “import” content from a specified URL; the other is to edit an existing page.

The vulnerable code can be found in the function `dolKeepOnlyPhpCode()`, inside the `/core/lib/website.lib.php` file. where no checking for the `<?` tag is done. This function intended purpose is to extract the PHP code from the given string and return it to the caller. The caller would throw an error if this function returns a non-empty string since it indicates the presence of PHP code.

```
/core/lib/website.lib.php:
<?php
function dolKeepOnlyPhpCode($str)
{
    $str = str_replace('<?=', '<?php', $str);
    $newstr = '';
    // Split on each opening tag
    //$parts = explode('<?php', $str);
    $parts = preg_split('/'.preg_quote('<?php', '/').'/i', $str);
    if (!empty($parts)) {
        $i = 0;
        foreach ($parts as $part) {
            if ($i == 0) {  // The first part is never php code
                $i++;
                continue;
            }
            $newstr .= '<?php';
            //split on closing tag
            $partlings = explode('?>', $part, 2);
            if (!empty($partlings)) {
                $newstr .= $partlings[0].'?>';
            } else {
                $newstr .= $part.'?>';
            }
        }
    }
    return $newstr;
}

```

This function takes in a single argument which is the string to sanitize. It first replaces all occurrences of `<?=` with `<?php` and subsequently all `<?php` tags are tokenized, and the string between the opening and optional closing tags are selected and returned to the caller.

In order to achieve RCE, the adversary must first be authenticated with an account and the Website module must be enabled. Then, modify an existing web page to include the `<?` tag where arbitrary PHP code can be executed. Command execution is achieved by using any of the PHP functions that executes system code (i.e. `system()`). After the web page is modified successfully, previewing the updated page would trigger the RCE:

## Exploit Conditions:[#](#exploit-conditions)

This vulnerability can be exploited when the “Website” module is enabled, as well as having access to a low-privilege user account.

## Proof-of-Concept:[#](#proof-of-concept)

We have tried our best to make the PoC as portable as possible. The following is a functional exploit written in Python3 that exploits this vulnerability to achieve remote command execution:

## Suggested Mitigations:[#](#suggested-mitigations)

Update the Dolibarr installation to the latest version as shown from the official repository [releases page](https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/releases).

## Detection Guidance:[#](#detection-guidance)

It is possible to detect the exploitation of this vulnerability by checking the `/document/` directory (default upload directory) to see if there are any `.tpl` files containing `<?` tags, and further inspecting the code contained within.
