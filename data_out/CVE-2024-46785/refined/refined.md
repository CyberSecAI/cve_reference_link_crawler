Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2024-46785.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `list_del()` on an SRCU (Sleepable RCU) protected list variable in the `eventfs_remove_rec` function within the Linux kernel's tracing subsystem. This function removes elements from a list of child inodes (`ei->children`) and then removes the current inode (`ei`) itself using `list_del(&ei->list)`. However, this list is protected by SRCU, which means that readers might be iterating over the list while the removal is happening. Using `list_del()` directly can lead to list corruption because the pointers are poisoned without ensuring that RCU readers have finished reading the list element.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect usage of `list_del()` instead of `list_del_rcu()` on an SRCU-protected list.
- Race condition where a reader might access a list element that has been removed and poisoned.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel panic (null pointer dereference) due to accessing a freed memory location. Specifically, the `ei_child->is_freed` is accessed after `ei_child` has been removed and its list pointers set to `LIST_POISON1`.
- System instability and denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by concurrently creating and deleting kprobe events using the `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/kprobe_events` interface while simultaneously listing the events in the `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/kprobes/` directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to write to `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/kprobe_events` and read from `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/kprobes/`, typically requiring root privileges or similar access.
- The attacker must be able to trigger concurrent operations on the tracefs, leading to the race condition.

**Technical Details:**
The provided code snippets show the fix which replaces `list_del(&ei->list)` with `list_del_rcu(&ei->list)`. This is necessary because `list_del_rcu()` ensures that the list element is only fully removed after all RCU readers have completed, preventing the race condition and the resulting kernel panic. The original code used `list_del` which does not offer this protection.
The provided crash log shows a kernel panic at `eventfs_iterate+0x2c0/0x398` and indicates that a memory access violation occurred at address `dead000000000150`, which was triggered by the described race condition.
The provided script `loop1` creates and removes events and `loop2` list the same events triggering the race condition that results in kernel panic.
