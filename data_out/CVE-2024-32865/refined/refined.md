    "Metadata": {
      "CISA_Advisory_Link": "https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-214-05",
      "CISA_Advisory_ID": "ICSA-24-214-05",
      "Vendor": "Johnson Controls, Inc.",
      "Equipment": "exacqVision Server",
       "CVSS_v3_Score": "6.4",
       "Initial_Publication_Date": "August 01, 2024"
    },
    "Vulnerability_Details": {
      "Root_Cause": "The exacqVision Server does not properly validate TLS certificates provided by connected devices under certain circumstances.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295)"
      ],
      "Impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and intercept communications.",
       "Attack_Vectors": [
        "Network adjacent attack"
      ],
       "Required_Capabilities": "The attacker would need to be in a network position to intercept the communications, and trigger the condition when the certificate isn't validated. The attack requires user interaction (UI:R) to initiate the connection.",
        "Affected_Products": [
        "exacqVision Server: Versions 24.03 and prior"
      ]
    },
    "Mitigations": {
      "Vendor_Mitigation": "Johnson Controls recommends users update exacqVision Client and exacqVision Server to version 24.06",
       "CISA_Mitigations": [
        "Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.",
        "Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.",
        "When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.",
        "Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.",
         "Refer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.",
        "Refer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks."

   "Additional_Notes": {
      "Researcher": "Diego Zaffaroni from Nozomi Networks reported this vulnerability to Johnson Controls, Inc.",
     "No_Known_Public_Exploitation": "No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.",
      "Attack_Complexity": "This vulnerability has a high attack complexity."
