# Detection: Splunk RCE via External Lookup Copybuckets

Updated Date: 2024-10-17
ID: 8598f9de-bba8-42a4-8ef0-12e1adda4131
Author: Rod Soto, Chase Franklin
[Type: Hunting](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

The following detection provides the ability to detect remote code execution attempts against a script named copybuckets present within the splunk\_archiver application by calling this script as an external lookup.

### Search

```
1index=_internal sourcetype="splunk_archiver-too_small" *.csv
2| rex field=_raw "Invoking command:\s(?<command>.*)"
3| stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(command) as command values(severity) as severity by host
4| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
5| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
6| `splunk_rce_via_external_lookup_copybuckets_filter`

```
### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [security\_content\_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml) | `convert timeformat="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" ctime($field$)` |
| splunk\_rce\_via\_external\_lookup\_copybuckets\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_rce_via_external_lookup_copybuckets_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

Requires access to internal indexes

### Known False Positives

An operator must identify elements indicatives of command execution requests by looking at regex data being extracted from the log. Not all the requests will be malicious.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Possible exploitation attempt against $host$ | 80 | 80 | 100 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.

# Remote Code Execution (RCE) through an external lookup due to “copybuckets.py“ script in the “splunk\_archiver“ application in Splunk Enterprise

**Advisory ID:** SVD-2024-0705

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2024-36985](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36985)

**Published:** 2024-07-01

**Last Update:** 2024-07-01

**CVSSv3.1 Score:** 8.8, High

**CVSSv3.1 Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**CWE:** [CWE-687](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/687.html)

**Bug ID:** VULN-8937

## Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.0.10, 9.1.5, and 9.2.2, a low-privileged user that does not hold the “admin“ or “power“ Splunk roles could cause a Remote Code Execution through an external lookup that likely references the “splunk\_archiver“ application.

The “splunk\_archiver“ application likely contains a script called “copybuckets.py“ that itself references a file called “erp\_launcher.py“, which would likely execute a script called “sudobash“.

The “sudobash“ script does not perform any input checking. Therefore it runs a bash shell with arguments supplied by the “erp\_launcher.py“ file. This can lead to an RCE.

## Solution

Upgrade Splunk Enterprise to versions 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10, or higher.

## Product Status

| Product | Version | Component | Affected Version | Fix Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.2 | splunk\_archiver | 9.2.0 to 9.2.1 | 9.2.2 |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.1 | splunk\_archiver | 9.1.0 to 9.1.4 | 9.1.5 |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.0 | splunk\_archiver | 9.0.0 to 9.0.9 | 9.0.10 |

## Mitigations and Workarounds

Disable the “splunk\_archiver“ application

## Detections

* [Splunk RCE via external lookup copybuckets](https://research.splunk.com/application/8598f9de-bba8-42a4-8ef0-12e1adda4131)

## Severity

Splunk rates this vulnerability as 8.8, High, with a CVSSv3.1 vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.

If the Splunk Enterprise instance disabled splunk\_archiver, there is no impact and the severity is Informational.
