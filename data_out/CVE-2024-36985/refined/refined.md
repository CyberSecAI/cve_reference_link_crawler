Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36985:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `copybuckets.py` script within the `splunk_archiver` application in Splunk Enterprise. This script indirectly calls `sudobash`, which executes a bash shell with user-supplied arguments without proper input sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `sudobash` script does not perform any input checking on the arguments it receives from `erp_launcher.py`.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By supplying malicious arguments to the `sudobash` script via `erp_launcher.py`, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **External Lookup Abuse:** The vulnerability is triggered via an external lookup that references the vulnerable `splunk_archiver` application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Splunk server.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The attacker can potentially gain complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is network-based and requires the attacker to send a request to the Splunk server.
*   **External Lookup:** The attacker leverages the external lookup functionality of Splunk to invoke the vulnerable script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privilege User:** The attacker must have a low-privileged user account on Splunk but does not require "admin" or "power" roles.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Splunk server.

**Additional Details (from provided content):**
*   The vulnerability exists in Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.0.10, 9.1.5, and 9.2.2.
*   The vulnerable application is `splunk_archiver` which includes scripts `copybuckets.py`, `erp_launcher.py` and `sudobash`.
*   The advisory provides a detection method to detect exploitation attempts.
*   The provided content provides a detection query:

```
* The vulnerability is rated as High severity with a CVSS score of 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
* Mitigations include upgrading to patched versions of Splunk, or disabling the `splunk_archiver` application.
* A number of threat actors could abuse this vulnerability.
