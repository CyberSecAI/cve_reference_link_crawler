### @Beuc **[Beuc](/Beuc)** commented [Jul 10, 2023](#issue-1796891416)

I'm part of the Debian LTS (Long Term Support) Team and I'm working on integrating the fix for [CVE-2022-24439](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hcpj-qp55-gfph "CVE-2022-24439") for GitPython in Debian.

After contacting [@Byron](https://github.com/Byron) privately we determined that [#1521](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1521) would need a follow-up fix, which I hereby propose in this PR.

I also modified 2 tests to validate the change, but I'm not sure if we want to double-check (multi/non-multi) all the currenttt clone/clone\_from tests, so I didn't, but I can do so if necessary.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Thanks a million!  I think it's sufficient to 'sample' only a couple of test as we know the fix is present for all clones, and I don't think that will change.  I will see to create a new release shortly. |
