Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references within the `addDv7Probe` function of D-Link D-View.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is an XXE injection vulnerability. The XML parser within the `addDv7Probe` function processes external entities without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to control the URI and potentially embed external content into the XML document.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information by causing the server to access and embed the content of an attacker-controlled URI into the XML document. The advisory specifically mentions that an attacker can disclose information in the context of SYSTEM.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, as a remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not require authentication to exploit the vulnerability, and can achieve this remotely.

The provided information gives more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific vulnerable function (`addDv7Probe`), the method of exploitation (XXE injection), and the fact that no authentication is required.
