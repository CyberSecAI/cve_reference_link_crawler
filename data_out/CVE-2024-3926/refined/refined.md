### Summary:
This document provides information about a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-3926, affecting the Element Pack Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within various widgets. This allows authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access or higher to inject malicious web scripts.

### Extracted Information:
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `custom_attributes` field of various Element Pack widgets, leading to unsanitized output.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Malicious scripts can be injected into the `custom_attributes` field which are then stored in the database and executed when the page is accessed by a user.
    *   **Insufficient Input Sanitization**: User-provided attributes are not properly sanitized or escaped, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code.
    *   **Inadequate Output Escaping:** The plugin fails to properly escape the output, allowing malicious scripts to execute.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to:
    *   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser.
    *   Potentially redirect users to malicious sites, steal cookies, or perform other harmful actions.
    *   Compromise user accounts or sensitive data depending on the scripts executed.
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   The primary attack vector is through the `custom_attributes` field of Element Pack widgets.
    *   An attacker injects malicious JavaScript or HTML into this field.
    *   When a user views the affected page, the injected script executes in the user's browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   **Authenticated User**: Attackers must have at least "Contributor" level access to the WordPress site.
    *   **Widget Configuration Access**: The attacker needs the ability to create/edit pages or posts and configure widgets.
    *   **No User Interaction Needed**: Once the malicious script is injected, it executes when other users merely access the compromised page.

### Additional Details:
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Element Pack Elementor Addons plugin up to and including version 5.6.1.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.6.2.
*   The provided code snippets from the plugin's source code highlight the location where the vulnerability is present, specifically in `creative-button.php`.
*   The changeset information provided shows a large set of file changes, indicating a significant patch effort.
*   The issue is located in the way custom attributes are handled within the widget rendering logic, particularly in the use of `$this->add_render_attribute()` function.
*   The Wordfence analysis explicitly mentions the `custom_attributes` value as the source of the vulnerability
