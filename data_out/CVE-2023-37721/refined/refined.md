```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a stack-based buffer overflow in the `page` function when handling the `/goform/fromSafeMacFilter` request.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A stack-based buffer overflow occurs because the user-provided `page` parameter is passed to `sprintf` without any length checks, allowing an attacker to overwrite stack memory.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) or Remote Code Execution (RCE).",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to `/goform/fromSafeClientFilter` with an overly long `page` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Tenda router, and no prior authentication is mentioned as required for the vulnerable endpoint."
