Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4663

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts execute when a user interacts with the affected page (e.g., clicks a link).
- Successful exploitation can lead to various malicious actions, including:
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts via the `id` parameter.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user loads a page where the malicious script was injected.
- Contributor+ access is required.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in the OSM Map Widget for Elementor WordPress plugin.
- The affected versions are 1.2.2 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.3.0.
- The vulnerability is present in the `osm-map.php` file, specifically around line 1478.
- The Wordfence report indicates the vulnerability is stored XSS, not reflected. The description incorrectly states it is reflected. This implies the payload is saved within the database and re-executed upon page load.
