# Potential exposure of access token via authenticated media

High

[davidegirardi](/davidegirardi)
published
GHSA-3jm3-x98c-r34x
Oct 15, 2024

## Package

Element Web

## Affected versions

>= 1.11.70, <= 1.11.80

## Patched versions

1.11.81

## Description

Element Web versions 1.11.70 through 1.11.80 contain a vulnerability which can, under specially crafted conditions, lead to the access token becoming exposed to third parties. At least one vector has been identified internally, involving malicious widgets, but other vectors may exist. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to version 1.11.81 to remediate the issue.

We classify this as a High severity security issue even if the CVSS score would be lower. CVSS score considering end-to-end encryption: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L 5.5. CVSS score ignoring end-to-end encryption: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L 6.8.

Note that despite superficial similarity to CVE-2024-47771, this is an entirely separate vulnerability, caused by a separate piece of code included only in Element Web. Element Web and Element Desktop share most but not all, of their code and this vulnerability exists in the part of the code base which is not shared between the projects.

### Impact

Potential access token exposure to malicious third parties under crafted conditions.

### Workarounds

Avoid granting permissions to untrusted widgets.

### References

N/A

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-47779

### Weaknesses

[CWE-200](/advisories?query=cwe%3A200)
