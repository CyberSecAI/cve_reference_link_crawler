Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to sanitize a file path within an error message. This allows the full server path of the application to be revealed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Full Path Disclosure:** The plugin displays the server's file path in an error message when an upload fails, specifically in the `ajax_chunk_receiver` function.
* **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not sanitize the file path before including it in the error message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain knowledge of the web application's full path, potentially aiding further malicious activities.
* **Limited Direct Impact:** The vulnerability itself is not directly exploitable for immediate harm, but provides information useful in combination with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network through HTTP requests to the vulnerable plugin endpoint.
* **File Upload Process:** The vulnerability is triggered during the file upload process, when an error occurs due to issues with writing the file.
* **Error Message:** The vulnerable file path is exposed in an error message generated by the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have author-level or higher privileges in WordPress to access the vulnerable functionality.
* **Upload Files Capability:** The user must be able to upload files.
* **Ability to Cause Upload Errors**: The attacker needs to be able to cause the upload process to fail in a way that triggers the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in the `ajax_chunk_receiver` function, specifically when handling chunked uploads.
*   The vulnerable file path is displayed in the `message` key in the json response or in an HTML error message if short is defined in the request.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions <= 2.1.2 of the Big File Uploads plugin.
*   Version 2.1.3 of the plugin addresses this vulnerability by removing the file path from the error message.
