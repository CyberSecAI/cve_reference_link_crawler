{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `BN_GF2m_poly2arr()` function in OpenSSL does not properly validate the input polynomial, allowing an attacker to provide an invalid polynomial with a zero constant term. This leads to an out-of-bounds memory access in the `BN_GF2m_mod_arr()` function, which relies on the polynomial having a non-zero constant term.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Out-of-bounds memory access"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service (application crash) and potentially remote code execution. However, the likelihood of exploitation is low because the vulnerability is only present when using explicit curve parameters that do not conform to the X9.62 standard.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker would need to supply specially crafted, invalid GF(2^m) parameters to the vulnerable OpenSSL APIs `EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m()`, `EC_GROUP_new_from_params()`, or other functions that use `BN_GF2m_*()`, specifically crafting a polynomial with a zero constant term.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply explicit elliptic curve parameters. This is generally not possible when using named curves which are usually used with X.509 certificates and TLS.",
	"additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in OpenSSL versions 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2. Patches for this issue are included in the upcoming releases of each affected branch. The vulnerability was reported by Google OSS-Fuzz-Gen on 16th September 2024. The fix implemented in the vulnerable function now returns a failure when the constant term is zero, the leading exponent exceeds `OPENSSL_ECC_MAX_FIELD_BITS` or if there is not enough space to pad the array with the `-1` sentinel value. Tests were also added to check for correct handling of invalid GF2m field parameters."
