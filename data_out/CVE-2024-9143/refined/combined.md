Subject: CVE-2024-9143: OpenSSL: Low-level invalid GF(2^m) parameters lead to OOB memory access

OpenSSL Security Advisory [16th October 2024]
=============================================

Low-level invalid GF(2^m) parameters lead to OOB memory access (CVE-2024-9143)
==============================================================================

Severity: Low

Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted
explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads
or writes.

Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or
even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols
involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only "named
curves" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they
specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent
problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable
application is low.

In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,
so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509
certificates.  Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an "exotic"
curve encoding.

The affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(),
and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.

Applications working with "exotic" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters,
that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero
constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a
result of reading or writing outside of array bounds.  Remote code execution
cannot easily be ruled out.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

OpenSSL 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are vulnerable to this issue.

OpenSSL 3.3 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.3.3 once it is released.

OpenSSL 3.2 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.2.4 once it is released.

OpenSSL 3.1 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.1.8 once it is released.

OpenSSL 3.0 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.16 once it is released.

OpenSSL 1.1.1 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1zb once it is released
(premium support customers only).

OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.2zl once it is released
(premium support customers only).

Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of
OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next release of each
branch, once it becomes available. The fix is also available in commit
c0d3e4d3 (for 3.3), commit bc7e04d7 (for 3.2), commit fdf67233 (for 3.1)
and commit 72ae83ad (for 3.0) in the OpenSSL git repository. It is available
to premium support customers in commit 8efc0cba (for 1.1.1) and in commit
9d576994 (for 1.0.2).

This issue was reported on 16th September 2024 by Google OSS-Fuzz-Gen.
The fix was developed by Viktor Dukhovni.

FWIW,

both parties answered off-list (I needed an answer during the german
business day and got held up by moderation).

The difference is that OpenSSL does not adhere to CVSS-style risk
assessment, but assesses the severity of the bug together with the
likelihood of exploitation. Due to the latter being extremely low, the
overall assessment is "low".

SuSE, however, used vanilla CVSS3.1 assessment which does not include
exploitability metrics beyond "AC:H".

That explains the different scores.

Best regards,

```
The BN_GF2m_poly2arr() function converts characteristic-2 field
(GF_{2^m}) Galois polynomials from a representation as a BIGNUM bitmask,
to a compact array with just the exponents of the non-zero terms.

These polynomials are then used in BN_GF2m_mod_arr() to perform modular
reduction.  A precondition of calling BN_GF2m_mod_arr() is that the
polynomial must have a non-zero constant term (i.e. the array has `0` as
its final element).

Internally, callers of BN_GF2m_poly2arr() did not verify that
precondition, and binary EC curve parameters with an invalid polynomial
could lead to out of bounds memory reads and writes in BN_GF2m_mod_arr().

The precondition is always true for polynomials that arise from the
standard form of EC parameters for characteristic-two fields (X9.62).
See the "Finite Field Identification" section of:

    <https://www.itu.int/ITU-T/formal-language/itu-t/x/x894/2018-cor1/ANSI-X9-62.html>

The OpenSSL GF(2^m) code supports only the trinomial and pentanomial
basis X9.62 forms.

This commit updates BN_GF2m_poly2arr() to return `0` (failure) when
the constant term is zero (i.e. the input bitmask BIGNUM is not odd).

Additionally, the return value is made unambiguous when there is not
enough space to also pad the array with a final `-1` sentinel value.
The return value is now always the number of elements (including the
final `-1`) that would be filled when the output array is sufficiently
large.  Previously the same count was returned both when the array has
just enough room for the final `-1` and when it had only enough space
for non-sentinel values.

Finally, BN_GF2m_poly2arr() is updated to reject polynomials whose
degree exceeds `OPENSSL_ECC_MAX_FIELD_BITS`, this guards against
CPU exhausition attacks via excessively large inputs.

The above issues do not arise in processing X.509 certificates.  These
generally have EC keys from "named curves", and RFC5840 (Section 2.1.1)
disallows explicit EC parameters.  The TLS code in OpenSSL enforces this
constraint only after the certificate is decoded, but, even if explicit
parameters are specified, they are in X9.62 form, which cannot represent
problem values as noted above.

Initially reported as oss-fuzz issue 71623.

A closely related issue was earlier reported in
<[#19826](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/19826)>.

Good morning everyone,

while OpenSSL rates this issue as "low severity", SuSE assesses it as
"moderate", with a CVSS 3.1 of 7.0
(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H).

I'm curious about these two quite different assessments. Could OpenSSL
and SuSE maybe elaborate a little?

Thanks,

The BN_GF2m_poly2arr() function converts characteristic-2 field
(GF_{2^m}) Galois polynomials from a representation as a BIGNUM bitmask,
to a compact array with just the exponents of the non-zero terms.

These polynomials are then used in BN_GF2m_mod_arr() to perform modular
reduction.  A precondition of calling BN_GF2m_mod_arr() is that the
polynomial must have a non-zero constant term (i.e. the array has `0` as
its final element).

Internally, callers of BN_GF2m_poly2arr() did not verify that
precondition, and binary EC curve parameters with an invalid polynomial
could lead to out of bounds memory reads and writes in BN_GF2m_mod_arr().

The precondition is always true for polynomials that arise from the
standard form of EC parameters for characteristic-two fields (X9.62).
See the "Finite Field Identification" section of:

    <https://www.itu.int/ITU-T/formal-language/itu-t/x/x894/2018-cor1/ANSI-X9-62.html>

The OpenSSL GF(2^m) code supports only the trinomial and pentanomial
basis X9.62 forms.

This commit updates BN_GF2m_poly2arr() to return `0` (failure) when
the constant term is zero (i.e. the input bitmask BIGNUM is not odd).

Additionally, the return value is made unambiguous when there is not
enough space to also pad the array with a final `-1` sentinel value.
The return value is now always the number of elements (including the
final `-1`) that would be filled when the output array is sufficiently
large.  Previously the same count was returned both when the array has
just enough room for the final `-1` and when it had only enough space
for non-sentinel values.

Finally, BN_GF2m_poly2arr() is updated to reject polynomials whose
degree exceeds `OPENSSL_ECC_MAX_FIELD_BITS`, this guards against
CPU exhausition attacks via excessively large inputs.

The above issues do not arise in processing X.509 certificates.  These
generally have EC keys from "named curves", and RFC5840 (Section 2.1.1)
disallows explicit EC parameters.  The TLS code in OpenSSL enforces this
constraint only after the certificate is decoded, but, even if explicit
parameters are specified, they are in X9.62 form, which cannot represent
problem values as noted above.

Initially reported as oss-fuzz issue 71623.

A closely related issue was earlier reported in
<[#19826](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/19826)>.

The BN_GF2m_poly2arr() function converts characteristic-2 field
(GF_{2^m}) Galois polynomials from a representation as a BIGNUM bitmask,
to a compact array with just the exponents of the non-zero terms.

These polynomials are then used in BN_GF2m_mod_arr() to perform modular
reduction.  A precondition of calling BN_GF2m_mod_arr() is that the
polynomial must have a non-zero constant term (i.e. the array has `0` as
its final element).

Internally, callers of BN_GF2m_poly2arr() did not verify that
precondition, and binary EC curve parameters with an invalid polynomial
could lead to out of bounds memory reads and writes in BN_GF2m_mod_arr().

The precondition is always true for polynomials that arise from the
standard form of EC parameters for characteristic-two fields (X9.62).
See the "Finite Field Identification" section of:

    <https://www.itu.int/ITU-T/formal-language/itu-t/x/x894/2018-cor1/ANSI-X9-62.html>

The OpenSSL GF(2^m) code supports only the trinomial and pentanomial
basis X9.62 forms.

This commit updates BN_GF2m_poly2arr() to return `0` (failure) when
the constant term is zero (i.e. the input bitmask BIGNUM is not odd).

Additionally, the return value is made unambiguous when there is not
enough space to also pad the array with a final `-1` sentinel value.
The return value is now always the number of elements (including the
final `-1`) that would be filled when the output array is sufficiently
large.  Previously the same count was returned both when the array has
just enough room for the final `-1` and when it had only enough space
for non-sentinel values.

Finally, BN_GF2m_poly2arr() is updated to reject polynomials whose
degree exceeds `OPENSSL_ECC_MAX_FIELD_BITS`, this guards against
CPU exhausition attacks via excessively large inputs.

The above issues do not arise in processing X.509 certificates.  These
generally have EC keys from "named curves", and RFC5840 (Section 2.1.1)
disallows explicit EC parameters.  The TLS code in OpenSSL enforces this
constraint only after the certificate is decoded, but, even if explicit
parameters are specified, they are in X9.62 form, which cannot represent
problem values as noted above.

OpenSSL Security Advisory [16th October 2024]
=============================================
Low-level invalid GF(2^m) parameters lead to OOB memory access (CVE-2024-9143)
==============================================================================
Severity: Low
Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted
explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads
or writes.
Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or
even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols
involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only "named
curves" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they
specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent
problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable
application is low.
In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,
so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509
certificates. Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an "exotic"
curve encoding.
The affected APIs include: EC\_GROUP\_new\_curve\_GF2m(), EC\_GROUP\_new\_from\_params(),
and various supporting BN\_GF2m\_\*() functions.
Applications working with "exotic" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters,
that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero
constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a
result of reading or writing outside of array bounds. Remote code execution
cannot easily be ruled out.
The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.
OpenSSL 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are vulnerable to this issue.
OpenSSL 3.3 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.3.3 once it is released.
OpenSSL 3.2 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.2.4 once it is released.
OpenSSL 3.1 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.1.8 once it is released.
OpenSSL 3.0 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.16 once it is released.
OpenSSL 1.1.1 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1zb once it is released
(premium support customers only).
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.2zl once it is released
(premium support customers only).
Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of
OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next release of each
branch, once it becomes available. The fix is also available in commit
c0d3e4d3 (for 3.3), commit bc7e04d7 (for 3.2), commit fdf67233 (for 3.1)
and commit 72ae83ad (for 3.0) in the OpenSSL git repository. It is available
to premium support customers in commit 8efc0cba (for 1.1.1) and in commit
9d576994 (for 1.0.2).
This issue was reported on 16th September 2024 by Google OSS-Fuzz-Gen.
The fix was developed by Viktor Dukhovni.

```
The BN_GF2m_poly2arr() function converts characteristic-2 field
(GF_{2^m}) Galois polynomials from a representation as a BIGNUM bitmask,
to a compact array with just the exponents of the non-zero terms.

These polynomials are then used in BN_GF2m_mod_arr() to perform modular
reduction.  A precondition of calling BN_GF2m_mod_arr() is that the
polynomial must have a non-zero constant term (i.e. the array has `0` as
its final element).

Internally, callers of BN_GF2m_poly2arr() did not verify that
precondition, and binary EC curve parameters with an invalid polynomial
could lead to out of bounds memory reads and writes in BN_GF2m_mod_arr().

The precondition is always true for polynomials that arise from the
standard form of EC parameters for characteristic-two fields (X9.62).
See the "Finite Field Identification" section of:

    <https://www.itu.int/ITU-T/formal-language/itu-t/x/x894/2018-cor1/ANSI-X9-62.html>

The OpenSSL GF(2^m) code supports only the trinomial and pentanomial
basis X9.62 forms.

This commit updates BN_GF2m_poly2arr() to return `0` (failure) when
the constant term is zero (i.e. the input bitmask BIGNUM is not odd).

Additionally, the return value is made unambiguous when there is not
enough space to also pad the array with a final `-1` sentinel value.
The return value is now always the number of elements (including the
final `-1`) that would be filled when the output array is sufficiently
large.  Previously the same count was returned both when the array has
just enough room for the final `-1` and when it had only enough space
for non-sentinel values.

Finally, BN_GF2m_poly2arr() is updated to reject polynomials whose
degree exceeds `OPENSSL_ECC_MAX_FIELD_BITS`, this guards against
CPU exhausition attacks via excessively large inputs.

The above issues do not arise in processing X.509 certificates.  These
generally have EC keys from "named curves", and RFC5840 (Section 2.1.1)
disallows explicit EC parameters.  The TLS code in OpenSSL enforces this
constraint only after the certificate is decoded, but, even if explicit
parameters are specified, they are in X9.62 form, which cannot represent
problem values as noted above.

Initially reported as oss-fuzz issue 71623.

A closely related issue was earlier reported in
<[#19826](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/19826)>.
