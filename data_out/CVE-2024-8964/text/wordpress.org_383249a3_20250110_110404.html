## Description

Accelerate your website and improve SEO with Sirv – the most complete image CDN and media optimization plugin for WordPress & WooCommerce.

Automatically resize, compress and serve videos & images in next-gen formats, from Sirv’s fast CDN in 25 major cities.

#### Why is Sirv the best choice for WordPress image optimization?

* Automatic optimization
* Automatic scaled images
* Automatic next-gen formats (AVIF & WebP)
* Smaller files than any other WP optimization plugin
* Incredibly fast CDN
* Perfect on WooCommerce
* Lazy loading

The best WordPress image optimizer – you don’t need to lift a finger. Just install the plugin and Sirv will automatically serve perfectly scaled and optimized images possible file-size. Every option is easily configured, if you wish to change the defaults.

#### Optimize your WordPress Media Library

Automatically optimize your existing WordPress media library images, without lifting a finger. Sirv can automatically copy your media library to Sirv, from where images will be served as highly optimized images across Sirv’s fast, global WordPress CDN (19 worldwide locations).

All these images (and more) can be automatically optimized by Sirv:

* Media gallery images
* Featured images
* WooCommerce product & category images
* Images added via other plugins or scripts
* Images added via “Add Media” button
* CSS background images

Simply enable the Sirv CDN and images will sync to your Sirv account automatically.

See the [complete list of features](https://sirv.com/features/) of Sirv’s fresh new take on media hosting and optimization.

### Take your WooCommerce sales to another level

* Optimization & CDN delivery of all your product images
* Ultra-deep image zoom, 3D GLB models and 360-spin for your media viewer
* Add image watermarks
* Add text captions
* Serves your files wherever you need them – websites, apps, feeds, social media, email campaigns

#### Image zoom

Sirv loves huge images – it can zoom deep inside them very fast. No matter how big, images load fast, just like zooming on a Google Map. The bigger your images, the more impressive this image zoom is – perfect if you have really high quality images.

#### Video streaming

Any video you upload to Sirv will be converted to different resolution video streams, for instant playback. Every user will receive the most optimal stream for their device, screen and network connection speed.

#### 3D models (GLB and USDZ)

Upload your 3D models to Sirv and embed them in your web pages and product galleries. It’s easy and automated with Sirv Media Viewer. No coding needed. It also provides Augmented Reality (AR) automatically.

#### 360 spin

Shoppers adore spinning products around to see them from all sides. If you’re selling something online, maybe with WooCommerce, Sirv provides a stunning 360-degree photography experience. Simply upload a set of photos and a 360 spin will be immediately ready to embed in your page. It feels incredible on desktop and mobile alike, especially the big full-screen 360 spin view.

Free and paid plans are available, depending on your needs. See “Price Plans” below.

#### What our users say

> ★★★★★
>
> “We’ve halved the load time on mobiles of a site that we had already done quite a bit of work on to get image sizes down.” [@martingfisher](https://wordpress.org/support/users/martingfisher/)
>
> ★★★★★
>
> “So far the best CDN plugin for WordPress. Please, never disappear!” [@mavenickster](https://wordpress.org/support/users/mavenickster/)
>
> ★★★★★
>
> “I was looking for a CDN fast and easy (no need to code)! Sirv is the best – Just upload your photos to your WordPress library and voilà “roulez jeunesse!!!” (French expression). Very good service!” [@disconance](https://wordpress.org/support/users/disconance/)
>
> ★★★★★
>
> “Sirv is fantastic! I have a lot of images on my website, and most of them are large, which resulted in slow site speeds, even with a CDN. What I love about Sirv is that they offer a CDN service, but also dynamically resize images based on the user’s browser/device, and serve the right file type. It has meant HUGE speed improvements on my website.” [@basellen](https://wordpress.org/support/users/basellen/)

#### Optimal format (every time)

Google loves next-gen image formats for SEO, but it’s a pain to convert all your images and keep track of them. Sirv solves that. It automatically delivers images to each user in the most optimal format. Usually that’ll be AVIF or WebP and the filesize is dramatically smaller, so Google will reward you with better search ranking.

Sirv’s intelligence always serves the smallest possible file format to each users’ browser. It is 100% automatic. Plus, images are automatically scaled down to the suitable width/height and they’re lazy loaded, so you’ll really have the best possible image solution for WordPress.

So far all is well with the plugin. Works as described. Tried to update to latest version yesterday but had to rollback due to some theme compatibility issues. Only bug I’ve found is that I can’t upload images using the upload button in the product image menu, I need to go into the Sirv gallery to upload images directly from wp back-end then hop back into product image section to find it.

It is really easy to use. I even hooked the whole folder structure to my MAC OS finder. The only thing I am mising is the “sirv-on-hover” feature in Sirv JS (v3) ( there is only sirv-on-drag left ´now). Support reactivated V2 for me very quickly (thanks !). Wish I could use it with the latest and upcoming versions …
