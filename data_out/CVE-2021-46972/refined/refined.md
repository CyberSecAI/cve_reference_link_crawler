Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2021-46972.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a dentry leak in the overlayfs filesystem.
- It occurs because, after commit 6815f479ca90 ("ovl: use only uppermetacopy state in ovl_lookup()"), overlayfs stopped putting temporary dentries when a metacopy error happens.
- This leads to dentry leaks when the related superblock is shut down.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Dentry leak
- Failure to handle metacopy errors correctly

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Dentry leaks during unmount of overlayfs.
- Busy inodes after unmount, potentially leading to a self-destruct of the filesystem and system instability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Triggering a metacopy error in overlayfs.
- Unmounting the overlayfs filesystem.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to mount and unmount overlayfs
- Ability to cause a metacopy error

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves adding a `dput(this);` call to release the dentry when refusing to follow a metacopy origin.
- The issue was discovered and reported by syzbot, a kernel fuzzer.
- The fix has been applied to Linux kernel versions 5.8 and later.
