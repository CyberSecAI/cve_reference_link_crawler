- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress WP Helper Premium Plugin <= 4.5.1 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a CSRF attack, where a malicious actor tricks an authenticated user into performing actions they did not intend.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into visiting a malicious page or link that triggers the forged request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but the victim user does.
