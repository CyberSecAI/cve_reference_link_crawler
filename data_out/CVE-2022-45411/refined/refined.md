Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45411:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability to bypass Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions using non-standard HTTP method override headers. Specifically, servers that echo the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` in the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response, and support the TRACE method along with headers like `X-Http-Method-Override`, `X-Http-Method`, or `X-Method-Override`, allow attackers to send TRACE requests even when normally restricted by CORS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CORS Bypass:** The vulnerability allows bypassing CORS protections by using HTTP method override headers.
*   **Cross-Site Tracing (XST):** Exploiting this bypass enables Cross-Site Tracing, a technique that allows attackers to obtain sensitive information.
*   **Non-Standard Headers:** The reliance on non-standard headers like `X-Http-Method-Override`, `X-Http-Method`, and `X-Method-Override` creates an unexpected attack vector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Access to Sensitive Headers:** Attackers can access authorization headers and cookies (including those with HTTPOnly flags) that are normally inaccessible to JavaScript. This could lead to account compromise or unauthorized access to sensitive data.
*   **Bypass of HTTPOnly Protection:** The vulnerability bypasses the security measure of HTTPOnly cookies by allowing attackers to read them directly from the TRACE response.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests using `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest`. These requests include the targeted TRACE method within an HTTP override header.
*   **CORS Misconfiguration:** The vulnerability depends on a specific server-side misconfiguration that echoes the `Access-Control-Request-Headers`.
*   **Vulnerable Servers:** Exploitation targets servers that implement the TRACE method and support HTTP method override headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS Vulnerability:** An existing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability on the target site is required to execute malicious code.
*   **Browser-Based Attack:** The attacker needs to execute JavaScript code within the victim's browser to make the malicious requests.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target server.

**Mitigation:**

The fix implemented in Firefox, Thunderbird, and other browsers involves blocking the use of TRACE method through HTTP override headers in `fetch()` and `XMLHttpRequest` requests. This prevents attackers from using this technique to bypass CORS protections and perform XST attacks.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by "scarlet".
*   The issue was also present in other browsers such as Chrome and Safari, leading to a coordinated fix across different browser vendors.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by updating the Fetch specification to include these headers as forbidden.
*   Mozilla awarded a security bug bounty for the report.
*   The fix was implemented by adding extra layer of validation of the specified override headers.
*   The issue is considered a moderate security risk.
