**CVE-2024-41518**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an *Incorrect Access Control* issue within the Feripro application's statistics endpoint.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper access control on the statistics endpoint. This allows unauthorized users to access and download sensitive data without any authentication or authorization checks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can download statistical data in the form of an XLSX (Excel) file, which includes detailed information such as:
    *   Number of participants
    *   Number of registrations
    *   Age and gender distribution of participants
    *   Potentially other sensitive data related to the event and participants
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is accessed via the path `/admin/programm/<program_id>/export/statistics`.
    *   No login or authentication is required to access the endpoint.
    *   The attacker simply needs the correct path to the statistics export to download the data.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker does not need any special privileges.
    *   The attacker needs to know the URL path, specifically the `program_id`.
    *   No user account is required, it can be exploited by anonymous users.

**Summary of the issue:**
The statistics endpoint for Feripro is publicly accessible, allowing anyone to download sensitive information about events and participants without logging in. This lack of access control has the potential to expose personal data to unauthorized individuals, leading to privacy and data security breaches.
