The provided content describes vulnerabilities in Saviynt Enterprise Identity Cloud, specifically related to user enumeration and authentication bypass. However, this content is associated with **VU#692873**, not CVE-2022-23855. Therefore, it is **UNRELATED** to the specified CVE.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described in the provided content (VU#692873):

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The local password reset feature in Saviynt Enterprise Identity Cloud has two vulnerabilities.
  - User enumeration is possible by specifying the `id` parameter in a specific URL, revealing usernames.
  - The password reset process can be bypassed, allowing an attacker to change a user's password without proper authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **User Enumeration:** The `id` parameter in the `/ECM/maintenance/forgotpasswordstep1` URL allows attackers to discover usernames by iterating through ID values.
- **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the password reset verification and change a user's password by manipulating the password reset flow (either unhiding a button or directly accessing a URL).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can enumerate users and change the password of an existing administrative user.
- This grants the attacker administrative access to the Saviynt Enterprise Identity Cloud instance.
- The attacker could then perform administrative actions and potentially compromise other connected authentication systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed over the network via HTTP requests.
- Attackers can directly access specific URLs to exploit the password reset process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Saviynt Enterprise Identity Cloud instance.
- No prior authentication is required to exploit the user enumeration and password reset bypass vulnerabilities.
