- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the Feed Them Social plugin. This lack of proper access control allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can perform actions intended for higher-privileged users. The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability can be exploited by an unprivileged user (e.g., a subscriber) by interacting with the vulnerable function that lacks proper access control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be a subscriber or a user with a similar level of access to exploit the vulnerability.
