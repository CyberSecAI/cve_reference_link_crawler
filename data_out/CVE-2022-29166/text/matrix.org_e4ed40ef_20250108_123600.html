Last update: 04.05.2022 09:27

We've released updates to matrix-appservice-irc and our forked node-irc that it depends on to patch a High security vulnerability.
It's advised to update to 0.34.0 as soon as possible.

The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate a Matrix user into executing IRC commands
by having them reply to a maliciously crafted message.

Incorrect handling of a CR character allowed for making part of the message be sent to the IRC server verbatim
rather than as a message to the channel.

If you are currently a matrix-appservice-irc user, exercise caution when replying to messages from untrusted participants
in IRC bridged rooms until your bridge instance has been upgraded.

The vulnerability has been patched in node-irc version 1.2.1 and matrix-appservice-irc 0.34.0.
You can get the release [on Github](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.34.0).

The bridges running on the Libera Chat, OFTC and other networks bridged by the Matrix.org Foundation have been patched.

The vulnerabilities are tracked as [GHSA-37hr-348p-rmf4](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-37hr-348p-rmf4) and
[GHSA-52rh-5rpj-c3w6](https://github.com/matrix-org/node-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-52rh-5rpj-c3w6).

Thank you, [Val Lorentz](https://valentin-lorentz.fr/) for reporting this vulnerability.
