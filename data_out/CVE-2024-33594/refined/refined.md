- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, which allows an unprivileged user to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. Specifically, the lack of proper authorization checks allows unauthenticated users to perform actions they should not have access to.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The specific impact is not detailed but could allow an attacker to perform actions with higher privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a function within the Leaky Paywall plugin that is missing appropriate access control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
