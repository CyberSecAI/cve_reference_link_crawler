- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The mknotifyd service generates a "result message" containing details about the notification handling, which may inadvertently include secrets (like passwords) that were not intended for transmission to remote sites.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information leak. The result message could expose sensitive information.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could potentially retrieve secrets (passwords, etc.) from the result message if they were able to intercept/access it. The remote site does not process the secrets but a malicious site could intercept and extract them.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote site receiving the result message could be compromised by a malicious actor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or access the result message sent back from mknotifyd.
