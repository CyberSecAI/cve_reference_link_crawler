When a notification context is sent to mknotifyd a "result message" is generated by mknotifyd and sent back so the original site so it can show if there were problems handling that notification.
This result message could contain secrets that were not meant to be sent to remote sites, e.g. passwords/secrets.

These secrets were not processed by the remote site but a rough site would have been able to retrieve these.

This issue was found during internal review.
