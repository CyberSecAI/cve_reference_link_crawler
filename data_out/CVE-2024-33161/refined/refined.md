{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `com.j2eefast.framework.sys.controller.SysRoleController: com.j2eefast.common.core.utils.ResponseData unallocatedList()` function of J2EEFAST does not filter `sql_filter` parameters.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the `sql_filter` parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.",
  "Attack vectors": "By passing malicious payload into `findUnallocatedList` function in `SysUserMapper.xml` through the `sql_filter` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the `unallocatedList` function of `SysRoleController` and supply the crafted `sql_filter` parameter."
