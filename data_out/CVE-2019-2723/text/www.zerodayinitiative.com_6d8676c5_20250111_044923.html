| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | WorkstationThis vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Oracle VirtualBox. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the processing of OHCI data. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the hypervisor. |
