{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The regexfn library is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to inefficient regular expressions used for email validation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The library uses regular expressions that can lead to catastrophic backtracking when processing specially crafted, invalid email addresses. This is a ReDoS vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing crafted, invalid email addresses to the vulnerable function. This can lead to excessive CPU usage and make the application unresponsive.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted string (invalid email address) to the isEmail function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide input to a function using the vulnerable regex from the regexfn library. No special privileges are required."
