- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation during project file upload.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper Input Validation (CWE-20). The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of project files uploaded to Nozomi Networks Guardian and CMC.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by uploading a malicious project configuration file, allowing execution of arbitrary commands with web server user privileges.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack vector is through the web interface where project configuration files are uploaded.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated with either admin or import manager roles on the affected Nozomi Networks Guardian or CMC appliance.
