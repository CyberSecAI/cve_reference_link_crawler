The provided content relates to CVE-2024-42121.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the use of `msg_id` as an array index without proper validation. The code does not check if `msg_id` is a valid non-negative value, and specifically if it is not equal to `MOD_HDCP_MESSAGE_ID_INVALID` (-1), before using it to access an array.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds access:** If `msg_id` has a negative value (specifically `MOD_HDCP_MESSAGE_ID_INVALID`, which is -1), it can lead to an out-of-bounds array access when used as an index in the `read` and `write` functions within `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/modules/hdcp/hdcp_ddc.c`. This is an **array index out-of-bounds vulnerability**.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact of the vulnerability is an **OVERRUN**, which could lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution. However, the provided text primarily focuses on the vulnerability itself and not specific exploitation scenarios.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malformed `msg_id` value passed to the `read` or `write` functions in `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/modules/hdcp/hdcp_ddc.c`. This could occur if the HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection) subsystem is handling a message with an invalid message ID.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to have the ability to influence the `msg_id` parameter passed to the `read` or `write` functions. This implies control over the communication or the ability to trigger specific code paths involving HDCP communication with the graphics driver.
