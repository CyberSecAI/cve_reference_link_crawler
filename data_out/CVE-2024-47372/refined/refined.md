Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The TNC PDF viewer WordPress plugin, in versions 3.1.0 and earlier, is vulnerable to XSS. The specific location or method of injection is not detailed, but the core issue is the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-supplied data before rendering it in the web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **XSS:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious scripts into the website. This is a client-side vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Script Injection:** Attackers can inject JavaScript or HTML code into the website.
*   **Redirects and Advertisements:** These injected scripts can cause redirects to malicious sites, display unwanted advertisements, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Website Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to website defacement, user session hijacking, and other serious security breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Injection through user-supplied data:** Attackers inject malicious payloads into the plugin via user-supplied data, which is then displayed unsanitized to users of the website. The exact data point is not specified.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Editor Privilege:** The report indicates that an "Editor" level privilege is required, suggesting that the vulnerability may be located in functionality that is available to WordPress users with this role, rather than a general unauthenticated vulnerability. However, this could be a misclassification as the attack may also be possible through other means.
