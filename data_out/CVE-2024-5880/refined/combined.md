### Description

The Hide My Site plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.2 due to the plugin not restricting access to the REST API when password protection is enabled. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain unauthorized access to the site.

It is wired plugin. It is still working even after I deactivated it.
I tried all possible methods to clear the cache, but the effect of this plugin is still remaining.

Might have been a good plugin, if only it wasn’t so buggy. I tested it on multisite, so maybe in simple WP installation it works fine.
