Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5880

**Root Cause:** The Hide My Site plugin for WordPress fails to restrict access to the REST API when password protection is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unauthenticated Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information due to the lack of access control on the REST API.
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The plugin does not enforce proper authentication or authorization checks before allowing access to the REST API, which should be protected when password protection is enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Unauthenticated attackers can gain unauthorized access to the site. The specific information that could be exposed isn't detailed, but unauthorized access to the REST API itself can reveal configuration details or allow the attacker to potentially interact with the site through the API.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely if the website is accessible over the network (i.e., the internet).
*   **REST API Exploitation:** The attacker targets the unprotected REST API endpoints of the plugin to gain access to sensitive information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker doesn't need any prior authentication or credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The plugin has been closed and is no longer available for download due to this security issue.
*   No patch is available and the recommendation is to uninstall the plugin.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions up to and including version 2.2 of the plugin.
