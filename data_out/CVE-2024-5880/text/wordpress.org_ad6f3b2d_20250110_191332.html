It is wired plugin. It is still working even after I deactivated it.
I tried all possible methods to clear the cache, but the effect of this plugin is still remaining.

Might have been a good plugin, if only it wasn’t so buggy. I tested it on multisite, so maybe in simple WP installation it works fine.
