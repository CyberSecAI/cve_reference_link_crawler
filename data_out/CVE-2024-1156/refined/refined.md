Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-1156:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Incorrect permissions in the installation directories for shared SystemLink Elixir-based services.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The vulnerability lies in the overly permissive file system permissions granted to "Users" and "Authenticated Users" on specific directories containing Elixir-based services.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An authenticated user with local access can potentially escalate their privileges. This means they could gain higher-level access to the system than they are supposed to have.
- The vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and/or system resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required for this vulnerability, so it can be exploited by an attacker who has gained local access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an authenticated user account on the target machine with local access.
- No user interaction is required.

**Affected Products:**
- SystemLink Server 2023 Q3 and prior versions.
- FlexLogger 2022 Q3 and prior
- G Web Development Software (All Editions) 2022 Q3 and prior

**Mitigation:**
- The recommended mitigation is to upgrade the affected software to the latest versions.
- If upgrading is not possible, a batch script or manual steps (provided in document) can be used to restrict file system permissions on specific directories.

**CVSS Score:**
