- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The FileTransfer class in Brocade SANnav uses the `ssh-rsa` signature scheme, which employs the SHA-1 hash algorithm. SHA-1 is considered weak and vulnerable to collision attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of a weak cryptographic hash function (SHA-1) in the `ssh-rsa` signature scheme. This weakness allows an attacker to potentially forge signatures.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack can be performed. Although the impact states "C:H/I:N/A:N", the "C:H" (High Confidentiality impact) is inconsistent with the text describing a man-in-the-middle attack, it would be more appropiate to classify the vulnerability with a high integrity impact as this would allow the attacker to perform changes on transit.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the client and server using the vulnerable `ssh-rsa` scheme. They do not need authentication to perform the attack.
