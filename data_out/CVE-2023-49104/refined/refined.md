The provided content relates to CVE-2023-49104.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `oauth2` app of ownCloud. It is caused by insufficient validation of the redirect URL during the OAuth2 flow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the ability to bypass redirect URL validation. The code fails to properly validate the provided redirect URL, specifically when subdomains are involved.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to redirect OAuth2 callbacks to a top-level domain (TLD) that they control. This could lead to various attacks, including:
-	Phishing attacks where the user is redirected to a malicious login page controlled by the attacker
-	Session hijacking where the attacker can steal the authentication token after successful login

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a specially crafted redirect URL passed to the `oauth2` app.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not require any prior authentication or elevated privileges. The attacker needs to be able to craft and send a malicious redirect URL to the application. The attacker can be unauthenticated.
