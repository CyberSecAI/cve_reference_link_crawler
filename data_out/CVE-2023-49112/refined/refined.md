Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-49112:

**Vulnerability:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

**Root Cause:** The Kiuwan API endpoint used to retrieve application information lacks proper access controls. It allows any authenticated user to query details about applications, regardless of whether they have explicit permissions to access that application's data.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The API endpoint does not enforce authorization checks to verify if the requesting user has the right to view the specified application's information.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An authenticated user can access sensitive information about applications they are not authorized to view.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **API Exploitation:** By directly querying the vulnerable API endpoint with the name of a target application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a valid, authenticated user of the Kiuwan platform.
*   **Access to "Code Security" Module**: They need to have access to the "code security" module to be able to make API requests.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable API endpoint is: `/saas/rest/v1/info/application?application=APPLICATION_NAME`.
*   By manipulating the `APPLICATION_NAME` parameter, an attacker can access information about applications they don't have explicit permissions for.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability exists in Kiuwan SAST on-premise, cloud/SaaS and Kiuwan Local Analyzer versions prior to the fixes.
*   The vulnerability was assigned the identifier `SAS-6853` within the vendor's internal tracking system and was fixed on release 2024-02-06
