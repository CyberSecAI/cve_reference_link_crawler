# [[2024-05-30] Change Log](/docs/display/K5/%5B2024-05-30%5D%2BChange%2BLog)

A Kiuwan On-Premises (KoP) update that includes the following enhancements and fixed issues.

**Contents**

**Latest Versions**

* KLA: master.1808.p685.q13371
* Engine: master.p685.q13371.a1910.i654
* Cloud: 2.8.2402.3
## Enhancements

#### Javascript language analysis

* Added .jsx extension in javascript languages analysis
* KLA (KiuwanLocalAnalyzer) now runs under Java 16

#### Cobol script

* New Cobol preprocessor script:

+ A new script (cobolPreprocess.xml) for pre-processing COBOL sources and replacing COPY statements with the content of copybooks is provided. This tool is useful when COPY statements are used in a way that makes the common strategy of parsing separately COBOL programs and copybooks lead to a high rate of parse errors but with the cost of losing the source code lines in reported defects, due to plain code substitution. The script is located in the local analyzer bin directory, and usage is as follows:

Where:

* + SOURCES\_DIR: The input
  + dialect: cobol85, cobolibm, cobolmicrofocus, coboltandem, acucobol, rmcobol.
     Default: cobol85.
  + marginType: The margin type to use when formatting. The default, autodetect, tries to detect the margin format heuristically. both\_margin is the ANSI format.
  + freeform: true | false. If true, free-format COBOL. Default: false.
  + encoding: The encoding for reading and writing files. Default: UTF-8.
  + programExtensions: Extensions for COBOL programs. Default: cob,cbl,cobol,pco.
  + copyExtensions: Extensions for COBOL copybooks. Default: cpy,copy.
  + include: Comma-separated patterns of files to include. Two asterisks mean 'all directories and subdirectories'. Default: \*/.
  + exclude: Comma-separated patterns of files to include. Default: empty.
  + OUTPUT\_DIR: Directory where the pre-processed files will be written. Defaults to the current directory.

#### JavaScript Vue.js framework

* Added support for the JavaScript Vue.js framework. The following rules were added:
  + VueComponentDataMustBeFunction: Component data must be a function.
  + VueForWithoutKey: Always use key with v-for.
  + VueHtmlEscapeDisabled: Vue HTML escaping is disabled.
  + VueIfWithForDirective: Never use v-if on the same element as v-for.

#### CWE and OWASP

* Update [CWETOP25 tags to 2021](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2021/2021_cwe_top25.html) version
* Added new mapping for the latest [2021 OWASP Top10](https://owasp.org/Top10/) list.

#### UI for user definition of neutralizers, sources, and sinks

This release includes a new Graphic User Interface (GUI) tool to allow customers to define and modify their custom metadata files. This tool should ease the process of the following actions:

* Finding the existing metadata files (both products and custom)
* Seeing the default product metadata
* Avoiding conflicts between different definitions (for all the systems/for an application/for a given analysis). Only custom metadata is allowed to be edited - but it is possible to see all existing metadata.

The tool should help the configurator to see possible alternative definitions and values for each field, it includes some tooltips and examples.

#### Insight checkpoint based on vulnerabilities

* This release includes a new Insight checkpoint based on component vulnerabilities. This checkpoint allows you to filter by group, component name or version, and by vulnerability severity risk

#### REST API endpoint to set up users and manage Life Cycle Permission

* + Kiuwan now allows to add users and set user permissions forVIEW\_LIFE\_CYCLE access rights through REST API

#### Java 16 and 17

* Kiuwan now supports Java 16 and 17
  + This new version also contains the following code quality rules for Java versions 16 and 17:

    - OPT.JAVA.DECL.AvoidDeprecatedPrimitivesConstructorsRule: Quality rule for deprecated primitive wrapper class constructors (Active for Java version 16 and up)
    - OPT.JAVA.SYNC.DoNotUseSynchronizationOnValueBasedClasses: Quality rule for synchronization on value-based classes (Active for Java version 16 and up)
    - OPT.JAVA.SERI.AvoidSerializationMethodsInRecords: Members ignored during record serialization should not be used (Active for Java version 16 and up)
    - OPT.JAVA.DECL.RecordWithArrayFieldsNotOverridingMethods: Methods should be overridden in records containing array fields (Active for Java version 16 and up)
    - OPT.JAVA.DECL.DoNotUseAppletAPI: Report usage of deprecated Applet API (Active for Java version 17 and up)
    - OPT.JAVA.SEC\_JAVA.SecurityManagerDeprecatedRule: Report usage of deprecated security manager API (Active for Java version 17 and up)

### Other Enhancements

* **QAK-6751** The engine now uses log4j version from the "reload4j" library version 1.2.25. This improves the performance and reliability of the logging mechanism used by the engine.
* **QAK-6786** Improved the detection rule for commented code in the Natural language (rule "OPT.NATURAL.NAT\_MAN.RemoveCommentedCode"). This rule may not have found commented-out code lines. The engine now checks if any line of code is commented out and reports it as a violation. This rule detects commented Natural code blocks.
* **QAK-6821** The engine now supports negation operation in the Natural language (IF #SOMETHING ¬= 'NOTHING' is an example of a negation operation in the Natural language). The engine now understands how to use logical operators like NOT and XOR in natural language expressions.
* **QAK-6936** Updated the version of the slf4j library to 1.7.36. eCore, to provide logging functionality.
* **SAS-5556** Improve Portfolio edition time

## REST API Enhancements

* Add attribute 'muted' for the endpoint /insights/analysis/security GET method
* New endpoint: GET /applications/mutepatterns
* New endpoint: GET /applications/{application}/defect/{defectId}/firstdate
* New parameter for GET /apps/analysis/{code}/defects endpoint to filter muted status
* Add PDF download to life cycle and rest API to obtain the pdf. New endpoint GET /audits/result/componentsPDF
* New parameters for GET/insights/analysis/summary/export endpoint
* New endpoint GET/auditResult/components
* New endpoint POST/applications/defects/mute
* Change return status for PUT /users/{username} endpoint when some of the applications in the request list do not exist
* GET/stats endpoint returns new "24hlocs" value.
