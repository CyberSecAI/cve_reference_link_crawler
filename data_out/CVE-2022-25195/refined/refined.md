{
  "CVE-2022-25195": {
    "Description": "autonomiq Plugin 1.15 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint. This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified username and password. Additionally, this HTTP endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.",
    "Root cause": "Missing permission check and CSRF vulnerability",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing permission check",
      "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified username and password, potentially capturing credentials.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network access via HTTP endpoint",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Overall/Read permission and ability to craft a malicious URL."
