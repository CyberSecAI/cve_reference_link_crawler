# Safe Mode bypass leads to authenticated Remote Code Execution

Moderate

[daftspunk](/daftspunk)
published
GHSA-x4q7-m6fp-4v9v
Oct 13, 2022

## Package

composer

october/system
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>2.0, >3.0

## Patched versions

2.2.34, 3.0.66

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability only affects installations that rely on the safe mode restriction, commonly used when providing public access to the admin panel. Assuming an attacker has access to the admin panel and permission to open the "Editor" section, they can bypass the Safe Mode (`cms.safe_mode`) restriction to introduce new PHP code in a CMS template using a specially crafted request.

### Patches

The issue has been patched in v2.2.34 and v3.0.66
