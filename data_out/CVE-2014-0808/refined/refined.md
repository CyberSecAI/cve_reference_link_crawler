Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2014-0808:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an authorization bypass issue in the `EC-CUBE` and `EC-Orange` e-commerce platforms. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the system handles user delivery address information within the shopping cart functionality. It fails to properly validate if a user is authorized to access or modify another user's delivery information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authorization Bypass (CWE-639):** The system does not correctly verify if a user is authorized to use the specified delivery address.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The vulnerability is caused due to a lack of proper checks on the delivery address before allowing its use by a user.
- **Permissions (CWE-264):**  The system lacks proper access controls to ensure users can only access their own data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A user of the affected shopping website can obtain other users' personal information (specifically delivery addresses) by sending a specially crafted HTTP request.
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can potentially access or modify delivery address information belonging to other users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network through HTTP requests.
- **Crafted HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to send a specially crafted HTTP request to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** An attacker needs a valid account on the affected website to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.
- **Some Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a specific HTTP request to exploit the vulnerability, but this is not overly complex.

**Additional Technical Details from the Patch Information:**

The provided patch information shows code changes to `LC_Page_Shopping_Multiple.php`, specifically the `lfCheckError` function. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the function did not verify if the selected shipping address (`other_deliv_id`) belonged to the currently logged-in user. The fix adds a check using SQL queries to ensure that the `other_deliv_id` is associated with the current user's `customer_id`.

**Affected Versions:**
- `EC-CUBE` versions 2.11.0 to 2.12.2.
- `EC-Orange` systems deployed before June 29th, 2015.

**Summary**
The vulnerability is an authorization bypass that allows a user to potentially access another user's delivery information by crafting a specific request. The fix adds a check to ensure the user is authorized to use the specified delivery address.
