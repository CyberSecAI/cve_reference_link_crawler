## Vulnerabilities

* [Med] In the case that the WOLFSSL\_CALLBACKS macro is set when building wolfSSL, there is a potential heap over read of 5 bytes when handling TLS 1.3 client connections. This heap over read is limited to wolfSSL builds explicitly setting the macro WOLFSSL\_CALLBACKS, the feature does not get turned on by any other build options. The macro WOLFSSL\_CALLBACKS is intended for debug use only, but if having it enabled in production, users are recommended to disable WOLFSSL\_CALLBACKS. Users enabling WOLFSSL\_CALLBACKS are recommended to update their version of wolfSSL. Thanks to Lucca Hirschi and Steve Kremer from LORIA, Inria and Max Ammann from Trail of Bits for finding and reporting the bug with the tlspuffin tool developed partly at LORIA and Trail of Bits. CVE 2022-42905

Release 5.5.2 of wolfSSL embedded TLS has bug fixes and new features including:

## New Feature Additions

* Add function wolfSSL\_CTX\_load\_system\_CA\_certs to load system CA certs into a WOLFSSL\_CTX and --sys-ca-certs option to example client
* Add wolfSSL\_set1\_host to OpenSSL compatible API
* Added the function sk\_X509\_shift
* AES x86 ASM for AES-CBC and GCM performance enhancements
* Add assembly for AES for ARM32 without using crypto hardware instructions
* Xilinx Versal port and hardware acceleration tie in
* SP Cortex-M support for ICCARM

## Enhancements

* Add snifftest vcxproj file and documentation
* Nucleus Thread Types supported
* Handle certificates with RSA-PSS signature that have RSAk public keys
* Small stack build improvements
* DTLS 1.3 improvements for Alerts and unit tests
* Add a binary search for CRL
* Improvement of SSL/CTX\_set\_max\_early\_data() for client side

* Add TLS 1.3 support of ticketNonce sizes bigger than MAX\_TICKET\_NONCE\_SZ
* FIPSv2 builds on win10 adjust for new fastmath default in settings.h
* Add IRQ install for Aruix example

## Fixes

* When looking up the session by ID on the server, check that the protocol version of the SSL and session match on TLS 1.3 or not
* Fix for potential EVP\_PKEY\_DH memory leak with OPENSSL\_EXTRA
* Curve448 32-bit C code: handle corner case
* Fixup builds using WOLFSSL\_LOG\_PRINTF

* Fix build with enable-fastmath and disable-rsa
* Correct wolfSSL\_sk\_X509\_new in OpenSSL compatible API
* Fixes for SP and x86\_64 with MSVC
