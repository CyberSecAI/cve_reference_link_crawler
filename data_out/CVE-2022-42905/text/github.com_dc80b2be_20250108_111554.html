[Latest](/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases/latest)

# To download the release bundle of wolfSSL visit the download page at [www.wolfssl.com/download/](http://www.wolfssl.com/download/)

NOTE:

* --enable-heapmath is deprecated.
* In this release, the default cipher suite preference is updated to prioritize

  TLS\_AES\_256\_GCM\_SHA384 over TLS\_AES\_128\_GCM\_SHA256 when enabled.
* This release adds a sanity check for including wolfssl/options.h or

  user\_settings.h.

PR stands for Pull Request, and PR references a GitHub pull request

number where the code change was added.

* [Med] An OCSP (non stapling) issue was introduced in wolfSSL version 5.7.4

  when performing OCSP requests for intermediate certificates in a certificate

  chain. This affects only TLS 1.3 connections on the server side. It would not

  impact other TLS protocol versions or connections that are not using the

  traditional OCSP implementation. (Fix in pull request 8115)

[wolfSSL Release 5.7.4 (Oct 24, 2024)](/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases/tag/v5.7.4-stable)

# To download the release bundle of wolfSSL visit the download page at [www.wolfssl.com/download/](http://www.wolfssl.com/download/)

## Vulnerabilities

* [Low] When the OpenSSL compatibility layer is enabled, certificate

  verification behaved differently in wolfSSL than OpenSSL, in the

  X509\_STORE\_add\_cert() and X509\_STORE\_load\_locations() implementations.

  Previously, in cases where an application explicitly loaded an intermediate

  certificate, wolfSSL was verifying only up to that intermediate certificate,

  rather than verifying up to the root CA. This only affects use cases where the

  API is called directly, and does not affect TLS connections. Users that call

  the API X509\_STORE\_add\_cert() or X509\_STORE\_load\_locations() directly in their

  applications are recommended to update the version of wolfSSL used or to have

  additional sanity checks on certificates loaded into the X509\_STORE when

  verifying a certificate. ([#8087](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/8087))

## PQC TLS Experimental Build Fix

* When using TLS with post quantum algorithms enabled, the connection uses a

  smaller EC curve than agreed on. Users building with --enable-experimental and

  enabling PQC cipher suites with TLS connections are recommended to update the

  version of wolfSSL used. Thanks to Daniel Correa for the report.

  ([#8084](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/8084))

[wolfSSL Release 5.7.2 (July 8, 2024)](/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases/tag/v5.7.2-stable)

NOTE: \* --enable-heapmath is being deprecated and will be removed by end of 2024

## Vulnerabilities

* [Medium] [CVE-2024-1544](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-grjj-54gm-q5vf "CVE-2024-1544")

  Potential ECDSA nonce side channel attack in versions of wolfSSL before 5.6.6 with wc\_ecc\_sign\_hash calls. Generating the ECDSA nonce k samples a random number r and then truncates this randomness with a modular reduction mod n where n is the order of the elliptic curve. Analyzing the division through a control-flow revealing side-channel reveals a bias in the most significant bits of k. Depending on the curve this is either a negligible bias or a significant bias large enough to reconstruct k with lattice reduction methods. Thanks to Luca Wilke, Florian Sieck and Thomas Eisenbarth (University of Lübeck) for reporting the vulnerability. Details will appear in the proceedings of CCS 24.

  Fixed [#7020](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7020)
* [Medium] [CVE-2024-5288](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rrg9-cmw9-3pwx "CVE-2024-5288")

  A private key blinding operation, enabled by defining the macro WOLFSSL\_BLIND\_PRIVATE\_KEY, was added to mitigate a potential row hammer attack on ECC operations. If performing ECC private key operations in an environment where a malicious user could gain fine control over the device and perform row hammer style attacks it is recommended to update the version of wolfSSL used and to build with WOLFSSL\_BLIND\_PRIVATE\_KEY defined. Thanks to Kemal Derya, M. Caner Tol, Berk Sunar for the report (Vernam Applied Cryptography and Cybersecurity Lab at Worcester Polytechnic Institute)

  Fixed in github pull request [#7416](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7416)
* [Low] When parsing a provided maliciously crafted certificate directly using wolfSSL API, outside of a TLS connection, a certificate with an excessively large number of extensions could lead to a potential DoS. There are existing sanity checks during a TLS handshake with wolfSSL which mitigate this issue. Thanks to Bing Shi for the report.

  Fixed in github pull request [#7597](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7597)
* [Low] [CVE-2024-5991](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jwjf-h4v6-qrpp "CVE-2024-5991")

  In the function MatchDomainName(), input param str is treated as a NULL terminated string despite being user provided and unchecked. Specifically, the Openssl compatibility function X509\_check\_host() takes in a pointer and length to check against, with no requirements that it be NULL terminated. While calling without a NULL terminated string is very uncommon, it is still technically allowed. If a caller was attempting to do a name check on a non\*NULL terminated buffer, the code would read beyond the bounds of the input array until it found a NULL terminator.

  Fixed in github pull request [#7604](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7604)
* [Medium] [CVE-2024-5814](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8cr7-x5g8-m3f3 "CVE-2024-5814")

  A malicious TLS1.2 server can force a TLS1.3 client with downgrade capability to use a ciphersuite that it did not agree to and achieve a successful connection. This is because, aside from the extensions, the client was skipping fully parsing the server hello when downgrading from TLS 1.3.

  Fixed in github pull request [#7619](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7619)
* [Medium] OCSP stapling version 2 response verification bypass issue when a crafted response of length 0 is received. Found with internal testing.

  Fixed in github pull request [#7702](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7702)
* [Medium] OCSP stapling version 2 revocation bypass with a retry of a TLS connection attempt. A revoked CA certificate could incorrectly be loaded into the trusted signers list and used in a repeat connection attempt. Found with internal testing.

  Fixed in github pull request [#7702](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7702)

[wolfSSL Release 5.7.0 (Mar 20, 2024)](/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases/tag/v5.7.0-stable)

NOTE: \* --enable-heapmath is being deprecated and will be removed by end of 2024

NOTE: In future releases, --enable-des3 (which is disabled by default) will be insufficient in itself to enable DES3 in TLS cipher suites. A new option, --enable-des3-tls-suites, will need to be supplied in addition. This option should only be used in backward compatibility scenarios, as it is inherently insecure.

NOTE: This release switches the default ASN.1 parser to the new ASN template code. If the original ASN.1 code is preferred define `WOLFSSL_ASN_ORIGINAL` to use it. See PR [#7199](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7199).

## Vulnerabilities

* [High] [CVE-2024-0901](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qrv4-68mg-fv43 "CVE-2024-0901") Potential denial of service and out of bounds read. Affects TLS 1.3 on the server side when accepting a connection from a malicious TLS 1.3 client. If using TLS 1.3 on the server side it is recommended to update the version of wolfSSL used. Fixed in this GitHub pull request [#7099](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7099)
* [Med] [CVE-2024-1545](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9chr-m38j-w26g "CVE-2024-1545") Fault Injection vulnerability in RsaPrivateDecryption function that potentially allows an attacker that has access to the same system with a victims process to perform a Rowhammer fault injection. Thanks to Junkai Liang, Zhi Zhang, Xin Zhang, Qingni Shen for the report (Peking University, The University of Western Australia)."

  Fixed in this GitHub pull request [#7167](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7167)
* [Med] Fault injection attack with EdDSA signature operations. This affects ed25519 sign operations where the system could be susceptible to Rowhammer attacks. Thanks to Junkai Liang, Zhi Zhang, Xin Zhang, Qingni Shen for the report (Peking University, The University of Western Australia).

  Fixed in this GitHub pull request [#7212](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7212)

[wolfSSL Release 5.6.6 (Dec 19, 2023)](/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases/tag/v5.6.6-stable)

NOTE: \* --enable-heapmath is being deprecated and will be removed by 2024

REMINDER: When working with AES Block Cipher algorithms, `wc_AesInit()` should always be called first to initialize the `Aes` structure, before calling other Aes API functions. Recently we found several places in our documentation, comments, and codebase where this pattern was not observed. We have since fixed this omission in several PRs for this release.

## Vulnerabilities

* [Medium] [CVE-2023-6935](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r36f-f47x-637q "CVE-2023-6935"): After review of the previous RSA timing fix in wolfSSL 5.6.4, additional changes were found to be required. A complete resistant change is delivered in this release. This fix is for the Marvin attack, leading to being able to decrypt a saved TLS connection and potentially forge a signature after probing with a very large number of trial connections. This issue is around RSA decryption and affects the optional static RSA cipher suites on the server side, which are considered weak, not recommended to be used and are off by default in wolfSSL (even with `--enable-all`). Static RSA cipher suites were also removed from the TLS 1.3 protocol and are only present in TLS 1.2 and lower. All padding versions of RSA decrypt are affected since the code under review is outside of the padding processing. Information about the private keys is NOT compromised in affected code. It is recommended to disable static RSA cipher suites and update the version of wolfSSL used if using RSA private decryption alone outside of TLS. Thanks to Hubert Kario for the report. The fix for this issue is located in the following GitHub Pull Request: [#6955](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/6955).
* [Low] [CVE-2023-6936](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cwpg-8775-j56v "CVE-2023-6936"): A potential heap overflow read is possible in servers connecting over TLS 1.3 when the optional `WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS` has been defined. The out of bounds read can occur when a server receives a malicious malformed ClientHello. Users should either discontinue use of `WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS` on the server side or update versions of wolfSSL to 5.6.6. Thanks to the tlspuffin fuzzer team for the report which was designed and developed by; Lucca Hirschi (Inria, LORIA), Steve Kremer (Inria, LORIA), and Max Ammann (Trail of Bits). The fix for this issue is located in the following GitHub Pull Request: [#6949](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/6949).
* [Low] A side channel vulnerability with AES T-Tables is possible in a very controlled environment where precision sub-cache-line inspection can happen, such as inside an Intel SGX enclave. This can lead to recovery of the AES key. To prevent this type of attack, wolfSSL added an AES bitsliced implementation which can be enabled with the “`--enable-aes-bitsliced`” configure option. Thanks to Florian Sieck, Zhiyuan Zhang, Sebastian Berndt, Chitchanok Chuengsatiansup, Thomas Eisenbarth, and Yuval Yarom for the report (Universities of Lübeck, Melbourne, Adelaide and Bochum). The fix for this issue is located in the following GitHub Pull Request: [#6854](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/6854).
* [Low] [CVE-2023-6937](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ff3x-q8pg-rh37 "CVE-2023-6937"): wolfSSL prior to 5.6.6 did not check that messages in a single (D)TLS record do not span key boundaries. As a result, it was possible to combine (D)TLS messages using different keys into one (D)TLS record. The most extreme edge case is that, in (D)TLS 1.3, it was possible that an unencrypted (D)TLS 1.3 record from the server containing first a ServerHello message and then the rest of the first server flight would be accepted by a wolfSSL client. In (D)TLS 1.3 the handshake is encrypted after the ServerHello but a wolfSSL client would accept an unencrypted flight from the server. This does not compromise key negotiation and authentication so it is assigned a low severity rating. Thanks to Johannes Wilson for the report (Sectra Communications and Linköping University). The fix for this issue is located in the following GitHub Pull Request: [#7029](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7029).

[wolfSSL Release 5.6.4 (October 30, 2023)](/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases/tag/v5.6.4-stable)

NOTE: \* --enable-heapmath is being deprecated and will be removed by 2024

\* Old CyaSSL/CtaoCrypt shim layer was removed in this release (5.6.4)

## Vulnerabilities

* [Medium] A fix was added, but still under review for completeness, for a Bleichenbacher style attack, leading to being able to decrypt a saved TLS connection and potentially forge a signature after probing with a large number of trial connections. This issue is around RSA decryption and affects static RSA cipher suites on the server side, which are not recommended to be used and are off by default. Static RSA cipher suites were also removed from the TLS 1.3 protocol and only present in TLS 1.2 and lower. All padding versions of RSA decrypt are affected since the code under review is outside of the padding processing. Information about the private keys is NOT compromised in affected code. It's recommended to disable static RSA cipher suites and update the version of wolfSSL used if using RSA private decryption alone outside of TLS. The fix is located in this pull request ([#6896](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/6896))

## New Feature Additions

* DTLS 1.3 PQC: support fragmenting the second ClientHello message. This allows arbitrarily long keys to be used, opening up support for all PQC ciphersuites in DTLS 1.3.
* SM2/SM3/SM4: Chinese cipher support including TLS 1.3 and 1.2 cipher suites. SM2 SP implementation available.
* Ability to parse ASN1 only with SMIME\_read\_PKCS7
* Added support for MemUse Entropy on Windows
* Added Ada Bindings for wolfSSL
* Added a PEM example that converts to and from DER/PEM.
* Added LMS/HSS and XMSS/XMSS^MT wolfcrypt hooks, both normal and verify-only options.
* Added support for the AES EAX mode of operation
* Port for use with Hitch (<https://github.com/varnish/hitch>) added
* Add XTS API's to handle multiple sectors in new port ot VeraCrypt

## Enhancements and Optimizations

* Turned on SNI by default on hosts with resources
* Improved support for Silicon Labs Simplicity Studio and the ERF32 Gecko SDK
* Thumb-2 and ARM32 Curve25519 and Ed25519 assembly have significantly improved performance.
* Thumb-2 AES assembly code added.
* Thumb-2 and ARM32 SP implementations of RSA, DH and ECC have significantly improved performance.
* Minor performance improvements to SP ECC for Intel x64.
* AES-XTS assembly code added for Intel x64, Aarch64 and ARM32.
* Added support for X963 KDFs to ECIES.
* Added 32-bit type only implementation of AES GMULT using tables.
* Add support for nginx version 1.25.0
* Add support for Kerberos version 5 1.21.1
* Check all CRL entries in case a single issuer has multiple CRL's loaded
* CRL verify the entire chain including loaded CA's
* Added example for building wolfSSL as an Apple universal binary framework using configure
* Sniffer tool now supports decrypting TLS sessions using secrets obtained from a SSLKEYLOGFILE
* Updates made for EBSNET port
* Update "--enable-jni" to include additional defines for expanded JNI support. Also includes JCE and JSSE builds under the single enable option now.

## Fixes

* Fixed error handling when decrypted pre-master secret is too long when using static RSA.
* Added a fix for keymod use with i.MX RT1170 CAAM blobs
* Added a fix for AES-GCM use with Petalinux Xilinx
* Fixed `wc_SignatureGenerate_ex` to not call verify twice
* Fixed wolfCrypt FIPS DLL on Win32
* Fixed TFM math library big-endian reading implementation when a zero length buffer is passed in.
* Fixed NO\_CERT configurations to build correctly.
* Fixed ARM AES-GCM streaming assembly when –enable-opensslextra defined.
* Added modulus checks to heap math implementation of mp\_exptmod().
* Fixed Windows assembly code to handle that certain XMM registers are non-volatile.
* Aarch64 SP ECC implementation of sp\_256\_mont\_dbl\_4 has the register list for the assembly code fixed to include all used registers.
* mp\_sqrt\_mod\_prime fixed to limit the number of iterations of a loop to handle malicious non-prime values being passed in.
* Ignore session ID's shorter than 32 bytes instead of erroring out

[wolfSSL Release 5.6.3 (June 20, 2023)](/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases/tag/v5.6.3-stable)

Release 5.6.3 of wolfSSL embedded TLS has 4 bug fixes:

* Fix for setting the atomic macro options introduced in release 5.6.2. This issue affects GNU gcc autoconf builds. The fix resolves a potential mismatch of the generated macros defined in options.h file and the macros used when the wolfSSL library is compiled. In version 5.6.2 this mismatch could result in unstable runtime behavior.
* Fix for invalid suffix error with Windows build using the macro GCM\_TABLE\_4BIT.
* Improvements to Encrypted Memory support (WC\_PROTECT\_ENCRYPTED\_MEM) implementations for modular exponentiation in SP math-all (sp\_int.c) and TFM (tfm.c).
* Improvements to SendAlert for getting output buffer.

[wolfSSL Release 5.6.2 (Jun 09, 2023)](/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases/tag/v5.6.2-stable)

Release 5.6.2 has been developed according to wolfSSL's development and QA process (see link below) and successfully passed the quality criteria.

<https://www.wolfssl.com/about/wolfssl-software-development-process-quality-assurance>

NOTE: \* --enable-heapmath is being deprecated and will be removed by 2024

Release 5.6.2 of wolfSSL embedded TLS has bug fixes and new features including:

## Vulnerabilities

* [Low] In cases where a malicious agent could analyze cache timing at a very detailed level, information about the AES key used could be leaked during T/S Box lookups. One such case was shown on RISC-V hardware using the MicroWalk tool (<https://github.com/microwalk-project/Microwalk>). A hardened version of T/S Box lookups was added in wolfSSL to help mitigate this potential attack and is now on by default with RISC-V builds and can be enabled on other builds if desired by compiling wolfSSL with the macro WOLFSSL\_AES\_TOUCH\_LINES. Thanks to Jan Wichelmann, Christopher Peredy, Florian Sieck, Anna Pätschke, Thomas Eisenbarth (University of Lübeck): MAMBO-V: Dynamic Side-Channel Leakage Analysis on RISC-V. Fixed in the following GitHub pull request [#6309](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/6309)
* [High] In previous versions of wolfSSL if a TLS 1.3 client gets neither a PSK (pre shared key) extension nor a KSE (key share extension) when connecting to a malicious server, a default predictable buffer gets used for the IKM value when generating the session master secret. Using a potentially known IKM value when generating the session master secret key compromises the key generated, allowing an eavesdropper to reconstruct it and potentially allowing surreptitious access to or meddling with message contents in the session. This issue does not affect client validation of connected servers, nor expose private key information, but could result in an insecure TLS 1.3 session when not controlling both sides of the connection. We recommend that TLS 1.3 client side users update the version of wolfSSL used. Thanks to Johannes from Sectra Communications and Linköping University for the report. Fixed in the following GitHub pull request [#6412](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/6412)
