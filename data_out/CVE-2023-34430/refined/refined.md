- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled search path
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software does not properly control the locations it searches for files or resources.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user with local access can escalate their privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required, and the user must be authenticated. The user needs to trigger the uncontrolled search path to load malicious resources.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the system. User interaction may be required.
