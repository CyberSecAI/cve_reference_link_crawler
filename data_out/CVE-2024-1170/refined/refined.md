Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1170:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2024-1170. Both the Wordfence article and the WordPress plugin's Trac indicate a vulnerability in the "Post Form – Registration Form – Profile Form for User Profiles – Frontend Content Forms for User Submissions (UGC)" plugin, where unauthenticated users can delete media files. This aligns with the description of CVE-2024-1170: "Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Media Deletion".

**2. Vulnerability details:**

   - **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `handle_deleted_media` function within the plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not verify if a user has the necessary privileges before allowing them to delete media files.

   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
      - **Missing Authorization:** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper access control, allowing unauthenticated users to interact with the sensitive `handle_deleted_media` function.

   - **Impact of Exploitation:**
      - **High Integrity Impact:** An attacker can delete arbitrary media files from the WordPress site. This results in a high impact on the integrity of the site's content as files can be removed without proper authorization.
       - **Low Availability Impact:** Deleting media files may affect the site availability due to missing resources, however this is more limited.

   - **Attack Vectors:**
        - The vulnerability is accessible via the network.
        - Unauthenticated users can trigger this vulnerability.

   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
