The Post Form – Registration Form – Profile Form for User Profiles – Frontend Content Forms for User Submissions (UGC) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized media file deletion due to a missing capability check on the handle_deleted_media function in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary media files.
