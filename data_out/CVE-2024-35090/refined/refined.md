**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-35090

**Affected Product:** J2EEFAST v2.7.0

**Fixed Version:** J2EEFAST v2.8.0 (as indicated on the project page. The provided txt file incorrectly states the fix was in v2.7.0, which is also the affected version.)

**Vendor:** https://www.j2eefast.com/

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is located in `com.j2eefast.framework.sys.controller.SysUreportFileController` within the `list()` function.
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `findPage` function within `SysUreportFileMapper.xml`.

**Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection

**Attack Vector:** The SQL injection occurs through the `findPage` function called from the  `list()` function in `SysUreportFileController`.

**Impact:** SQL injection vulnerability, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or other malicious activities by exploiting the database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to send malicious requests to the `list()` function in the `SysUreportFileController` that would inject malicious SQL into the findPage function via the SysUreportFileMapper.xml.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided Github file includes a prose description of the vulnerability which is "J2EEFAST v2.7.0 was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability via the findPage function in SysUreportFileMapper.xml."
- The J2eeFAST website mentions that SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks are mitigated, however the provided information contradicts that statement by detailing a SQL injection vulnerability in version 2.7.0.
