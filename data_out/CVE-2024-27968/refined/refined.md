- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or access.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by tricking an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that sends crafted requests to the vulnerable WordPress plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into performing a malicious action, often through social engineering, such as through email, messaging or malicious websites. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
