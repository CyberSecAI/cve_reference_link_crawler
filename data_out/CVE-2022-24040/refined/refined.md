Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-24040:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The web application does not enforce an upper bound on the cost factor of the PBKDF2 derived key during account creation or updates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Uncontrolled Resource Consumption: The lack of a limit on the PBKDF2 cost factor allows an attacker to set an extremely high cost, leading to excessive CPU consumption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Denial of Service (DoS): By setting a high PBKDF2 cost factor, an attacker can cause a DoS condition when a login attempt is made to the modified account, exhausting CPU resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Network-based: The attack is performed remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- User Profile Access Privilege: The attacker needs to have the privilege to create or modify user accounts on the affected system.
