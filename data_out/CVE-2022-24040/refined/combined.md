SUMMARY

Desigo PXC3, PXC4, PXC5 and DXR2 devices contain multiple vulnerabilities in the webserver application
that could allow an attacker to potentially intercept unencrypted transmission of sensitive information,
cause a denial of service condition, or perform remote code execution.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Desigo DXR2 controllers are compact, programmable automation stations with increased functionality
and ﬂexibility to support the demands for standard control of terminal HVAC equipment and TRA (Total
Room Automation) applications.

The Desigo PXC3 series room automation stations can be used for buildings with more sophisticated
requirements on functionality and ﬂexibility. Desigo Room Automation is used when several disciplines
(HVAC, lighting, shading) are combined to form one solution and when high ﬂexibility is required.

The Desigo PXC4 building automation controller was designed for HVAC systems controls.
It was
developed as a compact device with built in IOs with the ability to expand to your needs using addition
TX-IO modules.

The Desigo PXC5 is a freely programmable controller for BACnet system-level functions such as alarm
routing, system-wide scheduling and trending, as well as device monitoring.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-24039

The “addCell” JavaScript function fails to properly sanitize user-controllable input before including it
into the generated XML body of the XLS report document, such that it is possible to inject arbitrary
content (e.g., XML tags) into the generated ﬁle.

An attacker with restricted privileges, by poisoning any of the content used to generate XLS reports,
could be able to leverage the application to deliver malicious ﬁles against higher-privileged users and
obtain Remote Code Execution (RCE) against the administrator’s workstation.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-24040

The web application fails to enforce an upper bound to the cost factor of the PBKDF2 derived key
during the creation or update of an account.

An attacker with the user proﬁle access privilege could cause a denial of service (DoS) condition
through CPU consumption by setting a PBKDF2 derived key with a remarkably high cost effort and
then attempting a login to the so-modiﬁed account.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-24041

The web application stores the PBKDF2 derived key of users passwords with a low iteration count.

An attacker with user proﬁle access privilege can retrieve the stored password hashes of other
accounts and then successfully perform an ofﬂine cracking attack and recover the plaintext passwords
of other users.

Effort

Vulnerability CVE-2022-24042

The web application returns an AuthToken that does not expire at the deﬁned auto logoff delay timeout.

An attacker could be able to capture this token and re-use old session credentials or session IDs for
authorization.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-24043

The login functionality of the application fails to normalize the response times of login attempts
performed with wrong usernames with the ones executed with correct usernames.

A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this side-channel information to perform a username
enumeration attack and identify valid usernames.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-24044

The login functionality of the application does not employ any countermeasures against Password
Spraying attacks or Credential Stufﬁng attacks.

An attacker could obtain a list of valid usernames on the device by exploiting the issue and then
perform a precise Password Spraying or Credential Stufﬁng attack in order to obtain access to at least
one account.

tempts

Vulnerability CVE-2022-24045

The application, after a successful login, sets the session cookie on the browser via client-side
JavaScript code, without applying any security attributes (such as “Secure”, “HttpOnly”, or “SameSite”).

Any attempts to browse the application via unencrypted HTTP protocol would lead to the transmission
of all his/her session cookies in plaintext through the network. An attacker could then be able to sniff
the network and capture sensitive information.
