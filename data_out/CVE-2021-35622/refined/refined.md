Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-35622:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content includes mentions of CVE-2021-35622 in both the Oracle and NetApp documents. The Oracle document lists it within the "Oracle MySQL Risk Matrix" section, and the NetApp document explicitly states that their advisory covers CVE-2021-35622 among other MySQL vulnerabilities. Therefore, the content is relevant to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Oracle document provides a general overview of the vulnerability but does not specify the root cause, simply stating that it is a "Server: Security: Encryption" issue.
*   The NetApp document states that multiple MySQL versions are susceptible to vulnerabilities without specifying a specific root cause for CVE-2021-35622.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the "Security: Encryption" component of the MySQL Server. This suggests there might be a flaw in the implementation or handling of encryption within MySQL.
*   Both documents classify the vulnerability as affecting MySQL Server.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   According to the Oracle document: the potential impact includes a compromise of "Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability" with a medium CVSS score of 4.9.
*   NetApp's document states that exploitation could lead to unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, unauthorized read or modification access to data, or a denial-of-service (DoS). They assign a CVSS score of 4.9 with a base vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H indicating a medium severity.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The Oracle document lists the attack vector as "Network". The Protocol is "MySQL Protocol". It's classified as an exploit with a "Low" impact to confidentiality and integrity, but a "High" impact to availability.
*   NetApp's CVSS vector "AV:N" indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited over the network.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The Oracle document specifies the "Privileges Required" as "None". However, it does not specify the attacker's position relative to the target system.
*   NetApp's CVSS vector, "PR:H", implies that a high level of privileges is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   Both documents mention that patches are required to fix this issue.
*   The NetApp advisory lists several other CVEs related to MySQL Server vulnerabilities, indicating this is one of many issues addressed in their advisory and Oracle's October 2021 CPU.
*   The provided information suggests this is a medium-severity vulnerability that can be exploited over a network by an attacker with elevated privileges.

**Summary of CVE-2021-35622:**
*   **Root Cause:** Flaw in the MySQL Server's encryption handling.
*   **Weakness:** Vulnerability in the MySQL Server's "Security: Encryption" component.
*   **Impact:** Potential for unauthorized access, data modification, or DoS.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based attacks using the MySQL protocol.
*   **Attacker Requirements:** Requires elevated privileges on the MySQL server.
