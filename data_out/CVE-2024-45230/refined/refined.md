### CVE-2024-45230
**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `urlize()` and `urlizetrunc()` functions in `django.utils.html` are susceptible to a potential denial-of-service attack when processing very large inputs containing specific sequences of characters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Regular expression complexity: The underlying regular expression used in `urlize()` and `urlizetrunc()` can become computationally expensive with specific large and crafted inputs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause a server to become unresponsive or crash by providing an extremely large input with a particular sequence of characters to `urlize()` or `urlizetrunc()`, consuming excessive resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious input: An attacker could craft a large input string with a specific sequence of characters and submit it to an application where the input is processed by the vulnerable functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted input to the `urlize()` or `urlizetrunc()` functions. This could be via a form input, URL parameter, or any other method that allows the attacker to control the input string.

**Affected Versions:**
- Django 5.1
- Django 5.0
- Django 4.2
