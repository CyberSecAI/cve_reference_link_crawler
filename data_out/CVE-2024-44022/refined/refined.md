Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The WordPress plugin "Review & testimonial widgets" is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin does not properly sanitize user input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected into the website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious actor could inject malicious scripts into the website.
- These scripts could be used for various malicious purposes such as:
    - Redirecting users to other websites.
    - Displaying unwanted advertisements.
    - Stealing user session cookies
    - Performing other actions through HTML/JavaScript code injection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious actor could inject malicious scripts, likely through a form or other input field within the plugin.
- The injected script would then be executed when a user visits the affected part of the website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would likely need the 'contributor' level access, as mentioned in the "Required privilege" section, to inject the malicious payload into a location where it would be executed. The location of the injection is not specified.
