Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists within the `IRP_MJ_READ` handler of the `psmounterex.sys` driver in Macrium Reflect.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The driver allocates a buffer of a user-controlled size. When reading from a file specified by the user, the driver doesn't properly validate if the file size exceeds the allocated buffer. This leads to writing data beyond the allocated memory, which corrupts the kernel heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Kernel heap corruption
- Potential complete loss of system integrity

**Attack Vectors:**
- By sending specific IRP requests to the `psmounterex.sys` driver, an attacker can control the allocated buffer size and specify the file to read.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the size of the file being read exceeds the allocated buffer size.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to interact with the vulnerable driver.
- The attacker must have local privileges on the system to trigger the vulnerability (PR:L in the CVSS score).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability has been present since at least 2019
- The vulnerability is triggered by a file read operation that exceeds the allocated buffer.
- The vulnerability is triggered when reading a file from disk specified by the user.

**Affected Versions:**
- Macrium Reflect v8.1.7544 and earlier.

**Patch Information:**
- Fixed in version v8.1.7675
