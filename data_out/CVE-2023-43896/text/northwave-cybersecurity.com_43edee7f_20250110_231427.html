# Macrium reflect driver out of bounds write

[*See all Vulnerability notices*](/vulnerability-notice?hsLang=en)

*Date: 09-10-2023*

### CVE NUMBER

CVE-2023-43896(2)

### CVSS SCORE

9.3 - CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H

### SUMMARY

Inside the IRP\_MJ\_READ handler of the psmounterex.sys driver of Macrium Reflect exists an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. Abusing this vulnerability could lead to corruption of the kernel heap and potentially complete loss of integrity of the system.

### Impacted Versions

v8.1.7544 and before (bug has been present since at least 2019)

### DETAILS

The driver allows us to set the size for an allocation that is later used to read in a file from disk. We control which file is read from disk. If the file size exceeds the size of the allocation, the file's contents are written beyond the boundary of the allocation.

Setting the allocation size to 0x10, receiving back a pointer to that allocation:

Creating the following file on disk:

![999f51d627ae6ee65a61acf7efe1e9a6](https://northwave-cybersecurity.com/hs-fs/hubfs/999f51d627ae6ee65a61acf7efe1e9a6.png?width=322&height=75&name=999f51d627ae6ee65a61acf7efe1e9a6.png)

Then having the driver read from the file, we can see the A's extend beyond the 0x10 byte buffer:
