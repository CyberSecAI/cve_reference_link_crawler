## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# The Post Grid < 7.5.0 - Editor+ Stored XSS via Grid Creation

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its Grid settings, which could allow high privilege users such as Editor and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to "The Post Grid > Add New Grid"
2. Add a new grid and in the "Style" section add the payload `123"asdasd='' onmouseover='alert(1)'` to the "Parent Class"
3. Add the grid shortcode to a post or page and see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
