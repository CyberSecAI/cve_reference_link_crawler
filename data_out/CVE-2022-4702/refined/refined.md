Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-4702:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control and nonce checks on the `wpr_fix_royal_compatibility` AJAX action within the Royal Elementor Addons plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The AJAX action `wpr_fix_royal_compatibility` does not verify user capabilities or use nonce checks, making it accessible to any authenticated user, regardless of their role or permissions.
- **Plugin Deactivation:** The vulnerable function deactivates all active plugins except a hardcoded list, potentially disabling essential site functionality and security measures.
- **Theme Switching:** The function also switches the site's theme to "royal-elementor-kit" without checking if it's installed, which can cause a loss of site availability if the theme is missing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Site Disruption/Downtime:** Deactivating necessary plugins or switching to a non-existent theme can render a website inaccessible or dysfunctional.
- **Security Compromise:** Deactivating security plugins exposes the site to other potential attacks.
- **Data Loss/Corruption:** While not directly stated, deactivating plugins can lead to unpredictable behavior or data loss, depending on the deactivated plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **AJAX Call:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted AJAX request to the `wpr_fix_royal_compatibility` action.
- **Authenticated User:** Any logged-in user, including those with minimal permissions such as "subscriber," can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of AJAX Action:** The attacker needs to know the name of the vulnerable AJAX action (`wpr_fix_royal_compatibility`).

**Additional Notes:**
- The Wordfence article also notes that a patch was released to address this vulnerability. The patched version is 1.3.60 and later.
- Wordfence also provides a firewall rule for Wordfence Premium, Care and Response users to mitigate the vulnerability.
- Free users of Wordfence would receive the protection 30 days later.
