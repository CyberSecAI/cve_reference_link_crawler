## Remediation/Fixes

IBM strongly recommends that any instance originally created from an affected container version and using the initial encryption keys or network certificates to update their keystores by:

1. Upgrading the container image to 7.0.5.10 or later, 7.1.2.6 or later, 7.2.1.1 or later from the IBM Entitled Registry.
2. Replace any affected cryptographic keys using the [Fix4ContainerKeystores](https://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/downloadFixes?parent=ibm%7ERational&product=ibm/Rational/IBM+UrbanCode+Deploy&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=ContainerKeystoresFixPack-IBM-UrbanCode-Deploy&includeRequisites=1&includeSupersedes=0&downloadMethod=http "Fix4ContainerKeystores") directions and tools ([here](https://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/downloadFixes?parent=ibm%7ERational&product=ibm/Rational/IBM+UrbanCode+Deploy&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=ContainerKeystoresFixPack-IBM-UrbanCode-Deploy&includeRequisites=1&includeSupersedes=0&downloadMethod=http "here"))
