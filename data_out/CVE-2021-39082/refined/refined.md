{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The provided UC Deploy Container images contain non-unique HTTPS certificates and a database encryption key.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of hard-coded or non-unique cryptographic keys and certificates"
    ],
     "impact": "Exposure of sensitive data if the non-unique keys and certificates are exploited",
    "attack_vectors": "Exploitation would occur through the reuse of cryptographic material across multiple deployments which would allow for the potential decryption and access to sensitive information.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need access to the non-unique keys and certificates from a compromised deployment or knowledge that would allow them to leverage a non-unique key or certificate."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "UCD - IBM UrbanCode Deploy versions 7.0.3.4.1044170 through 7.2.1.0.1123293, as specified in the table."
  ],
  "remediation": "Upgrade the container image to 7.0.5.10 or later, 7.1.2.6 or later, 7.2.1.1 or later from the IBM Entitled Registry and replace any affected cryptographic keys using the provided Fix4ContainerKeystores tools and directions.",
   "workarounds": "None"
