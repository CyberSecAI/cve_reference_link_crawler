  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "By factory default, all Ethernet ports on the SICK SIM1012 are open to allow full programmability. If unused ports are not closed, it could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to impact the device.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Access Control (CWE-284)"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can connect to the SIM1012, interact with the device, change configurations, reset the device, and potentially upload new firmware. This could lead to a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the device.",

      "Network-based"

  "remediation": "SICK recommends disabling ports 2111 and 2122 once the SIM1012 is put into operation. The instructions to disable these ports are available in the SIM1012 API documentation. SICK also suggests using the SICK AppManager version 1.5.6 or later for commissioning the device.",
