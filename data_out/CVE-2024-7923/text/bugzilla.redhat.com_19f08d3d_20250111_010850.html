| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2305718#c0)  Avinash Hanwate    2024-08-19 12:40:08 UTC  ``` An authentication bypass vulnerability has been identified in Foreman when deployed with Gunicorn versions prior to 22.0, due to the puppet-foreman configuration. This issue arises from Apache's mod_proxy not properly unsetting headers because of restrictions on underscores in HTTP headers, allowing authentication through a malformed header. This flaw impacts all active Satellite deployments (6.13, 6.14 and 6.15) which are using Pulpcore version 4.0+ and could potentially enable unauthorized users to gain administrative access.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2305718#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-04 14:45:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Satellite 6.15 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:6335 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6335](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6335)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2305718#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-04 14:48:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Satellite 6.13 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:6337 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6337](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6337)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2305718#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-04 14:48:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Satellite 6.14 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:6336 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6336](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6336)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2305718#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-05 17:25:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Satellite 6.16 for RHEL 8   Red Hat Satellite 6.16 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2024:8906 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8906](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8906)   ``` |  |
