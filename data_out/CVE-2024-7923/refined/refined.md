  "vulnerability": "CVE-2024-7923",
  "affected_components": [
    "puppet-pulpcore"
  ],
  "root_cause": "An authentication bypass vulnerability has been identified in Pulpcore when deployed with Gunicorn versions prior to 22.0, due to the puppet-pulpcore configuration. This issue arises from Apache's mod_proxy not properly unsetting headers because of restrictions on underscores in HTTP headers, allowing authentication through a malformed header.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Authentication bypass",
    "Improper header handling by Apache's mod_proxy",
    "Underscore restrictions in HTTP headers"
   ],
  "impact": "Unauthorized users could gain administrative access.",
  "attack_vector": "By crafting a malformed header in an HTTP request to exploit the incorrect header handling by Apache's mod_proxy in configurations where Pulpcore is deployed with Gunicorn versions prior to 22.0",
  "required_capabilities": "Ability to craft and send malformed headers in HTTP requests",
   "additional_information": "This flaw impacts all active Satellite deployments (6.13, 6.14 and 6.15) which are using Pulpcore version 3.0+."
