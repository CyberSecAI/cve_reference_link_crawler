- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect authorization in the firmware upgrade functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Incorrect authorization leading to a bypass of firmware integrity checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Remote authenticated users with administrator privileges can bypass firmware integrity checks, potentially allowing for the installation of malicious firmware.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to be a remote authenticated user with administrator privileges.
