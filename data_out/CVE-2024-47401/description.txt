Mattermost versions 9.10.x <= 9.10.2, 9.11.x <= 9.11.1 and 9.5.x <= 9.5.9 fail to prevent detailed error messages from being displayed in Playbooks which allows an attacker to generate a large response and cause an amplified GraphQL response which in turn could cause the application to crash by sending a specially crafted request to Playbooks.
