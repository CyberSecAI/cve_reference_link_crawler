CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. Prior to CodeIgniter4 version 4.4.3, if an error or exception occurs, a detailed error report is displayed even if in the production environment. As a result, confidential information may be leaked. Version 4.4.3 contains a patch. As a workaround, replace `ini_set('display_errors', '0')` with `ini_set('display_errors', 'Off')` in `app/Config/Boot/production.php`.
