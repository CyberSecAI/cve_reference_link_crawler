Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `DhcpListClient` function of Tenda FH1201 firmware version 1.2.0.14. The vulnerability occurs because the function doesn't validate the length of the `list1` parameter before copying it to the stack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow: The lack of bounds checking on the `list1` parameter allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution: Overwriting the stack can lead to control of the program flow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- Denial of service: A stack overflow can crash the affected device, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/DhcpListClient` endpoint.
- Malicious payload: The attacker includes a long string (e.g., 2000 bytes of "a") in the `list1` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router on the network.
- Basic understanding of HTTP requests and parameters.
