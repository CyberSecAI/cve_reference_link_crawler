Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetApp products incorporate the Oracle Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) software libraries. Certain Java SE (JDK and JRE) versions are susceptible to vulnerabilities that could allow the compromise of Java SE via network access, lead to unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (DoS) of Java SE, or allow unauthorized read, update, insert or delete access to some Java SE accessible data. Refer to âOracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2021â for specific version details.

#### Impact

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow the compromise of Java SE via network access, lead to unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (DoS) of Java SE, or allow unauthorized read, update, insert or delete access to some Java SE accessible data.
