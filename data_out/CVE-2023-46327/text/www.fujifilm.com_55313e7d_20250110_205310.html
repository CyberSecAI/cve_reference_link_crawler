# Notification on the vulnerability in the encryption method used in the Address Book

October 31, 2023

November 9, 2023

Dear Customers,

We would like to thank you for your continuous support to FUJIFILM products. We have confirmed a vulnerability in the encryption method used for the address book of FUJIFILM multifunctional printers.

Please refer to the description below for further details and consider applying the fixed firmware.

## Details of the vulnerability

The multifunctional printers of FUJIFILM have a function that enables users to retrieve information registered in its address book. When the address book information is retrieved using this function, the credentials in the retrieved information are encrypted.

There is a vulnerability in that encryption method where cryptography used to protect the credentials is weak. When the cryptography is cracked, the credentials in the address books are exposed.

## Countermeasure

Please update the firmware to the fixed version.

For customers who have accepted the automatic firmware upgrade with the EP-BB maintenance contract, the firmware upgrade will be done by the EP-BB function after the release of the fixed firmware.

For other customers, please contact FUJIFILM Business Innovation via the support website at<https://support-fb.fujifilm.com/>

## Workarounds

We would like the customers to perform the below workarounds until the firmware is updated to the fixed version. It is possible to reduce the risk of attack.

* Please use your multi-function or single-function printers within the network protected by firewall etc.
* If access from the Internet is permitted, please consider allowing the access to restricted IP addresses only or use VPN to connect.
