- **Root cause:** The Hello Agency Theme for WordPress versions 1.0.5 and below lacks proper access control mechanisms. Specifically, there are missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in functions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions intended for privileged users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can perform actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users. The specific impact will vary depending on the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the vulnerable functions within the WordPress theme.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an unauthenticated user of the WordPress site.
