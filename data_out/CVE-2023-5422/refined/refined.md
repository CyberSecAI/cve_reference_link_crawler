- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The OTRS system's email handling functions (POP3, IMAP for fetching, and SMTP for sending) do not properly validate SSL/TLS certificates when using OpenSSL. Specifically, the `SSL_get_verify_result()` function is not utilized.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper certificate validation (CWE-295)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to use invalid certificates to impersonate a trusted host. This could involve using expired certificates or conducting other attacks that would be detected by proper certificate validation. This can lead to a signature spoofing attack by improper validation (CAPEC-475). The impact is high for confidentiality and integrity, but no impact on availability (C:H/I:H/A:N).
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N), but the attack complexity is high (AC:H) and the scope is changed (S:C).
