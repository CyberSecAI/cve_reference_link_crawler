- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of client-supplied parameters during the establishment of an SSL VPN session.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the processing of TLS and DTLS packets within the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server of Cisco Meraki MX and Z3 Teleworker Gateway devices.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could cause the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to crash and restart, leading to the failure of established SSL VPN connections. This forces remote users to initiate new VPN connections and re-authenticate. A sustained attack could prevent new SSL VPN connections from being established, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting and sending a malicious request to the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected device; no authentication is required.
