The provided content relates to the following vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `s_volume_name` field in the `ext4_super_block` structure is not null-terminated, and the code was incorrectly using `strscpy_pad` to copy this field when it should have used `memtostr_pad`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Incorrect string copying leading to potential buffer overflow if the provided `s_volume_name` is larger than `EXT4_LABEL_MAX`. While `strscpy_pad` is designed to prevent overflow, it is intended for null-terminated strings, which `s_volume_name` is not.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A buffer overflow could potentially lead to a denial of service, memory corruption, or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could potentially craft an ext4 filesystem image with a volume name exceeding `EXT4_LABEL_MAX` bytes, and trigger the vulnerable code path when the system attempts to read the label via `ext4_ioctl_getlabel`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need the ability to mount the crafted filesystem image, and also invoke `ext4_ioctl_getlabel`.
