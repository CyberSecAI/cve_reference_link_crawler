Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-41507:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from **multiple SQL injection flaws** present in the store locator component of Super Store Finder v3.6. These flaws are triggered by processing specific user-supplied parameters.
*   Additionally, a **hardcoded password** in Super Store Finder v3.6 allows attackers to access the administration panel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input passed via the `products`, `distance`, `lat`, and `lng` parameters in HTTP POST requests, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*  **Hardcoded Password:**  A hardcoded password exists within the application, allowing unauthorized access to the administration panel.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to manipulate database queries. This can lead to:
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials.
    *   **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify or delete data stored in the database.
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** In some scenarios, an attacker might achieve remote code execution via SQL injection, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
*   **Hardcoded Password:**  Successful exploitation allows attackers to gain unauthorized administrative access.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The attack vector is through the `products`, `distance`, `lat`, and `lng` parameters in HTTP POST requests.
*  **Hardcoded Password:** The attack vector is through the admin login panel, using the hardcoded password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities remotely over the network. No prior authentication or user interaction is required.
*   **Hardcoded Password:**  Attackers need to be able to access the admin login panel, typically via a web interface. They also need to know the hardcoded credentials.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided content indicates that the vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 10.0, which is the highest possible score.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.7 of Super Store Finder.
*   The patch notes for version 3.7 mention "Upgrade admin login library. Fixed a vulnerability issue if default admin username is not changed to something else,"  which may relate to the hardcoded password issue, however it is not explicitly mentioned.
