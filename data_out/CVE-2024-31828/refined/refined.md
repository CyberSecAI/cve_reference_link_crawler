The provided content is related to CVE-2024-31828.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code into the URL. Specifically, the application fails to filter keywords such as `onload` and `svg`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application suffers from a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can transmit private data (like cookies or session information), redirect victims to attacker-controlled web content, or perform other malicious operations on the user's machine, all under the guise of the vulnerable website.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the URL parameter. An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing XSS payloads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker only needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince the victim to access it. No special position or privileges are needed on the target system, as the vulnerability is web-based and relies on the victim's browser.
