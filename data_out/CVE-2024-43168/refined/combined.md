| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2303462#c0)  Abhishek Raj    2024-08-07 14:06:29 UTC  ``` Unbound version <= 1.19.3 contains a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability. The flaw occurs in the cfg_mark_ports function within the config_file.c file, leading to potential memory corruption. This issue can be triggered when processing certain inputs, causing the application to crash or potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.   ``` |  |
