The provided content is related to CVE-2024-44815.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the storage of web portal and Wi-Fi access point login credentials in plain text within the SPI flash memory of the Hathway router.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Plaintext storage of sensitive credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can extract the login credentials for both the web portal and Wi-Fi access point.
- This allows unauthorized access and misuse of the router's functionalities.
- Even if the user changes default credentials, the attacker can extract the updated credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- Physical access to the router is required.
- The attacker needs to disassemble the router to access the SPI flash memory chip.
- The attacker needs to dump the SPI flash memory contents using a programmer.
- Further analysis is needed to locate the memory address of the stored credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Physical access to the Hathway router.
- Ability to disassemble electronic devices.
- Knowledge of SPI flash memory and firmware dumping.
- Technical knowledge for analyzing binary data.
- Access to tools like a UART connection, serial console, CH431A flash programmer, and software for hex analysis of the dumped firmware.
