- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authentication for a critical function in the logout functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Lack of authentication in the logout process, allowing unauthorized users to trigger a logout.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user can logout the client, which could potentially disrupt workflows if the user is not aware of this action. However, the backup functionality will continue to operate unaffected.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a local user on the system where the Synology Active Backup for Business Agent is running.
