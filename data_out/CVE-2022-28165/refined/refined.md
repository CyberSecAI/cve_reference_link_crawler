- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of server-side restrictions to verify if the user has the required permissions before processing requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control, specifically within the role-based access control (RBAC) functionality of Brocade SANnav.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated, remote attacker can gain unauthorized access to resources and perform actions they should not be able to. This can result in unauthorized data access, modification, or system manipulation.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed remotely. The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated, have network access to the vulnerable system, and be in a position to send requests to the server.
