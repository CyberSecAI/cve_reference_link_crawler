Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input within the NotificationX WordPress plugin. Specifically, the 'type' parameter, passed via an HTTP request, is not properly handled before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `type` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, which may include user credentials, application data, and other confidential details. The provided content explicitly mentions that attackers could retrieve WordPress admin password hashes.
- **Full Database Access:** Although not explicitly stated, SQL injection could potentially allow an attacker to gain more control over the database, possibly leading to modification or deletion of data, depending on database user privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is reachable through an unauthenticated HTTP request.
- **'type' Parameter:** The attack vector is the `type` parameter within the HTTP request. This parameter is used to influence the SQL query, allowing the attacker to inject malicious SQL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable WordPress instance.
- **Understanding of HTTP and SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and SQL syntax to craft the injection payload.
- **Plugin installed and active:** The NotificationX plugin must be installed and active on the target WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the NotificationX plugin up to and including version 2.8.2.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.8.3 by implementing `esc_sql()` on the `type` parameter before using it in the SQL query.
- The provided content includes a blog post that provides a detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability, including source code analysis and a script that retrieves WordPress admin password hashes.
- The affected code is located in `notificationx/trunk/includes/Core/Rest/Analytics.php` for the vulnerable code and `notificationx/trunk/includes/Core/Database.php` for the fix.
