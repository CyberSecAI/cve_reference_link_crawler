### Description

The NotificationX – Best FOMO, Social Proof, WooCommerce Sales Popup & Notification Bar Plugin With Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'type' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.2 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## Summary

The NotificationX plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'type' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.2 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. Due to lack of information about exploitation, there are only speculations on what an attacker can do. But what's better than having an exploit for this newly dropped vulnerability in less than 24 hours of release. Yes, you read it right, this post covers a complete breakdown of how to approach such targets, including source code analysis, following the trail of user-supplied parameters to the relevant sinks and then crafting the SQLi payload. Finally, the post ends with an exploit script to retrieve the WordPress admin password hashes! Everything is explained in an easy-to-digest manner, making it a great learning resource for a beginner, to read and follow along in this CVE hunting journey.
