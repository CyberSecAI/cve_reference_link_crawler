The Permalink Manager Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the 'debug_data', 'debug_query', and 'debug_redirect' functions in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data including password, title, and content of password-protected posts.
