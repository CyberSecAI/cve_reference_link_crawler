Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8195:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `debug_data`, `debug_query`, and `debug_redirect` functions within the Permalink Manager Lite plugin. These functions are intended for debugging purposes but lack proper access controls, allowing unauthenticated users to trigger them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the absence of capability checks or authentication requirements before executing the vulnerable debug functions.
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The debug functions expose sensitive data related to posts, including password-protected content, such as titles, content, and potentially passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve sensitive information, including the title and content of password-protected posts.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** The exposed information could be used for further malicious activities, such as identifying vulnerabilities, credential stuffing, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated HTTP Requests:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending direct HTTP requests to trigger the vulnerable debug functions.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** By appending specific query parameters (`debug_url`, `debug_redirect`) to URLs, attackers can activate the debug functions, without authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have any user account or login to the WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Permalink Manager Lite versions up to and including 2.4.4.
*   The patched version is 2.4.4.1, which adds a check for a new "Debug Mode" option to control the visibility of debug data.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by `stealthcopter`.

In summary, CVE-2024-8195 is a medium-severity vulnerability caused by a lack of authorization in debug functions, leading to unauthenticated sensitive information disclosure in the Permalink Manager Lite WordPress plugin.
