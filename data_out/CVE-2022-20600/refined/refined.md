{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper input validation in the LWIS component.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Elevation of privilege (EoP) due to improper validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially elevate their privileges on the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "The specific attack vector is not detailed in the document, but it involves exploiting a vulnerability within the LWIS component.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need the ability to interact with the LWIS component using methods that expose the vulnerability."
