**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within Elementor Pro widgets. This allows malicious code to be stored within the database.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to adequately cleanse user-provided data before storing it.
    *   **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly encode stored data when rendering it on a web page, leading to the execution of malicious scripts.
*  **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
    *   These scripts execute whenever a user accesses an affected page.
    *   This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
        *   Stealing session cookies, potentially hijacking user accounts.
        *   Redirecting users to malicious sites.
        *   Performing actions on behalf of logged-in users.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered via a widget's `custom_id` attribute.
    *   Attackers inject malicious code into the `custom_id` field.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be authenticated with contributor-level or higher permissions on the WordPress site.
    *   No specific network position is required (attack can originate from any location with access to the WordPress admin interface).

**3. Additional Notes:**

*   The `wordfence.com` content provides a CVSS score of 6.4 (Medium) for this vulnerability.
*   The `elementor.com` changelog indicates that the vulnerability was likely addressed in version `3.20.2` with multiple security fixes, although the CVE isn't mentioned explicitly.
*   The `wordfence.com` content states that the vulnerability is present in all versions up to and including 3.20.1 and recommends updating to version `3.20.2` or a newer patched version.

**Summary:**

CVE-2024-1364 is a stored XSS vulnerability in Elementor Pro, which allows authenticated users with contributor-level permissions or higher to inject malicious scripts into website pages via a widget's `custom_id`. This vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of user input and insufficient output escaping, leading to the execution of malicious scripts whenever an affected page is accessed by a user. The vulnerability is likely fixed in version `3.20.2`.
