Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromqossetting` function of the Tenda FH1201 firmware.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack Overflow:** The `sprintf` function is used to construct a string using a user-supplied parameter without proper bounds checking. The statement `sprintf(v7, "qos_list.asp?page=%s", v4);`, where `v4` is derived from user-controlled input `page`, copies the user-provided data into a fixed-size buffer `v7`. If the size of `v4` exceeds the size of `v7`, a stack-based buffer overflow occurs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite adjacent data on the stack, potentially gaining arbitrary code execution on the device. This could allow the attacker to fully control the router, leading to data theft, denial of service, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/qossetting` endpoint.
*   **`page` Parameter:** The malicious payload is passed via the `page` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the Tenda router's web interface.
*   **No Authentication Required**: The provided information doesn't mention any authentication needed for this particular request, indicating that this may be exploitable without credentials
*  **Crafting HTTP Request:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send an HTTP POST request with a payload large enough to cause a buffer overflow.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Firmware:** The vulnerability is specifically in the Tenda FH1201 Firmware V1.2.0.14(408).
*   **Proof of Concept:** The provided Python code demonstrates how to trigger the overflow using `requests.post` library.
*   **Reproducibility:** The provided images show the overflow happening, and the script shows how to reproduce it, giving it a high degree of confidence.

This information gives a clear and detailed understanding of the vulnerability.
