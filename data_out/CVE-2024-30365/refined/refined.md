  "summary": "The provided content describes an Out-of-Bounds Read/Write and Use-After-Free vulnerability in Foxit PDF Reader. The vulnerability stems from the application failing to properly validate a pointer before performing operations on it and from lack of validation of the existence of an object before performing operations on it. This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader. Exploitation requires user interaction, such as opening a malicious PDF file."
