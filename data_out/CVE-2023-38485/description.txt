Vulnerabilities exist in the BIOS implementation of Aruba 9200 and 9000 Series Controllers and Gateways that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code early in the boot sequence. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to and change underlying sensitive information in the affected controller leading to complete system compromise.
