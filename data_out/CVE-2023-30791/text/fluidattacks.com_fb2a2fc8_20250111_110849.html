## Description

Plane version 0.7.1-dev allows an attacker to change the avatar of his
profile, which allows uploading files with HTML extension that interprets
both HTML and JavaScript.

## Vulnerability

The vulnerability arises when uploading files other than JPG and PNG which
it says is allowed, since files of all file extensions and sizes can be
uploaded and stored without validation. Then an attacker can upload an HTML
file as a profile avatar, and it may contain malicious JavaScript code stored
with which they can steal session cookies from users and the administrator.

## Exploit

![vulnerability-code-Plane](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BetaH4k/Plane---CVE-0.7.1/main/exploit%20-%20file.png)

## Evidence of exploitation

Log in with any user and go to the menu and go to
"Settings -> General -> Logo (Upload)" we create a
file with HTML extension which inside sends in a
request to an attacker's server the user's cookies.

Once the attacker obtains the cookies he can use them to
log into the user's account and as seen in this example
gain full control of the account to delete, create, view.
