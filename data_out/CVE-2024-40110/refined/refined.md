Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-40110

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unauthenticated file upload vulnerability in the `product.php` endpoint of the Poultry Farm Management System v1.0. This occurs because the application does not properly validate or sanitize the uploaded file, allowing an attacker to upload a malicious PHP file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unauthenticated File Upload:** The vulnerability does not require any authentication to upload files, making it accessible to any attacker.
*   **Lack of File Validation:** The system does not check the file type or content of uploaded files, allowing for the upload of arbitrary files, including PHP scripts.
*   **Insecure File Storage:** Uploaded files are stored in the `/assets/img/productimages/` directory, which is publicly accessible, allowing the attacker to execute the uploaded PHP file by requesting it directly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. In the provided exploit, the attacker uploads a PHP backdoor that allows the execution of system commands.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Through RCE, an attacker could potentially gain complete control over the server and the application, leading to data breaches, malware deployment, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/farm/product.php` endpoint.
*   **File Upload:** The malicious PHP file is included as a file upload within the POST request using `multipart/form-data`.
*   **Direct Access:** After successful upload, the attacker accesses the uploaded PHP file via a direct GET request to execute the uploaded code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any user credentials to exploit the vulnerability, as the upload endpoint is unauthenticated.
*   **Knowledge of the Target Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the URL of the vulnerable endpoint (`/farm/product.php`) and where the file is stored (`/farm/assets/img/productimages/`).

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit code is written in Python and uses the `requests` library to perform the HTTP requests.
*   The exploit uploads a PHP backdoor that executes the `hostname` command as a proof of concept, and then returns the result.
*   The exploit shows how to upload the malicious PHP file via multipart/form-data along with other fields needed for the vulnerable application endpoint.
*   The content mentions a video PoC available at `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gOXhAjtUuIJHGz5SEpz3Tu50CEzoiDw_/view?usp=drive_link`.
