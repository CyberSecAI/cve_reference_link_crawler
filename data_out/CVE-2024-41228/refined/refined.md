The content is related to CVE-2024-41228, it describes a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTTOU) vulnerability in the `pouch cp` command of Pouch container engine.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A race condition exists in the `ExtractToDir()` function within `daemon/mgr/container_copy.go` of Pouch. This function is used when copying files into a container. The vulnerability arises between the `os.Lstat()` check on the target path and the subsequent `chrootarchive.Untar()` operation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The TOCTTOU vulnerability allows an attacker within a container to replace a target directory with a symlink after the initial check but before the file extraction.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can overwrite sensitive files on the host filesystem by creating a symlink that points to a host path. This enables the attacker to achieve container escape and gain unauthorized write access to the host system.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with control of a container can exploit the vulnerability by repeatedly creating and deleting a directory, then creating a symlink in its place, while simultaneously requesting an administrator to copy a file into the container to the same path. The timing of the symlink creation has to race with pouch cp operation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have control over a container and the ability to make requests via the platform's API to copy files into a specific path inside the container. The attacker must also be able to execute code within the container to create the symlink in a race condition. Additionally, a separate user with administrator privileges must initiate the copy operation.

The document also provides further information about the vulnerability and potential fixes:
- The vulnerability can be exploited under two conditions: either runc is set as the container runtime or runsc (gVisor) is used as the container runtime and a file is copied from the host to the shared volume between the container and host.
- The root cause of the susceptibility is that Pouch utilizes an old version of chrootarchive package, whereas newer versions used by docker have implemented security checks to set the root of the chroot to the container's rootfs.
- A suggested workaround is to update the chrootarchive package.
