Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28183:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2024-28183. The GitHub Security Advisory, identified as GHSA-22x6-3756-pfp8, describes a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability in the ESP-IDF bootloader's anti-rollback mechanism. This advisory explicitly states that it is associated with CVE-2024-28183.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a TOCTOU issue in the bootloader's anti-rollback implementation. Specifically:

*   The bootloader performs anti-rollback checks by verifying the secure version of the application image.
*   However, there was a window of opportunity between the time the check was performed and the time the application was loaded. This allowed an attacker with physical access to modify the flash and replace the application with a version having a lower security version after the initial check.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **TOCTOU Vulnerability:** The core weakness is the time gap between the security version check and the actual loading/execution of the application. This allows for a race condition that can be exploited.
*   **Insufficient Verification:** The initial implementation lacked a second verification stage just before handing off control to application after the load stage.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass Anti-Rollback:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the anti-rollback protection and load an older version of the application. This could potentially allow to boot older application having known vulnerabilities.
*   **Potential Security Downgrade:** If the device also has flash encryption enabled, an attacker may be able to boot a passive partition image which has lower security version.
*   **Physical Access Required:** The attack requires physical access to the device's flash memory.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Flash Manipulation:** An attacker with physical access must modify the flash memory after the bootloader performs its initial anti-rollback check and before application loading is complete. This involves replacing the application image with a lower security version but valid image.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker must have physical access to the device to manipulate the flash memory.
*   **Knowledge of Flash Layout:**  The attacker needs to know the flash memory layout and image structure to perform the necessary modifications.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to perform the flash modification within the TOCTOU window between the security check and application load by the bootloader.

**7. Patches/Mitigation:**

The following patches were implemented to address this vulnerability.

*   **Bootloader Fix:** The `secure_version` is now read during the SHA256 calculation of the application and it is verified again after the loading stage. This prevents modification after the initial check.
*  **Application Startup Fix:** The application startup code has been updated to ensure that the currently booting app has an equal or higher security version than the one programmed in the eFuse for anti-rollback scenario.
*   **Code Optimization:** Added `__attribute__((optimize("O0")))` to `process_esp_app_desc_data` function to prevent compiler optimizations that might lead to multiple reads from flash. This ensures the secure version is read only once.

These changes mitigate the TOCTOU vulnerability by ensuring the security version is verified before and after the loading stage, making it extremely difficult for an attacker to perform flash manipulation without detection.
