The provided content is related to CVE-2021-47286.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The MHI (Mobile Host Interface) driver reads the channel ID from an event ring element sent by the device. This channel ID can be any value between 0 and 255. However, the driver does not validate this channel ID against the maximum number of channels supported by the controller or against channels that have not been configured. This lack of validation can lead to out-of-bounds access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds access:** The driver attempts to access `mhi_cntrl->mhi_chan[chan]` using a potentially invalid `chan` value read from the device. Without validation, a malicious or faulty device could provide an out-of-bounds `chan` value, causing a memory access violation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: Out-of-bounds access could lead to corruption of kernel memory. This could cause a system crash or allow an attacker to gain control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious or faulty MHI device can send an event ring element with a crafted channel ID to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to control or be able to manipulate a connected MHI device to send malicious event ring data with out-of-bounds channel IDs.
