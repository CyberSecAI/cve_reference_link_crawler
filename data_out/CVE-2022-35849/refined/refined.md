- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the management interface of FortiADC, where crafted arguments to existing commands are not properly sanitized, leading to command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability (CWE-78).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker can execute unauthorized commands on the underlying operating system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must be authenticated to the management interface. The attack is carried out by crafting malicious arguments to existing commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the FortiADC management interface.
