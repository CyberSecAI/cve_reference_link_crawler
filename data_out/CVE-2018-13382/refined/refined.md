Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-13382:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control within the SSL VPN web portal of both FortiProxy and FortiOS. This allows unauthorized actions to be performed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Password Change:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can modify the passwords of local SSL-VPN users through specifically crafted HTTP requests. This indicates a failure to properly validate and authorize password reset requests.
*   **Lack of Authorization:** The system fails to ensure that only authorized users can modify password of other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Hijacking:** Attackers can change user passwords, leading to account hijacking.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Once a password is changed, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to the user's VPN account.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** The FortiProxy advisory mentions "Execute unauthorized code or commands" as a potential impact, suggesting that further exploitation is possible after gaining initial access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the network.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack involves sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable SSL VPN web portal.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need to authenticate prior to exploiting the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable FortiProxy or FortiOS instance.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:**  The attacker must be able to craft specific HTTP requests to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **No Prior Knowledge of User Credentials:** The attacker doesn't need to know existing user passwords to exploit the vulnerability and can simply overwrite them.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   **FortiProxy:** Version 2.0.0
*   **FortiOS:** Versions 6.0.0 to 6.0.4

**Mitigation and Solutions:**

*   **Upgrade:** Upgrade to FortiProxy version 1.2.9 or above, or 2.0.1 or above.  Upgrade to FortiOS versions 5.4.11, 5.6.9, 6.0.5, 6.2.0 or above.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Enabling 2FA for SSL VPN users with local authentication can mitigate the impact. Even if an attacker changes the password, they cannot log in without the 2FA code.
*   **Migrate Authentication:** Migrate SSL VPN user authentication from local to remote (LDAP or RADIUS).
*   **Disable SSL-VPN Service:** Disable the SSL-VPN service entirely (both web-mode and tunnel-mode) as a last resort if other options are not feasible. (CLI commands are provided to achieve this).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The FortiOS advisory provides a workaround involving disabling the SSL VPN service, which requires deleting firewall policies tied to SSL VPN first.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Meh Chang and Orange Tsai from DEVCORE Security Research Team.
* The provided CVSSv3 score is 8.9, categorized as high severity.
