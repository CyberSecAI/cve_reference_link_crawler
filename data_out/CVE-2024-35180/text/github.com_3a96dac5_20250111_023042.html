# JSONP callback

Moderate

[jburel](/jburel)
published
GHSA-vr85-5pwx-c6gq
May 21, 2024

## Package

pip

omero-web
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=5.25.0

## Patched versions

5.26.0

## Description

### Background

There is currently no escaping or validation of the `callback` parameter that can be passed to various OMERO.web endpoints that have JSONP enabled. One such endpoint is `/webclient/imgData/...`. As we only really use these endpoints with jQuery's own callback name generation [1](#user-content-fn-1-bf0c233950e99a097c2523ab9e5b81ae) it is quite difficult or even impossible to exploit this in vanilla OMERO.web. However, these metadata endpoints are likely to be used by many plugins.

### Impact

OMERO.web before 5.25.0

### Patches

Users should upgrade to 5.26.0 or higher

### Workarounds

None
