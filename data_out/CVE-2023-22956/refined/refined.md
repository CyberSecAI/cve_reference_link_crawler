{
  "cve": "CVE-2023-22956",
  "affected_product": "AudioCodes VoIP Phones",
  "vulnerability_details": "The AudioCodes VoIP phones use a hardcoded cryptographic key to encrypt configuration files. An attacker can extract the key by analyzing the `decryption_tool` executable within the phone's firmware. With the key, the attacker can decrypt the encrypted configuration files and retrieve sensitive information.",
  "root_cause": "Use of a hardcoded cryptographic key for encrypting configuration files.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "CWE-321",
    "Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key"
  ],
  "impact": "An attacker can decrypt encrypted configuration files and retrieve sensitive information.",
  "attack_vectors": "The attacker must first obtain the firmware for the affected device. After obtaining the firmware, the hardcoded key can be extracted by analyzing the `decryption_tool` executable.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to reverse engineer the firmware and extract the key. They also need to have access to the encrypted configuration files. ",
  "solution": "Update devices to firmware version 3.4.8.808 or later and define a custom secret from which the encryption key is derived."
