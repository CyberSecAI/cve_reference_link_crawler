- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control in Dell Alienware Command Center versions 5.7.3.0 and prior.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control leading to potential denial of service and information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A low privileged attacker can exploit this vulnerability, leading to denial of service on the local system and information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access. The attacker needs to have low privileged access to the system. User interaction is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low privileged access to the local system and must have the user perform some action (UI:R).
