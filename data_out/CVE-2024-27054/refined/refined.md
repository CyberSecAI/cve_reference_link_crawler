Based on the provided information, all the commits are related to the same vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a double module refcount decrement in the `dasd_generic_set_online` function in the s390/dasd driver. When an error occurs while setting a DASD (Direct Access Storage Device) online, the code incorrectly decrements the module refcount multiple times.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double decrement of module refcount leading to an incorrect refcount.
- Incorrect error handling in `dasd_generic_set_online` function.
- The error path decrements the module's refcount manually, while device deletion already handles this.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The double decrement of the module refcount does not cause immediate harm such as a crash, but it artificially lowers the module's reference count. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the module is unloaded while it's still in use.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by errors during the online process of a DASD device. This could involve a number of scenarios where setting the device online fails such as a device not responding.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to trigger an error during the online process of a DASD device in order to trigger the double refcount decrement. This would typically require some control over the system's storage configuration or other means to cause device online failures.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the s390 DASD subsystem.
