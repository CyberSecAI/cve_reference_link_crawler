Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-29836

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a path traversal issue. Certain parameters of the device software can be manipulated to point to arbitrary locations within the file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability:  The software does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input when constructing file paths, which allows an attacker to navigate outside the intended directory structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file system access: Attackers can potentially read, write, or execute files in locations outside the intended application directories
- Installation of custom packages:  Attackers could potentially install malicious software by leveraging the arbitrary file system access to install custom packages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: This vulnerability is likely exploitable through network access, as it allows an attacker to send specially crafted requests with manipulated path parameters to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: An attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device, either on the local network or through a network-accessible service
- Ability to send manipulated requests: The attacker needs the capability to send specially crafted requests, likely through a web interface or API, to the affected device to exploit the path traversal flaw.

**Additional Information:**
- The affected products include Western Digital My Cloud Home, My Cloud Home Duo and SanDisk ibi devices.
- The vulnerability is fixed in firmware version 8.11.0-113.
- The fix implemented involves ensuring the final path is resolved under the target directory.
