Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   **CVE-2023-45194:** The vulnerability stems from the use of default credentials, specifically the initial pre-shared key for wireless LAN communication remaining at its factory-default value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CVE-2023-45194:** Use of default credentials (CWE-1392). The vulnerability exists when the wireless LAN pre-shared key is not changed from its default value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CVE-2023-45194:** If the default pre-shared key is used, an attacker can intercept and potentially eavesdrop on wireless LAN communication performed by the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CVE-2023-45194:** The attacker needs to be within range of the wireless LAN network and have the capability to intercept wireless communications.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **CVE-2023-45194:** The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the affected device's network. No authentication is needed beyond being within range to intercept communications if the default key is used.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects specific models of Micro Research's MR-GM series, specifically MR-GM2 and MR-GM3 devices with specific firmware versions. The MR-GM3L series is not affected.
*   The vendor (Micro Research) has released firmware updates to address this vulnerability, urging users to update their devices.
