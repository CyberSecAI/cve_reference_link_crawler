The provided content relates to CVE-2021-45863.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `HevcUnit::updateBits` function due to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow in `HevcUnit::updateBits` function at `hevc.cpp:76`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow can lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted HEVC stream to `tsMuxer`, the `HevcUnit::updateBits` function attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer.
- The vulnerable code is triggered when the program processes a malicious input file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted HEVC stream that triggers the overflow.
- The attacker needs to be able to run the `tsMuxer` application with the malicious input.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported using AddressSanitizer (ASan) which identified the heap-buffer-overflow.
- The issue was resolved with commit `3763dd34755a8944d903aa19578fa22cd3734165` which was then merged into the master branch via pull request #512.
- The specific location of the vulnerability is in the `HevcUnit::updateBits` function at line 76 of `hevc.cpp`.
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) file named `poc.zip` in the issue report can be used to trigger the overflow.
