Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization. The `id` parameter received via the GET method in `view_package.php` is directly concatenated into an SQL query without any prior filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the susceptibility to SQL injection due to the direct use of user-supplied input in the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Database Access:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This can lead to:
  - Reading sensitive data from the database
  - Modifying or deleting data
  - Potentially gaining further control of the server (depending on database permissions and configuration)

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `view_package.php` script, specifically by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.
- The attacker would need to make a request like: `/cdsms/admin/packages/view_package.php?id=<malicious SQL code>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to possess knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.
- **Authentication:** The provided content mentions needing to be logged into the admin panel which suggests the attacker needs to be logged into the application as an authenticated user, however, this may not be a requirement to exploit the SQL injection.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable file is `view_package.php`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `$_GET['id']`.
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) uses `sqlmap` to demonstrate exploitation.
- The specific application affected is the "Sourcecodester Car Driving School Management System v1.0".
- The vulnerable URL is similar to `/cdsms/admin/packages/view_package.php?id=1`
