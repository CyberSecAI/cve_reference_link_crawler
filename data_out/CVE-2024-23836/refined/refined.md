        "description": "Limit the maximum number of live SMTP transactions per flow, preventing excessive resource consumption when a malicious client sends many DATA commands without confirmation. A new boolean `is_data` is introduced to track if a DATA command has been seen without a confirmation from the server, and prevents creation of new transactions in such cases.",
