smtp: avoid creating empty transaction

Ticket: 6477

So as to avoid ending up with too many empty transactions.

This happens when Suricata sees a DATA command in the current
transaction but did not have a confirmation response for it.
Then, if Suricata receives another DATA command, it will
create another new transaction, even if the previous one
is empty. And so, a malicious client can create many empty
transactions by just sending a repeated amount of DATA commands
without having a confirmation code for them.

Suricata cannot use state->current_command == SMTP_COMMAND_DATA
to prevent this attack and needs to resort to a new boolean
is_data because the malicious client may send another dummy command
after each DATA command.

This patch leaves only one call to SMTPTransactionCreate
