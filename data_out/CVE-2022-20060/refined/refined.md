- **Root cause of vulnerability**: In preloader (usb), there is a permission bypass due to missing proper image authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing proper image authentication, which allows a permission bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the device is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Physical access to the device, no additional execution privileges needed, and user interaction is required for exploitation.
