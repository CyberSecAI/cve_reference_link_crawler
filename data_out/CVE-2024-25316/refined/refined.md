The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the Hotel Management System version 1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insecure handling of the 'eid' parameter in the `usersettingdel.php` script. User-supplied input is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization or parameterized queries

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can compromise the application.
- The attacker can access or modify data stored in the database.
- The attacker can potentially exploit further vulnerabilities of the underlying database system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted GET request to `/Hotel/admin/usersettingdel.php` with a malicious value in the `eid` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
