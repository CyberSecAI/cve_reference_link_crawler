Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the `action_edited_author()` function within the `Author_Editor.php` file. Specifically, the `authors-user_id` parameter, which is user-controlled, is not validated before being used to update the `user_email` of an arbitrary user account.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The plugin directly uses the `authors-user_id` parameter from the request without verifying the current user's permissions to modify the email of the specified user ID. This lack of validation allows an attacker to target any user on the system.
*   **Privilege Escalation/Account Takeover:** An authenticated user with "Author" level access can exploit this vulnerability to modify the email address of any user including administrators. By changing the email associated with an admin account, the attacker can initiate a password reset and gain unauthorized access to the admin account.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:

*   **Modify email addresses of arbitrary user accounts:** This includes administrator accounts.
*   **Take over user accounts:** By initiating a password reset using the modified email address, the attacker gains control of targeted accounts, including those with administrative privileges.
*   **Gain full control of the WordPress site:** By compromising an administrator account, the attacker can take complete control of the website and its content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint during the author edit process. An attacker with Author or higher privileges can manipulate the `authors-user_id` parameter within the POST request to target any user id.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account with at least "Author" level access to the WordPress site.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send manipulated POST requests to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability has been addressed in version 4.7.2 of the plugin
*   The fix includes checks on `is_user_logged_in()` and `current_user_can()` to determine if the user has the necessary permissions to edit the author profile or user.
*   A fallback mechanism to assign the user to the current user was added in case the user lacks the necessary capabilities to edit another profile
*   The email address is only overwritten if it is modified, not on every save action.
