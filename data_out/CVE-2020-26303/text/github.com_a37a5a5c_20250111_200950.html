| Hello,  The [GitHub Security Lab team](https://securitylab.github.com/) has found a potential vulnerability in your project. Please create a [Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team%40latest/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/creating-a-security-advisory) and invite me in to further disclose and discuss the vulnerability details and potential fix. Alternatively, please add a [Security Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team%40latest/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository) containing a security email address to send the details to.  Kind regards, A |

| This is the tiniest library I could find out there for sanitizing HTML. Sucks that I'll have to go with a bigger one. Hope this gets addressed soon. |

| [@bevacqua](https://github.com/bevacqua) can we push it forward üôè ?  `insane` is a very critical lib for many developers. Since this is a security issue, no one other than you can fix it...  If necessary, can you add one more maintainer to this repository?  Thanks for your help! ü§û üîí |
