Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-26586:

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**
The root cause is an inconsistency between the firmware reporting of the maximum number of Access Control Lists (ACLs) allowed in a group and the layout of the register (PAGT) used to configure ACL groups. Specifically, while the firmware on Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs reported a maximum ACL group size greater than 16, the PAGT register's design limited the size to 16. This mismatch could lead to stack corruption when more than 16 ACLs are added to a group.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack corruption: The primary vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow occurring in the `mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_update` function. This is due to writing beyond the stack's allocated space when the number of ACLs exceeds the PAGT register's limit.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel panic: The stack corruption leads to a kernel panic, resulting in a denial of service. The system becomes unstable and unusable, requiring a reboot.

**Attack vectors:**
- Traffic Control (tc) filters: The vulnerability is triggered by adding traffic control filters to a network device. When filters are added, the system binds the network port to an ACL group. Adding a specific number of filters that exceed the hardware limit will trigger the issue
- The vulnerability is triggered when more than 16 ACLs are added to a group and the filters are placed in different regions due to priority and key usage.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to configure traffic control filters on a network device using the `tc` command. This often requires root or elevated privileges on the system.
- The attacker needs to have access to a system using Mellanox Spectrum-2 or newer ASICs.

**Additional details:**
- The fix implemented limits the maximum ACL group size by taking the minimum between what the firmware reports and the maximum number of ACLs that fit in the PAGT register.
- A test case was added to verify the fix and ensure the system doesn't crash when this condition is hit by adding alternating IPv4 and IPv6 filters until insertion fails, verifying no crash happens and then removing the added filters.
- The vulnerability affects the mlxsw driver.
- The vulnerability is related to the handling of TCAM (Ternary Content Addressable Memory) in the mlxsw driver.
