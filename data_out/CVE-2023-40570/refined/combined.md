|  |  |  |
|  |  | 1.0a4 (2023-08-21) |
|  |  | ------------------ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This alpha fixes a security issue with the ``/-/api`` API explorer. On authenticated Datasette instances (instances protected using plugins such as `datasette-auth-passwords <https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-passwords>`\_\_) the API explorer interface could reveal the names of databases and tables within the protected instance. The data stored in those tables was not revealed. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | For more information and workarounds, read `the security advisory <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/security/advisories/GHSA-7ch3-7pp7-7cpq>`\_\_. The issue has been present in every previous alpha version of Datasette 1.0: versions 1.0a0, 1.0a1, 1.0a2 and 1.0a3. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Also in this alpha: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - The new ``datasette plugins --requirements`` option outputs a list of currently installed plugins in Python ``requirements.txt`` format, useful for duplicating that installation elsewhere. (:issue:`2133`) |
|  |  | - :ref:`canned\_queries\_writable` can now define a ``on\_success\_message\_sql`` field in their configuration, containing a SQL query that should be executed upon successful completion of the write operation in order to generate a message to be shown to the user. (:issue:`2138`) |
|  |  | - The automatically generated border color for a database is now shown in more places around the application. (:issue:`2119`) |
|  |  | - Every instance of example shell script code in the documentation should now include a working copy button, free from additional syntax. (:issue:`2140`) |

# Datasette 1.0 alpha series leaks names of databases and tables to unauthenticated users

Low

[simonw](/simonw)
published
GHSA-7ch3-7pp7-7cpq
Aug 22, 2023

## Package

pip

datasette
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

1.0a0, 1.0a1, 1.0a2, 1.0a3

## Patched versions

1.0a4

## Description

### Impact

This bug affects Datasette instances running a Datasette 1.0 alpha - 1.0a0, 1.0a1, 1.0a2 or 1.0a3 - in an online accessible location but with authentication enabled using a plugin such as [datasette-auth-passwords](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-passwords).

The `/-/api` API explorer endpoint could reveal the names of both databases and tables - but not their contents - to an unauthenticated user.

### Patches

Datasette 1.0a4 has a fix for this issue.

### Workarounds

To work around this issue, block all traffic to the `/-/api` endpoint. This can be done with a proxy such as Apache or NGINX, or by installing the [datasette-block](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-block) plugin and adding the following configuration to your `metadata.json` or `metadata.yml` file:

```
{
    "plugins": {
        "datasette-block": {
            "prefixes": ["/-/api"]
        }
    }
}
```

This will block access to the API explorer but will still allow access to the Datasette read or write JSON APIs, as those use different URL patterns within the Datasette `/database` hierarchy.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-40570

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
