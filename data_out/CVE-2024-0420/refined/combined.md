## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# MapPress Maps for WordPress < 2.88.15 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape the map title when outputting it back in the admin dashboard, allowing Contributors and above roles to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor, create/edit a map with the below payload as title and attach it to a post (can be done in the post dashboard in the Map column)
<script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
The XSS will be triggered when anyone access the post dashboard (/wp-admin/edit.php?post\_type=post)
