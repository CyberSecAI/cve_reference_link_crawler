{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a missing check for NULL values in the `rdp_write_logon_info_v1` function within FreeRDP. Specifically, when writing logon information version 1, the function does not verify if the `info->domain` or `info->username` members are NULL before attempting to access them.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL Pointer Dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploitation could result in a NULL access and subsequent crash of the FreeRDP client application.",
     "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a FreeRDP client connects to a malicious or specially crafted RDP server that sends a crafted logon sequence with missing username or domain information. The client attempts to process this sequence and may dereference the NULL pointers.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control or manipulate the RDP server to which the FreeRDP client connects in order to send the crafted logon sequence."
  },
  "affected_versions": "Versions 3.0.0 up to and including 3.5.0 are affected",
   "patched_versions": "Version 3.5.1 contains the fix for the vulnerability."
