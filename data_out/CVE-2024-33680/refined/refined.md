- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The MainWP Child Reports plugin <= 2.1.1 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The plugin does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing attackers to potentially trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. Specific impacts may vary case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted web request that exploits the lack of CSRF protection in the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious site or clicking a malicious link/button, which then sends a forged request to the vulnerable WordPress site. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to initiate the attack but the user that triggers the request must be authenticated.
