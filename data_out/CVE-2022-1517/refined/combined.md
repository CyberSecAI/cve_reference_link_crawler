### 4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 4.2.1    [EXECUTION WITH UNNECESSARY PRIVILEGES CWE-250](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/250.html)

LRM utilizes elevated privileges. An unauthenticated malicious actor can upload and execute code remotely at the operating system level, which can allow an attacker to change settings, configurations, software, or access sensitive data on the affected product. An attacker could also exploit this vulnerability to access APIs not intended for general use and interact through the network.

[CVE-2022-1517](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-1517) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 4.2.2    [IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

LRM contains a directory traversal vulnerability that can allow a malicious actor to upload outside the intended directory structure.

[CVE-2022-1518](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-1518) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 4.2.3    [UNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPE CWE-434](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html)

LRM does not restrict the types of files that can be uploaded to the affected product. A malicious actor can upload any file type, including executable code that allows for a remote code exploit.

[CVE-2022-1519](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-1519) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 4.2.4    [IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

LRM does not implement authentication or authorization by default. A malicious actor can inject, replay, modify, and/or intercept sensitive data.

[CVE-2022-1521](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-1521) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)).

#### 4.2.5    [CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)

LRM version 2.4 and lower does not implement TLS encryption. A malicious actor can MITM attack sensitive data in-transit, including credentials.

[CVE-2022-1524](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-1524) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices) on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
