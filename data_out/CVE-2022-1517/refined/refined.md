The provided document is a CISA ICS advisory regarding multiple vulnerabilities in Illumina's Local Run Manager (LRM) software.

Based on the advisory, CVE-2022-1517 is associated with "Execution with Unnecessary Privileges" (CWE-250).

**Root cause of vulnerability:** LRM utilizes elevated privileges unnecessarily.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The software operates with elevated privileges that are not required for its function. This allows for code execution with more privileges than needed.

**Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can upload and execute code remotely at the operating system level on the affected product. This allows the attacker to change settings, configurations, software, and access sensitive data. Additionally, it provides access to APIs not intended for general use, and could interact with the network through the affected product.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote network access

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network connectivity to the affected LRM device.
- No authentication is required.
