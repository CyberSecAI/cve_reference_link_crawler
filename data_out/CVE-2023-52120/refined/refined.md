- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NEX-Forms â€“ Ultimate Form Builder plugin for WordPress lacks sufficient protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin is vulnerable to CSRF, which allows an attacker to force higher-privileged users to perform unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially force a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to perform actions that could compromise the security or integrity of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted malicious request that targets the vulnerable plugin functionality. An attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into initiating this request, typically through social engineering.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user, with adequate privileges, to click a link or perform an action that triggers the malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the target WordPress site.
