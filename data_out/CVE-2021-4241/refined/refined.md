The provided content relates to a commit that addresses CVE-2021-4241, which involves the use of a predictable algorithm in a random number generator.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application was using `mt_rand()` to generate a random token for the "remember me" functionality. `mt_rand()` is known to produce predictable outputs, making it unsuitable for security-sensitive contexts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Predictable random number generation. The use of `mt_rand()` made the generated tokens guessable.
- Insecure cookie handling: The cookie structure was relying on predictable token generation which was then used to create authentication cookies.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially predict the generated tokens, and forge valid "remember me" cookies to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker who can observe the output of the `mt_rand()` function or can make educated guesses about it, especially if predictable seeds were used, can potentially create valid authentication cookies by guessing the token.
- An attacker would need to have access to the user id.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to guess the token created by `mt_rand()`.
- The attacker would likely also need to be aware of the user IDs as they are part of the cookie generation.

**Additional notes:**
- The commit replaces the `mt_rand()` function with `random_bytes(64)`, which provides cryptographically secure random bytes.
- The commit also changes the separator in the cookie string from ":" to "\_" to match other changes in the cookie generation.
- The fix also includes a change in how the cookie is generated, where a "_" is used instead of a ":" as separator
