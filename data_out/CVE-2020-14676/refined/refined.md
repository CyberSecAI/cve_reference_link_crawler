Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-14676:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content from `www.zerodayinitiative.com` directly mentions **CVE-2020-14676** and describes a privilege escalation vulnerability in Oracle VirtualBox, which aligns with the CVE ID. The other sources confirm this CVE is for VirtualBox.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of Transmit Message Descriptors within the PCnet virtual network interface implementation in Oracle VirtualBox.
    *   The core issue is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which allows a memory access beyond the allocated buffer.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds memory access:** The vulnerability allows a memory access past the end of an allocated buffer due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The system doesn't properly check data from the user-supplied data, leading to the buffer overflow.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate privileges within the guest OS and execute code in the context of the hypervisor.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the hypervisor process.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack is launched from within a guest operating system. The attacker has to first have high privileged access within the guest OS
*   **PCnet Virtual Network Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through the handling of Transmit Message Descriptors of the virtual PCnet network interface.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **High-Privileged Access in Guest OS**: The attacker first needs to achieve the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The ZDI advisory mentions that Oracle has released an update to address this issue.
*   The `lists.opensuse.org` content indicates the vulnerability is fixed in VirtualBox version `6.1.14` and `6.0.24` as well.
*   The `security.gentoo.org` content indicates that the affected versions are below `6.1.12` and below `6.0.24`.
*   The provided text offers additional details about other CVEs resolved in the same VirtualBox update.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.5.
