- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `class-sbmm-list-table.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can trick a site administrator into clicking a malicious link, which then allows the attacker to bulk delete messages.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker exploits the CSRF vulnerability via a forged request, likely using a malicious link. The attacker needs to trick a site administrator into clicking on the link to execute the request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that exploits the lack of CSRF protection. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to initiate the attack. The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in administrator to click on the malicious link.
