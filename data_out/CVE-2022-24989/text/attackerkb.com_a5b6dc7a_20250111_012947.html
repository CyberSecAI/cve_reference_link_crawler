## Description

TerraMaster NAS 4.2.29 and earlier allows remote attackers to discover the administrative password by sending “User-Agent: TNAS” to module/api.php?mobile/webNasIPS and then reading the PWD field in the response.

###### Technical Analysis

This is the third exploit a.k.a. `TerrorMaster 3` targeting TerraMaster NAS devices running TerraMaster Operating System (TOS) `4.2.29` or lower.

**Octagon Networks** published in March 2022 an analysis [CVE-2022-24990: TerraMaster TOS unauthenticated remote command execution via PHP Object Instantiation](https://octagon.net/blog/2022/03/07/cve-2022-24990-terrmaster-tos-unauthenticated-remote-command-execution-via-php-object-instantiation/) explaining a chain of vulnerabilities that makes all TerraMaster NAS servers running TOS version `4.2.29` and lower vulnerable for an unauthenticated RCE.

It basically combines [CVE-2022-24990: Leaking sensitive information](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-24990) and [CVE-2022-24989: Authenticated remote code execution](https://www.redpacketsecurity.com/terramaster-tos-command-execution-cve-2022-24989/) to achieve an unauthenticated RCE by exploiting vulnerable endpoint `api.php?mobile/webNasIPS` leaking sensitive information such as admin password hash and mac address to achieve unauthenticated access and use the vulnerable endpoint`api.php?mobile/createRaid` with `POST` parameters `raidtype` / `diskstring` to execute remote code as root on TerraMaster NAS devices.

As usual, you can find the third module [here](https://github.com/h00die-gr3y/Metasploit/blob/main/terramaster_unauth_rce_cve_2022_24990.rb) in my local repository or as [PR 18086](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/18086) submitted at the Metasploit Github development.

With release of `TOS 5.x`, all of these vulnerabilities are now mitigated, but I would not be surprised that in the near future, some new exploits will come to surface looking back at the ugly history of TerraMaster flaws in the past.

### Mitigation

Please update your `TOS version` up to the latest supported `TOS 4.2.x` version or `TOS 5.x` version to be protected against all known vulnerabilities and do **NOT** to expose your TerraMaster NAS devices directly to the Internet.
