- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of AR files within Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt. Specifically, there is a lack of validation to ensure the existence of an object before performing operations on it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-After-Free vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by opening a malicious AR file or by visiting a malicious web page. User interaction is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to deliver a malicious AR file to the target or lure the target to a malicious web page.
