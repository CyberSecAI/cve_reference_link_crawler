| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=698882#c0)  Sebastian Rasmussen    2018-01-22 06:12:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 14614](attachment.cgi?id=14614 "Minimized PDF from oss-fuzz.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=14614&action=edit "Minimized PDF from oss-fuzz.") Minimized PDF from oss-fuzz.  When running   build/sanitize/mutool draw -s t ./oss-fuzz-5490.pdf  an assert in openjpeg is triggered. I tried compiling openjpeg upstream [34dae137a9a8c04feaa9763ae7e09a86ecb10400](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?34dae137a9a8c04feaa9763ae7e09a86ecb10400) which is the commit mupdf uses at the moment. Running   opj_decompress -i ./oss-fuzz-5490.pdf -o image.pgm   does _not_ trigger the assert. So this must be researched further. The mupdf draw output follows below:  error: cannot recognize xref format warning: trying to repair broken xref warning: repairing PDF document warning: object missing 'endobj' token error: no XObject subtype specified error: no XObject subtype specified error: no XObject subtype specified error: no XObject subtype specified error: no XObject subtype specified error: no XObject subtype specified error: zlib error: invalid distance too far back warning: read error; treating as end of file error: freetype: cannot load font: unknown file format warning: ignored error when loading embedded font; attempting to load system font error: no XObject subtype specified warning: openjpeg warning: In SOT marker, TPSot (176) is not valid regards to the current number of tile-part (7), skipping  mutool: thirdparty/openjpeg/src/lib/openjp2/cio.c:552: opj_stream_get_number_byte_left: Assertion `p_stream->m_user_data_length >= (OPJ_UINT64)p_stream->m_byte_offset' failed. Aborted ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=698882#c1)  Sebastian Rasmussen    2018-09-05 17:35:57 UTC  ``` By extracting the j2k stream and attempting to decode this with the openjpeg command line too I can reproduce the crash. By doing the same decoding with the most recent version of openjpeg an error is printed instead. Thus I believe that upgrading openjpeg to a later version will fix this issue. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=698882#c2)  Sebastian Rasmussen    2018-09-13 17:26:40 UTC  ``` It is not only oss-fuzz 5490 that may be fixed by upgrading openjpeg, in addition 7673, 8129, 8269, 8866, 9379, 9380 and 9734 all seem to be fixable by updating openjpeg. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=698882#c3)  Sebastian Rasmussen    2018-09-21 11:49:07 UTC  ``` Fixed in  commit [2b06a50140b7eb81eb55dcc1547fee4e8842e697](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?2b06a50140b7eb81eb55dcc1547fee4e8842e697) Author: Sebastian Rasmussen <sebras@gmail.com> Date:   Fri Sep 14 00:46:28 2018 +0800      Update to OpenJPEG 2.3.0.          There is a regression for 2325_-_JPX_image_with_padding_rejected.pdf.     Object 3 in that document is a JPX-encoded image. Its EOC marker is     preceded by two extra bytes of data, 0x80 0x80. This makes the file     broken according to the JPEG 2000 specification.          Acrobat Reader and the Kakadu JPX decoder accepts this file without     issues, so OpenJPEG 2.1.0 added code to fix this (bug 226, commit     [005e75bdc](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?005e75bdc)). That fix detects exactly two bytes of 0x80 0x80, a rather     brittle fix. Adding more padding or changing the padding byte values     is not accepted. Adding more padding is acceptable to Acrobat Reader     and Kakadu. An unrelated fix for another problem has since broken     OpenJPEG's support for this broken image. ``` |  |
