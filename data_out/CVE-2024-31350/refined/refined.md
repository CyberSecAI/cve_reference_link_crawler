The provided content is related to CVE-2024-31350.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the AWP Classifieds plugin. This lack of proper access control allows an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Broken Access Control: The core issue is a failure to enforce proper access control mechanisms, which leads to unauthorized actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact varies, but a successful exploit could lead to an unprivileged user performing actions they should not be able to do, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or other security breaches.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the vulnerable function within the AWP Classifieds plugin, where the broken access control allows malicious requests to bypass normal access restrictions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user with a subscriber role or lower. This means any logged-in user with minimal permissions.
