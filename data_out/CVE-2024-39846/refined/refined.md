The provided content discusses a commit in the NewPass project that addresses password storage, but it does not relate to a specific CVE. The commit changes the way passwords are stored by hashing them before storing them in encrypted shared preferences.

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The previous implementation stored the database encryption password directly in `EncryptedSharedPreferences`, though encrypted. This could potentially be vulnerable if the encryption was ever compromised.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present (prior to commit):**
- Direct storage of the encryption password even if encrypted.

**Impact of exploitation (prior to commit):**
- If the encrypted storage was compromised, attackers could potentially gain access to the encryption password, thereby exposing the user's database.

**Attack vectors (prior to commit):**
- Unauthorized access to the device or shared preferences

**Required attacker capabilities/position (prior to commit):**
- Ability to access the device's storage or compromise the shared preferences encryption.

**Changes introduced by the commit:**
- The user's password is now hashed using `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256` before being stored in `EncryptedSharedPreferences`.
- A randomly generated salt is used for each password hash, improving security.
- The salt and hash are stored as a base64 encoded string.
- During login, the entered password is also hashed using the same salt and is compared against the stored hash.

**Improvements Introduced by the commit:**
-  Improved password security by not storing passwords directly
-  Improved password security by using a salt
- Makes it harder for an attacker to perform a dictionary or rainbow table attack.

**No vulnerability is mentioned or fixed with this commit, rather, a security enhancement is made.**
