Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the Jodit rich text editor. Specifically, the editor fails to completely filter out malicious XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the editor, which are then executed in the browsers of other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability can lead to:
    *   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session.
    *   **Data Theft:** Attackers could potentially steal sensitive data, such as session cookies, or user credentials.
    *   **Website Manipulation:** Attackers may manipulate the content or appearance of the website, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** In some cases, they could be used to distribute malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the Jodit rich text editor. An attacker injects malicious code into the editor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to input text into the Jodit editor, typically a user who has access to the editor.
*   The attacker needs to be aware of the specific XSS vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The reported payload is `<iframe src="JavaScript: alert (/xss/)">`. This payload demonstrates the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code via an iframe with a javascript: URI.
*   The vulnerability affects Jodit Editor versions prior to `v.4.0.0-beta.86` however, the issue states that v.4.0.0-beta.86 is vulnerable and the version before this is not. This seems contradictory and should be investigated further.
*   The `clean_html` plugin of the editor can be used to manage the HTML tags allowed in the content. This suggests that the default configuration might be too permissive, allowing the injection of unsafe HTML elements or attributes.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a classic XSS issue within the Jodit rich text editor, where improper input sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts via `iframe` tags. This can be exploited to perform a wide range of attacks that compromise the users of the editor.
