Yours sincerely,
    Martin Heiland, Open-Xchange GmbH

Internal reference: MWB-2261
Type: CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'))
Component: backend
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by vendor
Last affected revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev50
First fixed revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev51
Discovery date: 2023-08-08
Solution date: 2023-09-14
Disclosure date: 2023-09-19
CVE: CVE-2023-29048
CVSS: 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Details:
OXMF templates allow remote code execution. A component for parsing OXMF templates could be abused to execute arbitrary
system commands that would be executed as the non-privileged runtime user.

Risk:
Users and attackers could run system commands with limited privilege to gain unauthorized access to confidential
information and potentially violate integrity by modifying resources. No publicly available exploits are known.

Solution:
The template engine has been reconfigured to deny execution of harmful commands on a system level.

Internal reference: MWB-2274
Type: CWE-90 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection'))
Component: backend
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by vendor
Last affected revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev50, OX App Suite backend 8.16
First fixed revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev51, OX App Suite backend 8.17
Discovery date: 2023-08-17
Solution date: 2023-09-18
Disclosure date: 2023-09-19
CVE: CVE-2023-29050
CVSS: 7.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L)

Details:
LDAP filter injection vulnerability in Contacts Provider LDAP. The optional "LDAP contacts provider" could be abused by
privileged users to inject LDAP filter strings that allow to access content outside of the intended hierarchy.

Risk:
Unauthorized users could break confidentiality of information in the directory and potentially cause high load on the
directory server, leading to denial of service. No publicly available exploits are known.

Solution:
Encoding has been added for user-provided fragments that are used when constructing the LDAP query.

Internal reference: OXUIB-2489
Type: CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))
Component: frontend
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by vendor
Last affected revision: OX App Suite frontend 7.10.6-rev33
First fixed revision: OX App Suite frontend 7.10.6-rev34
Discovery date: 2023-08-14
Solution date: 2023-09-18
Disclosure date: 2023-09-19
CVE: CVE-2023-29049
CVSS: 5.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

Details:
XSS in upsell portal widget. The "upsell" widget at the portal page could be abused to inject arbitrary script code.

Risk:
Attackers that manage to lure users to a compromised account, or gain temporary access to a legitimate account, could
inject script code to gain persistent code execution capabilities under a trusted domain. No publicly available
exploits are known.

Solution:
User input for this widget is now sanitized to avoid malicious content the be processed.
