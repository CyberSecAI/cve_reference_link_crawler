Dear subscribers,

We're sharing our latest advisory with you and like to thank everyone who contributed in finding and solving those
vulnerabilities. Feel free to join our bug bounty programs for OX AppSuite, Dovecot and PowerDNS at YesWeHack.

This advisory has also been published at <https://documentation.open-xchange.com/security/advisories/>.

Yours sincerely,
    Martin Heiland, Open-Xchange GmbH

Internal reference: MWB-2261
Type: CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'))
Component: backend
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by vendor
Last affected revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev50
First fixed revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev51
Discovery date: 2023-08-08
Solution date: 2023-09-14
Disclosure date: 2023-09-19
CVE: CVE-2023-29048
CVSS: 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Details:
OXMF templates allow remote code execution. A component for parsing OXMF templates could be abused to execute arbitrary
system commands that would be executed as the non-privileged runtime user.

Risk:
Users and attackers could run system commands with limited privilege to gain unauthorized access to confidential
information and potentially violate integrity by modifying resources. No publicly available exploits are known.

Solution:
The template engine has been reconfigured to deny execution of harmful commands on a system level.

Internal reference: MWB-2274
Type: CWE-90 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection'))
Component: backend
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by vendor
Last affected revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev50, OX App Suite backend 8.16
First fixed revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev51, OX App Suite backend 8.17
Discovery date: 2023-08-17
Solution date: 2023-09-18
Disclosure date: 2023-09-19
CVE: CVE-2023-29050
CVSS: 7.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L)

Details:
LDAP filter injection vulnerability in Contacts Provider LDAP. The optional "LDAP contacts provider" could be abused by
privileged users to inject LDAP filter strings that allow to access content outside of the intended hierarchy.

Risk:
Unauthorized users could break confidentiality of information in the directory and potentially cause high load on the
directory server, leading to denial of service. No publicly available exploits are known.

Solution:
Encoding has been added for user-provided fragments that are used when constructing the LDAP query.

Internal reference: OXUIB-2489
Type: CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))
Component: frontend
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by vendor
Last affected revision: OX App Suite frontend 7.10.6-rev33
First fixed revision: OX App Suite frontend 7.10.6-rev34
Discovery date: 2023-08-14
Solution date: 2023-09-18
Disclosure date: 2023-09-19
CVE: CVE-2023-29049
CVSS: 5.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

Details:
XSS in upsell portal widget. The "upsell" widget at the portal page could be abused to inject arbitrary script code.

Risk:
Attackers that manage to lure users to a compromised account, or gain temporary access to a legitimate account, could

ble. Not deploying this Patch Release may result in remote service exploitation, security threats to
users and exposure of sensitive data.

Detailed vulnerability descriptions will be publicly disclosed no earlier than fifteen (15) working days
after public availability of this Patch Release. There is no indication that one or more of these vulner-
abilities are already getting exploited or that information about them is publicly circulating.

2 Breaking Changes

Warning

This delivery is affected by changes which potentially require manual interactions at update time.
Please read this section carefully before updating and follow the guidance. We highly recommend
to prepare the update on a staging or test system in advance.
This public security Patch contains Update Tasks, see: SCR-1299 and SCR-1080

3 Vulnerabilities fixed since previous Public Release

This section provides a summary of bug fixes and changes that have been applied subsequently
to shipping Patch Release #6245. Solutions for vulnerabilities have been provided for the existing
code-base via Patch Releases.

OXUIB-2489 CVE-2023-29049
CVSS:5.4

MWB-2274 CVE-2023-29050
CVSS:7.6

MWB-2261 CVE-2023-29048
CVSS:8.8

4 Bugs fixed since previous Public Release

This section provides a summary of bug fixes and changes that have been applied subsequently to
shipping Patch Release #6245.

MWB-2242 Filestore difference between File System User and DB
Consistency check not working due to missing reference to user filestore, utility output incomplete
when per-user filestores are used.
This has been solved by taking over selected filestore ID properly during user creation, introducing
update task to re-insert missing filestore references, and collecting and outputting records properly
during ”list_unassigned”.

MWB-1621 Create users when email login is longer than 128 characters fails
Different max. sizes for user name, mail login, primary mail address, and further user aliases.
Solution: Have a max. common size of 191 characters for user name, mail login, primary mail
address, and further user aliases.

Release Notes for Patch Release #6248

5 Changes relevant for Operators

5.1 Changes of Database Schema

Change #SCR-1299 Extend the ”login” column for ”user_mail_account” and ”user_transport_ac-
count” tables
Extend the ”login” column for ”user_mail_account” and ”user_transport_account” tables from VAR-
CHAR(128) to VARCHAR(256).
Related Update Task: com.openexchange.groupware.update.tasks.MailAccountExtendLoginTask

Change #SCR-1080 Aligned sizes for user name, mail login, primary mail address and fur-
ther user aliases
Have a max. common size of 191 characters for user name, mail login, primary mail address and
further user aliases.
Related Update Task: com.openexchange.groupware.update.tasks.ExtendUserFieldsTask

5.2 Changes of Packaging

Change #SCR-1271 Updated Apache FreeMarker template engine
Updated Apache FreeMarker template engine from v.2.3.20 to v2.3.32 in bundle com.openexchange.tem-
plating.impl

6 Changes relevant for Developers

6.1 Changes of internal APIs

Change #SCR-1260 Introduced the ’lastModified’ field for the mail filter rule
Introduced the lastModified field for the mail filter rule. Now, when getting mail filters, an extra field
will be present hinting the client about the time the last modification happened to each individual
rule.
Note, that already existing rules will NOT have the ’lastModified’ timestamp, unless they are up-
dated.

7 Tests

Not all defects that got resolved could be reproduced within the lab. Therefore, we advise guided
and close monitoring of the reported defect when deploying to a staging or production environ-
ment. Defects which have not been fully verified, are marked as such.

To avoid side effects, the shipped packages have gone through automated regression test on
both, a Continuous Integration System and a dedicated server set-up for system and integration
testing. All changes have been checked for potential side-effects and effect on behavior. Unless
explicitly stated within this document, we do not expect any side-effects.

8 Fixed Bugs

MWB-2242, MWB-1621, OXUIB-2489, MWB-2274, MWB-2261,
