**Advisory ID:** NTAP-20160420-0001
**Version:**
22.0

**Last updated:**
09/14/2018

**Status:**
Final.

**CVEs:** CVE-2016-3443, CVE-2016-0687, CVE-2016-0686, CVE-2016-3427, CVE-2016-3449, CVE-2016-3422, CVE-2016-3425, CVE-2016-3426, CVE-2016-0695

Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetApp products incorporate the Oracle Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) software libraries. Java SE (JDK and JRE) versions below 6u115, 7u101, and 8u92 are susceptible to multiple vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthenticated remote code execution, a partial denial of service (DoS) of Java, or unauthorized reading or modification of a subset of data accessible to the Java process.This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available.

#### Impact

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may lead to an unauthorized Operating System takeover including arbitrary code execution, a partial denial of service (DOS) of Java SE and/or JavaFX, an unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some Java SE, JavaFX, or JRockit accessible data, as well as read access to a subset of Java SE or JRockit accessible data.
