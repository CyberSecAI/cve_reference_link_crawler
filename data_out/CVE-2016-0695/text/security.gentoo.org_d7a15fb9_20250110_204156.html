# IcedTea: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201606-18**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in IcedTea allowing remote
attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability through
various vectors.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/icedtea-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **7.2.6.6-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **7.2.6.6-r1**>= **3.0.1** |

### Background

IcedTea’s aim is to provide OpenJDK in a form suitable for easy
configuration, compilation and distribution with the primary goal of
allowing inclusion in GNU/Linux distributions.

### Description

Various OpenJDK attack vectors in IcedTea, such as 2D, Corba, Hotspot,
Libraries, and JAXP, exist which allows remote attackers to affect the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of vulnerable systems. Many
of the vulnerabilities can only be exploited through sandboxed Java Web
Start applications and java applets. Please review the CVE identifiers
referenced below for details.

### Impact

Remote attackers may execute arbitrary code, compromise information, or
cause Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known work around at this time.

### Resolution

Gentoo Security is no longer supporting dev-java/icedtea, as it has been
officially dropped from the stable tree.

Users of the IcedTea 3.x binary package should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/icedtea-bin-3.0.1"

```

Users of the IcedTea 7.x binary package should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/icedtea-7.2.6.6"

```
