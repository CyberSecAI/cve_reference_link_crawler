We have completed a major update that involves numerous quality fixes as well as the following new REST API functionality:-</span></p><ul><li><span>Created a new </span><strong>/content</strong><span> endpoint that returns a list of all of the content that a user has access to. This includes all Yellowfin Content types such as Views, Reports, Dashboards, Stories and more. This allows Customers for example, the ability to build their own content browsing solution in an embedded scenario.</span></li><li><span>Updated the </span><strong>/users</strong><span> endpoint to make it easier to use and also to return and allow the update of more user profile information such as timezone and language preferences..</span></li><li><span>Created new endpoints for </span><strong>/dashboards, /presentations and /themes</strong><span> to allow retrieval of lists of those content items or detailed information for a specific content item</span></li><li><span>Enhanced the </span><strong>/import-export</strong><span> endpoint with an option to list the dependencies of a Content Item from within an Import File. This could be used when determining whether the dependencies for a content item already exist on a target system - and enhances the ability for Customers to automate content synchronization between environments.</span></li><li><span>Created new </span><strong>/health</strong><span> endpoints that return the overall health of a Yellowfin deployment, including clustered deployments. There are two forms, a ping endpoint that does not require authentication and returns limited information, and a full health endpoint that returns comprehensive information about the deployment.</span></li><li><span>We added REST endpoints to trigger </span><strong>Cached Filter Refreshes</strong><span> for Dashboards and Views. This functionality was previously only available in our SOAP API.</span></li><li><span>We extended the </span><strong>/discussion-streams</strong><span> endpoint to allow new discussion streams to be created including within Client Orgs. This is useful in multi-tenant scenarios when onboarding new tenants and setting them up with a standard default environment that includes discussion streams.</span></li><li><span>We created a new </span><strong>Integration API</strong><span> utility that allows external developers to get information about the user and organization. This exposes a user-friendly interface to developers to avoid them having to reference internal Yellowfin methods to get the current user, role or client organization when developing custom headers, JSPs and internal plugins like formatters and analytic functions.</span></li></ul><p><span>Our current REST API documentation is stored in ReDoc and hosted <a class="external-link" href="https://developers.yellowfinbi.com/dev/api-docs/current/" rel="nofollow">here.</a></span></p><p><span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">There are a few breaking changes in the V3 API. If you are migrating from an earlier version, please consult the migration <a href="https://wiki.yellowfinbi.com/display/yfcurrent/REST+API#RESTAPI-GuidelinesformigratingtoV3oftheAPI" rel="nofollow">guide.</a></span></span></p><h4 id="ReleaseNotesforYellowfin9-OtherHighlights"><span>Other Highlights</span></h4><h5 id="ReleaseNotesforYellowfin9-ReportBuilder"><span>Report Builder</span></h5><p><span>The User Interface for re-ordering columns in the Report Builder has been improved.

Calculated totals are an extremely useful feature when using calculated fields in a report. It provides the option to re-execute the calculation at the total or sub-total level for a report, rather than using traditional aggregation types such as Sum, Average etc. This is useful for example where you use a calculation such as a ratio (return on equity for example). Previously, when used in a chart, this aggregation type was not available due to the fact that data was re-aggregated to create the chart itself. We have now added Calculated Total support to most chart types.</span></p><p><em>Check&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.yellowfinbi.com/display/yfcurrent/Calculations#Calculations-CalculatedTotal" rel="nofollow">Calculated Field</a> for more information.</em></p><p><span>We have continued to improve our charting capability, including the ability to apply micro-configurations to ensure our Customers can achieve the exact visual design they are looking for.

This uses Yellowfin&rsquo;s standard color picker that allows for a choice between standard colors or a fully custom color including the ability to enter the hexadecimal code of your favorite color.
