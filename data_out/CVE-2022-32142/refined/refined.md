- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CODESYS Control runtime system improperly handles crafted requests with invalid offsets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset. The software uses pointer offsets that are out of range.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can result in a denial-of-service condition or local memory overwrite.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can send a crafted request with invalid offsets to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated on the controller (or if no level 1 online password is configured on the controller). The attack can be performed remotely.
