Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2660:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The content from `security.gentoo.org`, `www.oracle.com`, and `security.netapp.com` all explicitly mention CVE-2020-2660.
   - These sources confirm that this CVE relates to a vulnerability in MySQL server and its related products.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability resides within the "Server: Optimizer" component of MySQL.
   - The specific nature of the flaw within the optimizer isn't detailed in the provided excerpts.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   -  A flaw exists within MySQL's optimizer that can be exploited by an attacker
   -  The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially cause a denial of service condition.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Denial of Service:** The primary impact, as indicated by all sources, is a potential hang or frequently repeatable crash of the MySQL server. This can cause partial or complete denial of service.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - The attack vector is generally over the network via the MySQL protocol.
   -  Specifics on how an attacker crafts malicious SQL to trigger the flaw in the optimizer are not detailed.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - The attacker needs network access to the MySQL server.
   - The attacker is typically required to have high privileges for exploitation as described in the risk matrices.
   - Some sources mention the ability to trigger the vulnerability with a lower privilege in some situations.

**Summary of Findings Across Sources:**

*   **Gentoo:** Lists CVE-2020-2660 as one of many MySQL vulnerabilities addressed in their advisory, indicating a need to upgrade affected packages.
*   **Oracle:**
    *   Includes CVE-2020-2660 in their Critical Patch Update advisory.
    *   Specifies that the vulnerability is located in the MySQL server's optimizer component.
    *   Highlights the risk of a denial-of-service (hang or crash)
    *   The risk matrix indicates that a high level of privilege is required for exploitation.
*   **NetApp:**
    *   Identifies the vulnerability within Oracle MySQL, impacting various NetApp products.
    *   Describes the impact as a potential denial of service.
    *   Provides a CVSS v3.0 score of 4.9 (MEDIUM).
    *  Indicates that the vulnerability is not remotely exploitable without authentication

**Additional Notes:**

*   The sources are consistent in identifying the affected component (MySQL optimizer) and the primary impact (denial of service).
*   None of the sources provides specific details on the technical specifics of the vulnerability such as the specific code flaw.

**Conclusion**

The vulnerability tracked by CVE-2020-2660 is a flaw in the MySQL optimizer that can potentially lead to a denial-of-service.  The attacker would require high privileges to trigger the vulnerability. The provided documents emphasize the need to patch vulnerable MySQL installations, the need for high privileges, and the potential to cause a denial of service.
