**Affected Software:** WordPress Mantra Theme

**Vulnerable Versions:** <= 3.3.2

**Root Cause:** The theme is susceptible to XSS, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

*   The specific impact varies but can lead to defacement, redirection, or the execution of malicious code in users' browsers.

**Attack Vectors:**  A malicious actor injects scripts into the website, likely through user-supplied input or a vulnerability that is not sanitized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into a field or input that is not properly sanitized by the theme.
*   The attacker needs Contributor-level privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
