Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The WordPress "Posts and Users Stats" plugin, versions 1.1.3 and earlier, is vulnerable to CSV Injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **CSV Injection:** The plugin is susceptible to CSV injection, which means it doesn't properly sanitize or escape data that is later exported to a CSV file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious formulas into the exported data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   A malicious actor can craft malicious formulas within the CSV data.
-   When a user opens the crafted CSV file with spreadsheet software, the injected formulas can be executed.
-   This execution could allow the attacker to:
    - Exploit vulnerabilities within the spreadsheet software.
    - Execute arbitrary commands on the victim's computer.
    - Potentially gain access to the victim's PC.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker would need to inject malicious formulas into data that is exported via the plugin into a CSV file. The specific input method isn't described, but a likely method would be through user-controlled data being included in statistics.
- The victim would then need to download and open the crafted CSV file using spreadsheet software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to inject data that will be exported to a CSV file, this is likely performed through a user-accessible function, such as posts, users, or comments, since the plugin's name is "Posts and Users Stats".
- The attacker would likely be a subscriber, as indicated by the "Required privilege" section.
- The attacker does not require specific high-level access.
