Subject: CVE-2024-6119: OpenSSL: Possible denial of service in X.509 name checks

OpenSSL Security Advisory [3rd September 2024]
==============================================

Possible denial of service in X.509 name checks (CVE-2024-6119)
===============================================================

Severity: Moderate

Issue summary: Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS
clients checking server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory
address resulting in abnormal termination of the application process.

Impact summary: Abnormal termination of an application can a cause a denial of
service.

Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS clients checking
server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address when
comparing the expected name with an `otherName` subject alternative name of an
X.509 certificate. This may result in an exception that terminates the
application program.

Note that basic certificate chain validation (signatures, dates, ...) is not
affected, the denial of service can occur only when the application also
specifies an expected DNS name, Email address or IP address.

TLS servers rarely solicit client certificates, and even when they do, they
generally don't perform a name check against a "reference identifier" (expected
identity), but rather extract the presented identity after checking the
certificate chain.  So TLS servers are generally not affected and the severity
of the issue is Moderate.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.
OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are also not affected by this issue.

OpenSSL 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.

OpenSSL 3.3 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.3.2

OpenSSL 3.2 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.2.3

OpenSSL 3.1 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.1.7

OpenSSL 3.0 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.15

This issue was reported on 16th June 2024 by David Benjamin (Google),
reiterating an AddressSanitizer issue raised on 30th September 2021.  The fix
was developed by Viktor Dukhovni.

I.e., curl, wget, et al, and possibly (and more importantly IMO) apache/nginx proxying to another server.  Speculating here: this could affect high volume web services where security is enough of a concern that the operators have enabled certificate name checks.

It seems to be worked on.Â  The fix is already in the tree as of
yesterday.

I imagine there will be a SA in the near future.

```
The incorrectly typed data is read only, used in a compare operation, so
neither remote code execution, nor memory content disclosure were possible.
However, applications performing certificate name checks were vulnerable to
denial of service.

The GENERAL_TYPE data type is a union, and we must take care to access the
correct member, based on `gen->type`, not all the member fields have the same
structure, and a segfault is possible if the wrong member field is read.

The code in question was lightly refactored with the intent to make it more
obviously correct.

```
The incorrectly typed data is read only, used in a compare operation, so
neither remote code execution, nor memory content disclosure were possible.
However, applications performing certificate name checks were vulnerable to
denial of service.

The GENERAL_TYPE data type is a union, and we must take care to access the
correct member, based on `gen->type`, not all the member fields have the same
structure, and a segfault is possible if the wrong member field is read.

The code in question was lightly refactored with the intent to make it more
obviously correct.

OpenSSL Security Advisory [3rd September 2024]
==============================================
Possible denial of service in X.509 name checks (CVE-2024-6119)
===============================================================
Severity: Moderate
Issue summary: Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS
clients checking server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory
address resulting in abnormal termination of the application process.
Impact summary: Abnormal termination of an application can a cause a denial of
service.
Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS clients checking
server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address when
comparing the expected name with an `otherName` subject alternative name of an
X.509 certificate. This may result in an exception that terminates the
application program.
Note that basic certificate chain validation (signatures, dates, ...) is not
affected, the denial of service can occur only when the application also
specifies an expected DNS name, Email address or IP address.
TLS servers rarely solicit client certificates, and even when they do, they
generally don't perform a name check against a "reference identifier" (expected
identity), but rather extract the presented identity after checking the
certificate chain. So TLS servers are generally not affected and the severity
of the issue is Moderate.
The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.
OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are also not affected by this issue.
OpenSSL 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.
OpenSSL 3.3 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.3.2
OpenSSL 3.2 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.2.3
OpenSSL 3.1 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.1.7
OpenSSL 3.0 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.15
This issue was reported on 16th June 2024 by David Benjamin (Google),
reiterating an AddressSanitizer issue raised on 30th September 2021. The fix
was developed by Viktor Dukhovni.

```
The incorrectly typed data is read only, used in a compare operation, so
neither remote code execution, nor memory content disclosure were possible.
However, applications performing certificate name checks were vulnerable to
denial of service.

The GENERAL_TYPE data type is a union, and we must take care to access the
correct member, based on `gen->type`, not all the member fields have the same
structure, and a segfault is possible if the wrong member field is read.

The code in question was lightly refactored with the intent to make it more
obviously correct.

```
The incorrectly typed data is read only, used in a compare operation, so
neither remote code execution, nor memory content disclosure were possible.
However, applications performing certificate name checks were vulnerable to
denial of service.

The GENERAL_TYPE data type is a union, and we must take care to access the
correct member, based on `gen->type`, not all the member fields have the same
structure, and a segfault is possible if the wrong member field is read.

The code in question was lightly refactored with the intent to make it more
obviously correct.

|  |  | \* in Section 6, SmtpUTF8Mailbox subjectAltName MUST NOT |
|  |  | \* be used unless the local-part of the email address |
|  |  | \* contains non-ASCII characters. When the local-part is |
|  |  | \* ASCII, rfc822Name subjectAltName MUST be used instead |
|  |  | \* of SmtpUTF8Mailbox. This is compatible with legacy |
|  |  | \* software that supports only rfc822Name (and not |
|  |  | \* SmtpUTF8Mailbox). [...] |
|  |  | \* |
|  |  | \* SmtpUTF8Mailbox is encoded as UTF8String. |
|  |  | \* |
|  |  | \* If it is not a UTF8String then that is unexpected, and |
|  |  | \* we ignore the invalid SAN (neither set san\_present nor |
|  |  | \* consider it a candidate for equality). This does mean |
|  |  | \* that the subject CN may be considered, as would be the |
|  |  | \* case when the malformed SmtpUtf8Mailbox SAN is instead |
|  |  | \* simply absent. |
|  |  | \* |
