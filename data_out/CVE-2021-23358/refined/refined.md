Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-23358

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization in the `template` function of the Underscore JavaScript library. Specifically, when the `variable` option is taken from `_.templateSettings`, it is not properly sanitized before being used, which allows for arbitrary code injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Arbitrary Code Injection: The primary weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary code due to the lack of sanitization.
- Unsafe use of `_.templateSettings`: The `variable` property within `_.templateSettings` is directly used to generate code, which makes it vulnerable when not handled correctly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server or client-side where the vulnerable code is used.
- Loss of Confidentiality: The injected code can be used to steal sensitive information.
- Data Modification: Attackers can modify data due to the vulnerability.
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can potentially disrupt the availability of the application.
- Total loss of confidentiality: resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is by manipulating the `variable` option within the `_.templateSettings` object when using the template function.
- Network attacks are possible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the `variable` property within `_.templateSettings` in the context where the underscore library is being used.
- The attacker requires privileges that provide significant (e.g., administrative) control over the vulnerable component allowing access to component-wide settings and files.
- No user interaction is required.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered within the `template` function when it processes the `variable` property from `_.templateSettings` without proper sanitization.
- Proof of Concept (PoC): The provided PoC demonstrates how to inject code using `_.templateSettings.variable` to execute system commands.
   ```javascript
    const _ = require('underscore');
    _.templateSettings.variable = "a = this.process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('touch HELLO')";
    const t = _.template("")();
   ```

**Affected Versions:**
-  `underscore` versions before 1.13.1 are affected.
- Specifically, versions `1.13.0-0` up to but not including `1.13.0-2` and `1.3.2` up to but not including `1.12.1` are mentioned.

**Fix:**
- Upgrade `underscore` to version 1.13.1 or higher.

**Additional Notes:**
- Snyk indicates that they have a PoC or detailed explanation for this vulnerability.
- This vulnerability is categorized as CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code).
- Multiple sources such as Fedora, Debian, Tenable and Snyk identify this CVE.

**CVSS Score:**
- Snyk: CVSS 3.1 score of 5.5 (Medium)
- NVD: CVSS 3.1 score of 7.2 (High)
- Red Hat: CVSS 3.1 score of 7.2 (High)
