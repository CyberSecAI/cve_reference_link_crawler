{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing and displaying it in the 'Subject' field of the 'Add Discussion' component.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers who view the affected page. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, and other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects a malicious payload, specifically an <img src=a onerror=alert(1)> tag into the Subject field of the 'Add Discussion' component under Submissions, while logged in as an administrator. This malicious code gets stored in the application database and is executed when the stored content is viewed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access the 'Submissions' section and add discussions. They also need to have the ability to input text into the subject field."
