Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is that GitLab Duo Chat does not respect the SSO enforcement settings applied to groups. It bypasses the check for active SSO sessions, allowing access to issues and epics even when SSO is required for regular web access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Bypass of Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the enforced SSO restriction for accessing sensitive group resources (issues and epics).
- **Lack of Session Validation:** Duo Chat lacks proper validation of active SSO sessions when accessing resources, unlike other parts of the GitLab UI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized users within a group can gain access to the content of issues and epics within that group, even if they are not authenticated through the required SSO mechanism.
- **Data Leakage:** Sensitive information contained within the issues and epics can be leaked to users who would normally be blocked.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Duo Chat Interface:** The attack vector is through the GitLab Duo Chat interface.
- **Direct URL Input:** The attacker directly provides the URL of the target resource (issue or epic) within the Duo Chat prompt.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Group Membership:** The attacker must be a member of the target GitLab group.
- **No Active SSO Session:** The attacker must *not* have an active SSO session that would normally be required to access the group's resources.
- **Access to Duo Chat:** The attacker must have access to the GitLab Duo Chat feature.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects groups with "Enforce SSO-only authentication for web activity" enabled.
- The attacker needs to be a member of the group where SSO is enabled.
- The vulnerability is present because Duo Chat is not checking for valid SSO sessions before accessing data.
- The provided steps to reproduce are clear and well-defined.
