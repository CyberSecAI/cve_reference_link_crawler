In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mmc: uniphier-sd: Fix a resource leak in the remove function

A 'tmio_mmc_host_free()' call is missing in the remove function, in order
to balance a 'tmio_mmc_host_alloc()' call in the probe.
This is done in the error handling path of the probe, but not in the remove
function.

Add the missing call.
