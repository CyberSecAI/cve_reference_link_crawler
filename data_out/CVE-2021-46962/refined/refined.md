The provided content relates to CVE-2021-46962.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A resource leak exists in the `uniphier_sd_remove` function of the `uniphier-sd.c` driver. The function was missing a call to `tmio_mmc_host_free()`, which is necessary to balance the `tmio_mmc_host_alloc()` call made during the probe.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a resource leak due to a missing `tmio_mmc_host_free()` call in the driver's remove function. This contrasts with the error handling path within the probe function which correctly includes this call.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A memory leak would occur each time the driver is removed and unloaded. Repeated loading/unloading of the driver could eventually cause memory exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by removing the driver and would not require any special attacker capability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker only requires the ability to load and unload the affected driver, which is a local operation.
