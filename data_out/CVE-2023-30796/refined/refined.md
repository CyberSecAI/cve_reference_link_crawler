Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-30796:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds read occurs when parsing specially crafted JT files. This happens because the application attempts to read beyond the end of an allocated memory structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read:** The vulnerability is specifically categorized as an out-of-bounds read, meaning the software is accessing memory outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Application Crash:** Exploiting this vulnerability can cause the application to crash.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious JT File:** The attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a specially crafted, malicious JT file with an affected application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a method to get the user to open the malicious file, but this can be achieved by a local user or a user who downloaded the file.
- **User Interaction:** The user must be tricked into opening the malicious JT file. This is classified as "User Interaction Required".
