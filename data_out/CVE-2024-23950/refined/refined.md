Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2024-23950:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `igl::MshLoader::parse_element_field` function in `MshLoader.cpp` when processing binary `.msh` files.
*   The code reads an element index (`elem_idx`) from the input file and uses it to write data into the `field` vector.
*   Critically, there's **no check** to ensure that `elem_idx` is within the bounds of the `field` vector, which was previously sized based on a value read from the file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Write:** The primary weakness is the lack of bounds checking on `elem_idx` before writing data to the `field` vector. A malicious file can specify an `elem_idx` value that, when multiplied by `num_components`, goes beyond the allocated size of the vector, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The out-of-bounds write can overwrite adjacent memory locations. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the data being written and the memory being overwritten.
*   **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability could also lead to a crash, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted `.msh` file containing a malicious element index value that triggers the vulnerability when parsed by `libigl`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to have the victim load a malicious `.msh` file. This typically involves user interaction or a service that loads user-provided files.
*   **File Creation:** The attacker must be able to craft a malicious `.msh` file.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet in `igl::MshLoader::parse_element_field (binary file)` is:

```c++
IGL_INLINE void igl::MshLoader::parse_element_field(std::ifstream& fin) {
    ...
    for (size_t i=0; i<num_int_tags; i++)
[0]     fin >> int_tags[i];

    if (num_string_tags <= 0 || num_int_tags <= 2) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Invalid file format");
    }
    std::string fieldname = str_tags[0];
    int num_components = int_tags[1];
[1] int num_entries = int_tags[2];
    std::vector<Float> field(num_entries*num_components);

    if (m_binary) {
        size_t num_bytes = (num_components * m_data_size + 4) * num_entries;
        char* data = new char[num_bytes];
        igl::_msh_eat_white_space(fin);
        fin.read(data, num_bytes);
        for (int i=0; i < num_entries; i++) {
                int elem_idx;
                // works with sizeof(int)==4
[2]             memcpy(&elem_idx, &data[i*(4+num_components*m_data_size)],4);
                elem_idx -= 1;

                // directly copy data into vector storage space
[3]             memcpy(&field[elem_idx*num_components], &data[i*(4+num_components*m_data_size) + 4], m_data_size*num_components);
        }
        delete [] data;
    } else {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

The issue lies at [3], where `elem_idx` read at [2], which is controlled by the attacker, is used to write to the `field` vector without checking if `elem_idx * num_components` exceeds `field.size()`. `field` is initialized with a size of `num_entries * num_components` at [1].
