## Security Update

* **[CVE-2022-21679](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2CVE-2022-21679i])**:
  Istio versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 contain a vulnerability where configuration for proxies at version 1.11 is generated incorrectly, affecting the `hosts` and `notHosts` field in the authorization policy.
* **[CVE-2022-21701](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2CVE-2022-21679i])**:
  Istio versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 are vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`.

## Changes

* **Added** privileged flag to Istio-CNI Helm charts to set `securityContext` flag.
  ([Issue #34211](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/34211))
* **Fixed** an issue where enabling tracing with telemetry API would cause a malformed host header being used at the trace report request.
  ([Issue #35750](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/35750))
* **Fixed** `istioctl pc log` command label selector not selecting the default pod.
  ([Issue #36182](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/36182))

  ([Issue #36245](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/36245))
* **Fixed** omitted setting `.Values.sidecarInjectiorWebhook.enableNamespacesByDefault` in the default revision
  mutating webhook and added –auto-inject-namespaces flag to `istioctl tag` controlling this setting.
  ([Issue #36258](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/36258))
* **Fixed** values in the Istio Gateway Helm charts for configuring annotations on the Service. Can be used to configure load balancer in public clouds.
  ([Pull Request #36384](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/36384))
* **Fixed** the incorrect format of version and revision in the build info.
  ([Pull Request #36409](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/36409))
* **Fixed** an issue where stale endpoints can be configured when a service gets deleted and created again.
  ([Issue #36510](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/36510))
* **Fixed** an issue that sidecar iptables will cause intermittent connection reset due to the out of window packet.
  Introduced a flag `meshConfig.defaultConfig.proxyMetadata.INVALID_DROP` to control this setting.
  ([Issue #36489](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/36489))
* **Fixed** `operator init --dry-run` creates unexpected namespaces.
  ([Pull Request #36570](https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/36570))

# Privileged Escalation in Kubernetes Gateway API

Moderate

[howardjohn](/howardjohn)
published
GHSA-mq8f-9446-c28r
Jan 19, 2022

## Package

gomod

istio.io/istio
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

1.12.0-1.12.1

## Patched versions

1.12.2

## Description

### Impact

Istio version 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 are vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`.

#### Am I Impacted?

This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature, the [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/gateway-api/). This is not the same as the Istio `Gateway` type (`gateways.networking.istio.io`), which is not vulnerable.

Your cluster may be impacted if:

* You have the Kubernetes Gateway CRD installed. This can be detected with `kubectl get crd gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io`.
* You have not set the `PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=false` environment variable in Istiod (this is defaulted to `true`).
* Untrusted users have `CREATE` permissions for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects.

### Patches

Istio 1.12.2+ are patched.

Older Istio versions are not impacted.

### Workarounds

If you are unable to upgrade, any of the following will prevent this vulnerability:

* Remove the `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` CustomResourceDefinition.
* Set `PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=false` environment variable in Istiod.
* Remove `CREATE` permissions for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects from untrusted users.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
