### Changes affecting third-party developers and designers

* Upgraded Whoops to version 2.9.1.
* Added support for web push notifications. To support these kinds of notifications, you will need to add parse*mobile*\* methods in your Notification extensions.
* Added a `$count` parameter to `\IPS\Content::definiteArticle/_definiteArticle()`. If an integer is passed, a pluralized phrase will be used, if available. You should add pluralized strings for any `__defart_*` strings you've already created. The key should be in the format `__defart_*_plural`.
* Added constant `ACP_SESSION_TIMEOUT` to allow administrators to control how long AdminCP sessions are valid for.
* Added a per-application setting to hide the application on the announcement creation form (this setting's use may be expanded in the future).
* Added theme settings to control header height (desktop & mobile sizes), which are used in the existing CSS variables.
* Added version to the filename of exported apps/plugins/themes/languages.
* Added `\IPS\DateTime::roundedDiff()` and `\IPS\DateTime::roundedDiffFromSeconds()` to return a human-readable rounded diff of two datetime objects, or a diff based on a supplied number of seconds, respectively.
* Added a new 'enforceMaxLimit' option for \IPS\Form\Helper\Password elements to bypass the max 72 character limit.
* Added an option to set `orderResults` to `FALSE` for `\IPS\Helpers\Form\Item` instances to return results in the order the user specified.
* Added a new javascript utility method to adjust external links to force them to open in a new window: `ips.utils.links.updateExternalLinks`. This is called automatically on the contentChange event, but may also be called manually in situations where the contentChange event is not fired.
* Improved the extensibility of Cache/DataStore methods.
* Updated some uses of border-radius to use existing CSS variables.
* Changed template groups and locations to be case-sensitive, which fixes an issue enabling designers mode on a server using a case-sensitive file system.
* Changed the logic that controls how pagination is shown in templates. The `data-role="tablePagination"` element should now always exist in the table DOM; it will be shown/hidden dynamically if pagination is required after AJAX requests.
* Fixed an error that can occur when dev sync runs if you are not logged in and the application has a whatsnew.json file in its latest version folder.
* Fixed broken progress bar when enabling designers mode.
* Fixed numeric values passed to the REST API `/core/members/{id}` endpoint not always adjusting the property, and sometimes causing an SQL error.
* Fixed the "Upcoming Events" widget not showing when developer mode is enabled.
* Fixed an issue using the `hide` option for `contentAction` when deleting a member via the REST API.
* Fixed `eq()` pseudo-selector no longer being supported in theme hooks.
* Fixed `required()` pseudo-selector not working in theme hooks.
* Fixed `\IPS\Content\Statistics` not working for applications that use a database column prefix.
* Fixed theme hooks on Forums > index > forumGridItem not working as expected.
* Fixed a missing redirect when hiding comments using multi-moderation on classes that do not define a `$hideLogKey` property.
* Fixed the constructor for `\IPS\nexus\DomainLookup` not honoring the `$performWhoisLookup` parameter.
* Fixed some inconsistent HTML with building the quick search menu options.
* Fixed an error that can occur when sessions are cleared.
* Fixed a bug where a notification flash instance without an image passed (i.e. a notification with no author) results in a broken image.

* Fixed installing plugins generating an invalid widgets.json file.
* Fixed an error deleting Pages templates in the AdminCP when developer mode is enabled.
* Fixed issues adding/editing database indexes for applications.
* Fixed an issue where you could not hook into `\IPS\Redis`.
* Fixed an undefined index notice parsing valid ICS feeds with no events in them.
* Fixed an inaccurate Redis log entry indicating read server used instead of write server.
* Abstracted code in `\IPS\core\modules\admin\members\members::export()` to make it easier to apply hooks to member list exports.
* Removed ability to reorder queries for upgrader in the developer center. Developers should manually reorder the JSON file if necessary.
* Removed the `onOtherAppUninstall()` method from application Uninstall extensions in favor of `onOtherUninstall()`.
* Removed several deprecated methods and properties throughout the Suite and verified core code no longer references those methods and properties.
* Enforced the `$type` parameter for `\IPS\Email::buildFromContent()` and `\IPS\Email::buildFromTemplate()` with an error if the type is not specified.
* The `markRead()` method will no longer consider an `updated` column if `last_comment` or `last_review` is defined.
* A number of caching improvements have been implemented, please make sure your pages are sending no-cache headers if you do not want them cached.
* Non-AJAX requests that retain a CSRF token in the URL with a 200 response code will now trigger a development error recommending to redirect the request or otherwise remove the CSRF token. Leaving a CSRF token in the URL while generating a page can represent a security risk if remote images (for example) are embedded on the page, as the CSRF token could be susceptible to interception by the remote party.
* Support for notification sounds in the browser has been removed. If you rely on playing sounds, you will need to implement this functionality in your application.
* Add new method was added to the IPS\Content\Item class which is called when an item is deleted. It's receiving the comment/review ids which are going to be deleted, allowing you to remove any additional cleanup calls based on the comments and reviews in this item.
* Updated the ModCP content restore (soft delete) to use the built in `restore()` method instead of using its own code.
* Account settings will no longer prompt for re-authentication if the account does not have a way of re-authenticating. Applies mostly to custom SSO integrations.

Important Method Changes:

* Added a `$seperator` parameter to `\IPS\CustomField::displayValues` which can be used to define a custom seperator when displaying multiple values .
* Updated method signature for `\IPS\Node\Model::getLastCommentTime()`.
* Added a `$count` parameter to `\IPS\Content::definiteArticle/_definiteArticle()`. If an integer is passed, a pluralized phrase will be used, if available. You should add pluralized strings for any `__defart_*` strings you've already created. The key should be in the format `__defart_*_plural`.
