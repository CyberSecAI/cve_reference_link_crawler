## Description

#### Introduction to WP Private Content Plus

[WP Private Content Plus](https://www.wpexpertdeveloper.com/wp-private-content-plus/?ref=wporg1) simplifies the process for protecting your important WordPress site content from guests,members,specific user roles or group of selected users. This plugin supports content restrictions on posts,pages,custom post types, navigation menus,widgets and post attachments.Also the plugin allows you to hide specific content within posts and pages using a shortcode.

[Documentation](https://www.wpexpertdeveloper.com/wp-private-content-plus-documentation/?ref=wporg1) || [Support](https://www.wpexpertdeveloper.com/support/?ref=wporg1) || [WP Private Content Pro](https://www.wpexpertdeveloper.com/wp-private-content-pro/?ref=wporg1)

Apart from that you will get a unique private portal page for every user of your site and let the administrator add user specific content to this client area. Only the owner will be able to see the content in this private portal. WP Private Content Plus provides the ability to display different menu items to different users based on their login status as well as user roles. You can extend the private area with private discussions (private messages) and private files using the [PRO Version](https://www.wpexpertdeveloper.com/wp-private-content-pro/?ref=wporg2).

### User Profiles Made Easy Integration

WP Private Content Plus is a plugin that protects your content from different type of users. It involves many user management related features. This version is not capable of handling user related functions such as frontend login, frontend registration, member directory and user profile search. So we have integrated WP Private Content Plus with popular [User Profiles Made Easy](https://goo.gl/FjiZ1N) plugin to offer complete features related to user management and content protection. WP Private Content Plus handled the content restriction management while User Profiles Made Easy handles frontend user features related to content restriction.

### [No Support](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/no-support-550/)

[jstraete](https://profiles.wordpress.org/jstraete/ "Posts by jstraete")
March 22, 2023

There are several comments on a thread support message regarding an issue with the latest version of the plugin. Another user commented that the author has not shown as active here since 2021. I have since found another plugin to replace this one given the lack of support from the developer on this plugin.

The plugin worked great as long as you we did not use any search functionality on the site. After implementing the standard wordpress search we did not get any search results and had to activate/deactivate all plugins till we found that this one blocks displaying any search results.

1) you do not understand how to login and it is NOT explained (need an external plugin? boh)
2) it is not clear how to land into the private page of userA and it is NOT explained
3) even if the plugin is enabled the private-page slug returns a 404
4) the documentation is short and useless and does NOT explain in any way how to access your private pages / posts.
5) I was unable to use the plugin after 1 hour of testing
6) you are so greedy that you want to get customers to pay for the “PrEmIuM” version that you have not bothered to explain the basic functions to your followers. good.

If you were looking for a simple way to restrict certain pages by user role, don’t waste your time unless you plan on paying. They literally only included the most basic features most of which you can already do with WP by default. The way these plugin developers rope you in with their “free plan” but give you every useless feature, only allowing you access just up to the point of making the plugin useful then they hit you with the Must Upgrade. If they would make these plugins usable and make the more advance stuff requiring an upgrade, I might pay for some, but they make the free versions look good in the description then you install them, DENIED. Worse, when you go to delete the plugin that doest work as you thought, they don’t clean up after themselves and leave crap all over your database! ARGH!

### Description

The WP Private Content Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 3.6. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting access to posts via the REST API when a page has been made private. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view protected posts.
