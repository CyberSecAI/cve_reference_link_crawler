				pcf2bdf

INSTALL

	for gcc:
	make -f Makefile.gcc install

	for visual c++:
	nmake -f Makefile.vc

NAME
	pcf2bdf  - convert X font from Portable Compiled Format to
	Bitmap Distribution Format

SYNOPSIS
	pcf2bdf [ -v ] [ -o outputfile ] [ fontfile.pcf[.gz] ]

DESCRIPTION
	Pcf2bdf is a font de-compiler.  It converts  X  font  from
	Portable Compiled Format (PCF) to Bitmap Distribution For-
	mat (BDF).  It can also accept  a  compressed/gzipped  PCF
	file as input, but gzip must be found in your PATH.

	FONTBOUNDINGBOX in a BDF file is not used by bdftopcf , so
	pcf2bdf generates irresponsible values.

OPTIONS
	-v      very verbose output.

	-o output-file-name
		 By default pcf2bdf writes the bdf file to standard
		 output; this option gives the name of a file to be
		 used instead.

SEE ALSO
	bdftopcf(1), X(7)

| Hello [@ganaware](https://github.com/ganaware), as discussed earlier: I have compiled pcf2bdf with address sanitization and fuzz-tested inputs with AFL. The file is partially parsed before the program crashes due to a segmentation fault. The actual input file is stored within the zipped folder attached.  Input: `./pcf2bdf segfault_deadly_signal`  Output:  ``` ...... parsed content to stdout ......

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
