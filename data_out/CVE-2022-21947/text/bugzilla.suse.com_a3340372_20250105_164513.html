| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1197491#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2022-03-24 16:39:53 UTC  ``` CVE-2022-21947 assigned to a new rancher issue. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1197491#c1)  Matthew Farina   2022-03-24 18:53:15 UTC  ``` This CVE was used in a GitHub advisory at <https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-desktop/security/advisories/GHSA-x5mj-x8h3-9pcc>  The details we put on GitHub can be used to go along with the CVE itself.  Thanks for the quick turn around on an ID.  This is for a vulnerability found in Rancher Desktop (<https://rancherdesktop.io>). The first affected version is 1.2.0 and the fix version is 1.2.1 (was released less than 24 hours after 1.2.0). Note, Rancher Desktop has an auto-update mechanism for many (most?) users. The fix will be automatically applied for those users.  Our quick CVSS3 base score (did we do it right?) is 7.6. It is adjacently network accessible and a high confidentiality impact. We verified this in testing.  We are not aware of this being actively exploited. We discovered the vulnerability while responding to a related issue that was filed.  I'm happy to fill in any other details or answer any questions. Or, take feedback on how to handle this better next time. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1197491#c2)  Marcus Meissner   2022-03-25 07:57:08 UTC  ``` make public, adjust summary ...   can you quote the full CVSS v3.1 vector? ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1197491#c3)  Matthew Farina   2022-03-25 19:14:04 UTC  ``` The base score with a temporal score is <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L/E:U/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1>  I reworked my assessment and the base score came out a little higher.  I didn't add an environmental score. If you want one I would appreciate some help to make sure I get it right. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1197491#c4)  Marcus Meissner   2022-04-01 11:10:17 UTC  ``` i would say "Network" instead of "Adjacent" as there is no limit on the network listening , right? ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1197491#c5)  Matthew Farina   2022-04-04 13:16:55 UTC  ``` What happened is a web server bound to 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces) on a machine. The machines are desktop computers rather than machines meant to be servers. As the desktop machines are overwhelmingly on local networks (rather than the Internet at large), would this be Network or Adjacent? ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1197491#c6)  Marcus Meissner   2022-04-05 15:01:20 UTC  ``` these scenarios we usually consider "Network"  e.g. Desktops would use wifi, and any kind of wifi that would for instance be used by Laptops is considered "Network", (think Cafe or Hotel Wifi which are fully untrusted) ``` |  |
