Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `sorting` parameter in the Ultimate Member plugin's member directory functionality is not properly sanitized or escaped. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to adequately sanitize the `sorting` parameter before using it in a database query. This allows unsanitized data to be passed directly into SQL statements.
*   **Lack of Prepared Statements:** While the code does use `prepare` statements in certain areas, the `sorting` parameter is not properly included, leading to the injection point.
*   **Direct use of user-supplied data in SQL query:** The code directly uses user-supplied `sorting` parameters in the `ORDER BY` clause, without proper sanitization or parametrization of the whole SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the WordPress database, including user data, passwords, and other confidential data.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion**: Attackers may be able to alter or delete the database contents.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful exploitation can allow attackers to gain further access to the server by using SQL injection to upload malicious files or execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Unauthenticated Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is accessible to unauthenticated attackers, meaning that no prior access to the website is needed for exploitation.
*   **HTTP Request Parameter:** The `sorting` parameter is passed via an HTTP request, allowing the attacker to inject SQL code through a simple web request.
*  **Direct access:** Attackers can directly access the vulnerable code through the plugin's AJAX handler `ajax_get_members`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any login credentials or special user permissions.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in the `class-member-directory-meta.php` file, specifically in the `ajax_get_members()` function, where the `$_POST['sorting']` parameter is directly used in the SQL query without proper sanitization.
*   The vulnerable code is within the following lines (approximate), where the `sortby` variable taken from the user supplied `$_POST['sorting']` is being used to construct the SQL `ORDER BY` clause without sanitization:

    ```php
    666     $sortby = ! empty( $_POST['sorting'] ) ? sanitize_text_field( $_POST['sorting'] ) : $directory_data['sortby'];
    667     $sortby = ( $sortby == 'other' ) ? $directory_data['sortby_custom'] : $sortby;

    739		$this->sql_order = " ORDER BY CAST( umm_sort.um_value AS SIGNED ) {$order}, u.user_registered DESC ";

    816     if ( false !== array_search( $sortby, $metakeys ) ) {
    817        $this->joins[] = "LEFT JOIN {$wpdb->prefix}um_metadata umm_sort ON ( umm_sort.user_id = u.ID AND umm_sort.um_key = '{$sortby}' )";
    818     $this->sql_order = " ORDER BY CAST( umm_sort.um_value AS CHAR ) {$order} ";
    ```
*  The fix involves using prepared statements with placeholders when dealing with the `sortby` parameter to prevent SQL injection.

**Affected Versions:**
*   Ultimate Member plugin versions 2.1.3 up to and including 2.8.2

**Patched Version:**
*   Ultimate Member plugin version 2.8.3

**Additional Notes:**
*   The Wordfence content indicates that there have been significant attacks targeting this vulnerability.
*   The provided code diff highlights several other security improvements that have been made in later versions of the code.
*   The patch implemented in version 2.8.3 is the primary fix for this vulnerability.

**In Summary:** This is a critical, unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability in the Ultimate Member plugin that requires immediate patching. The lack of sanitization on the `sorting` parameter allows an attacker to directly manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to a full compromise of the WordPress database.
