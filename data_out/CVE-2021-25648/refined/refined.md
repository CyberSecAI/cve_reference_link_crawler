- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The mobile application relies on client-side storage of user permissions, specifically the "isAdmin" and "isPremium" parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Client-side storage of sensitive user permissions allows for tampering. The application does not properly validate or secure these permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can modify the "isAdmin" and "isPremium" parameters to gain access to the administrative interface, which communicates with the backend API web server. This privilege escalation can grant the attacker control over administrative functionalities of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** By tampering with locally stored data, the attacker could change the permission parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to modify client-side data storage, which is possible on a compromised device.
