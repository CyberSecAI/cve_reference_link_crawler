The provided content is related to CVE-2023-52738.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from calling `drm_sched_fini()` in the AMDGPU fence driver's software finalization routine without verifying if the corresponding `drm_sched_init()` had been successfully executed. This occurs when a driver probe fails, leading to `drm_sched_fini()` being invoked on an uninitialized scheduler, causing a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of the DRM scheduler lifecycle within the AMDGPU fence driver. Specifically, `drm_sched_fini()` was being called without ensuring a successful initialization using `drm_sched_init()`.
- Reliance on the `sched.ready` field, which is set during the ring initialization, regardless of the DRM scheduler status. This made the check unreliable.
- Lack of proper validation before calling `drm_sched_fini()`, specifically, the code did not reliably check if the scheduler was properly initialized before calling `drm_sched_fini()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel NULL pointer dereference, leading to a system crash (kernel oops).
- System instability during driver probe failures.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a driver probe failure, which could be induced by various system issues or device configurations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to induce a driver probe failure in a system using the affected AMDGPU driver. This may involve misconfiguring the device or its resources, or other means that would result in a driver probe failure.
