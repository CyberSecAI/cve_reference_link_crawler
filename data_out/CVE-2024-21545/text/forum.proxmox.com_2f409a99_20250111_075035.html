### Subject: PSA-2024-00001-1: PixieFAIL EDK2 PXE vulnerabilities​

**Advisory date:** 2024-01-24

**Package(s):**

* Proxmox VE 7.x:
  + pve-edk2-firmware
* Proxmox VE 8.x:
  + pve-edk2-firmware-ovmf
  + pve-edk2-firmware-legacy

**Details:**

Nine vulnerabilities in EDK II's reference EFI implementation that can be exploited by unauthenticated remote attackers on the same local network, and in some cases, by attackers on remote networks were identified by researchers at QuarksLab. The impact of these vulnerabilities includes denial of service, information leakage, remote code execution, DNS cache poisoning, and network session hijacking, mainly via IPv6.

EDK II is used in Proxmox VE to provide the UEFI firmware to VM guests. PXE booting is enabled by default as lowest priority boot mechanism.

**Fixed:**

- pve-edk2-firmware-ovmf 4.2023.08-3 (Proxmox VE 8.x)

- pve-edk2-firmware 4.20230228-4~bpo11+2 (Proxmox VE 7.x)

**Not Fixed:**

- pve-edk2-firmware-legacy

(Proxmox VE 8.x, static copy of legacy 2 MB firmware files that cannot be build anymore, only used for backwards compatibility)

**References:**

### Subject: PSA-2024-00003-1: QEMU denial of service via VNC client clipboard access​

**Advisory date:** 2024-03-28

**Package(s):** pve-qemu-kvm

**Details:** A flaw was found in the QEMU built-in VNC server while processing ClientCutText messages. The qemu\_clipboard\_request() function can be reached before vnc\_server\_cut\_text\_caps() was called and had the chance to initialize the clipboard peer, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. This could allow a malicious authenticated VNC client to crash QEMU and trigger a denial of service.

**Fixed:** pve-qemu-kvm >= 8.1.5-1 (Proxmox Virtual Environment 8.x)

**References:** CVE-2023-6683

### Subject: PSA-2024-00004-1: LDAP: missing schema validation for synced attributes​

**Advisory date:** 2024-03-28

**Package(s):** libpve-access-control

**Details:** On Proxmox Virtual Environment systems with user/group sync from LDAP or ActiveDirectory, the attribute values were not properly validated against the user.cfg schema, possibly allowing injection of arbitrary contents into user.cfg by an attacker controlling the directory server.

Please note that attackers controlling the directory server can already log in as any synced user, so it's never safe to integrate an untrusted LDAP or AD server as realm into a Proxmox project.

**Fixed:**

- libpve-access-control >= 8.1.1 (Proxmox Virtual Environment 8.x)

- libpve-access-control >= 7.4.3 (Proxmox Virtual Environment 7.x)

### Subject: PSA-2024-00006-1: perl PVE API client certificate validation failure if fingerprint is not passed​

**Advisory date:** 2024-03-28

**Package(s):** libpve-api-client-perl

**Details:** Usage of the perl PVE API client module without a pinned TLS certificate fingerprint (see below for exact parameters) was broken.

The usage of this API client module inside Proxmox VE is limited to:

* Cluster node join: here a fingerprint is required by the API schema, so joining via API (including the web UI) is not affected at all. For joining via the CLI the fingerprint is presented for confirmation and must be manually verified by the admin.
* External remote node migration of virtual guests: this is currently a tech-preview and not exposed in the Proxmox VE user interface, usage with fingerprint was always safe.
* Status and backup list of the PBS integration - a Denial of Service for PBS status, or bogus content listing might be returned by an attacker.

  Most actions, including sending or reading backup data, are not handled by the Perl client, but by the rust-based PBS client and libraries, so neither backup nor restore were affected at all.

Other usage of the client (e.g. in third party scripts or integrations) might be affected if `$ssl_opts->{verify_hostname}` is enabled, which is the default setting if no fingerprint is provided by the caller.

For any of the above scenarios to be exploitable, an attacker needs to be in a position to man-in-the-middle the client connection to the API server, like controlling the DNS server.

**Note:** This issue was found during internal audit, we do not know of any attack in the wild.

**Fixed:**

- libpve-api-client-perl >= 3.3.2 (Proxmox Virtual Environment 8.x, Proxmox Mail Gateway 8.x)

- libpve-api-client-perl >= 3.2-2 (Proxmox Virtual Environment 7.x, Proxmox Mail Gateway 7.x)

### Subject: PSA-2024-00007-1: Shim bootloader remote code execution via http response​

**Advisory date:** 2024-06-28

**Packages:** shim-unsigned, shim-signed

**Details:** A remote code execution vulnerability was found in the secure boot Shim bootloader. The Shim boot support trusts attacker-controlled values when parsing an HTTP response. This flaw allows an attacker to craft a specific malicious HTTP request, leading to a completely controlled out-of-bounds write primitive and complete system compromise. This flaw is only exploitable during the early boot phase, an attacker needs to perform a Man-in-the-Middle or compromise the boot server to be able to exploit this vulnerability successfully.

**Fixed:** shim-unsigned >= 15.8, shim-signed >= 1.40+pmx1+15.8 (Proxmox VE 8.x, Proxmox Backup Server 3.x, Proxmox Mail Gateway 8.x)

*Bullseye-based Proxmox products do not ship a custom version of shim, refer to Debian's security tracker if manual secure boot is in use.*

**References:** CVE-2023-40547, shim 15.8 additionally fixes CVE-2023-40546 and CVE-2023-40548 to CVE-2023-40551

### Subject: PSA-2024-00008-1: kernel: DoS via short ethernet frames over tun/tap interfaces​

**Advisory date**: 2024-07-29

**Packages**: Proxmox 5.15 kernel packages (Proxmox VE 7), Proxmox 6.5 and 6.8 kernel packages (Proxmox VE 8)

**Details**: The tun and tap network drivers in the Linux kernel lacked verification for short frames in XDP (eXpress Data Path).

This could be abused by a malicious guest with a VirtIO-net device to cause out-of-bound access in the host kernel and with certain hardware, even cause a kernel panic.

**Fixed**:

- proxmox-kernel-6.8.8-4-pve or later (for the 6.8 kernel series in Proxmox VE 8)

- proxmox-kernel-6.5.13-6-pve or later (for the 6.5 kernel series in Proxmox VE 8)

- pve-kernel-5.15.158-2-pve or any later 5.15 based package (for Proxmox VE 7)

**References**:

- <https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/24/4>

### Subject: PSA-2024-00009-1: Proxmox VE/Mail Gateway API: post-authentication privileged file read vulnerabilities​

**Advisory date**: 2024-09-23

**Packages**:

- Proxmox Virtual Environment: pve-manager, libpve-storage-perl, libpve-http-server-perl, qemu-server

- Proxmox Mail Gateway: pmg-api, libpve-http-server-perl

**Details**:

Insufficient safeguards against malicious API response values allowed authenticated attackers with 'Sys.Audit' or 'VM.Monitor' privileges to download arbitrary host files via the API.

Two instances of this issue were discovered and reported by the Security Labs team at Snyk.

The issue was introduced in libpve-http-server-perl in version 3.2-1 (Proxmox VE/Proxmox Mail Gateway 6) with commit 6d832db ("allow 'download' to be passed from API handler").

### Subject: PSA-2024-00010-1: Proxmox VE iSCSI plugin volume path confusion​

**Advisory date**: 2024-11-20

**Packages**: libpve-storage-perl

**Details**:

On a Proxmox VE system with an active storage of type 'iscsi', a sufficiently privileged user can trick the system into accessing arbitrary host block devices, including passing them through into guests as volume, instead of such access being limited to iSCSI LUNs belonging to that storage

instance/iSCSI target.

Sufficient privs in this case means having permissions for both `Datastore.Allocate` on an iSCSI storage and `VM.Config.Disk` on a virtual machine.

If only the built-in access roles were used, the roles with the smallest privilege set that would allow this to be exploited would be a combination of both `PVEDatastoreAdmin` and `PVEVMAdmin`, or for a single role, `PVEAdmin`.

This issue was discovered internally, there are no known instances of it being exploited.

**Fixed**:

- libpve-storage-perl version 8.2.6

**References**: None

### Subject: PSA-2024-00013-1: Proxmox VE OVA/OVF importer: Insufficient validation of untrusted input​

**Advisory date**: 2024-12-11

**Packages**:

- libpve-storage-perl == 8.2.8 (pvetest and pve-no-subscription only)

**Details**:

On a Proxmox VE system with an active storage with content type "import", a sufficiently privileged attacker could import a specifically crafted OVA appliance and obtain a VM whose disk contains a copy of an arbitrary host file chosen by the attacker.

**The required privileges are**:

- `Datastore.Audit` and `Datastore.AllocateTemplate` on a storage with content type "import", to upload the crafted OVA appliance.

- Necessary privileges for creating a VM from the OVA appliance, including (but not limited to) `Datastore.Audit` and `Datastore.AllocateSpace` on a VM disk storage.

This issue was discovered internally, there are no known instances of it being exploited.

**Fixed**:

- libpve-storage-perl 8.2.9

- libpve-storage-perl <= 8.2.7 are unaffected as these versions do not implement OVA/OVF uploads

### Subject: PSA-2024-00014-1: image format confusion issues​

**Advisory date**: 2024-12-11

**Packages**: libpve-storage-perl, qemu-server, proxmox-backup-file-restore

**Details**:

Multiple ways of tricking a Proxmox VE system into using specially crafted, user-provided image data with an unexpected format were discovered. Some instances of this issue include resolving references to arbitrary host files, effectively providing read or - in some instances - write access to such files.

All known instances of these issues require some combination of the following as pre-requisite:

- direct access to a VM guest (shell, SSH, ..)

- VM.Config.Disk or VM.Config.CDROM privileges on a VM guest

- VM.Backup, VM.Clone or VM.Allocate privileges on a VM guest

- Datastore.AllocateTemplate privileges on a storage

- privileges to create a PBS backup snapshot

These issues were discovered, analyzed and fixed internally. There are no known instances of them being exploited. Upgrading affected Proxmox VE systems as soon as possible is recommended.

**Fixed**: qemu-server >= 8.3.2, libpve-storage-perl >= 8.3.0, proxmox-backup-file-restore >= 3.3.2-1

### Subject: PSA-2024-00016-1: XSS via Qemu guest agent response​

**Advisory date**: 2024-12-18

**Packages**: pve-manager

**Details**:

The VM summary panel of the Proxmox VE web interface was missing encoding of values returned by the QEMU Guest Agent (QGA). A malicious agent implementation inside the VM could return arbitrary content that would be injected into the rendered page.

This issue was reported by Jens Krabbenhöft.

**Fixed**: pve-manager >= 8.3.2
