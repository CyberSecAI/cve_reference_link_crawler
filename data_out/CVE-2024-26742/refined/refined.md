The provided content is related to a fix for a bug in the `smartpqi` SCSI driver in the Linux kernel. This bug occurs when the `disable_managed_interrupts` module parameter is enabled, which changes how the driver registers with the block multi-queue (blk-mq) subsystem.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an incorrect function call for registering with the blk-mq subsystem when the `disable_managed_interrupts` parameter is enabled. Instead of calling `blk_mq_map_queues()`, the driver was incorrectly calling `blk_mq_pci_map_queues()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Incorrect blk-mq registration logic when `disable_managed_interrupts` module parameter is enabled. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual function calls for queue mapping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The incorrect function call results in a stack trace and may lead to undefined behavior. While the provided information doesn't describe a specific exploit scenario it does indicate system instability, likely a kernel panic.

**Attack vectors:**
Enabling the `disable_managed_interrupts` module parameter for the `smartpqi` driver. This could be triggered through module loading or configuration changes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need the ability to load/configure kernel modules and manipulate parameters during the loading process.
