## Advisory Information

* **Advisory ID:**  BOSCH-SA-341298-BT
* **CVE Numbers and CVSS v3.1 Scores:**
  + [CVE-2022-47648](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-47648)
    - Base Score:  [7.6 (High)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H)

## Summary

An authentication vulnerability was found in the B420 Ethernet communication module from Bosch Security Systems. This is a legacy product which is currently obsolete and was announced to reach End on Life (EoL) on 2013.  The B420 was last sold in July 2013 and was replaced by the B426. An EoL notice was provided to customers.

The B420 does not allow for direct access to the panel as this module does not allow direct connection to the SDI/Option Bus that communicates directly with the panel. \_\_ However, customers that are still using this device are advised to replace it for the B426 to ensure it is connected in a secure network.

## Affected Products

* Bosch B420
  + CVE-2022-47648
    - Version(s): All Versions

## Solution and Mitigations

### Upgrade to Sate of the Art successor

Customers are advised to upgrade to the B426 module.

Network administrators should implement security measures according to the applicable laws, regulations and industry best practices as listed below but not limited to:

* Segment and segregate networks.
* Do not expose device directly to the internet
* Limit access to the device to trusted employees only that are required to access the device
* Frequently monitor the network and review logs of the device

## Vulnerability Details

### CVE-2022-47648

CVE description: An Improper Access Control vulnerability allows an attacker to access the control panel of the B420 without requiring any sort of authorization or authentication due to the IP based authorization.
