The provided content relates to CVE-2024-45023.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing checks for recovery status in the `choose_bb_rdev()` and `choose_slow_rdev()` functions within the Linux kernel's RAID1 implementation. These functions are used to select the appropriate disk to read from during a read operation in degraded RAID1 arrays.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect disk selection:**  When a degraded RAID1 array has valid data only on slow disks, and a new normal disk is still undergoing recovery, the `choose_bb_rdev()` function could incorrectly select the new, not-yet-recovered normal disk for reading, leading to reading unrecovered data.
- **Missing recovery check:** The `choose_bb_rdev()` and `choose_slow_rdev()` functions lacked the check to verify if a disk was still in the recovery process before using it for read operations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data corruption:** Reading from a disk that is still recovering can lead to the retrieval of uninitialized or inconsistent data, which will cause data corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering a read operation on a degraded RAID1 array where a new disk is in recovery, and valid data is only present on slow disks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to trigger read operations on a system with a degraded RAID1 array. They do not necessarily need to have any special privileges, however, this would likely happen more often to legitimate users of the system.
