Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Themify Ultra Theme <= 7.3.5 suffers from a Broken Access Control vulnerability. This means there's a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Broken Access Control:**  The core issue is the lack of proper checks that would prevent unauthorized users from executing actions that should be limited to higher privileged users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user (specifically identified as a 'Subscriber' role) could potentially execute higher-privileged actions due to the missing access controls.
- The specific impact will vary depending on the vulnerable function.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is in the Themify Ultra WordPress theme.
- The specific attack vector is not detailed but would likely involve a malicious actor sending a crafted request to a vulnerable function within the theme.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a registered user of the WordPress site, having a minimum 'Subscriber' role. This suggests that the vulnerability is accessible internally and not only from public unauthenticated requests.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability has a high severity score of 8.3 CVSS.
- The fixed version is 7.3.6.
- Patchstack provides a virtual patch to mitigate the issue until the theme is updated.
