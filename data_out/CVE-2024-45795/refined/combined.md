# detect/datasets: reachable assertion with unimplemented rule option

High

[victorjulien](/victorjulien)
published
GHSA-6r8w-fpw6-cp9g
Oct 16, 2024

## Package

suricata

## Affected versions

< 7.0.7

## Patched versions

7.0.7

## Description

### Impact

Rules using datasets with the non-functional / unimplemented "unset" option can trigger an assertion during traffic parsing, leading to denial of service.

### Patches

This issue is addressed in 7.0.7.

### Workarounds

Use only trusted and well tested rulesets.

### References

<https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/7195>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

unset support in datasets was half-done.

A fix can be implementing the missing support

Another fix can be to reject such rules for now

* **Severity** changed from *MODERATE* to *HIGH*

HIGH as it requires a bad rule, but then it aborts in defined way.
