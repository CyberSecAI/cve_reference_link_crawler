Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31069:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `nestjs-proxy` library lacked the ability to control when the `Authorization` header should be forwarded to backend services. This could lead to sensitive information, such as OAuth bearer tokens, being exposed to services that shouldn't have access to them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure:** The vulnerability lies in the unintentional forwarding of the `Authorization` header. The library automatically forwarded this header to all backend services, including those that should not receive it, causing potential information exposure.
- **Lack of Configuration:** The library didn't provide a mechanism to selectively disable `Authorization` header forwarding per backend service before the fix.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens can be exposed to unintended backend services, potentially granting unauthorized access to resources.
- **Lateral Movement:** An attacker, having compromised one of the backend services, could gain access to other services if the exposed `Authorization` token is valid for them.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the configuration of a `nestjs-proxy`. If the proxy forwards authorization headers to a backend service that should not receive them, then the vulnerability can be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need direct access to the vulnerable service, they only need to compromise an endpoint that the proxy forwards to.
- The attacker would need to be able to intercept the proxied request, to access the headers.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by introducing a new configuration option `forwardToken` in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. This allows developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization header on a per-service basis.
- The affected package `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` is deprecated and users are advised to switch to `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`.
