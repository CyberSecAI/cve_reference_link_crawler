The provided document is an Adobe Security Bulletin that includes information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2024-36163.

**CVE-2024-36163**

*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The software is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). This occurs when user-supplied input is stored on the server and later displayed to other users without proper sanitization or encoding.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A remote attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application's stored data. When another user views the stored data, the malicious script executes within the victim's browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker requires the ability to inject malicious script into the application and a victim must interact with the stored data containing the malicious script (e.g., by viewing a page/resource containing the malicious payload).  A low privileged user is required for successful exploitation.
