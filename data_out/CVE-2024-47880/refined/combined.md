Mitigates [CVE-2024-47880](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-79jv-5226-783f "CVE-2024-47880").
See [GHSA-79jv-5226-783f](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/security/advisories/GHSA-79jv-5226-783f "GHSA-79jv-5226-783f")

By setting the contentType parameter to text/html and choosing export
parameters which include a script in the text output, an attacker would
be able to execute arbitrary code in the browser, inside OpenRefine's
origin.

The contentType parameter is not actually supplied in any internal
calls, meaning that the content type declared by the exporter is always
used, so we drop support for this parameter.

# Reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) from POST request in ExportRowsCommand

High

[wetneb](/wetneb)
published
GHSA-79jv-5226-783f
Oct 24, 2024

## Package

maven

org.openrefine:openrefine
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<3.8.3

## Patched versions

3.8.3

## Description

### Summary

The `export-rows` command can be used in such a way that it reflects part of the request verbatim, with a Content-Type header also taken from the request.

An attacker could lead a user to a malicious page that submits a form POST that contains embedded JavaScript code. This code would then be included in the response, along with an attacker-controlled `Content-Type` header, and so potentially executed in the victim's browser as if it was part of OpenRefine.

The attacker must know a valid project ID of a project that contains at least one row.

### Details

The malicious form sets `contentType` to `text/html` (ExportRowsCommand.java line 101) and `preview` to `true` (line 107). This combination causes the browser to treat what OpenRefine thinks of as an export preview as a regular webpage.

It would be safer if the `export-rows` command did not allow overriding the Content-Type header at all, instead relying on the exporter to provide the correct Content-Type. It could also require a CSRF token. As an additional measure, it could add a Content-Security-Policy header to the response disabling scripts and such entirely.

At least the CSV exporter (`separator` and `lineSeparator` fields) and templating exporter (any field) are affected. It may also be possible to inject into the `dateSettings.custom` field or the SQL exporter default value field, if the project contains date or null cells.

### PoC

An example form that demonstrates the issue is available on <https://wandernauta.nl/os/>.

### Impact

Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser. The attacker-provided code can do anything the user can do, including deleting projects, retrieving database passwords, or executing arbitrary Jython or Closure expressions, if those extensions are also present.

### Severity

High

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
