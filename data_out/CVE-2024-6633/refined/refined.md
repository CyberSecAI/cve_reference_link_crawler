The provided content is related to CVE-2024-6633.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure default credentials for the setup HSQL database (HSQLDB) used by FileCatalyst Workflow. These credentials were inadvertently published in a vendor knowledgebase article.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Exposure of Sensitive Information: The default database credentials, which should be kept secret, were publicly available.
- Insecure Default Configuration: The use of HSQLDB for production is not recommended by the vendor, yet the software defaults to using it with known credentials.
- Failure to follow vendor recommendations: users not configuring an alternative database per vendor recommendations remain vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to a complete compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the FileCatalyst Workflow software.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker with network access to the HSQLDB (port is not specified but implied through "reach") can exploit the vulnerability by using the published default credentials to gain unauthorized access to the database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to reach the HSQLDB, implying network accessibility, and they need the default credentials. No other special privileges are required.

**Additional Details:**
- The HSQLDB is intended for initial setup only and should not be used in production.
- The vendor provides instructions for switching to an alternative database, which if followed, would prevent this vulnerability from being exploitable.
- The vulnerability affects FileCatalyst Workflow 5.1.6 Build 139 and earlier.
- A fix is available in FileCatalyst Workflow 5.1.7 and later.
- The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 (Critical)
