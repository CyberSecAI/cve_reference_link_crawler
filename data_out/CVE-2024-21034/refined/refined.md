```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the LOV (List of Values) functionality within the Oracle Complex Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul component.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
The core weakness lies in insufficient validation or sanitization of user-supplied input used in LOV processing. This allows injection of malicious content.

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized data access, modification or other forms of malicious activities, potentially compromising the application's integrity and confidentiality.

Attack vectors:
The attack vector involves sending crafted HTTP requests, likely involving manipulated parameters associated with LOV requests.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker requires network access to the affected application and the capability to send HTTP requests. Knowledge of the application's internal workings, particularly its LOV implementation, may be necessary to craft a successful exploit. A standard user account may also be required for exploitation.
