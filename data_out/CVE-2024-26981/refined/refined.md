### CVE-2024-26981

Based on the provided content, this CVE is related to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `nilfs2` filesystem driver in the Linux kernel.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `nilfs_set_de_type` function uses `nilfs_type_by_mode` array with an index derived from the inode's mode. The size of the `nilfs_type_by_mode` array is defined as `S_IFMT >> S_SHIFT`, but the index is calculated as `(mode & S_IFMT) >> S_SHIFT`. When `mode & S_IFMT` equals `S_IFMT`, the index will be one larger than the array's bounds, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read in the `nilfs_set_de_type` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact is not explicitly detailed, but out-of-bounds reads can lead to various issues including:
    - Kernel crashes (denial of service)
    - Information leaks

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploiting this requires crafting an inode with a specific mode that triggers the out-of-bounds read in the `nilfs2` filesystem.
- This is done through the file system operations within the Linux kernel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to mount and interact with a specially crafted `nilfs2` filesystem.
- The attacker needs the ability to create inodes with specific modes, which may require some level of privilege (e.g., ability to create files or directories).

The patch addresses this by increasing the size of the `nilfs_type_by_mode` array to `(S_IFMT >> S_SHIFT) + 1`. This allows for the case where `(mode & S_IFMT) >> S_SHIFT` equals `S_IFMT >> S_SHIFT` without accessing memory outside the allocated bounds.
