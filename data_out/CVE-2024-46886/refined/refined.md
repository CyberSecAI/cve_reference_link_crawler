- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web server of affected devices does not properly validate input used for user redirection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Open Redirect vulnerability (CWE-601)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can craft a malicious link that, when clicked by a legitimate user, redirects the user to an attacker-chosen URL.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring the user to interact with a crafted link (UI:R/UI:A).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N). They need to be able to craft a malicious link and trick a user into clicking it.
