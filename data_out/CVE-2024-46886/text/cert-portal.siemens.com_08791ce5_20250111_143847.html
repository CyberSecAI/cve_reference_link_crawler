SSA-876787: Open Redirect Vulnerability in SIMATIC S7-1500 and S7-1200 CPUs

| Publication Date: | 2024-10-08 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-12-10 |
| Current Version: | V1.2 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 4.7 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 5.1 |

SUMMARY

Several SIMATIC S7-1500 and S7-1200 CPU versions are affected by an open redirect vulnerability that could allow an attacker to make the web server of affected devices redirect a legitimate user to an attacker-chosen URL. For a successful attack, the legitimate user must actively click on an attacker-crafted link.

Siemens has released new versions for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions. Siemens is preparing further fix versions and recommends specific countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC Drive Controllers have been designed for the automation of production machines, combining the functionality of a SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU and a SINAMICS S120 drive control.

SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller is a PC-based version of the SIMATIC S7-1500 Controller including optional visualization in combination with central I/Os in a compact device.

SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU products have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU products have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

The SIMATIC S7-1500 MFP CPUs provide functionality of standard S7-1500 CPUs with the possibility to run C/C++ Code within the CPU-Runtime for execution of own functions / algorithms implemented in C/C++ and an additional second independent runtime environment to execute C/C++ applications parallel to the STEP 7 program if required.

SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller is a SIMATIC software controller for PC-based automation solutions.

SIMATIC S7-PLCSIM Advanced simulates S7-1200, S7-1500 and a few other PLC derivatives. Includes full network access to simulate the PLCs, even in virtualized environments.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the same firmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-46886

The web server of affected devices does not properly validate input that is used for a user redirection. This could allow an attacker to make the server redirect the legitimate user to an attacker-chosen URL. For a successful exploit, the legitimate user must actively click on an attacker-crafted link.
