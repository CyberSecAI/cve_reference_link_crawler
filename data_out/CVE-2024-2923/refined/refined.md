Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2923:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the "Magical Addons For Elementor" plugin's text effect widget. Specifically, user-supplied attributes are not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious scripts injected through the vulnerable widget are stored in the database and executed when other users access the affected page.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input in the text effect widget.
- **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin does not correctly escape the output when rendering the text effect widget's content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts in the context of the user's browser when they view a page containing the affected widget.
- **Account Takeover:** If a higher-privileged user accesses a page containing the injected script, the attacker could potentially gain access to their account.
- **Data Theft:** The attacker could potentially steal user session cookies or other sensitive information.
- **Malware Distribution:** The injected scripts could redirect users to malicious sites or initiate drive-by downloads.
- **Website Defacement:** An attacker could modify the content displayed on the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Plugin's Text Effect Widget:** The vulnerability resides within the plugin's text effect widget.
- **User-supplied Attributes:** Attackers exploit the lack of sanitization in user-supplied attributes of the text effect widget to inject malicious scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** Attackers need to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This allows them to create or edit content and insert the malicious code using the vulnerable widget.
