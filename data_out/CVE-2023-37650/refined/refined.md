Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities found in Cockpit CMS and their relation to CVE-2023-37650:

**Note:** While the content discusses multiple vulnerabilities, the CVE-2023-37650 is a placeholder, and thus this analysis describes vulnerabilities based on the provided context. There is no specific association to a CVE.

**Vulnerabilities and Weaknesses:**

1.  **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) via Relational Mapping in Content API:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `populate` function in the Content API did not validate if the querying user was authorized to access related content based on `_id` and `_model` attributes in the data. Also, it did not validate if the type of link that the user sends is the same as configured on the model.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Lack of authorization checks on the referenced content, allowing unauthenticated users to access data they should not have access to by injecting `_id` and `_model` into JSON requests. Additionally, the system was vulnerable to the injection of arbitrary data structures into fields, leading to modification of the BSON structure.
    *   **Impact:** Sensitive data could be exposed by exploiting relational mappings by manipulating JSON requests. It's also possible to dump the content of a model for which the user does not have direct access to.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending malicious POST requests containing `_id` and `_model` attributes within a field in the JSON payload, and triggering the vulnerable `populate` function via the `?populate=1` URL parameter.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to send crafted POST requests to the content API. Initially, this would need the ability to write to a collection with a relational field, but the vulnerability was escalated by exploiting the fact that types of inputs were not validated. This allowed attackers to inject relational links into fields that were not configured to be relational links. Unauthenticated users could exploit this once they were able to modify fields to relational links by injecting `_id` and `_model` attributes.

2.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) on Admin API:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Admin API actions lacked CSRF token validation.
    *   **Vulnerability:** The admin portal was vulnerable to CSRF, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated admin user if that admin visited a malicious site.
    *   **Impact:** This CSRF could lead to XSS through malicious SVG uploads and RCE by uploading a zip file with a php payload that is then extracted.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By crafting malicious HTML forms on an external website and getting an authenticated admin user to visit that website.
    *   **Required Capabilities:**  Requires an authenticated admin user to visit a malicious website controlled by the attacker.

3.  **CSRF to XSS via SVG Upload Race Condition:**
    *   **Root Cause:** A race condition in the Assets API allows access to a temporary SVG file before it is sanitized, combined with a CSRF vulnerability.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  SVG files are moved to the temporary directory, and are only sanitized *after* the move, creating a window in which an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the victim admin user.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting malicious SVG file and using CSRF to upload this file. The attacker then redirects the victim to the file before it is sanitized.
    *    **Required Capabilities:**  Requires an authenticated admin user to visit a malicious website controlled by the attacker.

4.  **CSRF to RCE via Finder API:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The Finder API lacks CSRF protection, and has dangerous built-in actions such as unzip. It also allows uploading any file if the Content-Type of the request is not set to `application/json`.
    *   **Vulnerability:** The `unzip` function does not validate if the file being extracted is even a `.zip` file. This means that an attacker can upload a malicious ZIP file containing a PHP payload, and then use the `unzip` API action to extract this payload to the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution by writing PHP files to the server.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Using a malicious webpage with a HTML form to trigger the upload and unzip functionality.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Requires an authenticated admin user to visit a malicious website controlled by the attacker.

5.  **MongoDB Object ID Predictability:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The usage of MongoDB Object IDs can be predicted using tools.
    *   **Vulnerability:** MongoDB Object IDs are not truly random and can be predicted under certain circumstances. This made the IDOR exploit more easily usable, since the object IDs did not have to be enumerated one by one.
    *   **Impact:** Makes it easier to exploit the IDOR vulnerability to dump the content of different models on the CMS.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Using tools to predict ObjectIDs to exploit the IDOR.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** Requires the ability to create an initial Object ID in order to use the predictor tool.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `writeFile` action in the Finder API is considered a security risk, allowing arbitrary file overwrites, but it was not directly exploited for RCE in this writeup due to the rules.
*   The article highlights the lack of documentation about secure configuration and the insecure default settings of the CMS.
