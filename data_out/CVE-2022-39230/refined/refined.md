{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The issue allows a client of the API to retrieve more information than the client’s OAuth scope permits when making “search-type” requests.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper authorization leading to information disclosure.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A client can retrieve more information than their OAuth scope permits, specifically when making 'search-type' requests. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, however the client can only retrieve information about individuals they were already authorized to access.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Low privileges are required for the attacker. The attacker must be a client of the API with an OAuth scope. No user interaction is needed."
