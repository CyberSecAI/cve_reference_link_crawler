Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Password hashes were being reflected in the editing forms of the TYPO3 backend user interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Information Disclosure (CWE-200). The system was inadvertently exposing password hashes, which should not be visible to users, even backend users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The exposure of password hashes allows attackers to potentially crack the plaintext passwords using brute force techniques. This could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts if the passwords are successfully cracked.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker needs to access the TYPO3 backend user interface over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A valid backend user account (PR:L) with access to password input fields is needed to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker doesn't need user interaction (UI:N) and can exploit this without changing security scope (S:U).
- They need to have the ability to view the reflected password hashes.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is categorized as medium severity.
*   The affected versions range from 8.0.0 to 13.0.0.
