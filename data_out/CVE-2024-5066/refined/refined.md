Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `pincode` parameter within the `pincode-verification.php` script of the PHPGurukul Online Course Registration System 3.1. This allows for SQL Injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user input, specifically the `pincode` parameter, before using it in an SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could compromise the application's database.
- An attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data.
- An attacker could exploit other vulnerabilities present in the underlying database system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `pincode` parameter in the `pincode-verification.php` page at the URL `http://localhost/onlinecourse/pincode-verification.php`.
- A malicious user can inject arbitrary SQL code by manipulating the `pincode` parameter value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable endpoint `http://localhost/onlinecourse/pincode-verification.php`.
- The attacker needs to understand how to perform SQL injection to craft a malicious input string.
