- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing JP2 files, which leads to a memory corruption condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can exploit this by enticing a user to either visit a malicious page or open a specially crafted malicious JP2 file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to deliver a malicious JP2 file or a malicious page to a user. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability (opening the file/page).
