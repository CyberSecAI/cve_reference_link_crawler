Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the "network print report" feature of ScienceLogic SL1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to sanitize user-controlled input, directly passing it to a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **High Confidentiality Impact:**  Attackers can potentially access sensitive data stored in the database.
*  **High Integrity Impact:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database.
*   **High Availability Impact:** Attackers may disrupt the system's operation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have low-level privileges to access the vulnerable "network print report" feature.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack doesn't require any specific user interaction beyond accessing the vulnerable feature.

**Summary of Technical Details:**
The "network print report" feature in ScienceLogic SL1 does not sanitize user-provided input. This allows for injection of arbitrary SQL queries which can lead to complete compromise of the database. The vulnerability is rated as HIGH severity with a CVSS score of 8.8. It is accessible remotely to authenticated, low-privileged users.

**Affected Products:**
ScienceLogic SL1 <= 11.1.2
