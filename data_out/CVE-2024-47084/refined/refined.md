- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Gradio server does not properly validate the request origin when a cookie is present, leading to a bypass of CORS origin validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper CORS origin validation. The vulnerability exists in the `CustomCORSMiddleware` class, which skips CORS validation for requests containing cookies.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Unauthorized requests can be made to a local Gradio server from an attacker's website.
    - Attackers could potentially upload files, steal authentication tokens, and access user data if a victim visits a malicious website while logged into Gradio.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker needs to host a malicious website.
    - A victim, logged into a local Gradio deployment, has to visit the attacker's malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to host a website.
    - Ability to convince a Gradio user to visit the malicious website while logged into their local Gradio instance.
