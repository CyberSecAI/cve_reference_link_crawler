**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can place an arbitrary file (specifically a crafted DLL) in a specific folder.
- When the SKYSEA Client View service loads the crafted DLL, arbitrary code execution can occur with `SYSTEM` privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: A logged-in user on the target machine can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to write to the specific vulnerable folder.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid login to the machine where the vulnerable SKYSEA Client View client is installed.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to place files in the specific vulnerable folder.
- The attacker does not need administrative privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is a local privilege escalation vulnerability.
- The vendor has released updates and patches to address this issue (Ver.19.3 and patches for older versions).
