{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `rds_rdma_cm_event_handler_cmn` function in `net/rds/rdma_transport.c` does not check if the `conn` pointer is valid before dereferencing it to access `conn->c_tos`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL Pointer Dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A NULL pointer dereference can cause a kernel crash or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could potentially trigger a condition where `conn` is NULL during an RDMA connection setup.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to be able to interact with the RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) subsystem and trigger RDMA connection establishment. This could be local or over a network, depending on the system configuration and attack scenario."
