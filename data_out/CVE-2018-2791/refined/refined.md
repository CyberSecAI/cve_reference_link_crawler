 Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
 Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting attacks due to insufficient input sanitization
 Weaknesses: The backend of the Content Server is prone to both permanent and reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
 Impact of exploitation:
 - Include HTML- or JavaScript code into the web page.
 - Code execution in the browser of users when they visit the manipulated site.
 - Change the contents of the displayed site.
 - Redirect to other sites.
 - Steal user credentials.
 - Expose portal users to browser exploits and JavaScript Trojans.
 Attack vectors: Crafted GET requests to vulnerable parameters in the `/servlet/Satellite` endpoint, like `cs_imagedir` and `destpage`.
 Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to craft malicious URLs and trick users into accessing them
 Affected parameters: `cs_imagedir`, `destpage`
