The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Elenos ETG150 FM transmitter, specifically version 3.12.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper access control that allows a user to access and edit Traps configurations which they are not authorized to modify, this is done by manipulating the object id in the URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Vertical access control bypass:** The application fails to properly enforce vertical access controls. Users can bypass restrictions by directly manipulating object IDs in URLs.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application uses predictable object IDs in URLs, making it possible for users to access resources they are not authorized to view or modify by changing the ID.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthorized user can gain access to Traps configurations, which they are normally not permitted to alter, leading to potential unauthorized changes to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- By navigating to a legitimate configuration page that includes a configuration object ID in the URL (e.g., SMS or Email), the attacker can then modify the object ID to a different one (e.g. Traps configuration), allowing access to edit its parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a logged-in user with some access to configuration pages.
- The attacker needs to identify the specific object ID associated with the targeted configuration (e.g., Traps).
