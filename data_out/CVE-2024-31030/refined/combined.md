| Reproduce InfoVersion：v0.7Build Environment Update The `Makefile` within the `test_coap_server` directory have been updated to utilize `clang` with sanitizers.  ```  I1 = ../../lib/include  S1 = ../../lib/src -CC_ ?= gcc -CFLAGS = -Wall \ +CC_ ?= clang +CFLAGS = -Wall -g -fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer\           -I $(I1)  CFLAGS += $(IP6_CFLAGS)  CFLAGS += $(DTLS_CFLAGS) -LD_ ?= gcc -LDFLAGS = +LD_ ?= clang +LDFLAGS = -fsanitize=address,undefined  INCS = $(I1)/coap_server.h \         $(I1)/coap_msg.h \         $(I1)/coap_mem.h \ ``` Building test\_coap\_server ``` cd FreeCoAP/test/test_coap_server make dtls=n ``` Run InstructionsStarting the CoAP Server The CoAP server was started using the `test_coap_server` executable:  ``` cd FreeCoAP/test/test_coap_server ./test_coap_server ``` Sending a Packet The packet was sent to the server using the following command:  ``` echo -n "4402c6347d0fbbf3bd05657565756575657565756575657565756575" | xxd -r -p | nc -u 0.0.0.0 12436 ```  The packet's structure is as follows:   * ver = 1 * type = CON * tkl = 4 * code = POST * msg\_id = 50740 * token = '}\x0f\xbb\xf3' * options = [('Uri-Path', b'eueueueueueueueueu')] * paymark = ''   The hex representation of the datagram sent to the server is as follows:  ``` 4402c6347d0fbbf3bd05657565756575657565756575657565756575  ``` Description The server application encountered a runtime error detected by UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSan) during the execution of routine tasks. UBSan identified a null pointer being passed as the second argument to the `memcpy` function, which is explicitly declared to never accept a null pointer according to the annotations in `string.h`. The specific error was reported within the `server_handle_regular` function of `test_coap_server.c`. Crash report log of server：  ``` Info   : Received confirmable request from address 127.0.0.1 and port 58854 Info   : Request URI path requires a piggy-backed response to address 127.0.0.1 and port 58854 Info   : Responding to address 127.0.0.1 and port 58854 Notice : handle regular Received: ver:         0x01 type:        0x00 token_len:   4 code_class:  0 code_detail: 1 msg_id:      0x26c4 token:       0x88 0x18 0x8c 0x3d op[0].num:   11 op[0].len:   7 op[0].val:   0x72 0x65 0x67 0x75 0x6c 0x61 0x72 payload:      payload_len: 0 Sent:  ver:         0x01 type:        0x00 token_len:   0 code_class:  2 code_detail: 5 msg_id:      0x0000 token:       payload:     qwertyuiopasdfgh payload_len: 16  ```  Here is the UBSan report:  ``` test_coap_server.c:361:29: runtime error: null pointer passed as argument 2, which is declared to never be null /usr/include/string.h:44:28: note: nonnull attribute specified here     #0 0x4cb239 in server_handle_regular FreeCoAP/test/test_coap_server/test_coap_server.c:361:9     #1 0x4c8e1b in server_handle FreeCoAP/test/test_coap_server/test_coap_server.c:616:15     #2 0x4db596 in coap_server_exchange FreeCoAP/lib/src/coap_server.c:2440:15     #3 0x4d7c1f in coap_server_run FreeCoAP/lib/src/coap_server.c:2559:15     #4 0x4c8b95 in main FreeCoAP/test/test_coap_server/test_coap_server.c:747:11     #5 0x7fa12859d0b2 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-eX1tMB/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16     #6 0x41c36d in _start (FreeCoAP/test/test_coap_server/test_coap_server+0x41c36d)  SUMMARY: UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer: undefined-behavior test_coap_server.c:361:29 in   ``` |
