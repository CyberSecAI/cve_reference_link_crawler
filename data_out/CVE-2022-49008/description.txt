In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: can327: can327_feed_frame_to_netdev(): fix potential skb leak when netdev is down

In can327_feed_frame_to_netdev(), it did not free the skb when netdev
is down, and all callers of can327_feed_frame_to_netdev() did not free
allocated skb too. That would trigger skb leak.

Fix it by adding kfree_skb() in can327_feed_frame_to_netdev() when netdev
is down. Not tested, just compiled.
