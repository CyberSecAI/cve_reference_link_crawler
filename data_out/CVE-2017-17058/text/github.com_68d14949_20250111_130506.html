Hi there!

A user brings this to our attention: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17058>

> The WooCommerce plugin through 3.x for WordPress has a Directory Traversal Vulnerability via a /wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/templates/emails/plain/ URI, which accesses a parent directory.

Allegedly, "[When you dork with this,it will generate juciy information in parent

directory , for best practice filter according to the country](https://www.exploit-db.com/ghdb/4613/)."
