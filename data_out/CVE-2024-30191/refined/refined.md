The content is related to CVE-2024-30191.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the affected devices' ability to be tricked into associating a newly negotiated, attacker-controlled, security context with frames belonging to a victim. This allows the attacker to potentially manipulate or decrypt frames intended for the victim.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The device is vulnerable to a Wi-Fi encryption bypass attack.
- The device does not properly manage security context associations, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious security context.
- There is insufficient validation of security parameters during frame processing, which leads to the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** An attacker can decrypt frames meant for the victim, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Integrity:** An attacker could modify the frames and inject malicious data.
- **Availability:** An attacker could cause denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- A physically proximate attacker is required to carry out the attack.
- The attacker must be within Wi-Fi range of the vulnerable device.
- The attack exploits vulnerabilities in the device's handling of Wi-Fi security context.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be physically close to the target device.
- The attacker must have the ability to manipulate Wi-Fi frames and insert them into the network.
- The attacker must have a basic understanding of Wi-Fi security protocols to exploit the vulnerabilities.
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim devices.
