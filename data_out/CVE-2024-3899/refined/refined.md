- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape image settings, specifically the "Title" field, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or further attacks on the user.
- **Attack vectors:** By editing an image from a gallery and injecting a malicious script into the "Title" field, the XSS will be triggered on any page/post where the gallery is embedded via the shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the privileges of an author or higher to modify image settings.
