## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Envira Gallery < 1.8.15 - Author+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its image settings, which could allow users with post-writing privilege such as Author to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

Edit an Image from a Gallery (using the blue "Modify Image" overlay button when editing a Gallery) and add the following payload to the "Title" field: &lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)&gt;
The XSS will be triggered on page/post where the gallery is embed (for example via the related shortcode)
