**Published:** 2023-02-14

**Last Update:** 2023-02-14

**CVSSv3.1 Score:** 6.5, Medium

**CVSSv3.1 Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

**CWE:** [CWE-248](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/248.html)

**Bug ID:** SPL-232645

## Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 8.1.13, 8.2.10, and 9.0.4, an improperly-formatted ‘INGEST\_EVAL’ parameter in a [Field Transformation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Knowledge/Managefieldtransforms) crashes the Splunk daemon (splunkd).

## Solution

For Splunk Enterprise, upgrade versions to 8.1.13, 8.2.10, 9.0.4, or higher.

For Splunk Cloud Platform, Splunk is actively patching and monitoring the Splunk Cloud instances.

## Product Status

| Product | Version | Component | Affected Version | Fix Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Splunk Enterprise | 8.1 | Splunk Web | 8.1.12 and lower | 8.1.13 |
| Splunk Enterprise | 8.2 | Splunk Web | 8.2.0 to 8.2.9 | 8.2.10 |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.0 | Splunk Web | 9.0.0 to 9.0.3 | 9.0.4 |
| Splunk Cloud Platform | - | Splunk Web | 9.0.2209 and lower | 9.0.2212 |

## Mitigations and Workarounds

None

## Detections

* [Splunk Improperly Formatted Parameter Crashes splunkd](https://research.splunk.com/application/08978eca-caff-44c1-84dc-53f17def4e14/)

This hunting search provides information on who executed the crashing command, and when and how often the command was executed.

## Severity

Splunk rated the vulnerability as Medium, 6.5, with a CVSSv3.1 vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. The vulnerability requires compromising a user account with the capability to create or edit a Field transformation or run the ‘ingestpreview’ command via Search.

# Detection: Splunk Improperly Formatted Parameter Crashes splunkd

**EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION**

This detection status is set to experimental. The Splunk Threat Research team has not yet fully tested, simulated, or built comprehensive datasets for this detection. As such, this analytic is not officially supported. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to us at research@splunk.com.

ID: 08978eca-caff-44c1-84dc-53f17def4e14

[Type: TTP](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

The following analytic detects the execution of improperly formatted INGEST\_EVAL parameters in Splunk Enterprise, which can crash the splunkd service. It leverages the Splunk\_Audit.Search\_Activity datamodel to identify ad-hoc searches containing specific keywords. This activity is significant because it can disrupt Splunk operations, leading to potential data loss and service downtime. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service, impacting the availability and reliability of the Splunk environment.

### Macros Used

| splunk\_improperly\_formatted\_parameter\_crashes\_splunkd\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_improperly_formatted_parameter_crashes_splunkd_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Notable | Yes |
| Rule Title | `%name%` |
| Rule Description | `%description%` |
| Notable Event Fields | user, dest |
| Creates Risk Event | True |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type TTP. These detections will use Risk Based Alerting and generate Notable Events.
### Implementation

Requires access to audittrail and use of Splunk\_Audit.Search\_Activity datamodel.

### Known False Positives

This is a hunting search it should be focused on affected products, otherwise it is likely to produce false positives.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| An attempt to exploit ingest eval parameter was detected from $user$ | 100 | 100 | 100 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
