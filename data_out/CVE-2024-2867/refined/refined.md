**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2867

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Software:** WordPress plugin "Paid Membership Plugin, Ecommerce, User Registration Form, Login Form, User Profile & Restrict Content – ProfilePress"

**Affected Versions:**  All versions up to and including 4.15.4

**Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'title' parameter.

**Weaknesses:**
*   The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'title' parameter before storing it in the database.
*   The plugin fails to properly escape the stored input when rendering it in a web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page.
*   When a user visits the compromised page, the injected script will execute in their browser.
*   The attacker can potentially perform actions like stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.

**Attack Vector:**
*   The attack vector is through a crafted 'title' parameter.
*   The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within the 'title' field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be authenticated with Contributor access or higher.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists because the plugin does not sanitize and escape the 'title' parameter properly.
*   This allows an attacker to store malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed when the 'title' is rendered in a page.
*   The provided changelog diffs highlight the changes made to fix the XSS on the `carousel-author-posts` shortcode, while the main vulnerability is in the title parameter.
