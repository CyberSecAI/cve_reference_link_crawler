Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-4390:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The content from Wordfence and NinTechNet directly references **CVE-2021-4390** and discusses a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the "Contact Form 7 Style" WordPress plugin, which aligns with the CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability stems from the lack of or improper nonce validation in the `manage_wp_posts_be_qe_save_post()` function, specifically within `cf7-style-meta-box.php`.
   - The code checks for the existence of a nonce (`_inline_edit`) before validating it, but if the nonce is not present, the validation is bypassed, making the function vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is CSRF, which allows an attacker to induce a logged-in administrator to perform unintended actions.
   - **Missing or Incorrect Nonce Validation:** The code doesn't enforce nonce validation when the nonce parameter is missing.
   -  The vulnerable code snippet is located in `cf7-style-meta-box.php#L553`:

    ```php
    if ( isset( $_POST[ '_inline_edit' ] ) && ! wp_verify_nonce( sanitize_text_field( $_POST[ '_inline_edit' ] ), 'inlineeditnonce' ) )
        return $post_id;
    ```

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Unauthorized template quick edit:** An attacker can potentially modify or manipulate templates associated with Contact Form 7 through a forged request by exploiting the vulnerable `manage_wp_posts_be_qe_save_post()` function.
  - The impact of this vulnerability can be used to alter the website appearence and/or functionality.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Forged HTTP request:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request that targets the vulnerable function `manage_wp_posts_be_qe_save_post()`.
   - **Social Engineering:**  The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a link or performing an action (like submitting a form) that executes the malicious request.
   - The attack is conducted via a crafted link or form submission that a logged-in administrator is tricked into interacting with.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the WordPress site.
   - **Social Engineering:** The attacker must have the ability to entice an administrator to perform a specific action (e.g., clicking on a link).
   - **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send the crafted request to the vulnerable site.
   - **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Function:** The attacker needs to know the specific vulnerable function and the structure of the request needed to exploit the CSRF.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Wordfence analysis indicates that no patch is available.
*   The NinTechNet blog posts provide a broader view of many plugins being vulnerable to similar CSRF issues due to flawed nonce validation logic.
*  The `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` link points to the vulnerable code in `cf7-style-meta-box.php`.

In summary, CVE-2021-4390 is a CSRF vulnerability in the "Contact Form 7 Style" plugin, stemming from insufficient nonce validation that can allow unauthorized template edits if an admin is tricked into interacting with a malicious link.
