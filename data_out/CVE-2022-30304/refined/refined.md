Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an "improper neutralization of input during web page generation" vulnerability, specifically due to AngularJS client-side template injection. This means the application is not properly sanitizing user-controlled input before using it within AngularJS templates, leading to potential code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-79:** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting)
- **AngularJS Client-Side Template Injection:** The application is vulnerable to XSS due to the use of user-supplied data directly in AngularJS templates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can perform a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.
- Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of unauthorized code or commands within the victim's browser session. This could involve stealing cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the URL parameter observed in the FortiWeb attack event logview in FortiAnalyzer.
- A malicious payload is injected via a URL parameter.
- This payload is then stored and rendered within the FortiAnalyzer web interface, leading to XSS execution when viewed by an admin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to cause an entry to be added to the FortiWeb attack event logview in FortiAnalyzer.
- The attack requires a victim (typically a FortiAnalyzer user/admin) to access the affected view within the FortiAnalyzer web interface.
