- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Web Content Display widget's article selector.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability. A crafted payload injected into the `Title` field of a web content article is not properly sanitized.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML, potentially leading to malicious actions like session hijacking, phishing, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting a malicious payload into the `Title` field of a web content article. When a user selects and displays the article in the Web Content Display widget, the malicious script executes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have the capability to create/edit web content articles (i.e., a low-privilege authenticated user). The attacker also requires a victim to view the malicious content through the Web Content Display widget.
