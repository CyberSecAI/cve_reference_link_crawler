Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-5695:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-memory condition occurring during allocations in the probabilistic heap checker.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A specific out-of-memory condition during allocations could trigger an assertion.
- In rare cases, this could lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption could occur.
- Assertion could be triggered, possibly leading to a crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by specific memory allocation scenarios leading to an out-of-memory condition in the probabilistic heap checker.
- The attacker needs to be able to induce this specific out-of-memory condition via heap manipulation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to trigger specific allocation patterns to cause the out-of-memory condition.
-  The attacker would need to have a way to interact with the heap to trigger this memory condition.
