Impact

Fixed in

* Firefox 127

#### [#CVE-2024-5687: An incorrect principal could have been used when opening new tabs](#CVE-2024-5687)

Reporter
jackyzy823
Impact
high
##### Description

If a specific sequence of actions is performed when opening a new tab, the triggering principal associated with the new tab may have been incorrect. The triggering principal is used to calculate many values, including the `Referer` and `Sec-` headers, meaning there is the potential for incorrect security checks within the browser in addition to incorrect or misleading information sent to remote websites.
This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other versions of Firefox are unaffected.\*
