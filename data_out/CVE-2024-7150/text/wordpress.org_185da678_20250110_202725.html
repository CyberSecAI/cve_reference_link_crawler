Description says slider can display posts. Installed it and only to find out that feature is in paid version. Make it clear what features are free and premium so you don‚Äôt waste people‚Äôs time. The one star review is for bad user experience. The basic image only gallery is not much use.

Could be great, works mostly, but NO support. Bugs rarely fixed. If that works for you, go for it. I‚Äôm ready to look for an alternative. And they are out there.

Please download and if you run into any difficulties, please reach out in our support forum. And when we do, they ignore us. Noone gets an answer. Very frustrating.
The plugin has a serious bug after they updated it, but who cares. Not 10web i guess ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
