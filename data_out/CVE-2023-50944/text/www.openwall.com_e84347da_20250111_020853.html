Subject: CVE-2023-50944: Apache Airflow: Bypass permission verification to
 read code of other dags

Severity: low

Affected versions:

- Apache Airflow before 2.8.1

Description:

Apache Airflow, versions before 2.8.1, have a vulnerability that allows an authenticated user to access the source code of a DAG to which they don't have access. This vulnerability is considered low since it requires an authenticated user to exploit it. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.8.1, which fixes this issue.
