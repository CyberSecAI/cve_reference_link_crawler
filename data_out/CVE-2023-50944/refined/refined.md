Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-50944

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper permission checks when accessing the source code of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) within Apache Airflow. Specifically, an authenticated user could bypass permission verification and read the code of a DAG to which they don't have access. If multiple DAGs were defined within the same file, the user only needed read access to one of the DAGs to view the source code for all DAGs in that file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the insufficient enforcement of read permissions for DAG code. The system did not properly verify if the user had the necessary rights to view the DAG's source before allowing access.
- **Shared File Access:**  The vulnerability was exacerbated when multiple DAGs were defined within the same file.  Access to one DAG in the file granted access to the entire file, including code for unauthorized DAGs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the source code of sensitive DAGs. This could reveal sensitive business logic, credentials, or other confidential information embedded within the DAG definitions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the Apache Airflow web interface where authenticated users can request to view DAG source code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a valid authenticated user of the Apache Airflow instance.
- **Knowledge of DAG existence:** The attacker must know of the DAG's existence to attempt to access its source code through the web interface.
- **No special privileges needed:**  The attacker does not need any special administrative privileges beyond being a valid, logged-in user.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability is fixed in Apache Airflow version 2.8.1 by implementing checks to ensure users have proper read access to a specific DAG before allowing them to view its code. Additionally, the fix enforces that users should have read access to all DAGs defined in a file before granting access to that file's code.
