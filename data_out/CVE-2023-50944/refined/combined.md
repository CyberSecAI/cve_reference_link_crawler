Subject: CVE-2023-50944: Apache Airflow: Bypass permission verification to
 read code of other dags

Severity: low

Affected versions:

- Apache Airflow before 2.8.1

Description:

Apache Airflow, versions before 2.8.1, have a vulnerability that allows an authenticated user to access the source code of a DAG to which they don't have access. This vulnerability is considered low since it requires an authenticated user to exploit it. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.8.1, which fixes this issue.

### @hussein-awala **[hussein-awala](/hussein-awala)** commented [Dec 16, 2023](#issue-2044753027)

This PR checks if the user has read access on the DAG before allowing the reading of the DAG code. If the DAG is defined with other DAGs in the same file, the user should have read access to all the other DAGs. Otherwise, he will be forbidden from reading the file code.

Sorry, something went wrong.

This change is to avoid creating two different sessions because we use the method `code` and not the protected one.
