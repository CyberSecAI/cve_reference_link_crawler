- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists within the `fluid_msg::EchoCommon::unpack` routine of the Open Networking Foundation (ONF) libfluid (specifically the `libfluid_msg` module).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A network attacker can trigger a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition on the target component. The provided CVSS score also indicates a low impact on confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to the vulnerable component is required; no authentication is required.
