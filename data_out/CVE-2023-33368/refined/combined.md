# Access Control SoftwareiDSecure On-Premises

The iDSecure solution, developed by Control iD, is a software that enables controlling the access of people and vehicles in companies of all sizes.

All management is performed via a web browser and is compatible with the main operating systems and devices (cell phones, tablets and PCs).

The platform enables the configuration of custom access rules and the generation of detailed reports to make your operation easier and more intuitive.

* [Specification](#specifications)
* [Download](#download)

* Customizable access rules
* Offline contingency mode
* 100% web, accessed by web browser
* Integration with cameras (CCTV)
* Real-time monitoring
* Customizable reports
* Modern interface

### Easy to use

The iDSecure solution was developed with a focus on usability, making the experience of the manager and security professional as intuitive as possible. The local installation of the software combined with the 100% web interface allows the use of any device to manage access.

### Access rules and reports

The configuration of complex rules based on companies, groups, schedules, types (visitor, third party, resident, etc.) combined with double-entry control, credits and even random searches, guaran- tee the system’s compatibility with the most advanced security requirements.

### Connectivity e integration

All Control iD access controllers (e.g., iDAccess, iDBox, iDFace and iDBlock) are natively integrated with iDSecure and can be managed easily. In addition, the system allows integration with CCTV cameras and card and/or biometrics registers for PC.

### A version for every need

In the entry version of iDSecure (Lite), rules validation is done locally on the access control devices. In the Enterprise version, both identification and validation of rules takes place on the server, allowing an unlimited (depending on purchased license) number of users.
