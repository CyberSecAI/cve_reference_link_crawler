Target Audience: Customer & Service Partner & Fujitsu - Document Classification: Unclassified

PROBLEM / DESCRIPTION

In  July 2024, the  Fujitsu PSIRT (Europe)  received intelligence  by BINARLY, on  a  vulnerability  present  in AMI Aptio V
(BRLY-2024-005).

It  resides  in  certain  Fujitsu  PRIMERGY  firmware  package  versions,  available  to  customers  on  the  Fujitsu  (EMEA)
Product Support website. The components are subject to a vulnerability, which allows an attacker to potentially affect
system confidentiality, integrity and availability.

The  vulnerability  might  allow  local  users  or  physically  proximate  attackers  to  bypass  the  Secure  Boot  protection
mechanism by leveraging an AMI test key, present in AMI Aptio V (BIOS).

SITUATION

Based on the  intelligence information available, the Fujitsu PSIRT  rated the vulnerability  in summary, as a  medium-
high level threat to the Fujitsu product portfolio, due to the high severity, high risk factor, and low exploitability.

The U.S. MITRE and  NIST ITL were requested by CERT/CC for publication of  a dedicated CVE ID on the vulnerability.
The max. CVSSv3 base score is ~ High (8.2).

The  Fujitsu  PSIRT  has  estimated  a  Fujitsu  ARF  (Affection  Risk  Factor),  based  on  the  component  prevalence,
component security record, and component fix/mitigation expenditure.

DATE: SEPTEMBER 18, 2024 | PAGES: 14

The max. Fujitsu ARF score is High (5).

The max. EPSSv1/2 score is ~ Low (0.04%).
The above score was determined on July 26, 2024.

The  Fujitsu  PSIRT  has  no  knowledge  of  a  working  PoC  (Proof  of  Concept)  method  or  active  campaign,  able  to
exploit or exploiting this vulnerability, at the time of publication.

SOLUTION / REMEDIATION

Relevant Fujitsu PSIRT members and adjacent development and engineering departments were already informed.

The  Fujitsu  PSIRT  requested  a  mitigation  of  the  underlying  vulnerability,  via  software  package  updates,  and  has
also  provided  further,  internal  instructions  on  the  remediation.  Fujitsu  product  updates  will  be  made  available
consecutively, while all intelligence provided by the Fujitsu PSIRT is processed continuously.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

At this point Fujitsu PSIRT issue FJ-ISS-2024-072412, addressing this vulnerability, is MITIGATED/RESOLVED, but will be
updated as necessary, in the Fujitsu PSIRT PRODUCT SECURITY section of the Fujitsu Product Support website.

A  List  of  affected  Fujitsu  products  (APL)  on  the  affected  Client  Computing  Devices  (CELSIUS,  ESPRIMO,  FUTRO,
LIFEBOOK,  STYLISTIC),  Server  products  (PRIMERGY  and  PRIMEQUEST),  Storage  products  (ETERNUS),  Solutions
(PRIMEFLEX), Server BS2000 products (SE, AU) and Implementation Services (AIS) follows below.

■ This is an overview of affected Fujitsu products (and product components).
■ This list is updated regularly (i.e., affected systems, affection states, new fixed versions, release dates).
■ For the supply of an updated software or firmware, we often rely on the support of the component supplier.
■ Further, Fujitsu can only provide updates for products which are under service.
■ Products which are not listed below are already out of services/EoSL (End of Service Life)

(as of Q4/2023 affected and unaffected products are listed to accommodate future CSAF or VEX).

This  Fujitsu  PSIRT  security  notice  and  the  list  of  affected  Fujitsu  products  will  be  updated  as  soon  as  new
information is available.

RECOMMENDATION

The Fujitsu PSIRT recommends customers to install available Fujitsu product updates or execute the Platform Key
(PK) Replacement Procedure, and follow general security best practices.

Remediation via BIOS update (permanent fix/mitigation)
Step 1: Determine whether system is affected

Refer to the above list of affected Fujitsu products (APL). This list is updated regularly.
Before proceeding, please check the expected availability of the relevant BIOS update package.

Step 2: Download the BIOS update package

To download the BIOS update package, please go to the Fujitsu Technical Support page and follow these steps:
• Select "Select a new Product" [button]
• Select "Browse for product"
• Select "product line"
• Select "product group" and "product family"
• Select "OS Independent (BIOS, Firmware, etc.) [drop-down list]"
• Check "Important information" and/or "Installation description"
• Download the latest BIOS update package

Step 3: Preparation & BIOS update procedure

Content extraction and update execution are system dependent. The BIOS update package usually contains an
EfiFlashEfiUsage.txt, ReleaseNote.txt or ReadMe.txt file with further specific instructions for the BIOS update.
Please follow these instructions to commence the firmware update.

Remediation via Platform Key (PK) Replacement Procedure (temporary mitigation):
Step 1: Prepare a USB stick with FAT32 with a secure PK file

Refer to the Fujitsu Global Technical Support or your Fujitsu liaison.

Step 2: Replace PK file in BIOS setup

• Select "Security" tab, section Secure Boot [mode "custom"], sub-section Key Management menu
• Select "Platform Key (PK) " menu, then select "Update"
• Select "No" upon PK replacement, to load file from USB stick
• Select the stored PK file, later select "Authenticated Variable"
• Select "Yes" in update confirmation screen
• Select "No" in "Reset without saving?" dialog, then verify PK is set to "External"
• Select "Save Changes and Reset" in the "Save & Exit" and reboot

NOTE (temporary mitigation):

Do not perform BIOS Restore Defaults or Secure Boot Key restore, otherwise the changed PK is lost again.
