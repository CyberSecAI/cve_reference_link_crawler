  "CVE_data": [
    {
      "ID": "CVE-2024-8105",
      "Description": "The vulnerability allows local users or physically proximate attackers to bypass the Secure Boot protection mechanism by leveraging an AMI test key, present in AMI Aptio V (BIOS). The usage of default test keys poses an immediate and high-severity risk as it makes it trivial to defeat Secure Boot on affected devices, allowing malicious actors to launch advanced firmware-level threats from the operating system.",
      "Root cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability is the use of insecure Platform Keys (PK) in AMI Aptio V (BIOS). These keys, intended for testing, were inadvertently included in production firmware, allowing bypass of Secure Boot protection.",
       "Weaknesses": [
          "Use of default/insecure cryptographic keys.",
           "Lack of proper verification or validation of keys used in the Secure Boot mechanism."
        ],
      "Impact": "An attacker with access to the leaked private key can manipulate the boot process, executing malicious code even with Secure Boot enabled. This bypass could lead to system compromise, installation of persistent malware, data exfiltration, or denial of service.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local access or physical proximity to the vulnerable system is required for exploitation.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attackers need either physical access to the machine or local administrative privileges to exploit the vulnerability."
