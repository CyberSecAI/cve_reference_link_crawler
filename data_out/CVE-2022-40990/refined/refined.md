{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses `sprintf` to format command parameters into a stack buffer without proper size checks, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when using `sprintf` to format user-controlled inputs into fixed-size buffers.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted network packets containing long arguments to the vulnerable `DetranCLI` commands.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device and have knowledge of the vulnerable command structures."
