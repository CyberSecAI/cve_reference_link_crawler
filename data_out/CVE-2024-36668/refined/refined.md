Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2024-36668:

**Verification:**
The provided content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in `idccms V1.35`, which aligns with the placeholder description of CVE-2024-36668 which suggests a vulnerability exists.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper CSRF protection in the `idccms V1.35` application, specifically in the `type_deal.php` component. This allows an attacker to forge a request that the victim's browser will execute on the target server while the victim is authenticated.
*   **Weakness:** The application does not implement proper checks to ensure that requests are initiated by the authenticated user within the current session. Specifically, the absence of CSRF tokens or similar mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions on the idccms application. In this case, the provided Proof-of-Concept (PoC) shows the attacker is able to delete a money note (`dataType=moneyNote&dataID=21`).
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTML page that, when visited by a logged-in user, automatically sends a request to the vulnerable `type_deal.php` endpoint. This request will be executed in the context of the victim's session, thus causing the unintended action to be performed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into opening a crafted HTML page (e.g., through a phishing email or a malicious website). The attacker does not need direct access to the idccms application server but can exploit a logged-in user to achieve their aims.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** `http://127.0.0.1:80/admin/type_deal.php?mudi=del&dataType=moneyNote&dataTypeCN=%E4%B8%8D%E6%89%A3%E6%AC%BE%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E&theme=cs&dataID=21`
*   **Exploitation Method:** The provided HTML PoC exploits the vulnerability via a simple form with a POST request to the vulnerable URL, with the form being submitted automatically. This leverages the fact that when a user's browser receives the exploit HTML, and the user is authenticated against the idccms site, the browser will automatically submit the post request to the vulnerable server with the user's session.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided content includes a target URL (`http://idccms.com/`) and a local PoC target (`http://127.0.0.1:80/`). The PoC is meant for local testing/reproduction of the vulnerability.
*   The PoC includes a script `history.pushState('', '', '/')` which is used to remove the URL of the attacking page from the browser history to conceal the exploitation from the victim.

**Summary**
The content provides a clear description of a CSRF vulnerability within `idccms V1.35`, including the vulnerable component, the attack vector, and a proof-of-concept HTML exploit.
