Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-31823

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `removeSecondaryImage` function within `application/modules/admin/controllers/ecommerce/Publish.php`.
- The code directly concatenates user-controlled input (`$_POST['folder']` and `$_POST['image']`) into a file path without sufficient sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion (CWE-73):** The application is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the `removeSecondaryImage` function, allowing an attacker to specify paths outside of the intended directory.
- The code does not properly sanitize the folder parameter before using it in the `unlink` operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can delete any file on the server that the webserver user has permissions to delete. This can lead to:
    - Denial of service by deleting critical application files.
    - Data loss by deleting user uploaded files or configuration files.
    - Potential for further exploitation if the attacker deletes files that can be overwritten with malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/admin/removeSecondaryImage` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to make the request.
- The attacker controls the `$_POST['folder']` and `$_POST['image']` parameters in the POST request to specify the file to be deleted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the admin panel.
- The attacker must be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- Basic understanding of HTTP requests and file path manipulation is required.

**Additional details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in commit `d22b54e8915f167a135046ceb857caaf8479c4da`.
- The vulnerability was reported by LioTree.
- The fix adds a check using `realpath` and `strpos` to ensure that the path is within the intended directory.
