- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `NormalizationFilter` in dotCMS, responsible for stripping invalid characters from incoming URLs, failed to include double slashes (`//`) in its default list of invalid characters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: The vulnerability is a broken access control issue caused by the failure to normalize double slashes (`//`) in URLs, allowing attackers to bypass access controls and potentially XSS filters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can construct URLs with double slashes that can bypass security measures and access restricted areas of the application or potentially conduct cross-site scripting attacks. The example given in the advisory demonstrates access to a JSP page that should not be publicly accessible.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through crafted URLs that contain double slashes (`//`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers only need to be able to send HTTP requests to the dotCMS server with a crafted URL.

The advisory provides more detail than the standard CVE description which is a placeholder.
