### [Issues](/security/known-issues.dot) » Broken Access Control — Normalization Filter

| Issue: | SI-68 |
| --- | --- |
| Date: | Jun 30, 2023, 11:00:00 AM |
| Severity: | Medium |
| Requires Admin Access: | No |
| Fix Version: | 23.06+, LTS 22.03.7+, LTS 23.01.4+ |
| Credit: | Internal Security Team |
| Description: | In dotCMS, the **NormalizationFilter** is run on every request to strip invalid characters from incoming URLs. The default list of invalid characters to strip failed to include double slashes (`//`), which allows a URL to be constructed that can circumvent XSS and access controls built into dotCMS. An example of an affected URL is <https://demo.dotcms.com//html/portlet/ext/files/edit_text_inc.jsp>; this URL should not be externally accessible and should result in a 404/Not Found response.  The "default" list of invalid URL characters can be found here:  <https://github.com/dotCMS/core/blob/master/dotCMS/src/main/java/com/dotcms/filters/NormalizationFilter.java#L37>  Affected dotCMS versions:   * 5.3.8 * 21.06 * 22.03 * 23.01 |
| Mitigation: | URLs that contain double slashes can be blocked at an upstream firewall / WAF or can be blocked by using dotCMS config variables.  In dotCMS, the default list of invalid characters can be overridden by passing an environmental variable `DOT_URI_NORMALIZATION_FORBIDDEN_STRINGS` that adds `//` to a comma separated list of invalid strings, e.g.:`DOT_URI_NORMALIZATION_FORBIDDEN_STRINGS=;,..,/./,\\,?,%3B,%2E,%5C,%3F,%00,\0,\r,\n,\f,//`  It is also possible to pass an environmental variable `DOT_URI_NORMALIZATION_FORBIDDEN_REGEX` regex that can be tested for and blocked for more fine grained control.  For example, to block `//html.*` you could set:  `DOT_URI_NORMALIZATION_FORBIDDEN_REGEX=^\/\/html\/.*` |
