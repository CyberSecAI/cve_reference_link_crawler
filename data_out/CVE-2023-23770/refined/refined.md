The provided document describes multiple vulnerabilities in the Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) standard, but **does not contain any information related to CVE-2023-23770.** The vulnerabilities discussed are:

*   **CVE-2022-24401:** Decryption oracle attack due to reliance on unauthenticated network time in the Air Interface Encryption (AIE) keystream generator.
    *   **Root Cause:** Reliance on publicly broadcast, unauthenticated network time.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of authentication on the network time used for key generation.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality and authenticity; allows decryption of traffic.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Active; attacker intercepts and manipulates traffic.
    *  **Required Capabilities:**  Ability to intercept and manipulate TETRA radio communications.
*   **CVE-2022-24402:** Backdoor in the TEA1 algorithm that reduces the effective key size.
    *   **Root Cause:** Intentional weakening of the TEA1 cipher by reducing the key's effective entropy.
    *   **Weakness:**  Weak cryptographic design.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality and authenticity; trivial brute-forcing of the key.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Passive or Active; attacker can intercept or manipulate traffic.
    *   **Required Capabilities:**  Ability to intercept TETRA radio communications using the TEA1 encryption.
*   **CVE-2022-24404:** Lack of ciphertext authentication on AIE, enabling malleability attacks.
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of ciphertext authentication mechanism.
    *   **Weakness:**  Missing integrity protection of encrypted data.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of authenticity; ability to inject malicious messages.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Active; attacker manipulates ciphertext.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to intercept and manipulate TETRA radio communications.
*  **CVE-2022-24403:** Weak design in the scheme used to obfuscate radio identities, enabling user deanonymization.
    *   **Root Cause:** Weak obfuscation scheme for radio identities.
    *   **Weakness:**  Inadequate design of user identity obfuscation.
    *   **Impact:** User deanonymization and tracking.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Passive; attacker monitors network traffic.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to passively monitor TETRA radio communications.
*   **CVE-2022-24400:** Flaw in the authentication algorithm allows setting the Derived Cipher Key (DCK) to 0.
    *   **Root Cause:** Flaw in the authentication process.
    *   **Weakness:**  Vulnerability in key derivation process.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of authenticity and partial loss of confidentiality; allows uplink interception and access to post-authentication functionality.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Active; attacker manipulates the authentication process.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to manipulate the authentication process within TETRA communications.
