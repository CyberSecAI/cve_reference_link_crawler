- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unnecessary commands are available during boot time at the physical console of Cisco Access Point (AP) devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows bypassing the Cisco Secure Boot functionality due to the presence of unnecessary commands during boot time at the physical console. This allows loading of a tampered software image.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to load a tampered software image on the device, potentially leading to unauthorized access or control of the device. The Cisco Secure Boot functionality is not permanently compromised.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to the device's console is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be physically present at the device and must be able to interrupt the boot process and execute specific commands at the physical console. They also need to have a previously downloaded tampered image.
