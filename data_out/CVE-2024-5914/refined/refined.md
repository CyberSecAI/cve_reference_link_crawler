- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A command injection vulnerability exists in the `ScheduleGenericPolling` or `GenericPollingScheduledTask` scripts within the Cortex XSOAR CommonScripts pack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, leading to command injection (CWE-77).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands within the context of an integration container.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based, unauthenticated attacker
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system, no prior authentication is required. The attack complexity is considered high due to the present attack requirements.
