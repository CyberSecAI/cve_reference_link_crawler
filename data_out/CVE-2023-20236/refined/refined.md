- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient image verification during the iPXE boot process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability lies in the iPXE boot function of Cisco IOS XR software, where the system does not adequately verify software images before booting. This allows an attacker to manipulate boot parameters related to image verification.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to boot an unverified software image on the affected device. This could lead to a compromise of the system's integrity and potentially provide a foothold for further malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to be authenticated. The attacker manipulates boot parameters related to image verification during the iPXE boot process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated, local user with the ability to manipulate the boot parameters of the affected device during the iPXE boot process.
