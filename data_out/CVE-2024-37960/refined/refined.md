- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CodePen Embedded Pens Shortcode plugin for WordPress, in versions 1.0.0 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to inject scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, into the website. These scripts will then be executed when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited via the plugin's shortcode functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the "Contributor" privilege to inject the malicious scripts.
