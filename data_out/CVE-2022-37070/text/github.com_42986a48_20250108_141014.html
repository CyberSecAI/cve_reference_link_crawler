# H3C GR-1200W (<=MiniGRW1A0V100R006) Has an command injection vulnerability

## Overview

* Manufacturer's website information：<https://www.h3c.com/>
* Firmware download address ： <https://www.h3c.com/cn/d_202102/1383837_30005_0.htm>

### Product Information

H3C GR-1200W MiniGRW1A0V100R006 router, the latest version of simulation overview：

[![image-20220724213031606](/Darry-lang1/vuln/raw/main/H3C/GR-1200W/19/img/image-20220724213031606.png)](/Darry-lang1/vuln/blob/main/H3C/GR-1200W/19/img/image-20220724213031606.png)

## Vulnerability details

The H3C GR-1200W (<=MiniGRW1A0V100R006) router was found to contain a command insertion vulnerability in DelL2tpLNSList.This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands through the "param" parameter.

[![image-20220724213415656](/Darry-lang1/vuln/raw/main/H3C/GR-1200W/19/img/image-20220724213415656.png)](/Darry-lang1/vuln/blob/main/H3C/GR-1200W/19/img/image-20220724213415656.png)

In the `DelL2tpLNSList` function, it format the `param` parameter we entered into `V13` through the `snprintf` function, and execute our command through the system function. We can execute our orders through $(command).

## Recurring vulnerabilities and POC

In order to reproduce the vulnerability, the following steps can be followed:

1. Boot the firmware by qemu-system or other ways (real machine)
2. Attack with the following POC attacks

```
