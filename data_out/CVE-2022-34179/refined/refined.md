Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-34179:

**CVE-2022-34179**

*   **Root Cause:** The Embeddable Build Status Plugin allows specifying a `style` query parameter without restricting its values, which is then used to select an SVG image style.
*   **Weakness:** The plugin does not validate or sanitize the `style` parameter, leading to a relative path traversal vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can specify paths to other SVG images on the Jenkins controller file system, potentially accessing sensitive images. This bypasses the need for the Overall/Read permission, which is normally required.
*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious user can specify a crafted URL with a path traversal payload in the `style` parameter of a request to the affected plugin's endpoint.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** No specific permissions are required to exploit this vulnerability, which means an unauthenticated attacker can potentially exploit it.

**Affected Plugin:** Embeddable Build Status Plugin (versions 2.0.3 and earlier)

**Fix:** Embeddable Build Status Plugin version 2.0.4 restricts the `style` parameter to one of three legal values, preventing path traversal.
