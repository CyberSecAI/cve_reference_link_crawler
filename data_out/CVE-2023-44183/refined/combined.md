# Understanding VXLANs

Virtual Extensible LAN protocol (VXLAN) technology
allows networks to support more VLANs. According to the IEEE 802.1Q
standard, traditional VLAN identifiers are 12 bits longâthis
naming limits networks to 4094 VLANs. The VXLAN protocol overcomes
this limitation by using a longer logical network identifier that
allows more VLANs and, therefore, more logical network isolation for
large networks such as clouds that typically include many virtual
machines.

## VXLAN Benefits

VXLAN technology allows you to segment your networks (as VLANs
do), but it provides benefits that VLANs cannot. Here are the most
important benefits of using VXLANs:

* You can theoretically create as many as 16 million VXLANs
  in an administrative domain (as opposed to 4094 VLANs on a Juniper
  Networks device).

  + MX Series routers and EX9200 switches support as many
    as 32,000 VXLANs, 32,000 multicast groups, and 8000 virtual tunnel
    endpoints (VTEPs). This means that VXLANs based on MX Series routers
    provide network segmentation at the scale required by cloud builders
    to support very large numbers of tenants.
  + QFX10000 Series switches support 4000 VXLANs and 2000
    remote VTEPs.
  + QFX5100, QFX5110, QFX5200, QFX5210, and EX4600 switches support
    4000 VXLANs, 4000 multicast groups, and 2000 remote VTEPs.
  + EX4300-48MP
    switches support 4000 VXLANs.
* You can enable migration of virtual machines between servers
  that exist in separate Layer 2 domains by tunneling the traffic over
  Layer 3 networks. This functionality allows you to dynamically allocate
  resources within or between data centers without being constrained
  by Layer 2 boundaries or being forced to create large or geographically
  stretched Layer 2 domains.

Using VXLANs to create smaller Layer 2 domains that are connected
over a Layer 3 network means that you do not need to use Spanning
Tree Protocol (STP) to converge the topology but can use more robust
routing protocols in the Layer 3 network instead. In the absence of
STP, none of your links are blocked, which means you can get full
value from all the ports that you purchase. Using routing protocols
to connect your Layer 2 domains also allows you to load-balance the
traffic to ensure that you get the best use of your available bandwidth.
Given the amount of east-west traffic that often flows within or between
data centers, maximizing your network performance for that traffic
is very important.

The video Why Use an Overlay Network in a Data Center? presents a brief overview of the advantages of using VXLANs.

## How Does VXLAN Work?

VXLAN is often described as an overlay technology because it
allows you to stretch Layer 2 connections over an intervening Layer
3 network by encapsulating (tunneling) Ethernet frames in a VXLAN
packet that includes IP addresses. Devices that support VXLANs are
called *virtual tunnel endpoints (VTEPs)*âthey
can be end hosts or network switches or routers. VTEPs encapsulate
VXLAN traffic and de-encapsulate that traffic when it leaves the VXLAN
tunnel. To encapsulate an Ethernet frame, VTEPs add a number of fields,
including the following fields:

* Outer media access control (MAC) destination address (MAC
  address of the tunnel endpoint VTEP)
* Outer MAC source address (MAC address of the tunnel source
  VTEP)
* Outer IP destination address (IP address of the tunnel
  endpoint VTEP)
* Outer IP source address (IP address of the tunnel source
  VTEP)
* Outer UDP header
* A VXLAN header that includes a 24-bit fieldâcalled
  the *VXLAN network identifier (VNI)*âthat
  is used to uniquely identify the VXLAN. The VNI is similar to a VLAN
  ID, but having 24 bits allows you to create many more VXLANs than
  VLANs.

Note:

Because VXLAN adds 50 to 54 bytes of additional header
information to the original Ethernet frame, you might want to increase
the MTU of the underlying network. In this case, configure the MTU
of the physical interfaces that participate in the VXLAN network,
not the MTU of the logical VTEP source interface, which is ignored.

[Figure 1](#how-does-vxlan-work__vxlan-pkt) shows the VXLAN packet format.

Figure 1: VXLAN Packet Format![VXLAN Packet Format](../../images/g043104.gif)

## VXLAN Implementation Methods

Junos OS supports implementing VXLANs in the following environments:

* Manual VXLANâIn this environment, a Juniper Networks
  device acts as a transit device for downstream devices acting as VTEPs,
  or a gateway that provides connectivity for downstream servers that
  host virtual machines (VMs), which communicate over a Layer 3 network.
  In this environment, software-defined networking (SDN) controllers
  are not deployed.

  Note:

  QFX10000 switches do not support manual VXLANs.
* OVSDB-VXLANâIn this environment, SDN controllers
  use the Open vSwitch Database (OVSDB) management protocol to provide
  a means through which controllers (such as a VMware NSX or Juniper
  Networks Contrail controller) and Juniper Networks devices that support
  OVSDB can communicate.
* EVPN-VXLANâIn this environment, Ethernet VPN (EVPN)
  is a control plane technology that enables hosts (physical servers
  and VMs) to be placed anywhere in a network and remain connected to
  the same logical Layer 2 overlay network, and VXLAN creates the data
  plane for the Layer 2 overlay network.

## Using QFX5100, QFX5110, QFX5120, QFX5200, QFX5210, EX4300-48MP, and EX4600 Switches with VXLANs

You can configure the switches to perform all of the following
roles:

* (All switches except EX4300-48MP) In an environment without
  an SDN controller, act as a transit Layer 3 switch for downstream
  hosts acting as VTEPs. In this configuration, you do not need to configure
  any VXLAN functionality on the switch. You do need to configure IGMP
  and PIM so that the switch can form the multicast trees for the VXLAN
  multicast groups. (See [Manual VXLANs Require PIM](#mcast-vxlan) for more information.)
* (All switches except EX4300-48MP) In an environment with
  or without an SDN controller, act as a Layer 2 gateway between virtualized
  and nonvirtualized networks in the same data center or between data
  centers. For example, you can use the switch to connect a network
  that uses VXLANs to one that uses VLANs.
* (EX4300-48MP switches) Act as a Layer 2 gateway between
  virtualized and nonvirtualized networks in a campus network. For example,
  you can use the switch to connect a network that uses VXLANs to one
  that uses VLANs.
* (All switches except EX4300-48MP) Act as a Layer 2 gateway
  between virtualized networks in the same or different data centers
  and allow virtual machines to move (VMotion) between those networks
  and data centers. For example, if you want to allow VMotion between
  devices in two different networks, you can create the same VLAN in
  both networks and put both devices on that VLAN. The switches connected
  to these devices, acting as VTEPs, can map that VLAN to the same VXLAN,
  and the VXLAN traffic can then be routed between the two networks.
* (QFX5110 and QFX5120 switches with EVPN-VXLAN) Act as a Layer 3 gateway to route traffic between
  different VXLANs in the same data center.
* (QFX5110 and QFX5120 switches with EVPN-VXLAN) Act as a Layer 3 gateway to route traffic between
  different VXLANs in different data centers over a WAN or the Internet using
  standard routing protocols or virtual private LAN service (VPLS)
  tunnels.

Note:

If you want a QFX5110 or QFX5120 switch to be a Layer 3 VXLAN gateway in an EVPN-VXLAN
environment, you must configure integrated routing and bridging (IRB) interfaces
to connect the VXLANs, just as you do if you want to route traffic between
VLANs.

Because the additional headers add 50 to 54 bytes, you might
need to increase the MTU on a VTEP to accommodate larger packets.
For example, if the switch is using the default MTU value of 1514
bytes and you want to forward 1500-byte packets over the VXLAN, you
need to increase the MTU to allow for the increased packet size caused
by the additional headers.

## Changing the UDP Port on QFX5100, QFX5110, QFX5200, QFX5210, and EX4600 Switches

Starting with Junos
OS Release 14.1X53-D25 on QFX5100 switches, Junos OS Release 15.1X53-D210
on QFX5110 and QFX5200 switches, Junos OS Release 18.1R1 on QFX5210
switches, and Junos OS Release 18.2R1 on EX4600 switches, you can
configure the UDP port used as the destination port for VXLAN traffic. To configure the VXLAN destination port to be something other than
the default UDP port of 4789, enter the following statement:

`set protocols l2-learning destination-udp-port port-number`

The port you configure will be used for all VXLANs configured
on the switch.

Note:

If you make this change on one switch in a VXLAN, you
must make the same change on all the devices that terminate the VXLANs
configured on your switch. If you do not do so, traffic will be disrupted
for all the VXLANs configured on your switch. When you change the
UDP port, the previously learned remote VTEPs and remote MACs are
lost and VXLAN traffic is disrupted until the switch relearns the
remote VTEPs and remote MACs.

## Controlling Transit Multicast Traffic on QFX5100, QFX5110, QFX5200, QFX5210, and EX4600 Switches

When the switch acting as a VTEP receives a broadcast, unknown
unicast, or multicast packet, it performs the following actions on
the packet:

1. It de-encapsulates the packet and delivers it to the locally
   attached hosts.
2. It then adds the VXLAN encapsulation again and sends the
   packet to the other VTEPs in the VXLAN.

These actions are performed by the loopback interface used as
the VXLAN tunnel address and can, therefore, negatively impact the
bandwidth available to the VTEP. Starting with Junos OS Release 14.1X53-D30 for
QFX5100 switches, Junos OS Release 15.1X53-D210 for QFX5110 and QFX5200
switches, Junos OS Release 18.1R1 for QFX5210 switches, and Junos
OS Release 18.2R1 for EX4600 switches, if you know that there are
no multicast receivers attached to other VTEPs in the VXLAN that want
traffic for a specific multicast group, you can reduce the processing
load on the loopback interface by entering
the following statement:

```
set protocols l2-learning disable-vxlan-multicast-transit vxlan-multicast-group multicast-group
```

In this case, no traffic will be forwarded for the specified
group but all other multicast traffic will be forwarded. If you do
not want to forward any multicast traffic to other VTEPs in the VXLAN,
enter the following statement:

```
set protocols l2-learning disable-vxlan-multicast-transit vxlan-multicast-group all
```

## Using an MX Series Router, EX9200 Switch, or QFX10000 Switch as a VTEP

You can configure an MX Series router, EX9200 switch, or QFX10000
switch to act as a VTEP and perform all of the following roles:

* Act as a Layer 2 gateway between virtualized and nonvirtualized
  networks in the same data center or between data centers. For example,
  you can use an MX Series router to connect a network that uses VXLANs
  to one that uses VLANs.
* Act as a Layer 2 gateway between virtualized networks
  in the same or different data centers and allow virtual machines to
  move (VMotion) between those networks and data centers.
* Act as a Layer 3 gateway to route traffic between different
  VXLANs in the same data center.
* Act as a Layer 3 gateway to route traffic between different
  VXLANs in different data centers over a WAN or the Internet using
  standard routing protocols or virtual private LAN service (VPLS) tunnels.

Note:

If you want one of the devices described in this section
to be a VXLAN Layer 3 gateway, you must configure integrated routing
and bridging (IRB) interfaces to connect the VXLANs, just as you do
if you want to route traffic between VLANs.

## Manual VXLANs Require PIM

In an environment with a controller (such as a VMware NSX or
Juniper Networks Contrail controller), you can provision VXLANs on
a Juniper Networks device. A controller also provides a control plane
that VTEPs use to advertise their reachability and learn about the
reachability of other VTEPs. You can also manually create VXLANs on
Juniper Networks devices instead of using a controller. If you use
this approach, you must also configure Protocol Independent Multicast
(PIM) on the VTEPs so that they can create VXLAN tunnels between themselves.

You must also configure each VTEP in a given VXLAN to be a member
of the same multicast group. (If possible, you should assign a different
multicast group address to each VXLAN, although this is not required.
Multiple VXLANs can share the same multicast group.) The VTEPs can
then forward ARP requests they receive from their connected hosts
to the multicast group. The other VTEPs in the group de-encapsulate
the VXLAN information, and (assuming they are members of the same
VXLAN) they forward the ARP request to their connected hosts. When
the target host receives the ARP request, it responds with its MAC
address, and its VTEP forwards this ARP reply back to the source VTEP.
Through this process, the VTEPs learn the IP addresses of the other
VTEPs in the VXLAN and the MAC addresses of the hosts connected to
the other VTEPs.

The multicast groups and trees are also used to forward broadcast,
unknown unicast, and multicast (BUM) traffic between VTEPs. This prevents
BUM traffic from being unnecessarily flooded outside the VXLAN.

Note:

Multicast traffic that is forwarded through a VXLAN tunnel is sent only to the remote VTEPs in
the VXLAN. That is, the encapsulating VTEP does not copy and send copies of the
packets according to the multicast treeâit only forwards the received multicast
packets to the remote VTEPs. The remote VTEPs de-encapsulate the encapsulated
multicast packets and forward them to the appropriate Layer 2 interfaces.

## Load Balancing VXLAN Traffic

The Layer 3 routes that form VXLAN tunnels use per-packet load balancing by default, which means
that load balancing is implemented if there are ECMP paths to the remote VTEP. This
is different from normal routing behavior in which per-packet load balancing is not
used by default. (Normal routing uses per-prefix load balancing by default.)

The source port field in the UDP header is used to enable ECMP load balancing of the VXLAN
traffic in the Layer 3 network. This field is set to a hash of the inner packet
fields, which results in a variable that ECMP can use to distinguish between tunnels
(flows).

None of the other fields that flow-based ECMP normally uses are suitable for use with
VXLANs. All tunnels between the same two VTEPs have the same outer source and
destination IP addresses, and the UDP destination port is set to port 4789 by
definition. Therefore, none of these fields provide a sufficient way for ECMP to
differentiate flows.

## Enabling QFX5120 Switches to Tunnel Traffic on Core-Facing Layer 3 Tagged and IRB Interfaces

Note:

This section applies only to QFX5120 switches running
Junos OS Releases 18.4R1, 18.4R2, 18.4R2-S1 through 18.4R2-S3, 19.1R1,
19.1R2, 19.2Rx, and 19.3Rx.

When a QFX5120 switch attempts to tunnel traffic on core-facing
Layer 3 tagged interfaces or IRB interfaces, the switch drops the
packets. To avoid this issue, you can configure a simple two-term
filter-based firewall on the Layer 3 tagged or IRB interface.

Note:

QFX5120 switches support a maximum of 256 two-term filter-based
firewalls.

For example:

```
set interfaces et-0/0/3 unit 0 family inet filter input vxlan100
set firewall family inet filter vxlan100 term 1 from destination-address 192.168.0.1/24 then accept
set firewall family inet filter vxlan100 term 2 then routing-instance route1

```

Term 1 matches and accepts traffic that is destined for the
QFX5210 switch, which is identified by the source VTEP IP address
(192.168.0.1/24) assigned to the switch's loopback interface. For
term 1, note that when specifying an action, you can alternatively
count traffic instead of accepting it.

Term 2 matches and forwards all other data traffic to a routing
instance (route 1), which is configured interface et-0/0/3.

In this example, note that interface et-0/0/3 is referenced
by routing instance route1. As a result, you must include the `set firewall family inet filter vxlan100 term 2 then routing-instance
route1` command. Without this command, the firewall filter will
not work properly.

## Using ping and traceroute with a VXLAN

On QFX5100 and QFX5110 switches, you can use the `ping` and `traceroute` commands to troubleshoot traffic flow
through a VXLAN tunnel by including the `overlay` parameter
and various options. You use these options to force the `ping` or `traceroute` packets to follow the same path as data
packets through the VXLAN tunnel. In other words, you make the underlay
packets (`ping` and `traceroute`) take the same
route as the overlay packets (data traffic). See [ping overlay](../../../cli-reference/topics/ref/command/ping-overlay.html) and [traceroute overlay](../../../cli-reference/topics/ref/command/traceroute-overlay.html) for more information.

# Redundant Trunk Groups

## Understanding Redundant Trunk Links (Legacy RTG Configuration)

In a typical enterprise network composed of distribution
and access layers, a redundant trunk link provides a simple solution
for network recovery when a trunk port on a switch goes down. In that
case, traffic is routed to another trunk port, keeping network convergence
time to a minimum.

Note:

For information on redundant trunk link configurations
that include Q-in-Q support and use LAGs with link protection, see [Q-in-Q Support on Redundant Trunk Links Using LAGs
with Link Protection](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/topic-map/rtgs-on-lags.html).

To configure a redundant trunk link, create a redundant trunk
group. The redundant trunk group is configured on the access switch
and contains two links: a primary or active link, and a secondary
link. If the active link fails, the secondary link automatically starts
forwarding data traffic without waiting for normal spanning-tree protocol
convergence.

Data traffic is forwarded only on the active link. Data traffic
on the secondary link is dropped and shown as dropped packets when
you issue the operational mode command `show interfaces interface-name extensive`.

While data traffic is blocked on the secondary link, Layer 2
control traffic is still permitted. For example, an LLDP session can
be run between two switches on the secondary link.

Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) is enabled by default on
the switches to create a loop-free topology, but an interface is not
allowed to be in both a redundant trunk group and in a spanning-tree
protocol topology at the same time. You must disable RSTP on an interface
if a redundant trunk group is configured on that interface. For example,
in [Figure 1](#id-understanding-redundant-trunk-links-legacy-rtg-configuration__d103e47), in addition
to disabling RSTP on the Switch 3 interfaces, you must also disable
RSTP on the Switch 1 and Switch 2 interfaces connected to Switch 3.
Spanning-tree protocols can, however, continue operating on other
interfaces on those switchesâfor example on the link between
Switch 1 and Switch 2.

[Figure 1](#id-understanding-redundant-trunk-links-legacy-rtg-configuration__d103e47) shows three
switches in a basic topology for redundant trunk links. Switch 1 and
Switch 2 make up the distribution layer, and Switch 3 makes up the
access layer. Switch 3 is connected to the distribution layer through
trunk ports ge-0/0/9.0 (Link 1) and ge-0/0/10.0 (Link 2). Link 1 and
Link 2 are in a redundant trunk group called group1. Link 1 is designated
as the primary link. Traffic flows between Switch 3 in the access
layer and Switch 1 in the distribution layer through Link 1. While
Link 1 is active, Link 2 blocks traffic.

Figure 1: Redundant Trunk
Group, Link 1 Active![Redundant Trunk Group, Link 1 Active](../concept/../../images/g020016.gif)

[Figure 2](#id-understanding-redundant-trunk-links-legacy-rtg-configuration__d103e54) illustrates
how the redundant trunk link topology works when the primary link
goes down.

Figure 2: Redundant
Trunk Group, Link 2 Active![Redundant Trunk Group, Link 2 Active](../concept/../../images/g020017.gif)

When Link 1 between Switch 1 and Switch 3 goes down, Link 2
takes over as the active link. Traffic between the access layer and
the distribution layer is then automatically switched to Link 2 between
Switch 3 and Switch 2.

## Configuring Redundant Trunk Links for Faster Recovery on EX Series Switches

You can manage network convergence by configuring both
a primary link and a secondary link on an EX Series switch; this is
called a redundant trunk group (RTG). If the primary link in a redundant
trunk group fails, it passes its known MAC address locations to the
secondary link, which automatically takes over. You can configure
a maximum of 16 redundant trunk groups on most standalone switches
or on Virtual Chassis. The EX8200 switch and EX8200 Virtual Chassis,
however, support up to 254 redundant trunk groups.

Generally, you configure a redundant trunk group by configuring
one primary link (and its interface) and one unspecified link (and
its interface) to serve as the secondary link. A second type of redundant
trunk group, not shown in the procedure in this topic, consists of
two unspecified links (and their interfaces); in this case, neither
of the links is primary. In this second case, the software selects
an active link by comparing the port numbers of the two links and
activating the link with the higher port number. The procedure given
here describes configuring a primary/unspecified configuration for
a redundant trunk group because that configuration gives you more
control and is more commonly used.

Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) is enabled by default on
EX Series switches to create a loop-free topology, but an interface
is not allowed to be in both a redundant trunk group and in a spanning-tree
protocol topology at the same time.

A primary link takes over whenever it is able. You can, however,
alter the number of seconds that the primary link waits before reestablishing
control by configuring the primary linkâs preempt cutover timer.

Before you configure the redundant trunk group on the
switch, be sure you have:

* Disabled RSTP on all switches that will be linked to your
  redundant trunk group.
* Configured at least two interfaces with their port mode
  set to `trunk`; be sure that these two interfaces
  are not part of any existing RTG. See [Configuring Gigabit Ethernet Interfaces (CLI Procedure)](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/task/configuration/ex-series-gigabit-interfaces-cli.html) .

To configure a redundant trunk group on a switch:

1. Turn off RSTP:
   ```
   [edit]
   user@switch# set protocols rstp disable
   ```
2. Name the redundant trunk group while configuring one primary
   and one unspecified trunk interface:
   ```
   [edit ethernet-switching-options]
   user@switch# set redundant-trunk-group group name interface  interface-name primary
   user@switch# set redundant-trunk-group group name interface interface-name

   ```
3. (Optional) Change the length of time (from the default
   of 1 second) that a re-enabled primary link waits to take over from
   an active secondary link:
   ```
   [edit ethernet-switching-options]
   set redundant-trunk-group group name preempt-cutover-timer seconds
   ```

## Example: Configuring Redundant Trunk Links for Faster Recovery on Devices with ELS Support

Note:

This example uses Junos OS for EX Series switches or QFX
Series with support for the Enhanced Layer 2 Software (ELS) configuration
style.. For ELS details, see [Using the Enhanced Layer 2 Software CLI](layer-2-understanding.html#id-using-the-enhanced-layer-2-software-cli).

You can manage network convergence by configuring both a primary link and a secondary link on a
switch; this is called a redundant trunk group (RTG). If the primary link in a redundant
trunk group fails, it passes its known MAC address locations to the secondary link,
which automatically takes over after one minute.

This example describes how to create a redundant trunk group
with a primary and a secondary link:

* [Disabling RSTP on Switches 1 and 2](#d105e212)
* [Configuring Redundant Trunk Links on Switch 3](#d105e256)
* [Verification](#d105e324)

### Requirements

This example uses the following hardware and software
components:

* Two EX Series or QFX Series distribution switches
* One EX Series or QFX Series access switch
* The appropriate software release for your platform:

  + For EX Series switches: Junos OS Release 13.2X50-D10 or
    later
  + For the QFX Series: Junos OS Release 13.2X50-D15 or later

Before you configure the redundant trunk links network
on the access and distribution switches, be sure you have:

* Configured interfaces ge-0/0/9 and ge-0/0/10 on the access
  switch, Switch 3, as trunk interfaces.
* Configured one trunk interface on each distribution switch,
  Switch 1 and Switch 2.
* Connected the three switches as shown in the topology
  for this example (see [Figure 3](#d105e66__d105e111)).

### Overview and Topology

In a typical enterprise network composed of distribution and access layers, a redundant trunk
link provides a simple solution for trunk interface network recovery. When a trunk
interface fails, data traffic is routed to another trunk interface after one second,
thereby keeping network convergence time to a minimum.

This example shows the configuration of a redundant trunk group that includes one primary link
(and its interface) and one unspecified link (and its interface) that serves as the
secondary link.

A second type of redundant trunk group, not illustrated in the
example, consists of two unspecified links (and their interfaces);
in this case, neither of the links is primary. The software selects
an active link by comparing the port numbers of the two links and
activating the link with the higher port number. For example, if the
two link interfaces use interfaces ge-0/1/0 and ge-0/1/1, the software
activates ge-0/1/1. (In the interface names, the final number is the
port number.)

#### Topology

The two links in a redundant trunk group generally operate the same way, whether
they are configured as primary/unspecified or unspecified/unspecified. Data
traffic initially passes through the active link but is blocked on the inactive
link. While data traffic is blocked on the secondary link, note that Layer 2
control traffic is still permitted if the link is active. For example, an LLDP
session can be run between two switches on the secondary link.
If
the active link either goes down or is disabled administratively, MAC refresh
packets (for the MAC addresses that are learnt on the other ports of the VLAN)
are sent over the new active link, so that the peer device connected to this new
active link learns these MAC addresses and starts forwarding traffic towards the
new active link.

The one difference in operation between the two types of redundant trunk groups
occurs when a primary link is active, goes down, is replaced by the secondary
link, and then reactivates. When a primary link is re-enabled while the
secondary link is active, the primary link waits 1 second (you can change the
time interval by using the preempt cutover timer to accommodate your network)
and then takes over as the active link. In other words, the primary link has
priority and is always activated if it is available. This differs from the
behavior of two unspecified links, both of which act as equals. Because the
unspecified links are equal, the active link remains active until it either goes
down or is disabled administratively.

The example given here illustrates a primary/unspecified configuration for a
redundant trunk group because that configuration gives you more control and is
more commonly used.

Note:

Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) is enabled by default on the switches to
create a loop-free topology, but an interface is not allowed to be in both a
redundant trunk group and in a spanning-tree protocol topology at the same
time. You will need to disable RSTP on the two distribution switches in the
example, Switch 1 and Switch 2. Spanning-tree protocols can, however,
continue operating in other parts of the networkâfor example, between the
distribution switches and also in links between distribution switches and
the enterprise core.

[Figure 3](#d105e66__d105e111) displays an
example topology containing three switches. SwitchÂ 1 and SwitchÂ  2 make up the
distribution layer, and SwitchÂ 3 makes up the access layer. SwitchÂ  3 is
connected to the distribution layer through trunk interfaces ge-0/0/9.0 (LinkÂ 1)
and ge-0/0/10.0 (Link 2).

[Table 1](#d105e66__d105e119) lists the
components used in this redundant trunk group.

Because RSTP and RTGs cannot operate simultaneously on a switch, you disable RSTP
on Switch 1 and Switch 2 in the first configuration task, and you disable RSTP
on Switch 3 in the second task.

The second configuration task creates a redundant trunk group called example 1 on
Switch 3. The trunk interfaces ge-0/0/9.0 and ge-0/0/10.0 are the two links
configured in the second configuration task. You configure the trunk interface
ge-0/0/9.0 as the primary link. You configure the trunk interface ge-0/0/10.0 as
an unspecified link, which becomes the secondary link by default.

 set switch-options redundant-trunk-group group rtg0 interface ge-0/0/9.0 primary
 set switch-options redundant-trunk-group group rtg0 interface ge-0/0/10.0
 set redundant-trunk-group group rtg0 preempt-cutover-timer 60
```
##### Step-by-Step Procedure

Configure the redundant trunk group rtg0 on Switch 3.

1. Turn off RSTP:

   ```
   [edit]
   user@switch# set protocols rstp disable
   ```
2. Name the redundant trunk group rtg0 while configuring trunk interface ge-0/0/9.0 as the
   primary link and ge-0/0/10 as an unspecified link to serve as the
   secondary link:

   ```
   [edit switch-options]

   user@switch#  set redundant-trunk-group group rtg0 interface ge-0/0/10.0
   ```
3. (Optional) Change the time interval (from the default
   of 1 second) that a re-enabled primary link waits to take over for
   an active secondary link:

   ```
   [edit switch-options]
   user@switch#  set switch-options redundant-trunk-group group rtg0 preempt-cutover-timer 60
   ```
##### Results

Check the results of the configuration:

```
[edit]
user@switch# show
switch-options
    redundant-trunk-group {
        group rtg0 {
            preempt-cutover-timer 60;

            interface ge-0/0/9.0 {
                primary;
            }
            interface ge-0/0/10.0;
        }
    }
protocols {
rstp {

        disable;
    }
}

```

### Verification

To confirm that the configuration is set up
correctly, perform this task:

#### Verifying That a Redundant Trunk Group Was Created

* [Purpose](#d105e324__d50688e500)
* [Action](#d105e324__d50688e505)
* [Meaning](#d105e324__d50688e515)

##### Purpose

Verify that the redundant trunk group rtg0 has been
created on Switch 1 and that trunk interfaces are members of the redundant
trunk group.

##### Action

List all redundant trunk groups configured on the switch:

```
user@switch> show redundant-trunk-group
Group      Interface   State       Time of last flap           Flap
name                                                           count

rtg0       ge-0/0/9.0  Up/Pri      Never                         0
           ge-0/0/10.0 Up          Never                         0

```
##### Meaning

The `show redundant-trunk-group` command lists
all redundant trunk groups configured on the switch as well as the
interface names and their current states (up or down for an unspecified
link, and up or down and primary for a primary link). For this configuration
example, the output shows that the redundant trunk group rtg0 is configured
on the switch. The `Up` beside the interfaces indicates that
both link cables are physically connected. The `Pri` beside
trunk interface ge-0/0/9.0 indicates that it is configured as the
primary link.

## Example: Configuring Redundant Trunk Links for Faster Recovery on EX Series Switches

Note:

This example uses Junos OS for EX Series switches that
does not support the Enhanced Layer 2 Software (ELS) configuration
style. If your switch runs software that supports ELS, see [Example: Configuring Redundant Trunk Links for Faster
Recovery on Devices with ELS Support](redundant-trunk-groups.html#id-example-configuring-redundant-trunk-links-for-faster-recovery-on-devices-with-els-support). For ELS details,
see [Using the Enhanced Layer 2 Software CLI](layer-2-understanding.html#id-using-the-enhanced-layer-2-software-cli).

You can manage network convergence by configuring both a primary
link and a secondary link on a switch; this is called a redundant
trunk group (RTG). If the primary link in a redundant trunk group
fails, it passes its known MAC address locations to the secondary
link, which automatically takes over after one minute.

This example describes how to create a redundant trunk group
with a primary and a secondary link:

* [Disabling RSTP on Switches 1 and 2](#d106e189)
* [Configuring Redundant Trunk Links on Switch 3](#d106e233)
* [Verification](#d106e317)

### Requirements

This example uses the following hardware and software
components:

* Two EX Series distribution switches
* One EX Series access switch
* Junos OS Release 10.4 or later for EX Series switches

Before you configure the redundant trunk links network
on the access and distribution switches, be sure you have:

* Configured interfaces `ge-0/0/9` and `ge-0/0/10` on the access switch, Switch
  3, as trunk interfaces. See [Configuring
  Gigabit Ethernet Interfaces (CLI Procedure)](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/task/configuration/ex-series-gigabit-interfaces-cli.html).
* Configured one trunk interface on each distribution switch,
  Switch 1 and Switch 2.
* Connected the three switches as shown in the topology
  for this example (see [Figure 4](#d106e71__d106e133)).

### Overview and Topology

In a typical enterprise network composed of distribution and access layers, a redundant trunk
link provides a simple solution for trunk interface network recovery. When a trunk
interface fails, data traffic is routed to another trunk interface after one second,
thereby keeping network convergence time to a minimum.

This example shows the configuration of a redundant trunk group
that includes one primary link (and its interface) and one unspecified
link (and its interface) that serves as the secondary link.

A second type of redundant trunk group, not illustrated in the
example, consists of two unspecified links (and their interfaces);
in this case, neither of the links is primary. In this second case,
the software selects an active link by comparing the port numbers
of the two links and activating the link with the higher port number.
For example, if the two link interfaces use interfaces ge-0/1/0 and ge-0/1/1, the software activates ge-0/1/1. (In the interface names, the final number is the port number.)

#### Topology

The two links in a redundant trunk group generally operate the same way, whether they are
configured as primary/unspecified or unspecified/unspecified. Data traffic
initially passes through the active link but is blocked on the inactive link.
While data traffic is blocked on the secondary link, note that Layer 2 control
traffic is still permitted if the link is active. For example, an LLDP session
can be run between two switches on the secondary link.
If
the active link either goes down or is disabled administratively, MAC refresh
packets (for the MAC addresses that are learnt on the other ports of the VLAN)
are sent over the new active link, so that the peer device connected to this new
active link learns these MAC addresses and starts forwarding traffic towards the
new active link.

The one difference in operation between the two types of redundant trunk groups occurs when a
primary link is active, goes down, is replaced by the secondary link, and then
reactivates. When a primary link is re-enabled while the secondary link is
active, the primary link waits 1 second (you can change the length of time using
the preempt cutover timer to accommodate your network) and then takes over as
the active link. In other words, the primary link has priority and is always
activated if it is available. This differs from the behavior of two unspecified
links, which act as equals. Because the unspecified links are equal, the active
link remains active until it either goes down or is disabled
administratively.

The example given here illustrates a primary/unspecified configuration
for a redundant trunk group because that configuration gives you more
control and is more commonly used.

Note:

Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) is enabled by default
on EX Series switches to create a loop-free topology, but an interface
is not allowed to be in both a redundant trunk group and in a spanning-tree
protocol topology at the same time. You will need to disable RSTP
on the two distribution switches in the example, Switch 1 and Switch
2. Spanning-tree protocols can, however, continue operating in other
parts of the networkâfor example, between the distribution switches
and also in links between distribution switches and the enterprise
core.

[Figure 4](#d106e71__d106e133) displays an
example topology containing three switches. SwitchÂ 1 and SwitchÂ
2 make up the distribution layer, and SwitchÂ 3 makes up the access
layer. SwitchÂ  3 is connected to the distribution layer through
trunk interfaces ge-0/0/9.0 (Link 1) and ge-0/0/10.0 (Link 2).

[Table 2](#d106e71__d106e137) lists the components
used in this redundant trunk group.

Because RSTP and RTGs cannot operate simultaneously on a switch,
you disable RSTP on Switch 1 and Switch 2 in the first configuration
task, and you disable RSTP on Switch 3 in the second task.

The second configuration task creates a redundant trunk group
called `example 1` on Switch 3. The trunk
interfaces `ge-0/0/9.0` and `ge-0/0/10.0` are the two links configured in the second
configuration task. You configure the trunk interface `ge-0/0/9.0` as the primary link. You configure the trunk
interface `ge-0/0/10.0` as an unspecified
link, which becomes the secondary link by default.

### Verification

To confirm that the configuration is set up
correctly, perform this task:

#### Verifying That a Redundant Trunk Group Was Created

* [Purpose](#d106e317__d50688e851)
* [Action](#d106e317__d50688e859)
* [Meaning](#d106e317__d50688e869)

##### Purpose

Verify that the redundant trunk group example1 has been created on Switch 1 and that trunk interfaces are members
of the redundant trunk group.

##### Action

List all redundant trunk groups configured on the switch:

```
user@switch> show redundant-trunk-group
Group      Interface   State       Time of last flap           Flap
name                                                           count

example1   ge-0/0/9.0  Up/Pri      Never                         0
           ge-0/0/10.0 Up          Never                         0

```
##### Meaning

The `show redundant-trunk-group` command lists
all redundant trunk groups configured on the switch, both linksâ
interface addresses, and the linksâ current states (up or down
for an unspecified link, and up or down and primary for a primary
link). For this configuration example, the output shows that the redundant
trunk group example1 is configured on the switch. The (Up) beside the interfaces indicates that both link cables are
physically connected. The (Pri) beside trunk interface ge-0/0/9.0 indicates that it is configured as the primary link.
