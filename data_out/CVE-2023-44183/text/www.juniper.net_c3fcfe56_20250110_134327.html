# Redundant Trunk Groups

## Understanding Redundant Trunk Links (Legacy RTG Configuration)

In a typical enterprise network composed of distribution
and access layers, a redundant trunk link provides a simple solution
for network recovery when a trunk port on a switch goes down. In that
case, traffic is routed to another trunk port, keeping network convergence
time to a minimum.

Note:

For information on redundant trunk link configurations
that include Q-in-Q support and use LAGs with link protection, see [Q-in-Q Support on Redundant Trunk Links Using LAGs
with Link Protection](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/topic-map/rtgs-on-lags.html).

To configure a redundant trunk link, create a redundant trunk
group. The redundant trunk group is configured on the access switch
and contains two links: a primary or active link, and a secondary
link. If the active link fails, the secondary link automatically starts
forwarding data traffic without waiting for normal spanning-tree protocol
convergence.

Data traffic is forwarded only on the active link. Data traffic
on the secondary link is dropped and shown as dropped packets when
you issue the operational mode command `show interfaces interface-name extensive`.

While data traffic is blocked on the secondary link, Layer 2
control traffic is still permitted. For example, an LLDP session can
be run between two switches on the secondary link.

Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) is enabled by default on
the switches to create a loop-free topology, but an interface is not
allowed to be in both a redundant trunk group and in a spanning-tree
protocol topology at the same time. You must disable RSTP on an interface
if a redundant trunk group is configured on that interface. For example,
in [Figure 1](#id-understanding-redundant-trunk-links-legacy-rtg-configuration__d103e47), in addition
to disabling RSTP on the Switch 3 interfaces, you must also disable
RSTP on the Switch 1 and Switch 2 interfaces connected to Switch 3.
Spanning-tree protocols can, however, continue operating on other
interfaces on those switchesâfor example on the link between
Switch 1 and Switch 2.

[Figure 1](#id-understanding-redundant-trunk-links-legacy-rtg-configuration__d103e47) shows three
switches in a basic topology for redundant trunk links. Switch 1 and
Switch 2 make up the distribution layer, and Switch 3 makes up the
access layer. Switch 3 is connected to the distribution layer through
trunk ports ge-0/0/9.0 (Link 1) and ge-0/0/10.0 (Link 2). Link 1 and
Link 2 are in a redundant trunk group called group1. Link 1 is designated
as the primary link. Traffic flows between Switch 3 in the access
layer and Switch 1 in the distribution layer through Link 1. While
Link 1 is active, Link 2 blocks traffic.

Figure 1: Redundant Trunk
Group, Link 1 Active![Redundant Trunk Group, Link 1 Active](../concept/../../images/g020016.gif)

[Figure 2](#id-understanding-redundant-trunk-links-legacy-rtg-configuration__d103e54) illustrates
how the redundant trunk link topology works when the primary link
goes down.

Figure 2: Redundant
Trunk Group, Link 2 Active![Redundant Trunk Group, Link 2 Active](../concept/../../images/g020017.gif)

When Link 1 between Switch 1 and Switch 3 goes down, Link 2
takes over as the active link. Traffic between the access layer and
the distribution layer is then automatically switched to Link 2 between
Switch 3 and Switch 2.

## Configuring Redundant Trunk Links for Faster Recovery on EX Series Switches

You can manage network convergence by configuring both
a primary link and a secondary link on an EX Series switch; this is
called a redundant trunk group (RTG). If the primary link in a redundant
trunk group fails, it passes its known MAC address locations to the
secondary link, which automatically takes over. You can configure
a maximum of 16 redundant trunk groups on most standalone switches
or on Virtual Chassis. The EX8200 switch and EX8200 Virtual Chassis,
however, support up to 254 redundant trunk groups.

Generally, you configure a redundant trunk group by configuring
one primary link (and its interface) and one unspecified link (and
its interface) to serve as the secondary link. A second type of redundant
trunk group, not shown in the procedure in this topic, consists of
two unspecified links (and their interfaces); in this case, neither
of the links is primary. In this second case, the software selects
an active link by comparing the port numbers of the two links and
activating the link with the higher port number. The procedure given
here describes configuring a primary/unspecified configuration for
a redundant trunk group because that configuration gives you more
control and is more commonly used.

Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) is enabled by default on
EX Series switches to create a loop-free topology, but an interface
is not allowed to be in both a redundant trunk group and in a spanning-tree
protocol topology at the same time.

A primary link takes over whenever it is able. You can, however,
alter the number of seconds that the primary link waits before reestablishing
control by configuring the primary linkâs preempt cutover timer.

Before you configure the redundant trunk group on the
switch, be sure you have:

* Disabled RSTP on all switches that will be linked to your
  redundant trunk group.
* Configured at least two interfaces with their port mode
  set to `trunk`; be sure that these two interfaces
  are not part of any existing RTG. See [Configuring Gigabit Ethernet Interfaces (CLI Procedure)](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/task/configuration/ex-series-gigabit-interfaces-cli.html) .

To configure a redundant trunk group on a switch:

1. Turn off RSTP:
   ```
   [edit]
   user@switch# set protocols rstp disable
   ```
2. Name the redundant trunk group while configuring one primary
   and one unspecified trunk interface:
   ```
   [edit ethernet-switching-options]
   user@switch# set redundant-trunk-group group name interface  interface-name primary
   user@switch# set redundant-trunk-group group name interface interface-name

   ```
3. (Optional) Change the length of time (from the default
   of 1 second) that a re-enabled primary link waits to take over from
   an active secondary link:
   ```
   [edit ethernet-switching-options]
   set redundant-trunk-group group name preempt-cutover-timer seconds
   ```

## Example: Configuring Redundant Trunk Links for Faster Recovery on Devices with ELS Support

Note:

This example uses Junos OS for EX Series switches or QFX
Series with support for the Enhanced Layer 2 Software (ELS) configuration
style.. For ELS details, see [Using the Enhanced Layer 2 Software CLI](layer-2-understanding.html#id-using-the-enhanced-layer-2-software-cli).

You can manage network convergence by configuring both a primary link and a secondary link on a
switch; this is called a redundant trunk group (RTG). If the primary link in a redundant
trunk group fails, it passes its known MAC address locations to the secondary link,
which automatically takes over after one minute.

This example describes how to create a redundant trunk group
with a primary and a secondary link:

* [Overview and Topology](#d105e66)
* [Disabling RSTP on Switches 1 and 2](#d105e212)
* [Configuring Redundant Trunk Links on Switch 3](#d105e256)
* [Verification](#d105e324)

### Requirements

This example uses the following hardware and software
components:

* Two EX Series or QFX Series distribution switches
* One EX Series or QFX Series access switch
* The appropriate software release for your platform:

  + For EX Series switches: Junos OS Release 13.2X50-D10 or
    later
  + For the QFX Series: Junos OS Release 13.2X50-D15 or later

Before you configure the redundant trunk links network
on the access and distribution switches, be sure you have:

* Configured interfaces ge-0/0/9 and ge-0/0/10 on the access
  switch, Switch 3, as trunk interfaces.
* Configured one trunk interface on each distribution switch,
  Switch 1 and Switch 2.
* Connected the three switches as shown in the topology
  for this example (see [Figure 3](#d105e66__d105e111)).

### Overview and Topology

In a typical enterprise network composed of distribution and access layers, a redundant trunk
link provides a simple solution for trunk interface network recovery. When a trunk
interface fails, data traffic is routed to another trunk interface after one second,
thereby keeping network convergence time to a minimum.

This example shows the configuration of a redundant trunk group that includes one primary link
(and its interface) and one unspecified link (and its interface) that serves as the
secondary link.

A second type of redundant trunk group, not illustrated in the
example, consists of two unspecified links (and their interfaces);
in this case, neither of the links is primary. The software selects
an active link by comparing the port numbers of the two links and
activating the link with the higher port number. For example, if the
two link interfaces use interfaces ge-0/1/0 and ge-0/1/1, the software
activates ge-0/1/1. (In the interface names, the final number is the
port number.)

#### Topology

The two links in a redundant trunk group generally operate the same way, whether
they are configured as primary/unspecified or unspecified/unspecified. Data
traffic initially passes through the active link but is blocked on the inactive
link. While data traffic is blocked on the secondary link, note that Layer 2
control traffic is still permitted if the link is active. For example, an LLDP
session can be run between two switches on the secondary link.
If
the active link either goes down or is disabled administratively, MAC refresh
packets (for the MAC addresses that are learnt on the other ports of the VLAN)
are sent over the new active link, so that the peer device connected to this new
active link learns these MAC addresses and starts forwarding traffic towards the
new active link.

The one difference in operation between the two types of redundant trunk groups
occurs when a primary link is active, goes down, is replaced by the secondary
link, and then reactivates. When a primary link is re-enabled while the
secondary link is active, the primary link waits 1 second (you can change the
time interval by using the preempt cutover timer to accommodate your network)
and then takes over as the active link. In other words, the primary link has
priority and is always activated if it is available. This differs from the
behavior of two unspecified links, both of which act as equals. Because the
unspecified links are equal, the active link remains active until it either goes
down or is disabled administratively.

The example given here illustrates a primary/unspecified configuration for a
redundant trunk group because that configuration gives you more control and is
more commonly used.

Note:

Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) is enabled by default on the switches to
create a loop-free topology, but an interface is not allowed to be in both a
redundant trunk group and in a spanning-tree protocol topology at the same
time. You will need to disable RSTP on the two distribution switches in the
example, Switch 1 and Switch 2. Spanning-tree protocols can, however,
continue operating in other parts of the networkâfor example, between the
distribution switches and also in links between distribution switches and
the enterprise core.

[Figure 3](#d105e66__d105e111) displays an
example topology containing three switches. SwitchÂ 1 and SwitchÂ  2 make up the
distribution layer, and SwitchÂ 3 makes up the access layer. SwitchÂ  3 is
connected to the distribution layer through trunk interfaces ge-0/0/9.0 (LinkÂ 1)
and ge-0/0/10.0 (Link 2).

[Table 1](#d105e66__d105e119) lists the
components used in this redundant trunk group.

Because RSTP and RTGs cannot operate simultaneously on a switch, you disable RSTP
on Switch 1 and Switch 2 in the first configuration task, and you disable RSTP
on Switch 3 in the second task.

The second configuration task creates a redundant trunk group called example 1 on
Switch 3. The trunk interfaces ge-0/0/9.0 and ge-0/0/10.0 are the two links
configured in the second configuration task. You configure the trunk interface
ge-0/0/9.0 as the primary link. You configure the trunk interface ge-0/0/10.0 as
an unspecified link, which becomes the secondary link by default.

   user@switch#  set switch-options redundant-trunk-group group rtg0 preempt-cutover-timer 60
   ```

            interface ge-0/0/9.0 {
                primary;
            }
            interface ge-0/0/10.0;
        }
    }
protocols {
rstp {

        disable;
    }
}

```

### Verification

To confirm that the configuration is set up
correctly, perform this task:

#### Verifying That a Redundant Trunk Group Was Created

* [Purpose](#d105e324__d50688e500)
* [Action](#d105e324__d50688e505)
* [Meaning](#d105e324__d50688e515)

##### Purpose

Verify that the redundant trunk group rtg0 has been
created on Switch 1 and that trunk interfaces are members of the redundant
trunk group.

##### Action

List all redundant trunk groups configured on the switch:

```
user@switch> show redundant-trunk-group
Group      Interface   State       Time of last flap           Flap
name                                                           count

rtg0       ge-0/0/9.0  Up/Pri      Never                         0
           ge-0/0/10.0 Up          Never                         0

```
##### Meaning

The `show redundant-trunk-group` command lists
all redundant trunk groups configured on the switch as well as the
interface names and their current states (up or down for an unspecified
link, and up or down and primary for a primary link). For this configuration
example, the output shows that the redundant trunk group rtg0 is configured
on the switch. The `Up` beside the interfaces indicates that
both link cables are physically connected. The `Pri` beside
trunk interface ge-0/0/9.0 indicates that it is configured as the
primary link.

## Example: Configuring Redundant Trunk Links for Faster Recovery on EX Series Switches

Note:

This example uses Junos OS for EX Series switches that
does not support the Enhanced Layer 2 Software (ELS) configuration
style. If your switch runs software that supports ELS, see [Example: Configuring Redundant Trunk Links for Faster
Recovery on Devices with ELS Support](redundant-trunk-groups.html#id-example-configuring-redundant-trunk-links-for-faster-recovery-on-devices-with-els-support). For ELS details,
see [Using the Enhanced Layer 2 Software CLI](layer-2-understanding.html#id-using-the-enhanced-layer-2-software-cli).

You can manage network convergence by configuring both a primary
link and a secondary link on a switch; this is called a redundant
trunk group (RTG). If the primary link in a redundant trunk group
fails, it passes its known MAC address locations to the secondary
link, which automatically takes over after one minute.

This example describes how to create a redundant trunk group
with a primary and a secondary link:

* [Disabling RSTP on Switches 1 and 2](#d106e189)
* [Configuring Redundant Trunk Links on Switch 3](#d106e233)
* [Verification](#d106e317)

### Requirements

This example uses the following hardware and software
components:

* Two EX Series distribution switches
* One EX Series access switch
* Junos OS Release 10.4 or later for EX Series switches

Before you configure the redundant trunk links network
on the access and distribution switches, be sure you have:

* Configured interfaces `ge-0/0/9` and `ge-0/0/10` on the access switch, Switch
  3, as trunk interfaces. See [Configuring
  Gigabit Ethernet Interfaces (CLI Procedure)](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/task/configuration/ex-series-gigabit-interfaces-cli.html).
* Configured one trunk interface on each distribution switch,
  Switch 1 and Switch 2.
* Connected the three switches as shown in the topology
  for this example (see [Figure 4](#d106e71__d106e133)).

### Overview and Topology

In a typical enterprise network composed of distribution and access layers, a redundant trunk
link provides a simple solution for trunk interface network recovery. When a trunk
interface fails, data traffic is routed to another trunk interface after one second,
thereby keeping network convergence time to a minimum.

This example shows the configuration of a redundant trunk group
that includes one primary link (and its interface) and one unspecified
link (and its interface) that serves as the secondary link.

A second type of redundant trunk group, not illustrated in the
example, consists of two unspecified links (and their interfaces);
in this case, neither of the links is primary. In this second case,
the software selects an active link by comparing the port numbers
of the two links and activating the link with the higher port number.
For example, if the two link interfaces use interfaces ge-0/1/0 and ge-0/1/1, the software activates ge-0/1/1. (In the interface names, the final number is the port number.)

#### Topology

The two links in a redundant trunk group generally operate the same way, whether they are
configured as primary/unspecified or unspecified/unspecified. Data traffic
initially passes through the active link but is blocked on the inactive link.
While data traffic is blocked on the secondary link, note that Layer 2 control
traffic is still permitted if the link is active. For example, an LLDP session
can be run between two switches on the secondary link.
If
the active link either goes down or is disabled administratively, MAC refresh
packets (for the MAC addresses that are learnt on the other ports of the VLAN)
are sent over the new active link, so that the peer device connected to this new
active link learns these MAC addresses and starts forwarding traffic towards the
new active link.

The one difference in operation between the two types of redundant trunk groups occurs when a
primary link is active, goes down, is replaced by the secondary link, and then
reactivates. When a primary link is re-enabled while the secondary link is
active, the primary link waits 1 second (you can change the length of time using
the preempt cutover timer to accommodate your network) and then takes over as
the active link. In other words, the primary link has priority and is always
activated if it is available. This differs from the behavior of two unspecified
links, which act as equals. Because the unspecified links are equal, the active
link remains active until it either goes down or is disabled
administratively.

The example given here illustrates a primary/unspecified configuration
for a redundant trunk group because that configuration gives you more
control and is more commonly used.

Note:

Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) is enabled by default
on EX Series switches to create a loop-free topology, but an interface
is not allowed to be in both a redundant trunk group and in a spanning-tree
protocol topology at the same time. You will need to disable RSTP
on the two distribution switches in the example, Switch 1 and Switch
2. Spanning-tree protocols can, however, continue operating in other
parts of the networkâfor example, between the distribution switches
and also in links between distribution switches and the enterprise
core.

[Figure 4](#d106e71__d106e133) displays an
example topology containing three switches. SwitchÂ 1 and SwitchÂ
2 make up the distribution layer, and SwitchÂ 3 makes up the access
layer. SwitchÂ  3 is connected to the distribution layer through
trunk interfaces ge-0/0/9.0 (Link 1) and ge-0/0/10.0 (Link 2).

[Table 2](#d106e71__d106e137) lists the components
used in this redundant trunk group.

Because RSTP and RTGs cannot operate simultaneously on a switch,
you disable RSTP on Switch 1 and Switch 2 in the first configuration
task, and you disable RSTP on Switch 3 in the second task.

The second configuration task creates a redundant trunk group
called `example 1` on Switch 3. The trunk
interfaces `ge-0/0/9.0` and `ge-0/0/10.0` are the two links configured in the second
configuration task. You configure the trunk interface `ge-0/0/9.0` as the primary link. You configure the trunk
interface `ge-0/0/10.0` as an unspecified
link, which becomes the secondary link by default.

### Verification

To confirm that the configuration is set up
correctly, perform this task:

#### Verifying That a Redundant Trunk Group Was Created

* [Purpose](#d106e317__d50688e851)
* [Action](#d106e317__d50688e859)
* [Meaning](#d106e317__d50688e869)

##### Purpose

Verify that the redundant trunk group example1 has been created on Switch 1 and that trunk interfaces are members
of the redundant trunk group.

##### Action

List all redundant trunk groups configured on the switch:

```
user@switch> show redundant-trunk-group
Group      Interface   State       Time of last flap           Flap
name                                                           count

example1   ge-0/0/9.0  Up/Pri      Never                         0
           ge-0/0/10.0 Up          Never                         0

```
##### Meaning

The `show redundant-trunk-group` command lists
all redundant trunk groups configured on the switch, both linksâ
interface addresses, and the linksâ current states (up or down
for an unspecified link, and up or down and primary for a primary
link). For this configuration example, the output shows that the redundant
trunk group example1 is configured on the switch. The (Up) beside the interfaces indicates that both link cables are
physically connected. The (Pri) beside trunk interface ge-0/0/9.0 indicates that it is configured as the primary link.
