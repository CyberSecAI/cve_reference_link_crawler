Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the SiteGuard WP Plugin's "Rename Login Function". While the plugin attempts to prevent redirection to the modified login path from URLs like `/wp-activate.php` and `/wp-signup.php`, it fails to do so when accessing `/wp-register.php`. This oversight allows the modified login path to be revealed via redirection when accessing `/wp-register.php` or `/anypath/wp-register.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leakage:** The core vulnerability is that the customized login path (renamed from the default `wp-login.php`) is exposed through an unintended redirection.
- **Missing Redirection Prevention:** Specifically, the plugin failed to prevent redirection when accessing `wp-register.php`. This is a classic case of incomplete input sanitization and validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of Modified Login Path:** The primary impact is the leakage of the custom login path. This information can be used by attackers to bypass the intended security measure of renaming the login URL.
- **Increased Risk of Login Attempts:** The leaked login path makes the site vulnerable to targeted login attempts, including brute-force and credential stuffing attacks, as attackers can now directly target the renamed login path.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Request to `/wp-register.php`:** Attackers can trigger the vulnerability by sending a request to `/wp-register.php` or `/anypath/wp-register.php`, which will redirect to the modified login URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Special Privileges Needed:** No prior authentication or special user access is required.
- **Network Access:** Attackers only need network access to the vulnerable website to send the malicious request.
- **Knowledge of WordPress Structure:** Some understanding of WordPress's default file structure is beneficial to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability exists due to missing input validation on the `wp-register.php` path, causing a redirect to the modified login path.
- The issue was reported by Mr. Yuta Watanabe of STNet Corporation.
- The fix involves updating the plugin to version 1.7.7 or later, which includes the missing redirection check for `wp-register.php`.
- The CVSS score is 5.3, with the vector of `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`
