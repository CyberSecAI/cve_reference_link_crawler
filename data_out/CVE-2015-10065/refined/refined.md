Based on the provided commit message "fixed overflow vulnerability" and the code diff, here's the breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The original code used `fscanf(f, "%s", buff)` to read a string into a fixed-size buffer `buff` of 256 bytes. If the input from the file `f` was longer than 255 characters (plus null terminator), a buffer overflow would occur.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic stack-based buffer overflow due to the use of `fscanf` with `%s` format specifier into a fixed-size buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** A successful buffer overflow can allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory locations on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of service:** Even if code execution isn't achieved, the overflow can corrupt the program's state leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is triggered when the program reads data from a file (`f`) using `fscanf` .
-  The input file could be crafted to contain a string longer than 255 bytes to exploit the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs control over the input file being processed by the vulnerable code.
- They need the ability to inject data into the file that will cause the overflow.

**Code Changes:**

The commit fixes the vulnerability by replacing the vulnerable line:
```c
n = fscanf(f, "%s", buff);
```
with
```c
fgets(buff, 256, f);
```
`fgets` reads a maximum of 255 bytes from the file into `buff` (plus null terminator), preventing the overflow.
