The provided content describes a vulnerability related to TCP hijacking in NAT-enabled Wi-Fi networks. This vulnerability is not directly described in the CVE description, but the content does relate to a vulnerability that affects network security.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a side-channel leakage in the NAT port preservation strategy and an insufficient reverse path validation strategy of Wi-Fi routers.
*   Additionally, the vulnerability is exacerbated by the routers' disabling of the TCP window tracking strategy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NAT Port Preservation Side Channel:** The NAT port preservation strategy leaks information that allows an attacker to infer TCP connections.
*   **Insufficient Reverse Path Validation:** Routers lack proper validation of the reverse path, allowing attackers to send spoofed packets.
*   **Disabled TCP Window Tracking:** Routers, in many cases, disable TCP window tracking, which is necessary for proper stateful packet handling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **TCP Connection Interception:** The attacker can intercept TCP packets from the server.
*   **Sequence and Acknowledgment Number Acquisition:** The attacker obtains sequence and acknowledgment numbers through intercepted packets.
*   **Forced Connection Termination:** The attacker can forcibly close the TCP connection.
*   **Plaintext Traffic Poisoning:** The attacker can inject malicious content into the traffic in plaintext.
*   **Traffic Rerouting:** The attacker can reroute incoming server packets to their own machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Off-Path Attack:** The attacker does not need to be on the communication path between the victim and the server.
*   **Spoofed TCP Packets:** Attackers send fake TCP packets to manipulate the router's NAT mapping.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Off-Path Position:** The attacker must be on the same network (i.e., same Wi-Fi network) as the victim.
*   **Network Knowledge:** The attacker must have some knowledge of the network.
*   **Ability to Send Spoofed Packets:** The attacker must be able to send spoofed TCP packets.

**Additional Details:**

*   The research tested 67 widely used routers from 30 vendors, finding 52 affected.
*   A study on 93 real-world Wi-Fi networks found 75 to be vulnerable.
*   Case studies showed an average of 17.5, 19.4, and 54.5 seconds to terminate SSH connections, download private files from FTP servers, and inject fake HTTP responses, respectively.
*   The vendors were notified, and there were acknowledgments, CVEs, rewards, and adoption of the suggestions.
