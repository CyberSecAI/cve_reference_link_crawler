The provided content is related to CVE-2023-49103.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `graphapi` app utilizes a third-party library that provides a URL. Accessing this URL reveals the PHP environment's configuration details through `phpinfo()`. In containerized deployments, environment variables containing sensitive data can be exposed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Exposure of sensitive information due to the use of phpinfo().
- Inclusion of potentially sensitive data in environment variables within containerized deployments.
- The `graphapi` app did not properly restrict access to the phpinfo() output, allowing unauthorized users to view the information if they knew the specific URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Disclosure of sensitive credentials such as ownCloud admin passwords, mail server credentials, database credentials, object store/S3 access keys, and license keys.
- Potential for further attacks using the disclosed sensitive data.
- Full compromise of the ownCloud server and data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Accessing the specific URL provided by the vulnerable third-party library within the `graphapi` app.
- The vulnerability is present on the server side and does not require any user interaction to trigger.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the ownCloud server.
- The attacker needs to know the specific URL that exposes the phpinfo() output. This is obtained by reverse engineering the `graphapi` application.
