### FAQs for ownCloud Security Update

##### What is the security issue affecting ownCloud?

We have identified and made public several critical vulnerabilities in ownCloud Server 10 instances that could impact data integrity and service functionality. These include issues with the GraphAPI, crafted redirect URLs, and unauthorized file access.

##### How do I know if my ownCloud Server 10 installation is affected?

All ownCloud Server instances below version 10.13.3 are affected. Please check your current version to determine if an update is necessary. If you run at least ownCloud 10.13.1 and donât use external storage you should also upgrade, but you arenât subject to a security vulnerability. If you run ownCloud Infinite Scale or any of our managed services including ownCloud.Online you are NOT affected.

##### What immediate actions should I take?

Please upgrade your ownCloud Server to the latest version (10.13.3) as soon as possible. For specific vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-49103, CVE-2023-49104), update the respective apps and remove the âGetPhpInfo.phpâ file. For the WebDAV API issue (CVE-2023-49105), upgrade to 10.13.3 or apply a specific patch available from our support team if you are an ownCloud Subscription customer. Downloads are available at [www.owncloud.com/download](http://www.owncloud.com/download-server). For our subscription customers at [portal.owncloud.com](https://portal.owncloud.com/) . Our marketplace for updated apps is available at [marketplace.owncloud.com](https://marketplace.owncloud.com/).

##### Where can I find instructions for updating or patching my system?

Detailed update and patch application instructions are available in our administration documentation at: [doc.owncloud.com](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/next/admin_manual/maintenance/upgrading/upgrade.html)

##### Who can I contact for assistance?

Our dedicated support team is ready to assist our subscription customers. Please contact them at [owncloud.com/contact-us](https://owncloud.com/contact-us/) for any help.

##### What should I do if I encounter issues during the update process?

Please report any issues immediately to our support team. We are prepared to provide prompt assistance to resolve any complications as part of our subscription services.

##### Will there be further updates or communications on this and other security issues?

With each release of our products we provide detailed release notes as well as security information for our subscription customers and later for the general ownCloud community and the public â like at this time. Please continue to visit [www.owncloud.com/security](http://www.owncloud.com/security) for future updates.

**[Hall of fame](https://yeswehack.com/programs/owncloud-bug-bounty-program "People who helped make ownCloud more secure")**

### Process

If youâve discovered a security issue with ownCloud, please read our responsible disclosure guidelines and contact us at [YesWeHack](https://yeswehack.com/programs/owncloud-bug-bounty-program "ownCloud at YesWeHack").Â Your report should include, at least the following three things:

1. Product version
2. AÂ vulnerability description
3. Reproduction steps

AÂ member of the security team will confirm the vulnerability, determine its impact, and develop a fix. The fix will be applied toÂ theÂ master branch, tested, and packaged in the next security release.Â The vulnerability will be publicly announced after the release.Â Finally, your name will be added to the hall of fame as a thank you from the entire ownCloud community.

### Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

The ownCloud community kindly requests that you comply with the following guidelines when researching and reporting security vulnerabilities:

* Only test for vulnerabilities on your own install of ownCloud Server
* Confirm the vulnerability applies to a supported product version
* Share vulnerabilities inÂ detailÂ only with the security team
* Allow reasonable time for a response from the security team
* Do not publish information related to the vulnerability until ownCloud has made an announcement to the community

### Out of scope

Usually, the following types of bugs are out of scope from our security program:

* Network level vulnerabilities (e.g. DDoS)
* Bugs on infrastructure

### Supported Product Versions

ownCloud Server:

ownCloud Desktop Client:

### Third-party apps

Vulnerabilities in third-party applications should also be reported to the security team. The security team is not responsible for the security of these apps, but will attempt to contact the 3rd party app maintainer and then take proper actions.

# Disclosure of sensitive credentials and configuration in containerized deployments

Nov 21, 2023

* Risk: critical
* CVSS v3 Base Score: 10
* CVSS v3 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
* CWE ID: CWE-200
* CWE Name: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

### Description

The “graphapi” app relies on a third-party library that provides a URL. When this URL is accessed, it reveals

the configuration details of the PHP environment (phpinfo). This information includes all the environment variables of

the webserver. In containerized deployments, these environment variables may include sensitive data such as the

ownCloud admin password, mail server credentials, and license key.

It’s important to emphasize that simply disabling the graphapi app does not eliminate the vulnerability. Additionally,

phpinfo exposes various other potentially sensitive configuration details that could be exploited by an attacker to

gather information about the system. Therefore, even if ownCloud is not running in a containerized environment, this

vulnerability should still be a cause for concern.

Note that Docker-Containers from before February 2023 are not vulnerable to the credential disclosure.

### Affected

* graphapi 0.2.0 – 0.3.0

### Action taken

Delete the file owncloud/apps/graphapi/vendor/microsoft/microsoft-graph/tests/GetPhpInfo.php. Additionally, we disabled the phpinfo function

in our docker-containers. We will apply various hardenings in future core releases to mitigate similar vulnerabilities.

We also advise to change the following secrets:

– ownCloud admin password

– Mail server credentials

– Database credentials

– Object-Store/S3 access-key
