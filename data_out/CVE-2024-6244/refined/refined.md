{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks CSRF checks in some areas.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Specifically, the `pzfm_upload_avatar` action in `admin-ajax.php` is vulnerable.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can force a logged-in user to change their profile picture to an attacker-controlled image, potentially leading to further social engineering attacks or defacement.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that, when visited by a logged-in user, triggers an AJAX request to the vulnerable endpoint, changing the user's profile picture. This is done by posting to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `pzfm_upload_avatar` action and a base64 encoded image in the `imageData` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to lure a logged-in user to visit a malicious web page or click a malicious link that contains the CSRF exploit."
