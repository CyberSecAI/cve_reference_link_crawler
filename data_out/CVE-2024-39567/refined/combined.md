[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-39567

The system service of affected applications is vulnerable to command injection due to missing server side input sanitation when loading VPN configurations. This could allow an authenticated local attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges.
