# Jlink AX1800

Jlink routers suffer from A01 Broken Access Control. Any remote user can access any of the routers API's without a password. A rouge threat actor can enable telnet and then escalate to root privileges by just entering the su command.

**Telnet API:**

```
"mode_name=/web/um_telnet_set&telnetEnable=1&userName=admin&userPwd=pawnp@nda69"

```

**Run POC:**

```
expect jlink

```

Shodan shows 902 devices available to RCE.

CVE-2023-37058:
Insecure Permissions vulnerability in JLINK Unionman Technology Co. Ltd Jlink AX1800 v.1.0 allows a remote attacker to escalate privileges via a crafted command.

CVE-2023-37057:
An issue in JLINK Unionman Technology Co. Ltd Jlink AX1800 v.1.0 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the router's authentication mechanism.

Great monitor

I got this computer monitor for my husband to play Xbox on that way he's not hogging the big TV in our living room. My kids watch YouTube on it and also play their PlayStation on it. The picture quality is good and clear.

megan l hanley

it's great for not only gaming but for office work too. it has nice picture quality. and the screen brightness can be adjusted. worth the price.

SW

Good Value Gaming Monitor

Definitely not the very highest end, but a very good value monitor, suitable for gaming or office work. Colors are bright, blacks are black, and no artifacts even during fast motion video. HD picture and low glare. Included stand tilts and feels stable, and it's also VESA compatible. 2 inputs each for HDMI and Display Port.

A great second monitor or budget screen for just about any use case. Generally impressed with the quality to price ratio offered here.

Romildo Wynn

Clear picture, very cool breath light

Excellent monitor. The curved surface is easier on the eyes for such a larger screen. The picture quality is amazing. There's a really cool breathing light on the back of the gaming monitor, It changes different colors. Would reccommend to anyone looking for a curved monitor at this price point.

Amazing picture Quality!!

This gaming monitor has unbelievable picture quality graphics just pop out of the screen. My son uses it for his gaming and is super happy with it. It was super simple to assemble and plug it in to play. Decent screen size for any gamer. Unbelievable value for the money.

Serena Ann

This is a really great monitor. We are using it setup for a gaming PC and it offers a great picture. It was super easy to connect to my PC and has everything you need to get it ready to go. This display offers a crystal clear image and doesn't have any spots or color variations. Very nice.
