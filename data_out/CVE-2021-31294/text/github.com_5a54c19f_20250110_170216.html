Prevent replicas from sending commands that interact with keyspace ([#…](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/8868)

```
[…8868](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/8868))

This solves an issue reported in [#8712](https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/8712) in which a replica would bypass
the client write pause check and cause an assertion due to executing a
write command during failover.

The fact is that we don't expect replicas to execute any command other
than maybe REPLCONF and PING, etc. but matching against the ADMIN
command flag is insufficient, so instead i just block keyspace access
for now.
```
