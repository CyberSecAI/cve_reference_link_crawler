Prevent replicas from sending commands that interact with keyspace ([#…](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/8868)

```
[…8868](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/8868))

This solves an issue reported in [#8712](https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/8712) in which a replica would bypass
the client write pause check and cause an assertion due to executing a
write command during failover.

The fact is that we don't expect replicas to execute any command other
than maybe REPLCONF and PING, etc. but matching against the ADMIN
command flag is insufficient, so instead i just block keyspace access
for now.

```
[…8868](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/8868))

This solves an issue reported in [#8712](https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/8712) in which a replica would bypass
the client write pause check and cause an assertion due to executing a
write command during failover.

The fact is that we don't expect replicas to execute any command other
than maybe REPLCONF and PING, etc. but matching against the ADMIN
command flag is insufficient, so instead i just block keyspace access
for now.
```

| Hello, When I fuzzed the redis server, I found these command will crash redis. Just like:  ``` psync ldecl1 k failover set key value  ```  In fact, `set key value` can be replaced with any command. Save these command to a file named input, When executing `nc 127.0.0.1 6379 < ./input`, redis crashed. I use AddressSanitizer(ASan) to compile redis. Here is the error output:  ``` 83901:M 27 Mar 2021 23:57:56.593 * Ready to accept connections 83901:M 27 Mar 2021 23:57:57.978 * Replica 127.0.0.1:<unknown-replica-port> asks for synchronization

| Well this is an odd case. So for legacy reasons replica's have been allowed to ignore client pause and send commands any way to their primaries. I believe the intention of this is to allow ping/pong messages for health checks. With the introduction of 6.2, we try to provide stronger safety guarantees and we crash the server if mutating commands are executed during client pause. Since replicas are allowed to get around the client pause, they can sent mutating commands during the pause.  I'm don't think this crash needs to be explicitly fixed. We might want to re-think how the replication links works in the future to be more robust, but I'm not sure a tactical fix here is worthwhile.

| so a replica is sending a SET command to it's master (not something that should happen in real life), and if it happens during a failover, the master crashes on assertion.. i agree, i don't think it is important to fix, but if we do want to fix it, maybe the right thing is to reject any non-administrative command coming from a replica. |
