[v19.4.22](/OpenMage/magento-lts/tree/v19.4.22)

[`d28003f`](/OpenMage/magento-lts/commit/d28003ffa21be11591a7182840abc7b44bdf7d14)

This is an important security update release, it includes six security patches:

* [CVE-2021-21395](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r3c9-9j5q-pwv4 "CVE-2021-21395") - [GHSA-r3c9-9j5q-pwv4](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r3c9-9j5q-pwv4 "GHSA-r3c9-9j5q-pwv4") - Reset Password not protected against well-timed CSRF
* [CVE-2021-41144](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5j2g-3ph4-rgvm "CVE-2021-41144") - [GHSA-5j2g-3ph4-rgvm](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5j2g-3ph4-rgvm "GHSA-5j2g-3ph4-rgvm") - Fix for authenticated remote code execution through layout update
* [CVE-2021-41143](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5vpv-xmcj-9q85 "CVE-2021-41143") - [GHSA-5vpv-xmcj-9q85](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5vpv-xmcj-9q85 "GHSA-5vpv-xmcj-9q85") - Fix for arbitrary file deletion in customer media allows for remote code execution
* [CVE-2021-41231](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h632-p764-pjqm "CVE-2021-41231") - [GHSA-h632-p764-pjqm](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h632-p764-pjqm "GHSA-h632-p764-pjqm") - DataFlow upload remote code execution vulnerability
* [CVE-2021-39217](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c9q3-r4rv-mjm7 "CVE-2021-39217") - [GHSA-c9q3-r4rv-mjm7](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c9q3-r4rv-mjm7 "GHSA-c9q3-r4rv-mjm7") - Fix for arbitrary command execution in custom layout update through blocks
* [CVE-2023-23617](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3p73-mm7v-4f6m "CVE-2023-23617") - [GHSA-3p73-mm7v-4f6m](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3p73-mm7v-4f6m "GHSA-3p73-mm7v-4f6m") - DoS vulnerability in MaliciousCode filter

All of these updates should be totally backward compatible, except one, `CVE-2021-21395 - GHSA-r3c9-9j5q-pwv4 - Reset Password not protected against well-timed CSRF` in fact **is a breaking change and you will need to take action** after upgrading to this version of OpenMage.

Specifically, you will have to modify the `customer/form/resetforgottenpassword.phtml` file of your custom theme (in case you have customized it) and add this code `<input name="form_key" type="hidden" value="<?php echo $this->getFormKey(); ?>" />` after the `<form` open tag. Please [refer to this link](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/commit/58e72cf939ecab61462e433eb755dedbc5be0767) in case you want to see how the patch works and copy/paste the simple solution.

In case your custom theme does not have the `customer/form/resetforgottenpassword.phtml` or in case you are not using a custom theme then you will not have to do the aforementioned procedure.

[v20.0.19](/OpenMage/magento-lts/tree/v20.0.19)

[`e527e81`](/OpenMage/magento-lts/commit/e527e810970798b7c1ecfe1cf8d20a3e7a9aa238)

This is an important security update release, it includes six security patches:

* [CVE-2021-21395](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r3c9-9j5q-pwv4 "CVE-2021-21395") - [GHSA-r3c9-9j5q-pwv4](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r3c9-9j5q-pwv4 "GHSA-r3c9-9j5q-pwv4") - Reset Password not protected against well-timed CSRF
* [CVE-2021-41144](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5j2g-3ph4-rgvm "CVE-2021-41144") - [GHSA-5j2g-3ph4-rgvm](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5j2g-3ph4-rgvm "GHSA-5j2g-3ph4-rgvm") - Fix for authenticated remote code execution through layout update
* [CVE-2021-41143](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5vpv-xmcj-9q85 "CVE-2021-41143") - [GHSA-5vpv-xmcj-9q85](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5vpv-xmcj-9q85 "GHSA-5vpv-xmcj-9q85") - Fix for arbitrary file deletion in customer media allows for remote code execution
* [CVE-2021-41231](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h632-p764-pjqm "CVE-2021-41231") - [GHSA-h632-p764-pjqm](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h632-p764-pjqm "GHSA-h632-p764-pjqm") - DataFlow upload remote code execution vulnerability
* [CVE-2021-39217](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c9q3-r4rv-mjm7 "CVE-2021-39217") - [GHSA-c9q3-r4rv-mjm7](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c9q3-r4rv-mjm7 "GHSA-c9q3-r4rv-mjm7") - Fix for arbitrary command execution in custom layout update through blocks
* [CVE-2023-23617](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3p73-mm7v-4f6m "CVE-2023-23617") - [GHSA-3p73-mm7v-4f6m](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3p73-mm7v-4f6m "GHSA-3p73-mm7v-4f6m") - DoS vulnerability in MaliciousCode filter

All of these updates should be totally backward compatible, except one, `CVE-2021-21395 - GHSA-r3c9-9j5q-pwv4 - Reset Password not protected against well-timed CSRF` in fact **is a breaking change and you will need to take action** after upgrading to this version of OpenMage.

Specifically, you will have to modify the `customer/form/resetforgottenpassword.phtml` file of your custom theme (in case you have customized it) and add this code `<input name="form_key" type="hidden" value="<?php echo $this->getFormKey(); ?>" />` after the `<form` open tag. Please [refer to this link](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/commit/58e72cf939ecab61462e433eb755dedbc5be0767) in case you want to see how the patch works and copy/paste the simple solution.

In case your custom theme does not have the `customer/form/resetforgottenpassword.phtml` or in case you are not using a custom theme then you will not have to do the aforementioned procedure.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
