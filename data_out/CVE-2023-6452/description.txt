Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Forcepoint Web Security (Transaction Viewer) allows Stored XSS.





The
 Forcepoint Web Security portal allows administrators to generate 
detailed reports on user requests made through the Web proxy. It has 
been determined that the "user agent" field in the Transaction Viewer is
 vulnerable to a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, 
which can be exploited by any user who can route traffic through the 
Forcepoint Web proxy.

This 
vulnerability enables unauthorized attackers to execute JavaScript 
within the browser context of a Forcepoint administrator, thereby 
allowing them to perform actions on the administrator's behalf. Such a 
breach could lead to unauthorized access or modifications, posing a 
significant security risk.






This issue affects Web Security: before 8.5.6.
