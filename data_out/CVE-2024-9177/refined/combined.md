### Description

The Themedy Toolbox plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's themedy\_col, themedy\_social\_link, themedy\_alertbox, and themedy\_pullleft shortcodes in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.14, and up to, and including 1.0.15 for the plugin's themedy\_button shortcode due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
