Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-42232 (based on the filename containing "Archer A7(US)_V5_210519_tddp.md" and the content mentioning "Archer A7(US)_V5_210519")

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the improper filtering of user-supplied input when constructing a command for the `tftp` function within the TP-Link Archer A7 AC1750 firmware. Specifically, the firmware attempts to prevent command injection by filtering out semicolons (`;`), however, it does not filter out the double pipe symbol (`||`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **OS Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an OS command injection. Attackers can inject arbitrary shell commands into the `tftp` command execution context due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The filtering mechanism is flawed because it only blocks semicolons but overlooks other command separators like `||`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the affected TP-Link router. This can lead to:
    - **Complete system compromise:** Full control over the router, allowing the attacker to change its configurations, including DNS settings, potentially redirecting traffic through malicious servers.
    - **Malware installation:** Installation of backdoors, botnet clients, or other malicious software on the router.
    - **Data exfiltration:** Access to sensitive data that may be stored on the router.
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crashing the router or disrupting network services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the parameters passed to the `tftp` command.  The specific mechanism or interface through which these parameters are provided isn't detailed in the provided text (most likely via a web interface or other network service). However, an attacker can inject commands by including `||` followed by malicious commands in the parameters meant for `tftp`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the router in order to send the malicious input to the vulnerable interface.
- **Understanding of the Router's API:** The attacker needs to understand the interface used to execute `tftp` commands, and how to inject the malicious commands into the parameters.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** Knowledge that the router firmware is vulnerable to OS command injection through the `||` command separator when using the `tftp` command.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided github document indicates that this vulnerability was fixed in firmware version Archer A7(US)\_V5\_211022.
- The github document also includes an image illustrating the location of the vulnerable code (label 2) and the flawed sanitization (label 1).

In summary, this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to gain arbitrary code execution on the affected TP-Link router due to inadequate input sanitization when constructing commands for the `tftp` function.
