SSA-517377: Multiple Vulnerabilities in the SRCS VPN Feature in
SIMATIC CP Devices

2022-07-12
Publication Date:
2023-03-14
Last Update:
Current Version:
V1.2
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 10.0

SUMMARY

The below referenced devices contain multiple vulnerabilities that could be exploited when the SINEMA
Remote Connect Server (SRCS) VPN feature is used. The feature is not activated by default. The
most severe could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges under certain
circumstances.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Block access to port 5243/udp e.g. with an external ﬁrewall if possible
• Disable the SINEMA Remote Connect Server (SRCS) VPN feature

• Make sure to conﬁgure the CP to only connect to trusted SINEMA Remote Connect Server instances

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC CP 1242-7 and CP 1243-7 LTE communications processors connect SIMATIC S7-1200 con-
trollers to Wide Area Networks (WAN). They provide integrated security functions such as ﬁrewall, Virtual
Private Networks (VPN) and support of other protocols with data encryption.

SIMATIC CP 1243-8 IRC communications processors connect SIMATIC S7-1200 controllers via the
SINAUT ST7 telecontrol protocol to a control center or master ST7 stations.

SIMATIC CP 1543-1 communications processors connect SIMATIC S7-1500 controllers to Ethernet
networks. They provide integrated security functions such as ﬁrewall, Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and
support of other protocols with data encryption.

SIMATIC CP 1543SP-1, CP 1542SP-1 and CP 1542SP-1 IRC communications processors connect
SIMATIC ET 200SP controllers to Ethernet networks. SIMATIC CP 1543SP-1 and CP 1542SP-1 IRC
communications processors also provide integrated security functions such as ﬁrewall, Virtual Private
Networks (VPN) or support other protocols with data encryption.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-34819

The application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing speciﬁc messages. This
could result in a heap-based buffer overﬂow. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute
code in the context of device.
