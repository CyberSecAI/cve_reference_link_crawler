- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Sterling Connect:Express for UNIX browser UI uses cookies without the `SameSite` attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of `SameSite` attribute in cookies, which can lead to attacks that rely on cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: This vulnerability can be exploited to perform attacks relying on the use of cookies without the `SameSite` attribute.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation would occur via the browser UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to induce the browser to make requests with the vulnerable cookie to a target site.
