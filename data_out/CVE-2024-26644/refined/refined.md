{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `create_pending_snapshot()` function in the BTRFS filesystem driver initializes a new root item as a copy of the source root item. For a deleted subvolume, the source root item's `refs` field is 0. Subsequently, `btrfs_insert_root()` inserts a root with `refs == 0`. Then, `btrfs_get_new_fs_root()` finds the root and returns -ENOENT if `refs == 0`, which causes `create_pending_snapshot()` to abort, leading to a filesystem abort.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the way BTRFS handles snapshot creation of deleted subvolumes, specifically in the `create_pending_snapshot()` function not checking for a valid reference count before attempting the operation, leading to a potential filesystem abort.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attempting to snapshot a deleted subvolume can cause the BTRFS filesystem to abort, potentially leading to data unavailability and requiring manual intervention to recover the filesystem.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the `btrfs_mksnapshot` ioctl, specifically when the source file descriptor points to a deleted subvolume.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have the ability to perform ioctl calls on a BTRFS filesystem, which typically requires local access with sufficient privileges to create snapshots."
