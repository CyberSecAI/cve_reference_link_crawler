| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2272948#c0)  Zack Miele    2024-04-03 12:42:08 UTC  ``` An information disclosure flaw was discovered in OpenShift Virtualization. The DownwardMetrics feature was introduced to expose host metrics to virtual machine guests and is enabled by default.  This could expose limited host metrics of a node to any guest in any namespace without being explicit enabled by an administrator.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2272948#c3)  Dominik Holler    2024-04-03 14:38:12 UTC  ``` @zmiele   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2272948#c4)  Dominik Holler    2024-04-03 14:41:30 UTC  ``` Can the bug be already closed, and will this update the state in <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-31419> ?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2272948#c5)  Zack Miele    2024-04-03 15:27:31 UTC  ``` Yes, I'll close this shortly.   ``` |  |
