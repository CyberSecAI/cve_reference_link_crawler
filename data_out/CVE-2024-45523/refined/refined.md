- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A weakness in the Bravura Security API SOAP service (idapisoap) and the Bravura Security API service (idapi) related to how they handle failed login attempts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A resource leak vulnerability. Specifically, the services do not properly release resources (like memory) after failed login attempts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a resource exhaustion (memory leak), leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition, potentially slowing down or stopping the application. This would prevent legitimate users from accessing the security features provided by the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exposed through the Bravura Security API SOAP service (idapisoap), accessible remotely over the internet without requiring authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without any prior authentication. They can initiate multiple failed login attempts to trigger the resource leak.

The provided content gives more detail than the basic CVE description by specifying the exact services involved (idapisoap and idapi), the type of resource leak (memory), and the impact (DoS). It also provides mitigation and remediation steps.
