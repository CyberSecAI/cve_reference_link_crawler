## Active Record RCE bug with Serialized Columns

[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-3hhc-qp5v-9p2j/dependabot)

## Package

bundler

activerecord
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

>= 7.0.0, <= 7.0.3
>= 6.1.0, <= 6.1.6
>= 6.0.0, <= 6.0.5
<= 5.2.8

## Patched versions

7.0.3.1
6.1.6.1
6.0.5.1
5.2.8.1

## Description

When serialized columns that use YAML (the default) are deserialized, Rails uses YAML.unsafe\_load to convert the YAML data in to Ruby objects. If an attacker can manipulate data in the database (via means like SQL injection), then it may be possible for the attacker to escalate to an RCE.

There are no feasible workarounds for this issue, but other coders (such as JSON) are not impacted.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
