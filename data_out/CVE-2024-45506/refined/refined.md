  "ID": "CVE-2024-45506",
  "Summary": "The content provided indicates a vulnerability in HAProxy versions prior to 3.0.4 and 2.9.10, specifically related to the handling of incomplete HTTP/2 frames. This issue can cause an endless loop in the h2_send() function under specific conditions, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).",
  "Technical Details": {
    "Root Cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the improper handling of incomplete HTTP/2 frames within the H2 multiplexing logic. Specifically, errors occurring while processing an incomplete frame do not always lead to the proper termination of the connection, causing an endless loop. This loop is triggered when an error requiring a GOAWAY frame is reported with an almost full output buffer, while no further progress can be made on the input buffer due to the incomplete frame and simultaneous data transmission on multiple streams in zero-copy mode. This situation results in the output buffer being cleared without resetting the full condition, leading to a perpetual loop. The issue is further exacerbated by the inability to break out of the `h2_send()` loop when no progress can be made on the input buffer while an error is pending.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of incomplete HTTP/2 frames",
      "Lack of proper exit condition in h2_send() loop",
      "Insufficient error handling in H2 multiplexing logic"
    ],
    "Impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, as the affected HAProxy instances can get stuck in an endless loop, consuming excessive CPU resources and preventing the service from handling further requests. This can result in service unavailability.",
     "Attack Vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted or incomplete HTTP/2 frames to an HAProxy server."
    ],
    "Required Capabilities": [
      "The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP/2 requests to the vulnerable HAProxy server."
    ],
     "Affected Versions": "HAProxy versions prior to 3.0.4 and 2.9.10 are affected."
  },
    "Additional Information": {
    "Workaround": "A workaround for this issue, as mentioned in the changelog, is to disable zero-copy forwarding for HTTP/2 using the configuration setting: `tune.h2.zero-copy-fwd-send off`.",
       "Resolution": "The vulnerability was fixed in HAProxy versions 3.0.4 and 2.9.10."
