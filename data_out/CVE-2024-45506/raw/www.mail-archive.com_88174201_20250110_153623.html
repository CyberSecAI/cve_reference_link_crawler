<pre>Hi,

HAProxy 3.0.4 was released on 2024/09/03. It added 42 new commits
after version 3.0.3.</pre><pre>

This version addresses two issues affecting how the H2 mux deals with
incomplete frames:
  - in one case, certain errors happening while processing an incomplete
    frame did not lead to the termination of the connection, and would
    cause endless wakeups to try to handle the error, preventing the
    process from sleeping, thus eating CPU.

  - another case, much harder to reproduce but also observed as actively
    exploited in one case, can cause an endless loop in the h2_send()
    function if a processing error requiring a GOAWAY is reported with an
    almost full output buffer when no more progress can be made on the
    input buffer due to an incomplete frame while many streams are
    transmitting data in parallel in zero-copy mode. What happens in this
    case is that the output buffer is cleared (due to the error) while
    still leaving the full indication that prevents output data from being
    considered, and no condition to exit the loop is met. In this case the
    loop will be interrupted by the watchdog which will kill the process
    after two seconds. A work-around consists in simply disabling
    zero-copy forwarding for HTTP/2:  &quot;tune.h2.zero-copy-fwd-send off&quot;.
    This issue was assigned CVE-2024-45506.

Other than that, the following issues were fixed:
  - CLI: the &quot;show threads&quot; command would crash if issued with less than
    16 threads (due to an area shared for two different things it would
    start to dump threads from the 17th).

  - JWT: the SSL library functions used to validate a token would leave
    an error in the SSL stack, that will later be mistaken for an error
    on another connection and cause it to be closed.

  - a time-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU) issue in the queue processing
    makes it rare but possible to leave a server with no connection yet
    not take any traffic. It's more likely to happen with maxconn 1,
    very hard at 2 and almost impossible at 3 or above.

  - QUIC: when the accept queue is full and the incoming connection cannot
    be migrated to another thread, it needed to be re-migrated to the local
    thread, which was not supported because the migration had already
    started, and would crash. Also there was a case which could produce
    crashes when built with the aws-lc TLS library.

  - OCSP: a memory allocation error while loading OCSP parameters could
    leave the tree locked and freeze subsequent operations.

  - some uploads to H2 servers could freeze due to the zero-copy
    forwarding not always setting the END_STREAM flag on the last DATA
    frame (GH #2665).

  - it was possible to crash the process when performing an implicit
    protocol upgrade (TCP to HTTP due to a transition from a TCP front
    to an HTTP back) if an error happened on the connection just before
    the transition.

  - a crash could happen in mux-pt if an error happened on the connection
    just before an abort that is going to emit a shutdown, and with a
    pending wakeup that completes some work on a connection having no
    transport layer anymore. This only affects TCP (e.g. peers and master
    CLI; GH #2656).

  - mux-h1 could repeat a 408 error multiple times in logs when failing
    to send an empty message on a full output buffer. In this case, it
    would attempt to close again every client timeout and produce a log
    each time despite no data leaving.

Finally these changes are not exactly issues but address problems
encountered in some setups:

  - the hard limit on the number of file descriptors now defaults to about
    1 million, in order to match what has been done for a very long time
    on many distros, and that recently changed to 1 billion on some of
    them, causing a huge startup time (or even a watchdog at boot) and a
    massive memory usage.

  - New global directive &quot;h1-do-not-close-on-insecure-transfer-encoding&quot;
    was added to explicitly permit to maintain a connection alive when it
    uses both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding. This goes against the
    latest version of the HTTP specification but may be needed with some
    clients or servers which cause too many TLS reconnections because of
    this despite being in well controlled environments.

  - The log-format parser became stricter in 3.0 as a side effect of some
    of the log processing improvements. A fatal error was emitted when an
    alias or expression was used in an incompatible context (e.g. HTTP info
    in TCP logs, but there are more subtle ones), preventing some working
    configs from starting. This has now been relaxed and is only produced
    in diagnostic mode (-dD). This was Github issue #2642.

  - support for &quot;retry-on 429&quot; was added (GH #2687)

And the rest is pretty minor. For the more problematic issues above, a
2.9 release will follow shortly.

Thanks to all those who kindly shared traces, dumps and backtraces,
because many of the issues above were particularly hard to figure, let
alone reproduce, but the overall increasing level of details provided in
bug reports helps a lot! If some have suggestions about what can make
their lives easier when providing detailed traces, feel free to share
them!

Note that at this point this flushes the queue of pending bugs for 3.0,
which is a good news. There remains one exception, a recently introduced
QUIC patchset into 3.1 to implement NEW_TOKEN on 0-RTT that we'd like to
backport since it addresses some bad corner cases. But the backport is
non-trivial and the patches need to be exposed a bit longer in 3.1 first,
this might come in 3.0.5.
