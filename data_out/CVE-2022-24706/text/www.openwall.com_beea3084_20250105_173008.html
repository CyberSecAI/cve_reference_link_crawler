Sure, you should put this address in copy when posting to oss-security
then, so you would be sure people reply to that one too. ;)

> As for your questions, see this PR to our packaging infrastructure for how we handle this on Debian and Centos/Rocky: <https://github.com/apache/couchdb-pkg/pull/92/files>

Thanks, so you use a default env file to set the variable and allow
people to easily change it in the case of a clustered setup. Will do so
as well then!

Regards,
Bruno
