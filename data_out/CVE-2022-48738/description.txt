In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: ops: Reject out of bounds values in snd_soc_put_volsw()

We don't currently validate that the values being set are within the range
we advertised to userspace as being valid, do so and reject any values
that are out of range.
