- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient file type validation in the `process_image_upload` function within the IQ Testimonials plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted file upload of dangerous types.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Unauthenticated attackers can upload arbitrary files to the server, potentially leading to remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks targeting the vulnerable `process_image_upload` function in the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require authentication and needs to send a malicious file to the vulnerable endpoint. Exploitation is only possible when the 'gd' PHP extension is not loaded on the server.
