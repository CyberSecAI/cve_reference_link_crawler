- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'q' parameter in the Admission AppManager plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute if a user is tricked into clicking a malicious link. This could lead to various malicious activities, potentially including session hijacking, data theft, or redirecting the user to a malicious website.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted URL that includes the malicious script within the 'q' parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the payload and trick a user into accessing it. No authentication is required.
