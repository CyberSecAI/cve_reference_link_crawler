```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The program receives the attacker's GET request through the `getenv` function, obtains the value of the first field through code, and concatenates it into a formatted string using the `snprintf` function. Finally, the `system` function is used to execute the system command.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command Injection: The attacker's input is not filtered before being passed to the `system` function, allowing arbitrary command execution."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the vulnerable device.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET request to the `upload_file.cgi` endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable device."
