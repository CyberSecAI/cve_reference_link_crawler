WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to port 4444/tcp, to trusted IP addresses only

• Enable encryption in the SIMATIC Energy Manager conﬁguration

Product speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

With SIMATIC Energy Manager, you can visualize energy ﬂows and consumption values in your processes
in detail, assign them to the relevant consumers or cost centers, and identify why changes have occurred.
Evaluate implemented efﬁciency measures, optimize your energy procurement, and compare energy
efﬁciency across plants and locations – in a scalable, transparent, and future-proof way.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-23448

Affected applications improperly assign permissions to critical directories and ﬁles used by the
application processes. This could allow a local unprivileged attacker to achieve code execution with
ADMINISTRATOR or even NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM privileges.

CVSS Vector
CWE

7.3
CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource

Vulnerability CVE-2022-23449

A DLL Hijacking vulnerability could allow a local attacker to execute code with elevated privileges by
placing a malicious DLL in one of the directories on the DLL search path.

CVSS Vector
CWE

7.3
CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element

Vulnerability CVE-2022-23450

The affected system allows remote users to send maliciously crafted objects. Due to insecure
deserialization of user-supplied content by the affected software, an unauthenticated attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted serialized object. This could allow the attacker
to execute arbitrary code on the device with SYSTEM privileges.
