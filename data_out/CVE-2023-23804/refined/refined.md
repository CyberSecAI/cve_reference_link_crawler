- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies.
- **Attack vectors:** By tricking a logged-in user to visit a malicious website or click a malicious link, an attacker can send crafted requests to the vulnerable plugin.
