# `serde` deserialization for `FamStructWrapper` lacks bound checks that could potentially lead to out-of-bounds memory access

Moderate

[roypat](/roypat)
published
GHSA-875g-mfp6-g7f9
Jan 2, 2024

## Package

cargo

vmm-sys-util
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

>= 0.5.0

## Patched versions

0.12.0

## Description

### Impact

An issue was discovered in the FamStructWrapper::deserialize implementation provided by the crate for vmm\_sys\_util::fam::FamStructWrapper, which can lead to out of bounds memory accesses. The deserialization does not check that the length stored in the header matches the flexible array length. Mismatch in the lengths might allow out of bounds memory access through Rust-safe methods.

Impacted versions: >= 0.5.0

### Patches

The issue was corrected in version 0.12.0 by inserting a check that verifies the lengths of compared flexible arrays are equal for any deserialized header and aborting deserialization otherwise. Moreover, the API was changed so that header length can only be modified through Rust-unsafe code. This ensures that users cannot trigger out-of-bounds memory access from Rust-safe code.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
