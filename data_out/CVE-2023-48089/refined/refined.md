- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `/xxl-job-admin/jobcode/save` endpoint does not validate user privileges, allowing unprivileged users to modify the code of running cron jobs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authorization checks on the `/xxl-job-admin/jobcode/save` endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the job executor, leading to sensitive information disclosure or a reverse shell.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker crafts an HTTP request to the `/xxl-job-admin/jobcode/save` endpoint using a valid but unprivileged user's cookie. The request includes a malicious payload within the `glueSource` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs a valid, unprivileged user account and access to the network where the vulnerable application is running. They also need to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
