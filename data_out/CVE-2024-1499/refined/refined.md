### Summary of CVE-2024-1499
The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw found in the Orbit Fox by ThemeIsle WordPress plugin, specifically affecting versions up to and including 2.10.30. The vulnerability is located in the Pricing Table widget, which uses the `$settings['title_tags']` parameter.

**Root Cause:** The root cause is insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `title_tag` and `subtitle_tag` parameters within the Pricing Table widget. These parameters are used to define the HTML tag for the title and subtitle, and due to the lack of proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code into these fields.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'):** The plugin fails to sanitize the user-supplied input in the `title_tag` and `subtitle_tag` parameters before rendering it on the web page.

**Impact:**
- **Stored XSS:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into the pages. This malicious script will execute every time a user visits the injected page, allowing the attacker to perform actions such as:
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Stealing session cookies
  - Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user
  - Defacing the website
  - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Pricing Table widget settings within the WordPress admin panel.
- An authenticated attacker with Contributor-level access or higher can modify the `title_tag` and `subtitle_tag` parameters of the Pricing Table widget to inject malicious scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least Contributor-level access.
- **Access to Widget Settings:** The attacker needs to have the ability to edit pages/posts and add/modify the Pricing Table widget within the Elementor page builder.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.10.31 by adding sanitization to the `title_tag` and `subtitle_tag` parameters using a function called `sanitize_tag` and using `esc_html()` to escape output.
- The vulnerable code is located in `/vendor/codeinwp/elementor-extra-widgets/widgets/elementor/pricing-table.php`.
- The patch included changes to the `class-elementor-extra-widgets.php` file to sanitize settings before saving.
