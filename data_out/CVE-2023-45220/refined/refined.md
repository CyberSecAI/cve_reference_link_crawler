{
  "CVE-2023-45220": {
    "Root cause": "The Android Client application, when configured to use method 1 for server enrollment (manual IP address entry), uses HTTP instead of HTTPS to retrieve sensitive information, including the IP address and credentials for connecting to a remote MQTT broker.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information",
       "Missing Authentication for Critical Function"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker on the same network can intercept the sensitive information transmitted over HTTP, including MQTT broker connection details.",
    "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attack on the same subnet.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to be on the same network as the HMI device."
