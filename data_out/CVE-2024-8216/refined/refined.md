{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly enforce access control checks for the `recipt_no` parameter in `editPayment.php`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper access control. The system allows users to access and modify payment records that should be restricted by directly manipulating the `recipt_no` parameter in the URL. It lacks validation of user permissions to edit specific records.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can modify payment records that should be restricted or read-only, gain unauthorized access to payment records of other users, potentially causing financial and data integrity issues within the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "By modifying the `recipt_no` parameter in the URL of the `editPayment.php` endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the Life Insurance Management System (LIMS). They must also be able to identify and access a payment record and know the format of the `recipt_no`."
