Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-29835:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The WD Discovery software was installing a Windows 7-compatible driver on Windows 10 systems. This prevented the Windows 10 Memory Integrity feature from being enabled.

*   WD Discovery software executable files were signed with an unsafe SHA-1 hashing algorithm.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Driver incompatibility:** The use of an outdated, Windows 7-compatible driver on Windows 10 systems blocked the enabling of the Memory Integrity feature. This is a security feature of core isolation that protects high-security processes from malicious code.
*   **Weak hashing algorithm:** The use of the SHA-1 hashing algorithm for code signing is considered insecure. SHA-1 has known vulnerabilities, allowing potential attackers to create malicious software that appears to be legitimately signed by Western Digital.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Disabled Memory Integrity:** The outdated driver prevented the Windows 10 Memory Integrity feature from being enabled. This could increase the vulnerability of the system to attacks that target high-security processes.
*   **Compromised Code Signing:** The use of SHA-1 for code signing made it easier for attackers to potentially distribute malicious software disguised as legitimate updates, leading to system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local System:** An attacker with access to a vulnerable Windows 10 system with WD Discovery installed could leverage the driver incompatibility issue and potentially bypass system security mechanisms.
*   **Supply Chain Attack:** An attacker could exploit the weak SHA-1 code signing to create a malicious update and distribute it through the WD update mechanism.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **For driver incompatibility:** The attacker would need local access to a Windows 10 machine with a vulnerable version of WD Discovery installed.
*   **For code signing vulnerability:** The attacker would need the ability to create or modify software packages and the means to distribute those packages as Western Digital updates.

**Additional details:**

*   The issue was reported by Aaron LeMieux of Microsoft.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by updating the driver to one compatible with Memory Integrity, and by updating the code signing to use SHA-256.
*   The corrected version is WD Discovery version 4.4.396.
*   There was no impact to normal hard drive operation due to the old driver.
