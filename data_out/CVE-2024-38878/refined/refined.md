- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected devices allow authenticated users to export diagnostics data through an API endpoint. This endpoint is vulnerable to path traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') (CWE-22)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can exploit the path traversal vulnerability to download arbitrary files from the file system. This leads to confidentiality loss and potentially allows further malicious activities based on the exposed files.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable API endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the affected devices.
