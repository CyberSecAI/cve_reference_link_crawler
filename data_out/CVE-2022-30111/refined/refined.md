Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-30111:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The core issue is a predictable rolling code implementation in MCK locks. The blog post states, "The keyspace of rolling codes for MCK Lock is predictable." This means the sequence of codes generated by the remote is not sufficiently random or complex, making it possible to anticipate future codes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Predictable Rolling Codes:** The rolling code mechanism is flawed, allowing for the prediction of subsequent codes.
*   **Replay Attack Vulnerability:** Due to the predictability, captured unlock codes can be replayed to unlock the MCK lock.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can unlock the MCK lock without possessing the genuine key fob by replaying captured codes.
*   **Security Bypass:** The intended security of the rolling code mechanism is completely bypassed.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **RF Signal Capture:** The attacker uses a device (e.g., HackRF) to capture the RF signal containing the unlock code transmitted by the genuine key fob.
*  **Replay Attack:** The captured code is retransmitted to the lock to achieve unauthorized access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Physical Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within RF range to capture the signal from the key fob.
*   **RF Capture Equipment:** The attacker needs a device like HackRF to capture the RF transmission.
*   **Ability to Replay:** The attacker must be able to retransmit the captured signal.
* **Timing:** The attacker must replay the code within a limited window. The blog post states that it will unlock the lock within 10-20 attempts
