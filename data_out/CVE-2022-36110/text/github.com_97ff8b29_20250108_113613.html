### Security Notice

A moderate-severity vulnerability was discovered in v0.15.0 (will be disclosed shortly). Please upgrade to v0.15.1 to resolve this issue.

### Whats New

* [experimental] Client Connect/Disconnect: The netclient can now be temporarily disconnected from a network. This works via the UI. Go to node details, edit, toggle the "Connected" flag, and save. There is also a command line option, "netclient connect" and "netclient disconnect." However, a bug prevents this change from persisting, and any network change (peer or node update) will reset connection status. This will be fixed in v0.15.2.
* IPv6 Internet Gateway: you can now set an IPv6 Internet Gateway using "::/0". Keep in mind, this will not work on the Netmaker server, because ipv6 networking is not enabled in the docker/docker-compose. This will work on other machines that act as egress.
* Swagger Docs: Check them out! Will be built out over time <https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Netmaker/netmaker/0.15.1>
* Guidance on Locking down the Netmaker UI: How to make your dashboard inaccessible exept from your PC - <https://docs.netmaker.org/server-installation.html#security-settings>
* External Client Custom Name: Via api call, you can now create an external client with a custom name. EX: `curl -d '{"clientid": "test3"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://api.netmaker-site.com/api/extclients/{networkname}/{ingressid}`

### Whats Fixed

* restore from backup if config file corrupted
* netclient version will update in the UI when netclient is upgrades
* M1 Mac (brew) package now sets path correctly

### Known Issues

* ipv6 gateways do not work on netmaker server
* connect/disconnect will get reset by server (if set via CLI)

## New Contributors

[@k4s0](https://github.com/k4s0) made their first contribution! They added the custom ext client controller functionality.

**Full Changelog**: [v0.15.0...v0.15.1](https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/compare/v0.15.0...v0.15.1)
