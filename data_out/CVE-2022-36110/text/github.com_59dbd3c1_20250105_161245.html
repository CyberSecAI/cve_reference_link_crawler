# Insufficient Granularity of Access Control in Netmaker

Moderate

[afeiszli](/afeiszli)
published
GHSA-ggf6-638m-vqmg
Sep 9, 2022

## Package

gomod

netmaker
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< v0.15.1

## Patched versions

0.15.1

## Description

This vulnerability was brought to our attention by [@tweidinger](https://github.com/tweidinger)

### Impact

Improper Authorization functions leads to non-privileged users running privileged API calls. If you have added users to your Netmaker platform who whould not have admin privileges, they could use their auth token to run admin-level functions via the API.

In addition, differing response codes based on function calls allowed non-users to potentially brute force the determination of names of networks on the system.

### Patches

This problem has been patched in v0.15.1. To apply:

1. docker-compose down
2. docker pull gravitl/netmaker:v0.15.1
3. docker-compose up -d
