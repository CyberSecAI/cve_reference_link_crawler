Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-36110:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient granularity of access control within the Netmaker application. Specifically, improper authorization functions allowed non-privileged users to execute privileged API calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authorization:** The core issue is that Netmaker did not properly restrict access to its API endpoints based on user roles or privileges. This allowed standard users to perform actions that should have been limited to administrators.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The system used different response codes based on function calls, enabling non-users to potentially brute-force the determination of network names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Non-admin users could gain elevated privileges, enabling them to perform administrative actions via the API. This could include modifying system configurations, accessing sensitive data, or disrupting services.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The ability to brute-force network names through response codes could expose details about the system's configuration to unauthorized parties.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Exploitation:** Attackers leverage the Netmaker API using valid but non-privileged user authentication tokens. They can then call privileged API functions not intended for their user level.
*   **Brute-Force:** Non-authenticated attackers could try to identify network names by observing differing API response codes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the Netmaker platform, even if it's a standard non-privileged account, to use the API to escalate their privileges.
*   **API Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Netmaker API.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by @tweidinger.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as "moderate" severity.
*   The issue was fixed in version v0.15.1. Users are advised to upgrade immediately to remediate the vulnerability by pulling the new docker image.
*   The vulnerability is associated with CWE-1220 (Insufficient Granularity of Access Control).
