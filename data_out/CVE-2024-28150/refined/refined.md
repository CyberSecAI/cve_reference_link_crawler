The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins plugins, including CVE-2024-28150.

**CVE-2024-28150**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The HTML Publisher Plugin does not properly sanitize job names, report names, and index page titles within the report frame.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unsanitized input.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are executed within the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious code through job names, report names, or index page titles. When a user views the report, the injected script will be executed.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have Item/Configure permissions within Jenkins to modify job configurations and inject the malicious payload. The user has to view the report for the XSS to be executed.
