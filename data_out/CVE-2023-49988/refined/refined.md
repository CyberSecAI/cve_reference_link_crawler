Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input within the `rooms.php` file when updating room prices and discounts. Specifically, the `npss`, `dpss`, `npsd`, `dpsd`, `npds`, `dpds`, `npdd`, `dpdd`, `npdst`, and `dpdst` parameters are directly used in SQL queries without being sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through the vulnerable parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database. This can lead to:
  - Data exfiltration: Extracting sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials and personal details.
  - Data modification: Altering or deleting data within the database.
  - Data corruption: Causing inconsistencies and errors.
  - Complete control of the database: In some cases, the attacker might gain full control over the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `rooms.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application, as the exploitation occurs via HTTP requests.
- **Admin Authentication:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an admin user to access the `rooms.php` page.
- **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft malicious SQL payloads.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in version 1.0 of the Hotel Booking Management application.
- The vulnerable parameters include `npss`, `dpss`, `npsd`, `dpsd`, `npds`, `dpds`, `npdd`, `dpdd`, `npdst`, and `dpdst`.
- A sample payload `(select*from(select(sleep(5)))a)` is provided to demonstrate the SQL injection.
