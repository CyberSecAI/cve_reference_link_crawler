### Collaboration:

This vulnerability was found in collaboration with Marian-Razvan Ilisanu.

### NVD Disclosure:

The disclosure for this vulnerability can be found [here](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23861).

### Requirements:

This vulnerability requires:

* Valid user credentials in order to access and edit the vulnerable fields

### Proof Of Concept:
