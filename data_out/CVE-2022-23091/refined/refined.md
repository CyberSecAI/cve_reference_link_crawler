Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A memory mapping sharing issue in the FreeBSD virtual memory system. Specifically, a mishandling of shared memory mappings where a process can retain a mapping to a page after it has been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of shared memory mappings.
- Failure to invalidate mappings when memory is freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unprivileged local user can potentially read private data belonging to other processes or the kernel. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access by an unprivileged user.
- Exploitation is achieved via manipulation of memory mapping through mmap(), fork(), or other related system calls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary code on the affected system in an unprivileged context.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is similar to a previous issue (SA-21:08.vm), but has a different root cause.
- The vulnerability affects all supported versions of FreeBSD.
- Patches are available for different FreeBSD release and stable branches.
- NetApp products incorporate FreeBSD, and they have issued an advisory (NTAP-20240415-0008) to address this vulnerability, stating that multiple products are affected. However, the provided list of products in the NetApp advisory contains only unaffected products. The advisory indicates that there are no fixes, and customers should obtain software fixes through the NetApp Support website.
