{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient Session Expiration",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application does not properly invalidate user sessions upon account deletion, allowing a deleted user to continue using their session.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A deleted admin user can still perform administrative actions, potentially leading to unauthorized data modification or deletion.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker uses a valid session of a deleted admin user to make requests to the server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a valid session from an admin account that was subsequently deleted by another administrator."
