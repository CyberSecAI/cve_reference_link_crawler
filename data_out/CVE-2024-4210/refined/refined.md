- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `Gitlab::Asciidoc::IncludeProcessor` not properly handling recursive includes using the `include::` directive in AsciiDoc files. Specifically, the `:include_allowed?` method doesn't prevent cyclic imports, leading to an infinite loop when two files include each other.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -  Unrestricted recursive includes in AsciiDoc processing.
    -  Lack of proper cycle detection in the `Gitlab::Asciidoc::IncludeProcessor`.
    -  Inefficient processing of nested includes leading to resource exhaustion.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial of Service (DoS): The infinite loop caused by recursive includes leads to excessive CPU consumption, eventually causing the request to timeout after 60 seconds and potentially affecting the entire site.
    - Resource Exhaustion: The server's CPU is heavily utilized due to the infinite loop.

- **Attack vectors:**
    -  Uploading specially crafted AsciiDoc files that include each other recursively using the `include::` directive.
    -  Accessing these malicious files through the web interface which triggers the `Gitlab::Asciidoc::IncludeProcessor`.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to create or modify AsciiDoc files within a GitLab repository.
    - The attacker needs to have access to the GitLab instance (user account) to exploit this vulnerability
