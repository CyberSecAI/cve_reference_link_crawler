Based on the provided information, all the commits relate to the same vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `dc->clk_mgr` pointer is not checked for NULL before being dereferenced within the `dc->hwss.apply_idle_power_optimizations` call. This function pointer can resolve to `dcn35_apply_idle_power_optimizations` which dereferences `dc->clk_mgr`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the AMD display driver.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A null pointer dereference can lead to a system crash or other undefined behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when `dc->hwss.apply_idle_power_optimizations` is called and `dc->clk_mgr` is NULL. This is related to how the display driver is initialized and configured, which likely occurs during normal system operation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would likely need to have control over the system and the ability to manipulate how the display driver is initialized or configured, or influence conditions that would lead to `dc->clk_mgr` being null when `dc->hwss.apply_idle_power_optimizations` is called.

**Additional details:**
- The provided commit messages and code diffs provide more details than the basic CVE description. They clearly identify the specific file, function, and condition leading to the null pointer dereference. The fix involves adding a null check for `dc->clk_mgr` before calling `dc->hwss.apply_idle_power_optimizations`. This prevents the dereference of the potentially null pointer, resolving the vulnerability.
