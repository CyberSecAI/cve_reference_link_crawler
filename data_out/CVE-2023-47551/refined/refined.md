- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Donations Made Easy â€“ Smart Donations plugin (versions <= 4.0.12) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks sufficient CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions. The specific impact varies on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could create a malicious website or inject malicious code into another website, tricking an authenticated user into submitting a forged request while logged into the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website while the user is logged in to the affected WordPress site. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated themselves to initiate the attack.
