{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of channel numbers in the ad7124 ADC driver. Channel numbering must start at 0 and be sequential without any gaps. If non-sequential channel numbers are used, it's possible to cause an overflow when allocating storage for channels.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper bounds checking on channel numbers.",
      "Potential for out-of-bounds memory access due to channel number overflow."
    ],
    "impact": "The overflow can lead to unexpected behavior, including crashes or other undefined behavior within the kernel.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a device tree configuration with non-sequential channel numbers.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to configure the device tree for the system, which typically requires root or administrative access."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided patches add a check to ensure that channel indices are within the valid range, preventing the overflow. This fix was introduced to address a bug where the driver didn't properly handle arbitrary ordering of child nodes, and was fixed by ensuring the channel numbers were sequential. The fix includes a check to verify that channel is less than indio_dev->num_channels."
