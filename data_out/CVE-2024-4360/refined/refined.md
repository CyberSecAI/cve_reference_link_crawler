Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the Element Pack Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress. Specifically, user-supplied attributes like 'title\_tag' are not properly handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to sanitize the 'title_tag' attribute, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject malicious scripts into pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This could lead to:
  -  Malicious redirects
  -  Session hijacking
  -  Defacement
  -  Data theft
  -  Other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin's widgets that utilize the vulnerable 'title\_tag' attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have contributor-level access or higher to the WordPress site. This level of access allows them to modify page content and inject the malicious script through the vulnerable plugin settings.
