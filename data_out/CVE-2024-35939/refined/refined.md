The provided content relates to a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's DMA (Direct Memory Access) subsystem, specifically within the `dma-direct.c` file, and is related to the handling of encrypted memory on systems utilizing Intel's TDX (Trust Domain Extensions). This aligns with CVE-2024-35939.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly handle errors returned by `dma_set_decrypted()`. This function is used to decrypt memory pages allocated for DMA operations, particularly in the context of Intel TDX, where the untrusted host can cause the decryption to fail.
- Previously, if `dma_set_decrypted()` failed, the allocated memory pages would be freed. However, these pages might have been left in a decrypted state which is a security risk.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Error Handling:** The core vulnerability is the incorrect handling of `dma_set_decrypted()` failures. The code would attempt to free memory pages even if the decryption process failed.
- **Potential Exposure of Decrypted Memory:** Due to potential failures during the decryption process, the shared memory might be returned decrypted to the page allocator, creating the risk that a different user/process could get access to the decrypted data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** If `dma_set_decrypted()` fails, the decrypted shared memory pages could potentially be returned to the page allocator in a decrypted state which can then be accessed by other processes/users, leaking sensitive information.
- **Functional Issues:**  Returning decrypted memory could lead to various functional issues as well.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a malicious or compromised untrusted host (in the context of TDX) which can trigger a failure in the `set_memory_encrypted()` or `set_memory_decrypted()` functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Untrusted Host Access:** The attacker would need control or influence over the untrusted host in a system utilizing Intel TDX.
- **Ability to Trigger `set_memory_encrypted`/`set_memory_decrypted` Failure:** The attacker would need the ability to cause the `set_memory_encrypted()` or `set_memory_decrypted()` function to fail.

**Mitigation:**
The fix involves modifying the error handling within `dma_direct_alloc` and `dma_direct_alloc_pages` to leak the pages instead of freeing them when `dma_set_decrypted()` fails. This prevents the potentially decrypted shared memory from being returned to the page allocator and mitigates the risk of information exposure. Specifically, instead of calling `__dma_direct_free_pages`, the code now jumps to the `out_leak_pages` label which simply returns `NULL` without freeing the pages.

**Summary of Changes:**
- In `kernel/dma/direct.c`, within functions `dma_direct_alloc` and `dma_direct_alloc_pages`, when `dma_set_decrypted` fails, the code now jumps to `out_leak_pages`, which does not free the allocated memory. The previous behavior was to jump to `out_free_pages` which freed the memory.
