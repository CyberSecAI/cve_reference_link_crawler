Subject: CVE-2023-52291: Apache StreamPark (incubating): Unchecked maven
 build params could trigger remote command execution

Severity: low

Affected versions:

- Apache StreamPark (incubating) 2.0.0 before 2.1.4

Description:

In streampark, the project module integrates Maven's compilation capabilities. The input parameter validation is not strict, allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low.

Background:

In the "Project" module, the maven build args  “<” operator causes command injection. e.g : “< (curl  <http://xxx.com> )” will be executed as a command injection,

Mitigation:

all users should upgrade to 2.1.4,  The "<" operator will blocked。
