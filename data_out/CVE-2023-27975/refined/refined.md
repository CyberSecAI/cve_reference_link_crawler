The provided document is a security notification from Schneider Electric, detailing multiple vulnerabilities affecting their products. Here's the breakdown for CVE-2023-27975:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficiently Protected Credentials.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Credentials used to access project files within EcoStruxure™ Control Expert are not adequately protected.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to the project file. This could allow an attacker to view, modify, or steal sensitive information or the control logic of the PLC.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local user tampering with the memory of the engineering workstation running EcoStruxure™ Control Expert.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the engineering workstation where EcoStruxure™ Control Expert is running and be able to tamper with its memory. They also need some level of access that will allow them to open the project file, even if it's just in the software itself after memory tampering.

**Affected Products and Versions**

- EcoStruxure™ Control Expert versions prior to v16.0
- EcoStruxure™ Process Expert versions prior to v2023

**Remediation:**

- Update EcoStruxure™ Control Expert to version 16.0 or later.
- Update EcoStruxure™ Process Expert to version 2023 or later.
- Applying the patch is highly recommended. Test the patch in a development environment before deploying to production.

**Mitigation (if patching is not possible):**
- Enable an application password in the project properties.
- Enable encryption on application project and store application files in secure location with restricted access only for legitimate users.
- Use McAfee Application and Change Control software.
- Follow workstation, network, and site-hardening guidelines.
- Do not export and store application files outside the EcoStruxure Process Expert database
