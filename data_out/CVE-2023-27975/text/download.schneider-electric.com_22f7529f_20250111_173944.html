EcoStruxure™ Control Expert, EcoStruxure™ Process Expert and
Modicon M340, M580 and M580 Safety PLCs

13 February 2024 (13 August 2024)

Overview

Schneider Electric is aware of multiple vulnerabilities in its EcoStruxure™ Control Expert ,
EcoStruxure™ Process Expert and Modicon M340, M580 PLCs (Programmable Logic
Controllers).

Modicon PLCs control and monitor industrial operations. EcoStruxure™ Control Expert is the
common programming, debugging and operating software for Modicon PLCs. EcoStruxure™
Process Expert DCS is a single automation system to engineer, operate, and maintain an entire
plant Infrastructure.

Failure to apply the remediations provided below may risk unauthorized access to your PLC,
which could result in the possibility of denial of service and loss of confidentiality, integrity of the
controller.

August 2024 Update: A remediation is available for the Modicon M580 CPU Safety (page 3).

Note regarding vulnerability details: The severity of vulnerabilities was calculated using the
CVSS Base metrics in version 3.1 (CVSS v3.1) without incorporating the Temporal and
Environmental metrics. Schneider Electric recommends that customers score the CVSS
Environmental metrics, which are specific to end-user organizations, and consider factors such
as the presence of mitigations in that environment. Environmental metrics may refine the
relative severity posed by the vulnerabilities described in this document within a customer’s
environment.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for

that device.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

Practices document.
