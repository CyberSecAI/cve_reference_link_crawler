Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39322:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the `@keystone-6/core` package not properly applying field-level access control for `multiselect` fields. Specifically, the configuration options `label`, `access`, `graphql`, `isFilterable`, and `isOrderable` were not being propagated correctly for the `multiselect` field type.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Field-level Access Control Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the bypass of field-level access controls defined for `multiselect` fields. This means that access restrictions intended to limit create and update operations were not being enforced.
- **Incorrect Configuration Propagation:**  The `multiselect` field type was not correctly using provided configuration options, which led to the access control bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Attackers could potentially create or modify `multiselect` field data without proper authorization if field-level access controls are in place. This can lead to data integrity issues if non-admin users create data that should be restricted.
- **Compromised Data Confidentiality:** Depending on the specific application, this vulnerability could also expose sensitive data or affect confidentiality if unauthorized users gain access via modifying the fields.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **No special user privileges required:** Attackers could exploit the vulnerability without needing any special privileges.
- **No user interaction required:**  The exploit does not require any interaction from other users.
- **Access to the application:**  The attacker would need network access to the application using the vulnerable version of `@keystone-6/core`.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions `2.2.0` and `2.3.0` of the `@keystone-6/core` package.
- It only affects the `multiselect` field type.
- List-level access control is not impacted.
- The fix is available in version `2.3.1` of `@keystone-6/core`.
- The CVSS score is 9.1, indicating a critical severity.
- The CVSS vector is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N`
