# Field-level access-control bypass for multiselect field

Critical

[dcousens](/dcousens)
published
GHSA-6mhr-52mv-6v6f
Oct 18, 2022

## Package

npm

@keystone-6/core
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

2.2.0 || 2.3.0

## Patched versions

2.3.1

## Description

#### Impact

`@keystone-6/core@2.2.0 || 2.3.0` users who are using the `multiselect` field, and provided field-level access control - are vulnerable to their field-level access control not being used.

List-level access control is **NOT** affected.

Field-level access control for fields other than `multiselect` are **NOT** affected.

Example, **you are vulnerable if** you are using field-level access control on a `multiselect` like the following:

```
const yourList = list({
  access: {
    // this is list-level access control, this is NOT impacted
  },
  fields: {
    yourFieldName: multiselect({
      // this is field-level access control, for multiselect fields
      //   this is vulnerable
      access: {
        create: ({ session }) => session?.data.isAdmin,
        update: ({ session }) => session?.data.isAdmin,
      },
      options: [
        { value: 'apples', label: 'Apples' },
        { value: 'oranges', label: 'Oranges' },
      ],
      // ...
    }),
    // ...
  },
  // ...
});
```
#### Mitigation

Please upgrade to `@keystone-6/core >= 2.3.1`, where this vulnerability has been closed.

#### Workarounds

If for some reason you cannot upgrade your dependencies, you should stop using the `multiselect` field.

#### Credits

Thanks to [Marek R](https://github.com/marekryb) for reporting and submitting the pull request to fix this problem.

If you have any questions around this security advisory, please don't hesitate to contact us at security@keystonejs.com, or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/issues/new/choose).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
