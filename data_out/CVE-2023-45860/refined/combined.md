<= 5.1.7

5.3.5
5.2.5

## Description

### Impact

In Hazelcast Platform through 5.3.4, a security issue exists within the SQL mapping for the CSV File Source connector. This issue arises from inadequate permission checking, which could enable unauthorized clients to access data from files stored on a member's filesystem.

### Patches

Fix versions: 5.3.5, 5.4.0-BETA-1

### Workaround

Disabling Hazelcast Jet processing engine in Hazelcast member configuration workarounds the issue. As a result SQL and Jet jobs won't work.

### Severity

Moderate

6.5

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

`SqlConnector#resolveAndValidateFields` may try to resolve field names from metadata and a sample. This is not covered by any permission check.

Added `SqlConnector#permissionsForResolve` that returns permissions required to run the `resolveAndValidateFields`. Propagation of SqlSecurityContext was required for the actuall permission check.

Added permission to ProcessorSupplier returned by ReadFilesP.MetaSupplier (previously this allowed constructing unsecured DAG):
