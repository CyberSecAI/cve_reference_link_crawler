Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from inadequate permission checks in the SQL mapping for the CSV File Source connector within Hazelcast Platform. Specifically, the `SqlConnector#resolveAndValidateFields` method could resolve field names from metadata and samples without proper permission checks. Additionally, the `ReadFilesP.MetaSupplier` allowed constructing unsecured DAGs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Insufficient Permission Checks:** The primary weakness was the lack of permission checks when resolving field names from metadata or samples in the CSV file source connector.
- **Unsecured DAG Construction:** The `ReadFilesP.MetaSupplier` allowed the construction of unsecured Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), potentially bypassing security measures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Successful exploitation allows unauthorized clients to access data from files stored on a member's file system.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** The vulnerability leads to a high impact on data confidentiality, as unauthorized users can gain access to sensitive file data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs low privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to interact with the Hazelcast cluster.
- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required for exploitation.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability was identified as HZ-2991 internally.
- The fix includes adding `SqlConnector#permissionsForResolve` to enforce permission checks and adding permission to `ProcessorSupplier` returned by `ReadFilesP.MetaSupplier`.
- The vulnerability affects Hazelcast versions:
  - >= 5.3.0, <= 5.3.4
  - >= 5.2.0, <= 5.2.4
  - <= 5.1.7
- Patched versions: 5.3.5 and 5.2.5
- A workaround is disabling the Hazelcast Jet processing engine, which will also prevent SQL and Jet jobs from functioning.
- The vulnerability was fixed by multiple commits, including:
    - `5d6db2abe579805a177be601850d8ca6d2f2696c` - Check permission before resolving mapping fields.
    - `ee7e96933748283a01428e306e1b886b06b8a5ba` - Prevent another file read.
    - `5bebb05beea20fb5afb0a3a4f101a402ee5b6fd4` - Move PS to SecuredFunctions.
- Backports for the fix were created for 5.3.z, 5.2.z and 5.1.z branches.
