You can deselect this option to disable certification verification for LDAP Credential vaults. If you enable certification verification, you must perform the following steps:

2. Run the command c\_rehash.
3. Restart the Privileged Account Manager service by using the /etc/init.d/npum restart command.
#### For Windows Manager

Add the LDAP CA certificate to the Trusted Root List.

1. Right-click the cert format certificate.
2. Install the certificate and follow the subsequent steps to add it to the Computer level trusted root list.

   *NOTE:*You can also run the certificate management tool mmc > Add the Certificates Snapin or Certim.msc. Import the CA certificate into the trusted tool certificate list.
#### For SLES

Run the update-ca-certificates command. The directory of CA certificates trust anchors used by administrators is /etc/pki/trust/anchors.

#### For RHEL

To add a certificate in PEM or DER file format to the CA trusted list on the system:

1. Add the certificate as a new file to /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ directory.
2. Run update-ca-trust.
