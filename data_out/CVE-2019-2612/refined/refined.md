  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is within the Outside In Technology component, specifically during the processing of certain file formats.",
    "weaknesses": "Improper input validation or handling during file processing.",
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability, depending on how the affected software uses the Outside In Technology code.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted file. This could occur when a user opens a malicious file, or when a server application processes data received over a network that is passed to the vulnerable Outside In Technology code.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted file to an application that uses vulnerable versions of Oracle Outside In Technology. This could be achieved through user interaction (e.g. user opening malicious file) or by exploiting server applications that process attacker-controlled data."
