This vulnerability is due to incomplete error checking when parsing an HTTP header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to a targeted web server on a device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition when the device reloads.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-websrvs-dos-X8gNucD2>  For more information on the vulnerability that is described in this advisory, see [Cisco Event Response: Attacks Against Cisco Firewall Platforms](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/asa_ftd_attacks_event_response).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software if they have one or more of the vulnerable configurations listed in the following two tables.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine Whether an ASA or FTD Device Is Affected To determine whether a device that is running Cisco ASA Software or FTD Software is affected, use the **show asp table socket | include SSL** command and look for an SSL listen socket on *any*TCP port. If a socket is present in the output, the device should be considered vulnerable. The following example shows the output for a Cisco ASA device with two SSL listen sockets on TCP port 443 and TCP port 8443:  ```   ciscoasa#  show asp table socket | include SSLSSL       00185038  LISTEN     172.16.0.250:443    0.0.0.0:*SSL       00188638  LISTEN      10.0.0.250:8443    0.0.0.0:*      ```  **ASA Software Vulnerable Configuration**  In the following table, the left column lists Cisco ASA Software features that are potentially vulnerable. The right column indicates the basic configuration for the feature from the **show running-config** CLI command, if it can be determined. These features could cause the SSL listen sockets to be enabled.       | Cisco ASA Software Feature | Possible Vulnerable Configuration |   | --- | --- |   | AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (with client services) | crypto ikev2 enable [...] client-services port |   | Local Certificate Authority (CA)1 | crypto ca server no shutdown |   | Management Web Server Access (including ASDM and CSM)2 | http server enablehttp |   | Mobile User Security (MUS) | webvpn mus password mus server enable port mus |   | REST API3 | rest-api image disk0:/rest-api agent |   | SSL VPN | webvpn enable |      1. In Cisco ASA Software Release 9.13 and later, Local CA is deprecated and has been removed.   2. Management Web Server Access would only be vulnerable from an IP address in the configured **http** command range.   3. REST API is vulnerable only from an IP address in the configured **http** command range. **FTD Software Vulnerable Configuration**  In the following table, the left column lists Cisco FTD Software features that are potentially vulnerable. The right column indicates the basic configuration for the feature from the **show running-config** CLI command, if it can be determined. These features could cause the SSL listen sockets to be enabled.       | Cisco FTD Software Feature | Possible Vulnerable Configuration |   | --- | --- |   | AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (with client services)1,2 | crypto ikev2 enable [...] client-services port |   | AnyConnect SSL VPN1,2 | webvpn enable |   | HTTP server enabled3 | http server enablehttp |      1. Remote access VPN features are enabled from **Devices > VPN > Remote Access** in Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software or from **Device > Remote Access VPN** in Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM).   2. Remote access VPN features are first supported as of Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.2.   3. The HTTP feature is enabled from **Firepower Threat Defense Platform Settings > HTTP** in the Cisco FMC Console.   Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products and services listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco FMC Software.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
