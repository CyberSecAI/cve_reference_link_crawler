Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to incomplete error checking when parsing an HTTP header in the management and VPN web servers of Cisco ASA and FTD software.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Improper handling of HTTP headers.
    *   Lack of proper error checking when processing HTTP requests.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   A successful exploit can cause the affected device to reload unexpectedly.
    *   This reload results in a denial of service (DoS) condition, disrupting network operations.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Remote, unauthenticated attacker.
    *   The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable web server on the targeted device.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
    *   No authentication is required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability has been exploited in the wild.
*   The advisory provides commands to check if an ASA or FTD device is vulnerable (using `show asp table socket | include SSL`).
*   The advisory lists the affected software features that could cause the SSL listen sockets to be enabled.
*   There are no workarounds, and Cisco recommends upgrading to fixed software.
