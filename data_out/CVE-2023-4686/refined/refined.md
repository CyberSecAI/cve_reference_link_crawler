        *   Protected posts.
        *   Trashed posts.
        *   Pages.
        *   Other post types such as galleries.
    *   Exposed post titles and slugs could reveal internal content, drafts, or organizational information not intended for public view.

    *   The vulnerability is triggered via the publicly accessible `ajax_enabled_posts` function.
    *   The attacker sends a crafted AJAX request to this endpoint.
