- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of permission control in the "Axepta" module for PrestaShop allows unauthorized access to debug logs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information through debug logs, specifically a lack of access control allowing guests to download logs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exposure of private personal information including partial credit card details (expiry date), postal addresses, and email addresses. This is also a GDPR violation.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No privileges or user interaction required; an attacker needs only network access to the vulnerable PrestaShop instance.
