  "cve": "CVE-2024-35235",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The `cupsd` server, when configured with a `Listen` directive pointing to a symbolic link, attempts to `unlink` the target path and then bind to it as a domain socket. If either operation fails, due to, for example, AppArmor preventing the `unlink` on a symlink, or a race condition where the symlink is recreated before the bind, the server will proceed to change the file permissions of the target to world-writable using `chmod`, even if the binding failed.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The code does not properly check the return value of `unlink` and `bind` before proceeding to `chmod`.",
        "The code uses `chmod` on a path controlled by the user, not an explicit file descriptor, which could result in modification of an unintended target if the path is a symlink."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can cause the `cupsd` process to perform an arbitrary `chmod` operation, making any file world writable if they can cause a bind to a symbolic link to fail. Since `cupsd` often runs as root, this can be leveraged to escalate privileges.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack requires modifying the `/etc/cups/cupsd.conf` file to contain a `Listen` directive with a path that resolves to a symbolic link. This can be done via a race condition or with a separate vulnerability that allows writing to the configuration file.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to modify the `cupsd.conf` file to include a malicious `Listen` directive. They also need to be able to trigger a situation where the `unlink` and/or `bind` call fails, such as by planting a symlink in a location that will be later be called by `bind`."
    }
  ],
  "additional_details": {
     "vulnerability_chain": "This vulnerability was found as part of a larger chain in Ubuntu 24.04, where the ability to make arbitrary files world-writable leads to further vulnerabilities including the capability to execute commands with specific users and groups. This was achieved by modifying the cupsd.conf and cups-files.conf configuration files and using a FoomaticRIPCommandLine printer config. The issue is compounded by a race condition where a symlink can be created after the initial unlink, ensuring the bind fails and the chmod occurs.",
     "fix_description": "The suggested fix includes opening the configured paths using `openat` with `O_NOFOLLOW`, followed by using `fchmod` in place of `chmod`. Additionally, the return value of the `bind` call should be checked before proceeding to `chmod`.",
    "debug_print_issues":"The use of `DEBUG_printf` without saving and restoring `errno` might make the `errno == ENOENT` check unreliable as `DEBUG_printf` itself can overwrite it."
