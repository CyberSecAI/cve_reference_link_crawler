This is a pretty confusing description... if we accept the premise that an
attacker can somehow get root to run cupsd with a modified configuration
file (how???), then this patch doesn't seem sufficient. They can still
get root to unlink() an arbitrary file, no?

I guess someone from CUPS has seen a working Ubuntu exploit that did
this, but this really feels like fixing the bug in the wrong place?
