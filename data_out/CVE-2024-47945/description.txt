The devices are vulnerable to session hijacking due to insufficient 
entropy in its session ID generation algorithm. The session IDs are 
predictable, with only 32,768 possible values per user, which allows 
attackers to pre-generate valid session IDs, leading to unauthorized 
access to user sessions. This is not only due to the use of an 
(insecure) rand() function call but also because of missing 
initialization via srand(). As a result only the PIDs are effectively 
used as seed.
