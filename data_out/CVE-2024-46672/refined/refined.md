The provided content relates to a vulnerability in the brcmfmac driver in the Linux kernel, specifically concerning the handling of PMKSA (Pairwise Master Key Security Association) deletion commands.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `brcmf_pmksa_v3_op` function in the `brcmfmac/cfg80211.c` driver, which was not correctly handling PMKSA deletion requests based on SSID (Service Set Identifier). Specifically, when the wpa_supplicant sends an SSID-based PMKSA deletion command, the driver attempts to dereference the `bssid` and `pmkid` pointers, which may be NULL in these cases, leading to a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Null pointer dereference:** The code directly accesses the `bssid` and `pmkid` members of a `cfg80211_pmksa` structure without checking if they are valid, resulting in a null pointer dereference when SSID-based PMKSA deletion commands are received with NULL `bssid` and `pmkid` values.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Kernel crash:** The null pointer dereference can lead to a kernel crash, resulting in denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious or compromised wpa_supplicant can send crafted PMKSA deletion commands with only the SSID and no BSSID or PMKID.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to influence or control the wpa_supplicant daemon running on the affected system. This likely requires root or sufficient privileges to manipulate the Wi-Fi configuration.

The provided patches address this by checking if the bssid and pmkid members of the pmksa structure are valid, before attempting to access them. Additionally, the patches also copy the ssid into the relevant structure to support SSID based PMKSA updates.
