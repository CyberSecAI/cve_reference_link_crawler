Root cause of vulnerability: The plugin lacks CSRF protection in some areas and fails to sanitize and escape user inputs.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
  - Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored in the plugin settings. This script will execute when a user accesses the affected settings page within the plugin.

Attack vectors:
  - The attacker crafts a malicious HTML form that, when opened by a logged-in administrator, submits a crafted request to the vulnerable plugin's settings page.
  - This is achieved by exploiting the missing CSRF check.
  - The malicious payload is injected into the email setting due to the lack of sanitization and escaping.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - The attacker needs to trick a logged-in WordPress administrator into opening a malicious HTML page or accessing a malicious link.
  - The attacker does not need to be authenticated but needs a valid admin user to be logged in and interact with the malicious form.
