Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The application, "SourceCodester Profile Registration without Reload/Refresh 1.0", fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `full_name` parameter when registering a profile.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. The application does not neutralize user-controllable input (`full_name`) before including it in the output, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The application lacks proper input sanitization or validation, which allows the injection of HTML and JavaScript code into the `full_name` parameter.
*  **CWE-79:** The identified vulnerability aligns with CWE-79 which highlights the failure to neutralize user-controllable input before it's rendered in a web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser.
*   **Compromised User Accounts:** The attacker could potentially steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface the website, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated Registration Request:** The attacker modifies the `full_name` parameter within the registration form (add.php) by injecting a malicious XSS payload, such as `<IMG """><SCRIPT>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>">`
*  **HTTP Request Interception:** The provided example demonstrates how the attacker can intercept the registration request using a tool like Burp Suite and inject the malicious payload.
* **Reflected XSS:** The injected script is then reflected back on the administrator page (admin.php) when the user details are displayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs an understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and how web requests function.
*  **Man-in-the-Middle (Optional):** An attacker can potentially intercept the request using a proxy tool like Burp Suite to modify the payload before sending.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `full_name` in `add.php`
*   **Payload Example:** `%3cIMG%20%22%22%22%3e%3cSCRIPT%3ealert(%22XSS%22)%3c%2fSCRIPT%3e%22%3e` (HTML encoded version of `<IMG """><SCRIPT>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>">`)
*  **Affected Component:** Registration form
*   **Affected File:** `add.php`
