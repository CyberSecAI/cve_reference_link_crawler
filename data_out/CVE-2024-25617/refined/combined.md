# SQUID-2024:2 Denial of Service in HTTP Header parser

High

[yadij](/yadij)
published
GHSA-h5x6-w8mv-xfpr
Feb 14, 2024

## Package

squid

## Affected versions

<6.5

## Patched versions

6.5

## Description

Due to a Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value bug ,

Squid may be vulnerable to a Denial of Service

attack against HTTP header parsing.

---

### Severity:

This problem allows a remote client or a remote server to

perform Denial of Service when sending oversized headers in

HTTP messages.

In versions of Squid prior to 6.5 this can be achieved if the

request\_header\_max\_size or reply\_header\_max\_size settings are

unchanged from the default.

In Squid version 6.5 and later, the default setting of these

parameters is safe. Squid will emit a critical warning in

cache.log if the administrator is setting these parameters to

unsafe values. Squid will not at this time prevent these settings

from being changed to unsafe values.

---

### Updated Packages:

#### Hardening against this issue is added to Squid version 6.5.

In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable

releases can be found in our patch archives:

#### Squid 6:

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v6/SQUID-2024_2.patch>

If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer

to the package vendor for availability information on updated

packages.

---

### Determining if your version is vulnerable:

Run the following command to identify how (and whether)

your Squid has been configured with relevant settings:

```
`squid -k parse 2>&1 | grep header_max_size`

```

All Squid-3.0 up to and including 6.4 without header\_max\_size

settings are vulnerable.

All Squid-3.0 up to and including 6.4 with either header\_max\_size

setting over 21 KB are vulnerable.

All Squid-3.0 up to and including 6.4 with both header\_max\_size

settings below 21 KB are not vulnerable.

All Squid-6.5 and later without header\_max\_size configured

are not vulnerable.

All Squid-6.5 and later configured with both header\_max\_size

settings below 64 KB are not vulnerable.

All Squid-6.5 and later configured with either header\_max\_size

setting over 64 KB are vulnerable.

---

### Workaround:

For Squid older than 6.5, add to squid.conf:

```
  request_header_max_size 21 KB
  reply_header_max_size 21 KB

```

For Squid 6.5 and later, remove `request_header_max_size`

and `reply_header_max_size` from squid.conf

---

### Contact details for the Squid project:

For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions

of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary

package vendor.

If you install and build Squid from the original Squid sources

then the squid-users@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list is your

primary support point. For subscription details see

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html>.

For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest STABLE release

the squid bugzilla database should be used

<https://bugs.squid-cache.org/>.

For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the

squid-bugs@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list. It's a closed

list (though anyone can post) and security related bug reports

are treated in confidence until the impact has been established.

---

### Credits:

This vulnerability was discovered by Joshua Rogers of Opera

Software.

Fixed by The Measurement Factory.

### Revision history:

2023-10-25 11:47:19 UTC Patches Released

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Improve handling of expanding HTTP header values ([#1536](https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/pull/1536))

```
Squid manipulations often increase HTTP header value length compared to
the corresponding raw value received by Squid. Raw header length is
checked against request_header_max_size and reply_header_max_size that
default to 64KB, making the raw value safe to store in a String object
(by default). However, when the increased length of a manipulated value
exceeds String class limits, Squid leaks memory, asserts, or possibly
stalls affected transactions. The long-term fix for this problem is a
complete String elimination from Squid sources, but that takes time.

Known manipulations may effectively concatenate headers and/or increase
header value length by 50%. This workaround makes such known increases
safe by essentially tripling String class limits:

    (64KB + 64KB) * 150% = 3 * 64KB

This bug was discovered and detailed by Joshua Rogers at
<https://megamansec.github.io/Squid-Security-Audit/response-memleaks.html>
where it was filed as "Memory Leak in HTTP Response Parsing".
