{
  "CVE-2022-47003": {
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the authentication bypass vulnerability is a conditional logic flaw in the “remember me” functionality. The `rememberMe()` function checks if `arguments.userHash` has a zero length or if it matches the stored `rsUser.userHash`. If the length is zero, the function proceeds to log in the user using the provided userid.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Authentication bypass due to flawed conditional logic in the rememberMe function",
      "Use of insecure CFMX_COMPAT encryption algorithm.",
       "Information leakage via JSON API which discloses user IDs."
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can log in as any user (Site Member or System User) by exploiting the remember-me functionality.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a request with a valid 'userid' cookie and a blank or specially crafted 'userHash' cookie, an unauthenticated attacker can bypass the authentication and log in as the user specified in the 'userid' cookie.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know a valid 'userid' which can be obtained via the exposed JSON API or other information disclosure methods, and the ability to send HTTP requests with custom cookies."
