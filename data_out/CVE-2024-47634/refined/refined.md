- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress CartBounty plugin (versions <= 8.2) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact will vary case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor could craft a forged request and trick a logged-in user into submitting it (e.g., via a link or image tag).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in user to interact with their malicious content. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
