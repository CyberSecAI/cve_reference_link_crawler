## FAQ

### Does the ChatBot support OpenAI ChatGPT?

OpenAI is now supported with all WPBot WPBot packages. For advanced OpenAI features like fine tuning and GPT Assistants you need the WPBot pro Professional and Master licenses.

### How to train AI with your website data using ChatBot

You can train an OpenAI model with your data using one of the two methods (requires WPBot Pro Professional or Master License): Fine Tuning or GPT Assistant

We suggest using GPT Assistant as this is easier, quicker, and more flexible. Our ChatBot for WordPress WPBot allows you to easily generate a JSON file containing all your website data that you can upload to your GPT Assistant. Here is the step by step process guideline for [How to train AI with your website data using WPBot ChatBot](https://wpbot.pro/docs/knowledgebase/how-to-train-ai-with-your-website-data-using-chatbot/)

### How to save money and reduce OpenAI API cost for your ChatBot

You can **dramatically decrease** the OpenAI API cost by using chatbot for WordPress‚Äôs default features (which are free) in combination with OpenAI.

Here is a short guideline for [How to reduce OpenAI API cost for your ChatBot](https://wpbot.pro/docs/knowledgebase/how-to-save-money-and-reduce-openai-api-cost-for-your-chatbot/)

### Getting Started with OpenAI

Once you add the OpenAI API key, the WPBot should already start working for generic questions. Open a new browser window in Incognito mode and test by asking ‚ÄúWhat is the capital of Japan?‚Äù

Please make sure DialogFlow is Disabled if you want OpenAI to work with the WPBot.

### OpenAI not working. WPBot Keeps loading

If OpenAI is not responding back and the bot is just loading, then likely you hit your OpenAI API usage limit or need to add credit. Please

<

pre-purchase credit to use OpenAI API and increase the Usage limit. You can add credits to your API account from here: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing

### How to get an OpenAI API Key for the WPBot?

Visit your OpenAI API Keys page to retrieve the API key. You can grab the API key for the WPBot from this page: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### Can I use both DialogFlow and OpenAI GPT3 with the WPBot?

No. They will both NOT work together. Please disable DialogFlow if you want OpenAI to work for the WPBot.

### Is my language supported?

WPBot can work with ANY language. Just change the language texts from the WPBot Settings->Change Language to your preferred one.

### Does this ChatBot support multi language?

MultiLanguage is supported with the WPBot Pro Master License. For a multilingual ChatBot for international users grab the WPBot.Pro Master License

### I am not getting emails from the WPBot

The WPBot WPBot uses the WordPress‚Äô default email function. If you are not getting emails from the WPBot‚Äôs email feature, it is likely that no emails are getting through from your WordPress site or they are ending up in the Spam box. Try using an SMTP mailer plugin. Also, try changing the to and from email addresses in the WPBot‚Äôs general settings area.

### I cannot connect the WPBot to DialogFlow

Please Follow the steps in this tutorial correctly: https://www.wpbot.pro/dialogflow-integration/

### Simple text responses are not working or getting an error

WPBot requires mysql version 5.6+ for the simple text responses to work. If your server has a version below that, you might see some PHP error or the Simple Text Responses will not work at all. Please request your hosting support to update the mysql version on your server.

### I changed language or some other settings but do not see them when testing

Please clear the browser cache and **cookies** to see any change you have made. Alternatively, you can open a fresh browser window in incognito mode (Ctrl+Shift+N in chrome) to test your changes. Also, you may need to purge any cache plugin and CDN caching.

### The WPBot is NOT working in the front end.

The most common reason for this is if the theme is coded incorrectly and jQuery is loaded from external source. jQuery is included with WordPress core and according to WordPress standard, jQuery must be included using wp\_enqueue\_script. https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp\_enqueue\_script/ . Please make sure if that is the case in your theme.

Please contact us if you need [further help](https://www.wpbot.pro/free-support/). We take all user feedback sriously.

### The WPBot is stuck on typing or loading

This usually happens if you enabled DialogFlow but did not complete the set up.

### How do I add new conversations to the WPBot?

You can use WPBot to both answer user questions and collect information from the users.

To create answers to user questions you can use:

Simple Text Responses (built-in), FAQ(built-in), Site search(built-in), Product search(built-in Pro feature), DialogFlow(3rd Party) or OpenAI(3rd Party)

To collect information from your users you can use:

Conversational forms(built-in), Mail us(built-in), Call me back(built-in), Collect feedback features(built-in)

The built-in features are all free.

### How do I add Line Breaks?

Please use the br html tag for line breaks.

### Are HTML tags supported?

Yes, common HTML tags link link href, strong, br etc. are supported.

### Does the WPBot support images, GIFs, Videos

Images, GIFs and Youtube Videos are supprted in the pro version. Pro version also includes a handy giphy floating search for easy embed in the language center.
