# Security Bulletin: IBM App Connect Enterprise Certified Container DesignerAuthoring operands that run with designerFlowsOperationMode set to "all" may be vulnerable to loss of confidentiality due to CVE-2022-43922

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM App Connect Enterprise Certified Container DesignerAuthoring operands that run with designerFlowsOperationMode set to "all" would require an API Key to be defined for a cloud-hosted instance of IBM App Connect. If an OpenShift secret was not created manually for this API Key then the IBM App Connect Enterprise Certified Container operator would create the secret, but the name would include a hash based on the API Key. This used a weak hashing algorithm. This bulletin provides patch information to address the reported vulnerability CVE-2022-43922

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2022-43922](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-43922)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| App Connect Enterprise Certified Container | 4.1 |
| App Connect Enterprise Certified Container | 4.2 |
| App Connect Enterprise Certified Container | 5.0-lts |
| App Connect Enterprise Certified Container | 5.1 |
| App Connect Enterprise Certified Container | 5.2 |
| App Connect Enterprise Certified Container | 6.0 |
| App Connect Enterprise Certified Container | 6.1 |
| App Connect Enterprise Certified Container | 6.2 |

## Remediation/Fixes

**App Connect Enterprise Certified Container 4.1, 4.2, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 6.0, 6.1 and 6.2 (Continuous Delivery)**

Upgrade to App Connect Enterprise Certified Container Operator version 7.0.0 or higher, and ensure that all DesignerAuthoring components are at 12.0.7.0-r2 or higher.  Documentation on the upgrade process is available at <https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/app-connect/containers_cd?topic=releases-upgrading-operator>

If the DesignerAuthroing configuration includes the field "spec.ibmCloudAPIKey" and it is set to "ProvideAsASecretInIBMCloudAPIKeySecret" then delete the OpenShift secret referred to in "spec.ibmCloudAPIKeySecret"

Remove the following fields from the DesignerAuthoring definition:

* spec.appConnectInstanceID
* spec.appConnectURL
* spec.ibmCloudAPIKey
* spec.ibmCloudAPIKeySecret
* spec.ibmCloudAPIKeyValue

**App Connect Enterprise Certified Container 5.0 LTS (Long Term Support)**

Upgrade to App Connect Enterprise Certified Container Operator version 5.0.3 or higher, and ensure that all DesignerAuthoring components are at 12.0.7.0-r1-lts or higher.  Documentation on the upgrade process is available at <https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/app-connect-contlts?topic=releases-upgrading-operator>

If the DesignerAuthroing configuration includes the field "spec.ibmCloudAPIKey" and it is set to "ProvideAsASecretInIBMCloudAPIKeySecret" then delete the OpenShift secret referred to in "spec.ibmCloudAPIKeySecret"

Remove the following fields from the DesignerAuthoring definition:

* spec.appConnectInstanceID
* spec.appConnectURL

## Disclaimer

According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.
