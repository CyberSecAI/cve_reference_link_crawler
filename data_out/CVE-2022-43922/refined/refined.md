- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM App Connect Enterprise Certified Container operator, when creating an OpenShift secret for the API Key, uses a weak hashing algorithm to generate the secret name if one is not manually created. This weak hash is based on the API Key itself.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of a weak hashing algorithm to create the secret name. This could expose the API key through the name of the secret
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Loss of confidentiality of the API key. An attacker may gain access to the API Key based on the weak hash being used to generate the secret name
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker could potentially determine the API key based on the weakly hashed secret name.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to identify or have access to the OpenShift secret names and understand that the secret name is derived using a weak hashing algorithm based on the API Key.
