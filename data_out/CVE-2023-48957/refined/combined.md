# Multiple Vulnerabilities Found In PureVPN – One Remains Unpatched

Researchers spotted a couple of security vulnerabilities in PureVPN Desktop clients for Linux that impact users’ privacy. While PureVPN patched one flaw, another RCE vulnerability remains unpatched.

## Numerous PureVPN Vulnerabilities Affected Linux Clients

Security researchers Rafay Baloch and Muhammad Samaak discovered two different vulnerabilities when analyzing PureVPN Linux clients. In his [blog post](https://www.rafaybaloch.com/2023/11/Multiple%20Critical-Vulnerabilities-in-PureVPN.html), Baloch specified the two issues as an IP leak and a remote code execution (under certain conditions).

The IP leak issue was caused by the improper handling of DNS queries by the PureVPN Linux client. Consequently, the vulnerability allowed VPN tunnel bypass, exposing the DNS queries to the ISP or the default DNS servers leaking users’ original IP addresses.

The researchers could verify this vulnerability through a simple IP leak test via Ipleak.net. As demonstrated, the original IP address from Pakistan clearly appeared in the DNS leak test despite being connected to a PureVPN server with Indian IP.

Talking to LHN, Baloch deemed this vulnerability “as severe as an RCE” because it fails to serve the entire purpose of using a VPN.

The second vulnerability is a remote code execution that existed due to how the PureVPN Linux client works. An adversary could exploit this vulnerability for malicious purposes, such as stealing credentials, bypassing app whitelists, and triggering denial of service. Describing the exact issue, the post reads,

> When the login button is activated, a system call called ‘opennat()’ is initiated. This system call aims to load the ‘libnssckbi.so’ shared library file from a location that allows user-writable access… However, it is essential to note that the specified path lacks the existence of the ‘libnssckbi.so’ file.
>  This presents a security vulnerability, potentially enabling malicious actors to execute arbitrary code by placing a file named ‘libnssckbi.so’ in the designated path.

The following video serves as a PoC for the PureVPN remote code execution flaw.

## PureVPN Patched The IP Leak – But The RCE Awaits An Appropriate Fix

Upon discovering the flaws, the researchers reported the matter to PureVPN. In response, PureVPN fixed the IP leak issue but refused to address the RCE flaw.

Despite being a severe issue, exploiting the RCE flaw requires local access to the target system. Besides, analyzing the root cause of this code execution vulnerability made evident a broader issue affecting many other applications too. This vulnerability didn’t typically affect PureVPN; rather, it existed in Chromium’s Electron software framework that powers PureVPN, Google Chrome, Slack, and more, making all the apps similarly vulnerable.

That’s what PureVPN and Google Chrome highlighted in their responses to Baloch’s report. Consequently, while PureVPN put the onus of addressing the flaw on Google, the latter simply deemed the matter as out of the scope of its threat model.

However, Baloch noted that the vulnerability shouldn’t be taken lightly for a critical application like PureVPN.  Commenting on his interaction with PureVPN regarding the bug disclosure, Baloch told LHN,

> The response was satisfactory; however, I expected a more aggressive response given that they are a security company, and user privacy is their primary concern. The RCE has been marked as “Won’t fix.” However, especially for a VPN service that users rely on for enhanced privacy and security, this should have been addressed.

## Watch Out For VPN Issues

While security vulnerabilities are always risky, they are particularly dangerous for VPN users as they directly impact users’ online privacy. Therefore, whenever such reports surface online, users must pay attention to the matter and ponder over continuing their VPN use until bug fixes.

For example, in September, [AtlasVPN made it to the news for a zero-day](https://latesthackingnews.com/2023/09/11/avoid-using-atlas-vpn-until-a-fix-arrives-for-the-zero-day/) affecting its Linux clients. While the service pledged to deliver a fix, it took them a few days to release the patch. Until then, the users remained vulnerable to exploits unless they stopped using the service.

In the case of the recently discovered PureVPN vulnerabilities, the unpatched RCE flaw isn’t as dangerous since it typically requires local access from an attacker. Nonetheless, users who cannot surely prevent unwarranted local access to their devices must remain careful about PureVPN’s use until the matter gets fixed.

Absolutely right, but this issue is not going to fix in purevpn until they remove big political micromanagingment team. And, yes they’re fixing politically instead of improve the code quality.

Multiple Critical Vulnerabilities in PureVPN - Remote Code Execution + IP Leak

# Multiple Critical Vulnerabilities in PureVPN - Remote Code Execution + IP Leak

[10:55 AM](https://www.rafaybaloch.com/2023/11/Multiple%20Critical-Vulnerabilities-in-PureVPN.html "permanent link")

###

### Introduction

This blog
post highlights two vulnerabilities found in PureVPN, one being an IP leak,
which is as bad as an RCE in the VPN world, and the other being Remote Code
Execution in certain conditions. PureVPN is a very popular VPN that has been in
the game for more than a decade and has slowly started entering into other
security products.

### PureVPN DNS Leak Issue

#

The first
vulnerability is straight forward in PureVPN’s Desktop client for Linux. DNS
leaks, a common concern among VPN’s, which can inadvertently expose a user's
browsing history to their Internet Service Provider (ISP) or other prying
entities, even when the user is securely connected to a VPN.

This
vulnerability arises because the PureVPN Linux client fails to properly handle
DNS queries, allowing them to bypass the VPN tunnel and be sent directly to the
ISP or default DNS servers. This flaw was effectively demonstrated using
Ipleak.net, a tool designed to detect IP and DNS leaks.

### Code Execution via missing lib file

#

During a
dynamic analysis of the PureVPN Linux client, we noticed that when the login
button is activated, a system call called 'opennat()' is initiated. This system
call aims to load the 'libnssckbi.so' shared library file from a location that
allows user-writable access. Dynamic loading is a mechanism that allows an
application to load a library into its address space during runtime, rather
than at compile time. However, it is essential to note that the specified path
lacks the existence of the 'libnssckbi.so' file.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj1R2wiAsiOOzDVWrWGHDJpQBeBKyfYyXEtK2xfuKJLcwhMkQ-7euKGmOIwLBWxUna3g1Kj2Y0IiTkAYKW9y2sQ3KcpKySRj2GgB_9plVYwSkXypJ6rByfJ30Dmeus4Hwghe4uNsfakzouEG9lw7iNzPFgGiOfY05si_KN-SGjohA7niOT16TWMCDzbJoE=w640-h98)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj1R2wiAsiOOzDVWrWGHDJpQBeBKyfYyXEtK2xfuKJLcwhMkQ-7euKGmOIwLBWxUna3g1Kj2Y0IiTkAYKW9y2sQ3KcpKySRj2GgB_9plVYwSkXypJ6rByfJ30Dmeus4Hwghe4uNsfakzouEG9lw7iNzPFgGiOfY05si_KN-SGjohA7niOT16TWMCDzbJoE)This
presents a security vulnerability, potentially enabling malicious actors to
execute arbitrary code by placing a file named 'libnssckbi.so' in the
designated path. Furthermore, the root cause analysis has unveiled a broader
issue affecting applications that rely on the Chromium engine. Any such
application, when used on an Ubuntu-based system, becomes susceptible to this
issue.
### Potential Implications:

**Malicious Code Execution:** By exploiting this vulnerability an
attacker can inject, and execute, malicious code. The attacker can use this behaviour
to bypass the application whitelisting rules.

**Denial of Service (DoS) Attack:** Substituting the 'libnssckbi.so'
file not only exposes users to security risks but also disrupts the
functionality of the PureVPN application. This dual impact makes it a serious
concern.

**Phishing Threats:** As an extension of this vulnerability, an
attacker could potentially create fake login prompts for PureVPN, tricking
users into revealing sensitive information, falling victim to phishing
attempts.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

## **PureVPN’s Response**

PureVPN
responded by acknowledging the IP leak vulnerability and fixed it in the
subsequent release. Whereas, the RCE, PureVPN termed as “Won’t Fix” and
responded with the following:

“*We appreciate your efforts and responsibly
sharing your findings. We looked at your report thoroughly to find the root
cause of the problem in our code.*

*Our Linux application is based on Electron
which uses Chromium engine. While we have been able to reproduce your finding,
we were not able to find the vulnerable code in our repository. Upon initial
analysis, we have identified that the lookup for 'libnssckbi.so' from the path
'/home/$username/.pki/nssdb/libnssckbi.so' is done by Chromium itself and the
same behaviour has been observed in other applications using Chromium such as
Google Chrome and Slack (Screenshots / video attached for your reference).*

*Based on your POC, it appears that the PureVPN
app itself does not provide any vector for injection or remote code execution
attack unless the system is already breached and running this app. Same goes
with Slack and Google Chrome as well. Please see the below snippets and
attached screen recording for reference.*

*Reported issue does not require any action from
our side as it has to be fixed in the Chromium project. We would appreciate it
if you also may provide any recommendation for the current scenario.”*

## **Google’s Response**

It is worth
noting that this issue was responsibly reported to the Chromium project;
however, the response was not entirely satisfactory, as they deemed such
vulnerabilities as low impact and local attacks are normally not part of their
threat model.

**Credits**The vulnerability was discovered by "**[Rafay Baloch](https://twitter.com/rafaybaloch)"** and "**Muhammad Samaak"**.
## Conclusion

In case of PureVPN, the impact of this vulnerability is notably
higher due to the potential for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. A malicious
actor could replace the 'libnssckbi.so' file, rendering the PureVPN application
unusable. While it is true that each application has its own threat model, and
just because a vulnerability exists in one application does not mean it is
acceptable in another, especially in a VPN, which users rely on for enhanced
privacy and security.
