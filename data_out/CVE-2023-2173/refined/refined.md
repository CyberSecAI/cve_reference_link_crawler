Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-2173

**Description:** The `BadgeOS` plugin is vulnerable to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper authorization and validation checks within the following functions:

*   `badgeos_delete_step_ajax_handler`
*   `badgeos_delete_award_step_ajax_handler`
*   `badgeos_delete_deduct_step_ajax_handler`
*   `badgeos_delete_rank_req_step_ajax_handler`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The plugin does not properly verify if the authenticated user has the rights to perform delete operations on the specified posts.
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The mentioned AJAX handlers directly use user-supplied `step_id` to perform deletion, bypassing necessary authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can delete arbitrary posts on the WordPress site. This includes posts related to achievements, points, and ranks, potentially disrupting the functionality and data of the plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests to the plugin's AJAX endpoints.
*   The attacker must be an authenticated user (at least subscriber level permissions) to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have a valid user account with at least subscriber-level permissions on the WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to send a crafted AJAX request to the vulnerable handlers, with the `step_id` of the post that needs to be deleted.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Alex Thomas of Wordfence.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions of BadgeOS up to and including 3.7.1.6.
*   There is no known patch available for this vulnerability.

**In summary:** This IDOR vulnerability in the BadgeOS plugin allows authenticated users with low privileges to delete arbitrary posts by directly manipulating the 'step_id' parameter in AJAX requests. This poses a significant risk to the integrity and availability of the affected WordPress sites.
