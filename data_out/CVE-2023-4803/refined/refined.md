The provided content contains information about CVE-2023-4803.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in the Insider Threat Management (ITM) Server's web console, specifically within the WriteWindowTitle endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The WriteWindowTitle endpoint does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An authenticated administrator can use this vulnerability to run arbitrary JavaScript within another web console administrator's browser. This can lead to:
*   Session hijacking
*   Data theft
*   Malicious actions on behalf of the victim
*   Other malicious activities that can be performed with the permissions of the victim

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An authenticated administrator can craft a malicious request to the WriteWindowTitle endpoint, embedding JavaScript code in the input. When another administrator accesses the manipulated data, the injected script will execute in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker must be an authenticated administrator of the ITM server's web console.
* The attacker needs to trick another administrator into accessing the malicious data.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the ITM server prior to 7.14.3.69.
*   The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS score of 4.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).
*   The advisory also mentions CVE-2023-4802 which is a similar XSS vulnerability within the UpdateInstalledSoftware endpoint.
