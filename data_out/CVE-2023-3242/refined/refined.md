- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper initialization implementation and insufficient limiting/throttling in the Portmapper service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The Portmapper service is vulnerable to SYN flooding attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could cause several services of the system node to become inaccessible, effectively causing a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: A network-based attacker sends a high number of SYN requests to the system node.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the affected system node. This could be achieved by direct connection, through a wrongly configured/penetrated firewall, or by installing malicious software on a system node or infecting the network.
