The provided content is related to CVE-2021-44367.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `SetUpnp`'s JSON `param` parser in the `cgiserver.cgi` of Reolink RLC-410W camera assumes that the `param` JSON element is an object. It uses the subscription operator to access members of this object. When the `param` is not an object but a string (e.g., an empty string `""`), this leads to an assertion failure, crashing the `cgiserver.cgi` process and rebooting the device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Input Validation: The `cgiserver.cgi` does not properly validate the type of the `param` JSON element before attempting to access it as an object.
- Incorrect assumption on JSON structure: Code assumes that the `param` field will always be a JSON object, and does not handle cases when a string or other types are passed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: By sending a specially crafted HTTP request with the `param` as a non-object, an attacker can cause the device to reboot, disrupting its normal operation.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP request: An attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint with a JSON body containing the `SetUpnp` command and a non-object value for the `param` field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.
- Knowledge of API endpoint and command structure: The attacker needs to know the correct API endpoint `/cgi-bin/api.cgi`, the `SetUpnp` command, and the format of the JSON request body.
- TALOS-2021-1420 (optional): While not strictly required for this specific vulnerability, it is mentioned that the vulnerability can be exploited without authentication if combined with the TALOS-2021-1420 vulnerability.
