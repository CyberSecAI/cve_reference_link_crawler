Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The `AuthInterceptor` class has a flaw in its URL validation logic. It checks if a path starts with `/rest/`, but it doesn't properly handle relative path traversals like `/rest/../`. This allows unauthorized access to any API endpoint.
*   **Arbitrary File Download Vulnerability:** The `cgformTemplateController.showPic` API lacks proper sanitization or validation of the `code` and `path` parameters it receives, leading to an arbitrary file download. By manipulating these parameters, an attacker can specify an arbitrary file path on the server's filesystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided file paths in `cgformTemplateController.showPic`, allowing access to files outside of the intended directory using path traversal sequences like `../../`.
*   **Insecure Authentication/Authorization:** The authentication mechanism is bypassed by path traversal, granting unauthorized access to the API endpoint that exposes the file download vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker can download arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. This could potentially expose sensitive data such as configuration files, application source code, database credentials, and other private information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `/rest/../cgformTemplateController.do?showPic` endpoint, manipulating the `code` and `path` parameters to point to the desired file location on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application's server.
*   **HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to make HTTP requests and manipulate parameters within those requests.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any authentication. The bypass in AuthInterceptor allows pre-auth access.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet in `AuthInterceptor`:
    ```java
    if (requestPath.length()>3&&"rest/".equals(requestPath.substring(0,5))) {
        return true;
    }
    ```
*   The vulnerable code snippet in `cgformTemplateController`:
    ```java
    public void showPic(HttpServletRequest request,String code, String path,HttpServletResponse response){
        String defaultPath="default.jpg";
        String defaultCode="default/images/";
        if(path==null){
            path=defaultPath;
            code=defaultCode;
        }else{
            if(code==null){
                code="temp/";
            }else{
                code+="/images/";
            }
        }
        FileInputStream fis = null;
        OutputStream out = null;
        response.setContentType("image/" + FileUtils.getExtend(path));
        try {
            out = response.getOutputStream();
            File file = new File(getUploadBasePath(request),code+path);
            if(!file.exists()||file.isDirectory()){
                file=new File(getUploadBasePath(request),defaultCode+defaultPath);
            }
            fis = new FileInputStream(file);
            byte[] b = new byte[fis.available()];
            fis.read(b);
            out.write(b);
            out.flush();
    ```
*   Example exploit (PoC) is provided:
    ```
    POST /rest/../cgformTemplateController.do?showPic HTTP/1.1
    Host: 119.23.129.64:8083
    ...
    Content-Length: 58
    code=default&path=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
    ```
