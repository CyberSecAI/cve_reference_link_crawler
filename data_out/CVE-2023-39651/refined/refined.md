Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `ajax.php` script in the "Theme Volty CMS BrandList" module for PrestaShop contains SQL calls vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, it does not properly sanitize the `$pos` and `$value` parameters before using them in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is a lack of proper input sanitization leading to SQL injection. The module directly uses user-provided parameters (`$pos` and `$value`) within SQL queries without prior sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could extract sensitive data from the database, including admin credentials, user information, and other confidential details.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database, potentially damaging the shop's functionality or integrity.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers could gain administrative access by crafting specific SQL injection payloads.
*   **Email Hijacking:** Attackers could rewrite SMTP settings to intercept or manipulate emails, enabling them to carry out further malicious actions.
*   **Expose tokens and unlock adminsâ€™s ajax scripts**: Attackers could expose tokens and unlock admin's ajax scripts by extracting the data from sensitive tables and exposing it to the frontend.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network, meaning an attacker can exploit it remotely.
*   **HTTP Call:** The attack can be triggered by making a simple HTTP call to the `ajax.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privilege Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or user privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The attack can be carried out without requiring any interaction from the victim.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to send http requests to the server where the affected module is installed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions up to and including 4.0.1 of the `tvcmsbrandlist` module. Version 4.0.2 includes a fix.
*   The provided patch shows that the fix involves casting `$pos` and `$value` to integers before using them in the SQL queries (`(int) $pos` and `(int) $value`). This prevents SQL injection by sanitizing the input and preventing the injection of malicious code.
*   The advisory recommends upgrading to the latest version of the module, as well as to the latest version of PrestaShop itself.
*   It also recommends changing the default database prefix and activating OWASP 942's rules on a WAF, while noting these will not provide full protection against all SQL injection attacks (especially those using UNION clause).
