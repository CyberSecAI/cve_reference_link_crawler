- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a difference in response times when a login attempt is made with an existing username versus a non-existent one.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** User enumeration via timing differences in login responses.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can determine if a specific username exists in the application. This information can be used for subsequent attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attacker making login attempts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the login endpoint of the application.
