{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Puma web server incorrectly parses chunked transfer encoding bodies and zero-length Content-Length headers, leading to HTTP request smuggling.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Incorrect parsing of trailing fields in chunked transfer encoding bodies",
    "Parsing of blank/zero-length Content-Length headers"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can smuggle HTTP requests, potentially leading to various impacts like bypassing security checks, cache poisoning, or unauthorized access to resources.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted HTTP requests with chunked transfer encoding or zero-length Content-Length headers.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Puma server."
