- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `deviceName` parameter is directly passed to a `doSystemCmd` function without proper sanitization, leading to command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary command execution on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/setUsbUnload` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `deviceName` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This often means the attacker is on the same network as the device, or has access to the device's web interface.
