- Root cause of vulnerability: Unsafe Java object deserialization
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The application accepts serialized Java objects from unauthenticated users.
- Impact of exploitation: Remote attacker can execute arbitrary code.
- Attack vectors: Sending a malicious serialized Java object to the application.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Unauthenticated access to the application.
