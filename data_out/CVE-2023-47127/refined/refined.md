{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the fact that session cookies generated for one site within a TYPO3 installation can be reused on another site within the same installation without requiring additional authentication, if the cookie domain is not explicitly set or properly validated.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-302: Improper Check for Required Cryptographic Step",
      "CWE-1390: Insufficient Session Expiration"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with a valid user account on one site could potentially reuse the session cookie on another site within the same TYPO3 installation, potentially gaining unauthorized access or performing actions on the second site as the user from the first site. This vulnerability primarily affects the frontend of the website.",
     "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker would need to obtain a valid session cookie from one site and then attempt to use it on another site within the same TYPO3 installation.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires a valid user account on at least one of the sites within the TYPO3 installation (PR:L) and the attack has a high complexity (AC:H)."
  },
  "technical_details": {
      "vulnerable_code": "The issue was located within the session handling mechanism of TYPO3 CMS. Specifically, the session cookie did not include the domain on which it was created as part of the signature.",
      "affected_versions": "8.0.0-8.7.54, 9.0.0-9.5.43, 10.0.0-10.4.40, 11.0.0-11.5.32, 12.0.0-12.4.7",
      "fix": "The fix involves salting the user session signatures with the desired cookie domain. This change ensures that a cookie can only be used on the specific domain for which it was created. The changes also include explicit cookie domain validation and normalization, handling scenarios with subdomains and regex configurations. The fix was implemented in the following versions: 8.7.55 ELTS, 9.5.44 ELTS, 10.4.41 ELTS, 11.5.33, 12.4.8"
