Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of file names during file uploads. Malicious code embedded within file names is not properly escaped, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) when these names are displayed in tooltips and popups in the backend of the Contao CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is a stored XSS vulnerability. User-supplied input (file names) is not sanitized and can contain malicious JavaScript code. This code is then executed in the context of other users' browsers when they interact with the file manager.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Code Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the backend of the Contao CMS. This code can then be executed in the browsers of other users, including administrators.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** This could lead to the theft of sensitive information, manipulation of data within the CMS, or complete compromise of the application if an admin is targeted.
*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers could use the XSS vulnerability to steal session cookies, leading to account takeovers, especially of privileged users.
*   **Phishing:** The attacker can use JavaScript to redirect users to malicious websites or show fake login forms within the CMS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The primary attack vector is through the file upload functionality of the Contao file manager.
*   **Malicious Filename:** The attacker crafts a file name containing JavaScript code and uploads the file via the file manager.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User with Upload Permissions:** An attacker needs to be a user with the ability to upload files in the backend file manager. This could be an editor, administrator, or any user with sufficient file management privileges.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the Contao CMS backend and upload files through the web interface.

**Additional Technical Details**
* The fix involves encoding file names in tooltips and titles.
* The commit includes changes to the following files to address the vulnerability:
    * `core-bundle/src/Resources/contao/drivers/DC_Folder.php`: This file was modified to properly encode the file names when generating file tree.
    * `core-bundle/src/Resources/public/core.js`: This file was modified to encode titles in modal popups.
    * `core-bundle/assets/scripts/core.js`: This file was modified to encode titles in modal popups.
    * `core-bundle/assets/scripts/tips.js`: This file was modified to encode titles in tooltips.
* The fix also includes removing ampersands in sanitizeFileName() and then reverting that change
* There are also changes related to allowing HTML in help texts
* The `StringUtil::specialchars` function is being used with the second argument set to `false`, ensuring that HTML is not escaped, and then a third argument set to `true` is being used.

**In summary**, CVE-2024-28190 is a stored XSS vulnerability in the Contao CMS file manager. By uploading files with crafted file names, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that executes in the context of other users within the Contao backend when these file names are displayed in tooltips or modal popups. This can lead to various severe consequences, including data theft, account takeover, and system compromise. The fix includes proper encoding of filenames, modal titles and tooltip titles to mitigate this vulnerability.
