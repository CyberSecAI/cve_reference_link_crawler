The Cliengo â€“ Chatbot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'update_chatbot_token' and 'update_chatbot_position' functions in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change chatbot settings, which can lead to unavailability or other changes to the chatbot.
