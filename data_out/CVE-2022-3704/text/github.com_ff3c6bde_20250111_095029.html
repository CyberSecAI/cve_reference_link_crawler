Does someone know if the Rails team is planning a patch for Rails 6 in response to this vulnerability [GHSA-9chr-4fjh-5rgw](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9chr-4fjh-5rgw "GHSA-9chr-4fjh-5rgw")?

I know the commit was merged into the main branch, but I don't think the patch applies retroactively for older versions.

Thanks in advance for your answer.

Additionally, I saw this PR [d35b1a8](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/d35b1a8708a1ef704c55a18d67a6f2f3e886fd47) targeting Rails 5.2 but it was closed.

There is no CVE here. Who created it? it is a development page, even if there was a XSS here, the impact is so low that there is no reason to call this a vulnerability.

Sorry, something went wrong.

It is a notification we get from Github with periodic CVEs in different gems we use in our projects. Not sure who created it but it is listed on the National Vulnerability Database page: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3704>.

I see. Ok, let's get rid of the CVE thing, and let me put my question from another perspective. Is there a way to get this commit patch (PR associated: [#46269](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46269)) into the Rails 6 version?

Sorry [@skipkayhil](https://github.com/skipkayhil), I had to be more precise. The version we are using is `6.1.7` and I saw that the rails `6-1-stable` branch already has this patch too, but when I check the tag `v1.7.6` the change is not there: <https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v6.1.7/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/templates/routes/_table.html.erb#L116>.

I don't know the internal process the Rails team uses to apply the patches so what do you suggest to me to get this fix in the version we are using?
