Does someone know if the Rails team is planning a patch for Rails 6 in response to this vulnerability [GHSA-9chr-4fjh-5rgw](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9chr-4fjh-5rgw "GHSA-9chr-4fjh-5rgw")?

I know the commit was merged into the main branch, but I don't think the patch applies retroactively for older versions.

Thanks in advance for your answer.

Additionally, I saw this PR [d35b1a8](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/d35b1a8708a1ef704c55a18d67a6f2f3e886fd47) targeting Rails 5.2 but it was closed.

There is no CVE here. Who created it? it is a development page, even if there was a XSS here, the impact is so low that there is no reason to call this a vulnerability.

Sorry, something went wrong.

It is a notification we get from Github with periodic CVEs in different gems we use in our projects. Not sure who created it but it is listed on the National Vulnerability Database page: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3704>.

Yeah, I saw that. We are disputing that CVE since it is invalid.

I see. Ok, let's get rid of the CVE thing, and let me put my question from another perspective. Is there a way to get this commit patch (PR associated: [#46269](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46269)) into the Rails 6 version?

Sorry [@skipkayhil](https://github.com/skipkayhil), I had to be more precise. The version we are using is `6.1.7` and I saw that the rails `6-1-stable` branch already has this patch too, but when I check the tag `v1.7.6` the change is not there: <https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v6.1.7/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/templates/routes/_table.html.erb#L116>.

I don't know the internal process the Rails team uses to apply the patches so what do you suggest to me to get this fix in the version we are using?

| After highlighting this issue to the Rails team via Hacker1, I was informed that this bug should be highlighted here upstream. Whilst the issue is nothing critical, it is after all more of a self XSS, the ability to inject XSS attacks within the Rails framework is concerning. At a later date a vulnerability may be discovered that could leverage this issue or the code within this page could be reused elsewhere creating another attack vector that could be triggered by an attacker. I am not an expert in Ruby or Rails and when I found this issue on a penetration test for a client, we discovered it was not an issue with the web application but one within Rails itself. The screenshot attached is therefore redacted of client identification. Steps to reproduce Request a page that does not have a matching routing to produce the Routing Error page. Expected behavior Expected behaviour is a error page with resources to help navigate the issue. Actual behavior Within the search box for Path, it is possible to create a XSS injection. System configuration **Rails version**: No information on version from client **Ruby version**: No information on version from client.

| Sure, in the search bar input form. enter the following piece of code. `<svg><animate onend=alert(document.domain) attributeName=x dur=1s>` this will then bring up an alert box as per the image, giving proof of concept of the XSS vulnerability. |

| Clarifying, as for some reason a CVE was issued. The Rails Security team does not consider this a security issue. This originally came through our HackerOne security program and we forwarded it here as a non-security bug. I'm unsure why a CVE was created for this and we have filed a dispute.  This routing error page is only visible to developers, only in development mode, and only on localhost (or other domains configured to be "local").  Exploiting this would require tricking a developer into copy and pasting malicious code into this specific field on this routing error page. **This is effectively no different than tricking the developer into copy and pasting malicious content into their browser's web developer console**.  For these reasons we consider this only a bug and not a security risk. There is no urgency for users to upgrade or patch this. Please follow our [security announcements forum](https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/c/security-announcements/9) for our regular security updates. |
