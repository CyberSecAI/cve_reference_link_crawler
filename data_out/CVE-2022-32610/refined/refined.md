- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper synchronization in the Video Codec Unit (vcu). Specifically, a race condition exists in the vcu.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: The primary vulnerability is a race condition leading to a use-after-free scenario due to improper synchronization when accessing shared resources within the vcu.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to a local escalation of privilege. The attacker can gain elevated privileges on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some form of access to the device. No user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the device and the ability to trigger the vulnerable code path within the vcu. No additional execution privileges are needed to start the exploitation process, although achieving privilege escalation does require system privileges.
