January 9, 2024

We have recently identified a firmware vulnerability in our TRB1-series devices. This vulnerability can only be exploited through LAN access via Ethernet or USB interfaces and does not affect devices remotely via mobile networks. It affects the [TRB140](https://teltonika-networks.com/products/gateways/trb140), [TRB141](https://teltonika-networks.com/products/gateways/trb141), [TRB142](https://teltonika-networks.com/products/gateways/trb142), [TRB143](https://teltonika-networks.com/products/gateways/trb143), and [TRB145](https://teltonika-networks.com/products/gateways/trb145) industrial gateways across all firmware versions before *TRB1\_R\_00.07.05.2*.

Version *TRB1\_R\_00.07.05.2* of the firmware has resolved this issue, so wehighly recommend you update the firmware of your TRB1-series devices to the latest version to ensure the continued secure operation of your devices. You can download and install firmware updates from [our Wiki](https://wiki.teltonika-networks.com/view/FW_%26_SDK_Downloads) page, FOTA, or [RMS](https://euc-word-edit.officeapps.live.com/we/you%20update%20the%20firmware%20of%20your%20TRB1-series%20devices%20to%20version%20TRB1_R_00.07.05.2.). Regularly updating your devices’ firmware to the latest version is essential to keeping it secure.

As always, Teltonika Networks is committed to transparency regarding such issues and to ensuring the security and reliability of its products. For further assistance or advice on updating the firmware, please reach out to our technical support Helpdesk.
