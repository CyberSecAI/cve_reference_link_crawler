## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Swift Framework < 2024.04.30 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. When adding a slider as a contributor, for the "Caption Title" enter the payload: `<img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>`
2. Save the changes
3. When logged in as an admin, you can see the XSS when going to: https://example.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post\_type=swift-slider
