- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape certain settings, specifically the "Caption Title" when adding a slider.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with contributor privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. This code will then be executed in the context of an administrator's browser when they access the relevant section in the WordPress admin panel, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions with admin privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the "Caption Title" field of a slider when creating a slider as a contributor. The injected code is then stored and executed when an administrator views the slider settings in the admin panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor privileges within the WordPress site.
