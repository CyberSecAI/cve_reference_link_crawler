# defrag: IP ID reuse can lead to policy bypass

Moderate

[victorjulien](/victorjulien)
published
GHSA-qrp7-g66m-px24
Jul 11, 2024

## Package

suricata

## Affected versions

>=6.0.0,<=6.0.19
>=7.0.0,<=7.0.5

## Patched versions

6.0.20
7.0.6

## Description

### Impact

Mishandling of multiple fragmented packets using the same IP ID value can lead to packet reassembly failure, which can lead to policy bypass.

### Patches

Upgrade to 7.0.6 or 6.0.20.

### Workarounds

When using af-packet, enable `defrag` to reduce the scope of the problem.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

defrag: don't use completed tracker

[Browse files](/OISF/suricata/tree/9d5c4273cb7e5ca65f195f7361f0d848c85180e0)

```
When a Tracker is set up for a IPID, frags come in for it and it's
reassembled and complete, the `DefragTracker::remove` flag is set. This
is mean to tell the hash cleanup code to recyle the tracker and to let
the lookup code skip the tracker during lookup.

A logic error lead to the following scenario:

1. there are sufficient frag trackers to make sure the hash table is
   filled with trackers
2. frags for a Packet with IPID X are processed correctly (X1)
3. frags for a new Packet that also has IPID X come in quickly after the
   first (X2).
4. during the lookup, the frag for X2 hashes to a hash row that holds
   more than one tracker
5. as the trackers in hash row are evaluated, it finds the tracker for
   X1, but since the `remove` bit is not checked, it is returned as the
   tracker for X2.
6. reassembly fails, as the tracker is already complete

The logic error is that only for the first tracker in a row the `remove`
bit was checked, leading to reuse to a closed tracker if there were more
trackers in the hash row.

Ticket: [#7042](https://github.com/OISF/suricata/pull/7042).

defrag: don't use completed tracker

```
When a Tracker is set up for a IPID, frags come in for it and it's
reassembled and complete, the `DefragTracker::remove` flag is set. This
is mean to tell the hash cleanup code to recyle the tracker and to let
the lookup code skip the tracker during lookup.

A logic error lead to the following scenario:

1. there are sufficient frag trackers to make sure the hash table is
   filled with trackers
2. frags for a Packet with IPID X are processed correctly (X1)
3. frags for a new Packet that also has IPID X come in quickly after the
   first (X2).
4. during the lookup, the frag for X2 hashes to a hash row that holds
   more than one tracker
5. as the trackers in hash row are evaluated, it finds the tracker for
   X1, but since the `remove` bit is not checked, it is returned as the
   tracker for X2.
6. reassembly fails, as the tracker is already complete

The logic error is that only for the first tracker in a row the `remove`
bit was checked, leading to reuse to a closed tracker if there were more
trackers in the hash row.

Ticket: [#7042](https://github.com/OISF/suricata/pull/7042).
