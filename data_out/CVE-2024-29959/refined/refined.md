- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from Brocade SANnav including encrypted Brocade Fabric OS switch passwords in the support save file of the Brocade SANnav Standby node.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information (encrypted passwords) within a support save file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The exposure of encrypted passwords could potentially lead to unauthorized access to the Brocade Fabric OS switches if the encryption is weak or can be broken, or if other vulnerabilities are also present in the environment. The potential for complete loss of confidentiality of administrative credentials could have a serious business impact.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with access to the support save file from the Brocade SANnav Standby node can potentially extract the encrypted passwords.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs access to the support save file from the Brocade SANnav Standby node. The document doesn't specify how this access is gained.

The provided document also gives:
- **Affected product versions**: Brocade SANnav before v2.3.1 and v2.3.0a.
