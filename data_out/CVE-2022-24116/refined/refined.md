- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a weakness in the wireless security software and chipset implementations of the iNET/iNET II series radios. The specific nature of the weakness is not detailed but implies insufficient encryption strength or use of weak algorithms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate encryption strength.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the radio network. The CVSS score indicates a high potential impact across all three areas.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A) meaning an attacker needs to be within the same network segment or physical proximity.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be within adjacent network and requires user interaction (UI:R).
