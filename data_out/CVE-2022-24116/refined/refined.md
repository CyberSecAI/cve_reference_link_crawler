Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-24116:

**Root Cause:** Inadequate Encryption Strength

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability lies in a weakness within the wireless security software and chipset implementations of the affected iNET/iNET II series radios. This implies that the encryption algorithms or their implementation are not robust enough to protect the confidentiality and integrity of wireless communications.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to an attacker gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data transmitted over the wireless network, potentially allowing them to modify communications or disrupt operations.

**Attack Vectors:** An attacker needs to be adjacent to the vulnerable device to exploit this vulnerability, meaning they must be within the wireless range of the affected radio.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be within the wireless communication range of the affected devices.
   - No specific user privileges are required (PR:N).
   - The attacker needs to perform a specific action to trigger the vulnerability (UI:R).
