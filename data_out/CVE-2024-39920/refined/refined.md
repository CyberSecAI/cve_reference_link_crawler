        "text": "SnailLoad exploits a bottleneck present on all Internet connections. This bottleneck influences the latency of network packets, allowing an attacker to infer the current network activity on someone else's Internet connection. An attacker can use this information to infer websites a user visits or videos a user watches.\n\n1. The victim communicates with a server.\n2. The server has a fast Internet connection, the victim's last mile connection is comparably slow.\n3. The attacker's packets to the victim are delayed if the last mile is busy.\n4. In a side-channel attack the attacker infers what website or video the user is watching.\n\nWe believe that most Internet connections are affected. However, at this time it is unlikely that SnailLoad is exploited in the wild. SnailLoad exploits bandwidth bottlenecks close to your device. Typically, the bandwidth bottleneck is your personal internet connection, as it has a much lower bandwidth than backbone infrastructure. Our user-study with 10 home internet connections shows that our video-fingerprinting attack works on all of the tested connections, with varying accuracies between 37% and 98%.\n\nMitigating SnailLoad is not trivial. The root cause of SnailLoad are bandwidth differences between backbone and end-user connections. To provide a suitable bandwidth to multiple users simultaneously, the backbone network infrastructure has to have a higher bandwidth than the connections of the individual users. Hence, the root cause cannot be eliminated and further research is necessary to find satisfying solutions.\n\nThe attack masquerades as a download of a file or any website component (like a style sheet, a font, an image or an advertisement). The attacking server sends out the file at a snail's pace, to monitor the connection latency over an extended period of time.",

         "text": "In this paper, we present SnailLoad, a new side-channel attack where the victim loads an asset, e.g., a file or an image, from an attacker-controlled server, exploiting the victim’s network latency as a side channel tied to activities on the victim system, e.g., watching videos or websites. SnailLoad requires no JavaScript, no form of code execution on the victim system, and no user interaction but only a constant exchange of network packets, e.g., a network connection in the background. SnailLoad measures the latency to the victim system and infers the network activity on the victim system from the latency variations. We demonstrate SnailLoad in a non-PITM video-fingerprinting attack, where we use a single SnailLoad trace to infer what video a victim user is watching momentarily...SnailLoad exploits the subtle variations in the round-trip times (RTTs) of network packets that carry a side-channel signal influenced by activity of the victim. This enables an attacker to perform network side-channel attacks, that so far required a person-in-the-middle (PITM) scenario, from a fully passive and fully remote scenario off the transport path between victim and server... The root cause of SnailLoad are bandwidth differences in the transport path between victim and server...the last node connecting the victim exclusively to the internet, i.e., all packets to and from a victim pass through this node...We evaluate the general applicability of SnailLoad on 10 home internet connections using ADSL, FTTH, FTTB, LTE, and cable access technologies. With training data from the victim’s internet connection over the top 10 YouTube videos, played for 90 s with Firefox, we achieve F1 scores between 37 % on an FTTB connection and 98 % on an FTTH connection. Our evaluation shows variations in the accuracy between internet access technologies, depending on whether the last-mile transport medium is shared among multiple subscribers or not.",

        "text": "Online activities can be monitored in detail simply by analysing latency fluctuations in the internet connection, researchers at Graz University of Technology have discovered. The attack works without malicious code or access to the data traffic...The \"SnailLoad\" loophole is based on combining the latency of internet connections with the fingerprinting of online content... computer scientists from the Institute of Applied Information Processing and Communication Technology (IAIK) at Graz University of Technology (TU Graz) were able to track users' online activities in detail simply by monitoring fluctuations in the speed of their internet connection... The victim only needs to have a single direct contact with the attacker - for example when visiting a website or watching a promotional video - to download an essentially harmless file unnoticed. Because this file does not contain any malicious code, it is not recognised by security software...The transfer of this file is extremely slow providing the attacker with continuous information about the latency variation of the victim's internet connection...When the victim accesses a website, watches an online video or speaks to someone via video, the latency of the internet connection fluctuates in a specific pattern that depends on the particular content being used...The researchers collected the fingerprints of a limited number of YouTube videos and popular websites in advance for testing purposes. When the test subjects used these videos and websites, the researchers were able to recognise this through the corresponding latency fluctuations....When spying on test subjects who were watching videos, the researchers achieved a success rate of up to 98 per cent. The higher the data volume of the videos and the slower the victims' internet connection, the better the success rate.\"...Closing this security gap is difficult. The only option would be for providers to artificially slow down their customers' internet connections in a randomised pattern.",
