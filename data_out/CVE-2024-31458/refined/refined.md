Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user-controlled data being used in SQL queries. Specifically, the `column_name` field in the `graph_template_input` table is not properly validated and is directly concatenated into an SQL query in the `draw_nontemplated_fields_graph_item()` function within `lib/html_form_templates.php`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: Malicious SQL code can be injected through the `column_name` field, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries.
- Unsanitized input: The lack of input sanitization and validation of the `column_name` field is the core issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, which could lead to:
    - Data exfiltration (reading sensitive data).
    - Data modification (inserting, updating, or deleting data).
    - Potential denial of service (by deleting or altering critical data).
- The provided PoC demonstrates how to delete data from the `sessions` table, indicating a significant impact on application availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can inject malicious SQL code through a POST request to `graph_template_inputs.php` when saving a graph template input.
- The injected SQL payload is then triggered when accessing `graphs.php` to edit a graph.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs low privileges to save a graph template input using `graph_template_inputs.php`
- The attacker needs low privileges to trigger the SQL injection using `graphs.php`
- The attacker must have network access to the application.
-  User interaction is required to view the edited graph.

**Additional details:**
- The field length of `column_name` is limited to 50 characters.
- Data storage does not require administrator privileges but reading requires it.
- The vulnerability is present in Cacti versions up to and including 1.2.26, and it is fixed in version 1.2.27.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 4.6
