#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. As admin, edit a document. Perform some changes but do not save yet.
2. As a user without script right in another browser context, edit the same document, dismissing the conflict warning. Add <script>alert('XSS')</script> in the content and cause a conflict, e.g., by deleting everything else. Save the document.
3. As admin, save the document.
4. In the conflict popup, select "Fix each conflict individually"

**Expected result:**

The conflict is displayed but no alert.

**Actual result:**

An alert with content "XSS" is displayed.

I suspect this is a result of missing escaping in <https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/b6080ac1552e6c1c19a709d07df1bf94414200d5/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-web/xwiki-platform-web-templates/src/main/resources/templates/diff_macros.vm#L85>. This may also allow XWiki syntax injection if the conflict is displayed in a context with XWiki syntax support. This code has been introduced in [~~XWIKI-16464~~](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-16464 "Merge conflict: allow choice by chunks and custom fixes"), thus the affects version of 11.8.

The following screenshot shows the attack in action. Here, I added alerts in both versions but it is sufficient to have one of them, the example triggers two alerts, the shown alert is from the other save:

# XSS through conflict resolution

Critical

[michitux](/michitux)
published
GHSA-692v-783f-mg8x
Jul 31, 2024

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 11.8-rc-1, < 15.10.8
>= 16.0.0-rc-1, < 16.3.0-rc-1

## Patched versions

15.10.8
16.3.0-rc-1

## Description

### Impact

By creating a conflict when another user with more rights is currently editing a page, it is possible to execute JavaScript snippets on the side of the other user, which compromises the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation.

To reproduce on a XWiki instance, a user with admin rights needs to edit a document without saving right away.

Then, as another user without any other right than edit on the specific document, change the whole content to `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.

When the admin user then saves the document, a conflict popup appears. If they select "Fix each conflict individually" and see an alert displaying "XSS", then the instance is vulnerable.

### Patches

This has been patched in XWiki 15.10.8 and 16.3.0RC1.

### Workarounds

We're not aware of any workaround except upgrading.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
