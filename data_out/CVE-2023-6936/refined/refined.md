Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-6936:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- A heap overflow read is possible in servers connecting over TLS 1.3 when the optional `WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS` is defined. The vulnerability occurs when the server receives a malicious, malformed `ClientHello` message.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Heap-based out-of-bounds read
- Improper handling of malformed TLS 1.3 `ClientHello` messages
- Vulnerability exists when using the optional `WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS` feature

**Impact of exploitation:**

-  A malicious client can cause a heap overflow read on the server, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) or other undefined behavior.

**Attack vectors:**

-  A malicious TLS 1.3 client sends a malformed `ClientHello` message to a vulnerable wolfSSL server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to establish a TLS 1.3 connection to a server using wolfSSL with `WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS` enabled.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of the `ClientHello` message in the server handshake.
- The fix was implemented in pull request #6949 on GitHub.
- The vulnerability was reported by the tlspuffin fuzzer team.
-  Users are advised to either discontinue use of `WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS` on the server side or update their wolfSSL version to 5.6.6 or later.
