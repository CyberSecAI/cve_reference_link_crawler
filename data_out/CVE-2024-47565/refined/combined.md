VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-47553

The affected application does not properly validate user input to the `ssmctl-client` command.
This could allow an authenticated, lowly privileged remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying OS.

| CWE | CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-47562

The affected application does not properly neutralize special elements in user input to the `ssmctl-client` command.
This could allow an authenticated, lowly privileged local attacker to execute privileged commands in the underlying OS.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 8.8 |

| CWE | CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-47563

The affected application does not properly validate a file path that is supplied to an endpoint intended to create CSR files.
This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to create files in writable directories outside the intended location and thus compromise integrity of files in those writable directories.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 5.3 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |

| CWE | CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-47565

The affected application does not properly validate that user input complies with a list of allowed values.
This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to compromise the integrity of the configuration of the affected application.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 4.3 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |
