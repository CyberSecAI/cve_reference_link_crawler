This vulnerability is due to improper validation of requests that are sent to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with *root* privileges on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid *Administrator* credentials on the affected device.  There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
