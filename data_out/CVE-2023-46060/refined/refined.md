{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a stack buffer overflow in the fromSetVlanInfo function within the Tenda AC500 router firmware.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The code reads a user-controlled parameter ('port') without performing a length check. Subsequently, the unchecked content is copied into a local variable (dest) on the stack, leading to a buffer overflow.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the bin/httpd process or achieve remote code execution (RCE) with a carefully crafted payload.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/setVlanInfo` URL with an overly long value for the 'port' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface. It is also likely they need to be authenticated to access the vulnerable endpoint, since a cookie is included in the proof of concept."
