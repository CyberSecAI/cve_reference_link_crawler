Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6940 (Based on the reference in the VulDB entry, which links to the provided Gitee content)

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering in `article_template_rand.php` within DedeCMS V5.7.114. While the code attempts to block specific PHP functions and constructs (like `eval`, `system`, and the use of `$GLOBALS`), it fails to adequately prevent code injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The blacklist approach used to prevent code injection is flawed. Attackers can bypass the filters by using string concatenation and other PHP features to construct malicious code.
- **Code Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code into a template file (`template.rand.php`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  By injecting malicious PHP code, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- **System Privilege Gain:** The attacker could potentially gain system-level privileges after successful exploitation, allowing them to control the server and its resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `article_template_rand.php` file.
- **Form Data Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `templates` parameter within the POST data, inserting the malicious PHP code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be logged into the DedeCMS backend. The provided exploit code includes a cookie parameter, indicating that user authentication is necessary for the attack to succeed.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable DedeCMS installation.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit code shows how to inject PHP code using a combination of string concatenation and variable variables to bypass the blacklist filtering. The injected payload is designed to execute code sent in the POST request. Specifically,  `$a = '_POST'; $$a[1]($$a[0]);` allows execution of the command sent with the first POST parameter by calling a function, with the name provided by the second parameter of the post.
- The code also shows the complete HTTP POST request, including all parameters, required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided Gitee link contains a detailed analysis of the vulnerability, including the specific filtering mechanisms and bypass techniques, and includes screenshots and example code.
- The vulnerability is located in the `article_template_rand.php` file which is part of the DedeCMS backend administration.
