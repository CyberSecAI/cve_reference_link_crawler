{
  "CVE-2021-47546": {
    "Description": "The kernel leaks memory when a `fib` rule is present in IPv6 nftables firewall rules and a suppress_prefix rule is present in the IPv6 routing rules. In such scenarios, every incoming packet will leak an allocation in `ip6_dst_cache` slab cache.",
    "Root cause": "The generic `args->flags` always have `FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF` set, but the IPv6-specific flag `RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF` might not be. This leads to `fib6_rule_suppress` not decreasing the refcount when needed.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of reference counts for routes in the IPv6 routing subsystem when suppress rules are active",
       "Lack of protocol-specific flag checking in `fib6_rule_suppress` function"
    ],
    "Impact": "Memory leak in the `ip6_dst_cache` slab cache, leading to potential denial of service if the memory exhaustion is severe enough.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending IPv6 packets to a system with a specific nftables rule and a suppress_prefix routing rule configured.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker must be able to send network packets to the vulnerable system. No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability."
