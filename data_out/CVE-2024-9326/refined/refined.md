Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the SQL Injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization in the `/shopping/admin/index.php` login page. Specifically, the `username` parameter, obtained via `$_POST['username']`, is directly incorporated into an SQL query without any prior validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where user-supplied data can manipulate the intended SQL query. This is due to the direct embedding of the `$username` variable into the SQL query string.
- Unsafe SQL Query Construction: The code constructs the SQL query using string concatenation, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can bypass the login authentication mechanism by injecting malicious SQL payloads. This grants them access to the administrative panel without needing valid credentials.
- **Database Manipulation:** Successful exploitation could lead to database information takeover and unauthorized modification of database information. Attackers can potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database or modify data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to `/shopping/admin/index.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker doesn't need prior knowledge of a valid username/password.
- The attacker could be an unauthenticated user.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable Parameter: `username`
- Vulnerable Endpoint: `http://localhost/shopping/admin/index.php`
- Example Payload: `admin' -- -`
- Vulnerable Code Snippet (PHP):
 ```php
$username = $_POST['username'];
$password=md5($_POST['password']);
$ret = mysqli_query($con,"SELECT * FROM admin WHERE username='$username' and password='$password'");
```

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided code snippet shows that the password is being hashed using `md5()`, which is considered insecure for modern applications.
- The SQL query is vulnerable to SQL injection due to lack of sanitization of `$username` variable.
- The exploit allows the attacker to bypass authentication and gain access to admin panel pages like `/admin/todays-orders.php`.
