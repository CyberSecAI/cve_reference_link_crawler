2. Connect to the device through usual way http://VIA\_IP/viaIndex/index
3. View the current screen
4. Use the remote mouse
5. Use CVE-2023-33469 to gain RCE

### Mitigation

First update to version 4.0, then apply version 4.0.1.1326 or later.
Additionally make sure your devices are not publicly accessible from the internet.
