- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in Dell BIOS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in how Dell BIOS handles input, allowing a malicious user to potentially inject and execute arbitrary code. Specifically, this involves improper input validation that allows a local authenticated attacker to exploit the system using a System Management Interrupt (SMI).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution within System Management RAM (SMRAM). This is a highly privileged area of memory, which means the attacker could gain significant control over the system, including potentially compromising the entire machine.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local and requires the attacker to be authenticated on the system. They must use an SMI to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Local access to the vulnerable system.
    - Authenticated user privileges are required.
    - Ability to send a crafted SMI.
