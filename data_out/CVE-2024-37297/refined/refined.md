Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37297:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a modification in WooCommerce 8.8's implementation of the Order Attribution feature. This feature uses the Sourcebuster.js library to collect traffic source data. The collected data was used to construct input fields on registration and classic checkout forms. However, the data was not properly sanitized before being inserted into the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is an XSS issue where an attacker can inject malicious HTML and JavaScript into the page.
- Improper Input Sanitization: The code does not sanitize the input values obtained from Sourcebuster.js before inserting them into HTML input fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Malicious Code Injection: Attackers can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the registration and checkout forms.
- Hijacking User Sessions: The injected JavaScript could be used to hijack user sessions and access data stored in the browser.
- Data Theft: Sensitive information stored in the browser could potentially be stolen by the injected scripts.
- Malicious redirects: injected JavaScript could redirect users to a malicious website

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Links: Attackers can craft malicious links that, when clicked, will inject the malicious code into the affected WooCommerce pages.
- Manipulated URL Parameters: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting URLs that include malicious JavaScript code within the URL parameters that the Sourcebuster library parses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the websiteâ€™s backend.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a link with malicious content that a victim will click on.
- The target site must have WooCommerce version 8.8.0 or higher and order attribution enabled.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability was introduced in WooCommerce 8.8 and affects versions up to 8.9.2.
- The issue is present on pages that contain the registration and classic checkout forms.
- The injected code is not saved to the database, but the malicious links can be distributed to victims.
- Patches have been released in versions 8.8.5, 8.9.3 and 9.0

**Mitigation:**
- Update WooCommerce to version 8.8.5, 8.9.3, or 9.0 or later
- Disable the Order Attribution feature
