## Description

This is a schedule booking plugin. Use this plugin as a complete booking solution for your site. Create Locations, Add Schedules to the locations, Let customers book for schedules. Manage bookings from admin panel.

* Add Locations
* Create multiple schedules per locations.

#### Usage

1. Create some locations. `Booking Addresses -> Add New`
2. Add schedules for that location. Schedules are actually booking times. You can add schedule from the Booking Address page.
3. Put this shortcode [schd\_calendar no\_of\_month=”2″] in the content section of the Booking Addresses page. This will display jQuery booking calendar in the details page. With this calendar users will be able to choose a schedule and then book it.
