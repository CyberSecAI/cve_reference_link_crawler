**Root Cause:**
The root cause for all the mentioned CVEs is the unsafe usage of the `flask.send_file` function in Flask applications. Specifically, the `send_file` function is used with an attacker-controlled input path, which enables path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal, which stems from not sanitizing user-supplied input that's used to construct file paths. Specifically, using unsanitized user input in the `filename` parameter of `flask.send_file`.
*   **Unsafe use of `flask.send_file`**: The application passes an attacker-controlled filename to the `flask.send_file` function which leads to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized File Access:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server file system, including source code, configuration files, and other sensitive data, by manipulating the input path.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of internal application details or sensitive data due to unauthorized file access.
*   **Potential Server Compromise**: Depending on the application's structure and the files accessible, a path traversal vulnerability can potentially be leveraged for further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** All the listed vulnerabilities are exploitable over the network. The attack vector is "network" because the attacker can remotely exploit this vulnerability.
*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers inject absolute paths or `../` sequences in the request, which are then unsafely processed by the Flask application when using the `send_file` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required**: The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction to perform the attack, meaning anyone can potentially trigger the vulnerability if it is exposed over the network.
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability arises when the `flask.send_file` function is used to serve files where the path is not properly validated. The function takes the filename parameter, and the developer has not validated this filename to check for any path traversal attempt.
*   The core issue with `os.path.join` is that it doesn't handle absolute paths correctly when they're part of the `path` variable when constructing the file path for send_file, thereby bypassing any intended directory restrictions.

**Remediation:**

*  **`flask.send_from_directory`:** If serving files from a specific directory, using  `flask.send_from_directory()` instead of `flask.send_file()` is recommended. It uses a safer approach for serving static files from a specific folder.
*   **Input Sanitization:** Validate all user-supplied inputs that are used in constructing file paths.
