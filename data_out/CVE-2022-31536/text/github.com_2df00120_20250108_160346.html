Continuous integration, testing, releasing and kitchen sinks for git
====================================================================

With golem, every git commit, push or tag can set into motion a set of actions
that you determine. From running tests on every push to automatically creating
releases and uploading them to various points. It's all possible.

Does this remind you of anything? Of course! Jenkins!

This proect very much aims to be "not Jenkins" and was started because Jenkins
frustrated me. Specifically:

- It's not java. Not that ava is a bad language, but writing simple extensions
  is a pain and Golem is meant to be trivial to extend.
- Testing is *not* the main thing that can be done
- Modular build with workers and actions that can depend on each other
- Though it's written in python, other languages are fist-class. You do not
  need to write workers  in python.
- You can configure golem with plain text files
- You can run multiple actions for the same repo (or even the same commit!) at
  the same time

Golem is currently in alpha stage. Though I'm using it to release all my own
software, I'm still changing golem and its API for workers.
