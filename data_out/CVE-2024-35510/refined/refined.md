Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and filtering in the file management feature of DedeCMS V5.7.114. Specifically, while the system attempts to prevent the inclusion of dangerous functions and variables, it fails to block file inclusion, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Input Filtering:** The system filters for a list of dangerous functions and variables within the uploaded file content. However, it does not filter out file inclusion functions like `require_once`.
*   **Unrestricted File Inclusion:** The system allows the inclusion of arbitrary files through functions such as `require_once`, which are not blocked by the existing filters.
*  **Bypassable filters:** The existing filters can be bypassed by using php tags `<?php ?>` and not using dangerous functions directly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve RCE by creating a PHP file containing malicious code (e.g., using `system()`) and including it into another PHP file using `require_once`, which then allows the execution of the attacker's code on the server.
*   **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the server hosting the DedeCMS application.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **File Creation:** The attacker uses the DedeCMS file management feature to create two files:
    *   A PHP file (e.g., `1.php`) containing an inclusion statement like `<?php require_once('newfile.txt');?>`.
    *   A text file (e.g., `newfile.txt`) with malicious PHP code such as `<?php (s.y.s.t.e.m)("whoami");?>`.
2.  **File Inclusion:** By accessing `1.php` through the web server, the attacker triggers the inclusion of `newfile.txt`, thereby executing the malicious code within it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to DedeCMS Admin Panel:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an admin with the right privileges to use the file management feature and create files.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability and how to craft the necessary malicious files and commands to be executed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The attacker can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code through the file management interface by creating a text file containing the code and then including that file via another php file.
*   The vulnerability is present in the file management feature, specifically the `file_manage_view.php` and `file_manage_control.php` files.
* The vulnerable function is in `file_manage_control.php` where input is filtered and then saved. The filtering does not filter file inclusion functions.
