The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47551.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a race condition that can occur during GPU resets in an SRIOV (Single Root I/O Virtualization) environment. Specifically, a reset may fail to bring the ASIC back to a normal state, while `stop_cpsch` has already been called. In such a scenario, `start_cpsch` will not be called due to the absence of a resume. If a reset is triggered again, the driver might attempt to perform uninitialization again, leading to a kernel panic.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper checking to prevent double uninitialization during a reset sequence. The driver does not properly check if the scheduler is already stopped before proceeding with the uninitialization process, which leads to a race condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is a kernel panic, which will lead to a denial of service. This can affect the stability of the system as the system will crash.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through triggering GPU resets in an SRIOV configuration. A malicious actor may trigger a reset that fails to recover the ASIC, and then trigger another reset, which can lead to the kernel panic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be in a position to trigger GPU resets, specifically in an SRIOV environment. This could be a user with access to the GPU driver or by exploiting another vulnerability that gives access to such functionality.
