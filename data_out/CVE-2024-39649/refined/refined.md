- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Essential Addons for Elementor plugin (versions <= 5.9.26) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts would be executed when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack vector is through the plugin, where a malicious script could be injected via user input that is not properly sanitized.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs contributor-level privileges to exploit the XSS vulnerability.
