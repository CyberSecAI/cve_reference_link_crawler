{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Heap-based buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service, arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation could lead to a crash of VLC or potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the target user. While it is stated that these issues are likely to cause a crash, they could possibly be chained to leak information or achieve remote code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Opening a maliciously crafted mms stream",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious MMS stream which a victim must then open in VLC."
