## Major changes and New Features

* Initial support for the beta releases of the new native mobile apps
* Removed support for WebSocket traffic on port 3012, as it's been integrated on the main HTTP port for a few releases
* Updated included web vault to 2024.5.1

## General mention

Bitwarden has changed the push API endpoints which affects the EU region endpoint users.

So if you use the push functionality and use the EU region you need to make some changes.

You have to update `push.bitwarden.eu` to `api.bitwarden.eu`.

This is also an issue with any previous version of Vaultwarden.
