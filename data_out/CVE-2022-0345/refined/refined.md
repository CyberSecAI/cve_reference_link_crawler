- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin's `bnfw_search_users` AJAX action lacks authorization and CSRF checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authorization and CSRF protection on the `bnfw_search_users` AJAX action. This allows any authenticated user to call this action.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Email address disclosure of users by querying the endpoint with incremental character prefixes.
- **Attack vectors**: By making AJAX requests to the `bnfw_search_users` action with incremental character prefixes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site.
