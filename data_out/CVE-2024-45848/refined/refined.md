{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to the use of an unprotected `eval` function, which allows for arbitrary code execution by evaluating user-supplied strings as Python code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')",
    "Arbitrary code execution"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary Python code on the machine where the MindsDB instance is running, leading to full compromise of the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can inject malicious code through the `metadata` column in an ‘INSERT’ statement when using the ChromaDB integration.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to a MindsDB instance that has the ChromaDB integration installed."
