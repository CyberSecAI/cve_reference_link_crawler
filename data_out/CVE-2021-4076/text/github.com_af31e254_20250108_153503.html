Handle just signing keys in find\_jws(), to make sure we are

responding only to proper queries.

Tests were also failing to detect this issue and were updated

accordingly.

Issue discovered by Twitter Kernel and OS team during a source

code audit while evaluating Tang/Clevis for their needs.

Fixes [CVE-2021-4076](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-83f4-c2vq-g2p3 "CVE-2021-4076")

Sorry, something went wrong.
