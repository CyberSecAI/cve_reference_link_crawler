```
Handle just signing keys in find_jws(), to make sure we are
responding only to proper queries.

Tests were also failing to detect this issue and were updated
accordingly.

Issue discovered by Twitter Kernel and OS team during a source
code audit while evaluating Tang/Clevis for their needs.

Fixes [CVE-2021-4076](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-83f4-c2vq-g2p3 "CVE-2021-4076")
