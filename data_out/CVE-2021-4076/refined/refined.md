Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-4076:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `find_by_thp()` function in `src/keys.c` in the `tang` project, where it was also handling signing keys, in addition to deriving keys. This function was being used to retrieve keys based on their thumbprint.  The issue is that this function would return either the JWK if it was valid for deriving, or JWS if it was valid for signing, without proper verification of intended usage context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Key Handling:** The `find_by_thp()` function was not designed to handle signing keys which lead to private key exposure when a non-signing key is requested, but a signing key is returned.
- **Lack of Contextual Verification:** The code did not properly check whether the requested key was intended for signing before returning a JWS, leading to potential misuse of signing keys and private key leakage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Private Key Leakage:** An attacker could potentially obtain private signing keys by querying for a non-signing key, due to the incorrect handling within the `find_by_thp()` function.
- **Unauthorized Signing:** With access to private signing keys, an attacker could forge signatures, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is triggered through network requests to the `tang` server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `tang` server.
- **Knowledge of Thumbprints:** The attacker would need to know or be able to discover thumbprints of keys managed by the server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without needing any prior authentication or specific privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was discovered during a source code audit by the Twitter Kernel and OS team.
- The fix involves moving the signing functionality to the `find_jws()` function.
- The fix also involved updating tests to properly detect the issue.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.5, with a "High" confidentiality impact, and "None" for Integrity and Availability.
- The attack vector is "Network" with low complexity and no user interaction is needed.

**Summary of Changes in the Fix:**

The fix included the following changes:
   - Moved the signing part out of `find_by_thp()` and into `find_jws()`. The `find_by_thp` function now only returns the JWK if it's valid for deriving.
    - Updated tests to ensure proper detection and prevention of the issue.
   - The `find_jws()` function now explicitly checks if the key is valid for signing and returns a signed JWS.
   - The `find_jws()` now retrieves the key via `find_by_thp`, and performs the signing if the key can be used for signing.
