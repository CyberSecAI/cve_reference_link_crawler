Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient entropy ("seed") in the CTR DRBG (Deterministic Random Bit Generator) software generator used by FortiOS when a hardware TRNG (True Random Number Generator) is not available. This lack of sufficient randomness in the seeding process makes the random number generator predictable.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Predictable random number generation due to insufficient entropy in the DRBG seed.
    *   The software-based DRBG doesn't have explicit reseeding (fixed in later versions).
    *   Vulnerable to side-channel attacks (flush+reload).

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   When FortiOS acts as a TLS client with an RSA handshake and mutual ECDSA authentication, the long-term ECDSA secret can be recovered by exploiting the insufficient entropy via flush+reload side channel attacks, breaking the TLS connection's confidentiality.
    *   Information disclosure of the private state of DRBG.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Side-channel attacks, specifically flush+reload attacks, are used to observe the behavior of the DRBG and recover its internal state, including long-term secrets.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be in a position to perform flush+reload attacks. This typically implies co-location or the ability to access shared resources with the target.
    *   The attacker needs knowledge of the target system's cryptographic parameters and algorithms, specifically, the use of RSA handshake and mutual ECDSA authentication in TLS connections.
    *   The attacker would need to monitor the FortiOS device during the TLS handshake.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability primarily affects FortiGate models that do not have a hardware TRNG.
* FortiGate models with specific ASICs (CP9, SOC3, SOC4) and Intel CPU-based models with rdseed instructions are not vulnerable if the proper version of FortiOS is used.
*  The impact varies between hardware and virtual machine deployments. VMs are vulnerable unless they leverage Intel rdseed (if the host supports and exposes it) or Araneus USB TRNG.
*  A fix involves reseeding the DRBG periodically, starting with FortiOS 6.0.9 and 6.2.3.
