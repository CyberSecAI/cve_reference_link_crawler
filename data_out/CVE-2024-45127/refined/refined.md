The provided document contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2024-45127.

**CVE-2024-45127**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application stores user-provided data without sufficient sanitization or encoding, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute when other users view the data.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects the malicious payload into a data field within the application which will be stored in the database. When other users access the compromised data, their browsers will execute the attacker's malicious script.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to inject the malicious payload into the application. Requires authenticated access, and admin user privileges.
