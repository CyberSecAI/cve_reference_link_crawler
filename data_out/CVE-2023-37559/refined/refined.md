- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the CmpAppForce component of CODESYS products. Specifically, crafted network communication requests with inconsistent content can cause the component to read from an invalid address.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to the invalid memory access.
- **Attack vectors**: Network communication requests over the CODESYS protocol.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must be authenticated as a user in the affected CODESYS product.
    - The attacker must be able to send network communication requests to the CODESYS server.
