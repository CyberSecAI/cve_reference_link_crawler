{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `nj_setup` function in `netjet.c` might fail with `-EIO`. In this scenario, `card->irq` is initialized to a value greater than zero before `request_irq` is called. Subsequently, `nj_release` might attempt to free the IRQ, even if it was never properly requested.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect resource management",
      "Use of uninitialized resources"
    ],
    "impact": "A crash due to attempting to free a non-requested IRQ. This can lead to a kernel panic and denial of service.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability can be triggered during the probe process of the netjet driver, specifically in the `nj_probe` function if the `nj_setup` function fails with a -EIO error."
      ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger a condition where `nj_setup` fails with `-EIO` which results in `card->irq` being set, but the IRQ not being requested, leading to the vulnerable state."
