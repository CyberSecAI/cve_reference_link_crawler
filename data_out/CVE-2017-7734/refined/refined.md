- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the FortiOS GUI, specifically related to User Groups and Configuration Revision Comments. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute unauthorized JavaScript code in a logged-in user's browser. This could potentially lead to actions performed on behalf of the victim, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack is triggered by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the User Groups or Configuration Revision Comments sections of the FortiOS GUI. When a logged-in user views these sections, the injected script is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to modify User Groups or Configuration Revision Comments within the FortiOS system. This typically implies having some form of authenticated access or the ability to use another vulnerability to achieve this.
