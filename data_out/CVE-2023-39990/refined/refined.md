Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a "broken access control" issue. This means there's a lack of proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This missing check allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user (specifically a "subscriber") could potentially execute higher-privileged actions. The specific impact would depend on the vulnerable function and the specific actions that are not being properly authorized. The report indicates this is a low-severity impact and unlikely to be exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a function within the Paid Memberships Pro plugin that lacks proper access control.
