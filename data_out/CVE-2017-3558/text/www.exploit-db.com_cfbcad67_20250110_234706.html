**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1086

There is a vulnerability in VirtualBox that permits an attacker with
root privileges in a virtual machine with a NAT network interface to
corrupt the memory of the userspace host process and leak memory
contents from the userspace host process. This probably permits an
attacker with root privileges inside the guest to execute arbitrary
code in userspace context on the host.

The issue is in the copy of slirp that is shipped in VirtualBox, in
the function ip_input() in src/VBox/Devices/Network/slirp/ip_input.c:

void
ip_input(PNATState pData, struct mbuf *m)
{
    register struct ip *ip;
    [...]
    ip = mtod(m, struct ip *);
    [...]
    {
        [...]
        /*
         * XXX: TODO: this is most likely a leftover spooky action at
         * a distance from alias_dns.c host resolver code and can be
         * g/c'ed.
         */
        if (m->m_len != RT_N2H_U16(ip->ip_len))
            m->m_len = RT_N2H_U16(ip->ip_len);
    }
    [...]
}

This code does not seem to be present in the upstream version of
slirp.

The assignment `m->m_len = RT_N2H_U16(ip->ip_len)` overwrites the
trusted length field `m_len` of the buffer `m` with the untrusted
length field in the IP header of the received packet. At this point,
the IP header has not been validated at all. All following code that
processes packets relies on the correctness of `m->m_len`, so by
sending an IP header with a bogus length field, an attacker can cause
all following code to operate on out-of-bounds data.

In particular, an attacker can use this bug to obtain the following
attack primitives:

 - The attacker can leak out-of-bounds heap data by sending a UDP
   packet to a host on the internet with checksum 0 and a bogus length
   field in the IP header.
   The host process will send a (possibly fragmented) UDP packet to
   the specified host on the internet that includes out-of-bounds heap
   data.
   This method requires a cooperating host on the internet that the VM
   can talk to using the NAT network interface.
 - The attacker can leak out-of-bounds heap data by sending an ICMP
   Echo Request with a bogus length field in the IP header
   to the CTL_DNS address. The VM host then responds with an ICMP Echo
   Reply that includes out-of-bounds heap data.
   This approach has the advantage of not requiring a cooperating,
   reachable server on the internet, but has the disadvantage that
   the attacker needs to guess the 16-bit ICMP checksum.
 - The attacker can corrupt the heap by sending a UDP packet with a
   bogus length whose IP header contains IP options. The host process
   will then attempt to strip the IP headers via ip_input -> udp_input
   -> ip_stripoptions -> memcpy, which moves the IP payload - including
   out-of-bounds heap data - to a lower address. This can
   in particular be abused to overwrite a slirp heap chunk header
   (struct item) with attacker-controlled packet data.

I have attached a crash PoC. Copy it into a VM whose only network
interface is a NAT interface, compile it with
"gcc -o crasher crasher.c" and run it with "sudo ./crasher". The VM
should die after a few seconds, with something like this appearing in
dmesg on the host:

[107463.674598] traps: EMT-0[66638] general protection ip:7fc6a26076e8 sp:7fc6d2e27ad0 error:0 in VBoxDD.so[7fc6a24e2000+36d000]

I have tested my crasher in VirtualBox version "5.1.14 r112924".

The bug was introduced in SVN revision
<https://www.virtualbox.org/changeset/23155/vbox>.

################################################################################

Without modifications,
the exploit should work under the following conditions:

 - host runs Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty), 64-bit
 - host uses libc6 package version 2.19-0ubuntu6.9 (most recent
   version)
 - VirtualBox version is 5.1.14~112924~Ubuntu~trusty (official build)
   (most recent version)
 - guest runs Linux
 - main network interface of the VM is a NAT interface (default
   config)

The exploit is able to run an arbitrary shell command on the host
system. The command is hardcoded to "id > /tmp/owned_from_guest".

Some things about the exploit that might be of interest to you:

The exploit operates on memory that belongs to the zone zone_clust of
the UMA heap.
The UMA heap is relatively easy to attack, partly because the sanity
checks are compiled out in userland code in release builds. For
example, the check
`Assert((zone->magic == ZONE_MAGIC && zone == it->zone))` in
uma_zfree_arg() becomes a no-op, and the LIST_CHECKs in LIST_REMOVE()
have no effect. In particular, because the `zone == it->zone`
assertion is not compiled into release builds, an attacker who can
overwrite an item header and point its member ->zone to a controlled
memory area can cause an arbitrary function it->zone->pfFini to be
called when the item whose header was overwritten is freed.
It might make sense to turn assertions in the allocator into something
that is also active in release builds.

For exploiting the bug, it was very helpful that the VirtualBox binary
is built as non-relocatable, meaning that the binary is always loaded
at the same virtual address. The exploit uses a hardcoded address to
leak the contents of the GOT (global offset table), which can then be
used to locate the addresses of libc functions.
It's probably a good idea to build the VirtualBox binaries as
relocatable code to prevent attacks from simply using
hardcoded addresses - and this mitigation is pretty simple to
implement, you just have to add some compiler flags (`-pie -fPIE`
or so). To verify that it's working, run VirtualBox, then as root,
grep the contents of /proc/{pid of VirtualBox}/maps for VirtualBox and
verify that the mappings don't have low ranges like 00400000-00408000,
but use high addresses like 7ffb0f62e000 instead.

As far as I can tell from the source, on a Linux or Mac host, an
attacker who has compromised the VM host process can also run
arbitrary code in the host kernel using the ioctls SUP_IOCTL_LDR_OPEN
and SUP_IOCTL_LDR_LOAD. If that is indeed the case, it might make
sense to reduce the privileges of the userland host code by
sandboxing components like the shared folder host and the NAT
implementation and/or by rearchitecting VirtualBox so that the host
kernel doesn't trust the host userland binary.

To reproduce the bug with the attached exploit:

 - On the host or some other box on the internet, compile and run the
   helper:

       $ gcc -o helper helper.c -Wall
       $ ./helper

 - In the guest, compile the exploit:

       # gcc -o bcs bcs.c -Wall -std=gnu99

   (This may throw some harmless format string warnings depending on
   whether the guest is 64-bit.)

 - To improve reliability, ensure that the guest isn't
   running any network services or clients, save the guest VM and
   restore it. (Saving and restoring the guest resets the Slirp heap.)

 - In the guest, as root, run the exploit. Pass the helper host's IP
   address as argument.

       # ./bcs xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

 - If the exploit was successful, there should be a new file
   "/tmp/owned_from_guest" on the host that contains the output of the
   "id" command.

A successful run of the exploit should look like this:

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
