| | Cisco Security AdvisorySudo Privilege Escalation Vulnerability Affecting Cisco Products: January 2021 High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-sudo-privesc-jan2021-qnYQfcM  First Published: 2021 January 29 21:30 GMT  Last Updated:  2021 March 16 20:43 GMT  Version 1.15:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  CVE-2021-3156     CWE-122          CVE-2021-3156     CWE-122       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sudo-privesc-jan2021-qnYQfcM/csaf/cisco-sa-sudo-privesc-jan2021-qnYQfcM.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the command line parameter parsing code of Sudo could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute commands or binaries with root privileges.  The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of command line parameters that may result in a heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a Unix shell on an affected device and then invoking the **sudoedit** command with crafted parameters or by executing a binary exploit. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands or binaries with root privileges.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sudo-privesc-jan2021-qnYQfcM>  Affected Products  * Cisco investigated its product line to determine which products and services may be affected by this vulnerability.  The [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section includes Cisco bug IDs for each affected product. The bugs are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool and contain additional platform-specific information, including workarounds (if available) and fixed software releases.    Vulnerable Products The following table lists Cisco products that are affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory. If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the Last Updated date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details. Unless otherwise documented, all software releases prior to the first fixed release are to be considered affected by this vulnerability.       | Product | Cisco Bug ID | [Fixed Release Availability](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes) |   | --- | --- | --- |   | Network Management and Provisioning | | |   | Cisco Elastic Services Controller (ESC) | [CSCvx18712](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx18712) | ESC-5.4.0.86 (Available) |   | Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning | [CSCvx18714](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx18714) | 12.6.SU3 (Apr 2021) |   | Cisco Prime Service Catalog Virtual Appliance | [CSCvx18724](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx18724) | See the bug for update information. |   | Cisco Smart Net Total Care - On-Premises | [CSCvx18702](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx18702) | 2.1.0.1 (Mar 2021) |   | Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem | [CSCvx22363](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx22363) | 8-202102 (Mar 2021) |   | Routing and Switching - Enterprise and Service Provider | | |   | Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches | [CSCvx18710](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx18710) | 7.0(3)I7(9) (Available)19.3.7 (Available)10.1.1 (Available) |   | Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches | [CSCvx18709](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx18709) | 8.4.4 (Available) |   | Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode | [CSCvx18710](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx18710) | 7.0(3)I7(9) (Available)19.3.7 (Available)10.1.1 (Available) |   | Cisco Redundancy and Configuration Manager (for 4G/5G StarOS UserPlane) | [CSCvx19139](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx19139) | 21.23.0 (Mar 2021)21.22.uax (Apr 2021) |   | Unified Computing | | |   | Cisco UCS Director | [CSCvx18705](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx18705) | 6.8 (Mar 2021) |   | Voice and Unified Communications Devices | | |   | Cisco Paging Server (InformaCast) | [CSCvx18737](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx18737) | 12.22.1 (Mar 2021)14.0.1 (Mar 2021) |   | Cisco Cloud Hosted Services | | |   | Cisco Common Services Platform Collector | [CSCvx20991](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx20991) | 2.9.0.2 (Available)See the bug for 2.8 update information. |   | Cisco CX Cloud Agent Software | [CSCvx49685](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx49685) | 1.3 (Available) |   | Cisco Ultra Cloud | [CSCvx21182](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx21182) | 2020.02.1.i33 (Mar 2021) |       1. See the bug for additional operations that may be required to fully address this vulnerability. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products and services listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vulnerable) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Products that do not offer the capability for users to access an interactive terminal or to execute custom binaries in the context of the underlying Unix operating system or of a guest Unix operating system do not present an attack vector for the exploitation of this vulnerability and therefore are not considered vulnerable.
