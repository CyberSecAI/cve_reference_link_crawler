## Sudo set\_cmd() is vulnerable to heap-based buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#794544

Original Release Date: 2021-02-04 | Last Revised: 2021-04-26

---

### Overview

A heap-based overflow has been discovered in the `set_cmd()` function in sudo, which may allow a local attacker to execute commands with elevated administrator privileges.

### Description

From the [Sudo Main Page](https://sudo.ws):

> Sudo (su "do") allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments.

It is possible for a local Non-administrative user to exploit this vulnerability to elevate their privileges so that they can execute commands with administrator privileges. The team at [Qualys](https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-research/2021/01/26/cve-2021-3156-heap-based-buffer-overflow-in-sudo-baron-samedit) assigned this vulnerability CVE-2021-3156 and found multiple \*nix operating systems were vulnerable, including Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu. A blog update from February 3, 2021, reports that macOS, AIX, and Solaris may be vulnerable, but Qualys had not yet confirmed this.
There is [additional reporting](https://www.zdnet.com/article/recent-root-giving-sudo-bug-also-impacts-macos/) that other operating systems are affected, including Appleâs Big Sur.

### Impact

If an attacker has local access to an affected machine then it is possible for them to execute commands with administrator privileges.

### Solution

**Apply an Update**

Update sudo to the latest version to address this vulnerability when operationally feasible. This issue is resolved in sudo version 1.9.5p2. Please install this version, or a version from your distribution that has the fix applied to it

### Acknowledgements

This vulnerability was researched and reported by the Qualys Research Team.

### [Juniper Networks](#Juniper%20Networks) Affected

#### Vendor Statement

Juniper SIRT has confirmed that Sudo is not supplied with JUNOS/FreeBSD, hence these are not affected.

On Juniper platforms which are hosted on Wind River Linux (WRL) instances, the WRL instance contains the vulnerable version of Sudo, but only within the WRL OS. To exploit this vulnerability on Wind River Linux (WRL), authenticated users with Junos shell access, would first need to switch to a root account and then login to WRL OS. The vulnerability is contained within the WRL instance for which the Junos user would already have root privileges.

#### Vendor Statement

While the base FreeBSD installation does not include sudo and is therefore not directly affected by this vulnerability, the FreeBSD Project recognises that sudo is a very popular package for users to install on FreeBSD.

Users can install sudo on FreeBSD using ports or binary packages. The sudo port was updated to 1.9.5p2 on 2021-01-26 at 20:15:31 (main) and on 2021-01-26 20:40:57 (2021Q1 quarterly). Binary packages are available for all tier-1 supported platforms (amd64, i386, aarch64) and several tier-2 supported platforms.

#### Vendor Statement

illumos itself does not have sudo in its source. Illumos distros, however, do.

A NOTE: base illumos has the RBAC/profile-based pfexec(1) family of commands that are an alternative for sudo.

SmartOS: Use `pkgin upgrade` on any zones that have sudo installed.

OmniOSce and OpenIndiana (both use the IPS package system): Use `pkg update` to obtain the latest sudo if it's installed.

Dilos: Is fixed in update https://bitbucket.org/dilos/du2/commits/ca5129c54c84d7b2fd75d17e465e970435018f55 - a Debian-style update will install it.

Tribblix: If sudo is installed, `zap refresh && zap update sudo`

| **CVE-2021-3156** | Not Affected |
| --- | --- |

#### Vendor Statement

The Zephyr project is an embedded RTOS, and as such, does not directly have the capability to run sudo. However, there are few instances of sudo in the project scripts and documentation.

* Numerous instances throughout the documentation of suggestions to run a command with sudo. Generally, these are platform package management commands, in order to install dependencies needed to build Zephyr. It is assumed that the developer already has privileges necessary to run these commands, and this exploit would not gain additional privileges.
* sudo is used in CI to install dependencies needed to run the tests. These operations are run in a containered environment, and sudo is configured to run without requesting a password. Again privileges are required to run the tests, and no additional privileges are gained through this exploit.
