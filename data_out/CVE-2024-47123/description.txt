The goTenna Pro App uses AES CTR type encryption for short, encrypted 
messages without any additional integrity checking mechanisms. This 
leaves messages malleable to an attacker that can access the message. It
 is recommended to continue to use encryption in the app and update to 
the current release for more secure operations.
