- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The FortiTester appliance uses a hardcoded password for the mongodb service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of hard-coded credentials (CWE-798).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who has gained shell access to the device can use the hardcoded credentials to access the database via shell commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data modification, or data exfiltration.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to gain shell access to the FortiTester appliance to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker requires local access (or an exploit that grants shell access) to the FortiTester device to leverage the hardcoded credentials for the mongodb service.
