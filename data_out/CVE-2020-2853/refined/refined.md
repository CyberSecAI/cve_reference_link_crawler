Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2853:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The provided documents directly mention CVE-2020-2853 in the context of MySQL vulnerabilities. Therefore, the content is relevant.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

**Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The root cause isn't specified for CVE-2020-2853 in the provided documents, but it is related to the server-side security and privilege handling mechanisms within the MySQL database. It appears in multiple contexts of fixes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: A privilege-related vulnerability exists in MySQL Server's handling of security checks, possibly leading to unauthorized actions if exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation**:
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The Gentoo advisory mentions the worst case could be arbitrary code execution.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The Gentoo advisory also mentions the possibility of privilege escalation, which can lead to elevated access within the system.
*   **Data Access:** Gaining access to sensitive data or complete access to MySQL data is mentioned as a possible impact by both Gentoo and NetApp.
*   **Denial of Service:** A Denial of Service condition is also a possibility.

The NetApp advisory specifically notes:
   *   Unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server.
   *   Unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all of the MySQL Server accessible data.
   *   A hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server.
The oracle advisory says, that it is an "unspecified vulnerability" which is "remotely exploitable without authentication" and affects "MySQL Server".

**Attack Vectors**:
*   **Network**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network protocols, specifically mentioned by Gentoo and NetApp.
    *   The Oracle advisory indicates that it is remotely exploitable "without authentication", meaning no user credentials are required to attempt an exploit.
   *   **MySQL Protocol**: The vulnerability is specifically related to the MySQL protocol, as noted in the Oracle advisory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
*  **Network Access**: Remote network access to the affected MySQL server is needed.
* **No Authentication Required**: The Oracle advisory mentions that no authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**3. Additional Notes:**

*   **Multiple Vulnerabilities**: The content consistently indicates that CVE-2020-2853 is one of many vulnerabilities addressed in various MySQL updates.
*   **Patching is Critical**: All sources emphasize the importance of applying the latest security patches to mitigate the risk of exploitation.
*   **Affected Products**: Besides MySQL Server, the Gentoo advisory notes that `dev-db/mysql-connector-c` is also affected. NetApp indicates that multiple of their products that use MySQL are also affected.
*   **Vendor Response**:  Oracle, Gentoo, and NetApp issued advisories recommending updates to address the vulnerabilities. Fedora also released updates to address the vulnerabilities.
*   **CVSS Score:** NetApp indicates the CVSS score for CVE-2020-2853 is 4.9 (MEDIUM) with vector CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. Oracle indicates a CVSS score of 4.9 (Medium).

**4. Summary:**
CVE-2020-2853 is a security vulnerability within the privilege handling of MySQL Server which is remotely exploitable without authentication. It can potentially lead to a range of impacts, including arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, data access, and denial-of-service. Updating the software is essential to mitigate the risk.

In summary, the information in these documents provides a reasonable amount of detail regarding CVE-2020-2853.
