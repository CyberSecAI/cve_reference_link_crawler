Arbitrary Code Execution in TD Advanced Dashboard

 [Raw](/khronokernel/2598c067d0f49b0f0a4c8b01cf129d34/raw/fb0d307f26e0b419e4d072bd2d7de9a9b3d751b3/CVE-2023-50975.md)

# CVE-2023-50975 - Arbitrary Code Execution in TD Advanced Dashboard

On December 12th, 2023, TD Bank was notified through their [responsible disclosure system](https://www.td.com/ca/en/about-td/privacy-and-security/report-vulnerability) that TD Advanced Dashboard version 3.0.3 was vulnerable to arbitrary code execution.

## Affected Products

* TD Advanced Dashboard
  + Affected: 3.0.3 and older
  + Fixed: 3.0.4

## Vulnerability Details

Due to TD Advanced Dashboard being built with Electron [v9.3.1](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v9.3.1), the Electron framework implements the `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` environment variable without the ability to disable the feature. Therefore a local attacker can set this environment variable and execute arbitrary code under the context of TD Advanced Dashboard.

With TD Advanced Dashboard v3.0.4, TD Bank opted to upgrade the Electron backend to [v12.2.3](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v12.2.3) and set the `RunAsNode` fuse to false.
