  "CVE-2023-39947": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Fast-DDS when processing malformed RTPS packets, specifically within the `PID_PROPERTY_LIST` parameter, leading to a crash.",
    "details": "The vulnerability is triggered by a malformed `PID_PROPERTY_LIST` parameter within an RTPS packet. Specifically, a crafted packet includes a property list parameter with an incorrect size, causing a heap buffer overflow during the `memcpy` operation in the `push_back_helper` function. The size of the property value is read from the packet, and used to copy the data, however if that size exceeds the available buffer, a heap overflow occurs. This occurs even after the fix for a similar issue, indicating a different program counter for this overflow.",

    "patched_versions": ">= 2.11.1, 2.10.2, 2.9.2, 2.6.6",

    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to a machine running a vulnerable version of fastdds. No authentication is required, and no user interaction is required.",
