### @Jflick58 **[Jflick58](/Jflick58)** commented [Jun 2, 2023](#issue-1738953863) ‚Ä¢ edited Loading

This replaces the usage of the insecure `exec` function with a more secure library called [wasm\_exec](https://github.com/Jflick58/wasm_exec) TL;DR: Use `chroot` jails, `wasmtime` and a standalone Python3.11 WASM interpreter to safely execute arbitrary code

Some questions before I officially submit this pr:

* **How critical is it that we support the execution of code containing 3rd-party dependencies?** The team behind the wasm interpreter I vendor with the library is working on porting `numpy` along with some of the c libs needed to enable broader package support.

  + *If it is critical, then how critical is it to support Python versions below 3.11?* Right now the interpreter does support the use of an existing venv for accessing installed 3rd party deps, but the interpreter is only distributed in 3.11 which means I would either a) have to only support 3.11 b) have a 3rd split in the PythonRepl code base (base, AST, Wasm) or b) try to write some hacky and unpythonic code to try to dynamically create a new 3.11-based venv off of the currently active Python environment.
  + *If it is not critical* then is it okay if I refactor the test cases to avoid the tests containing `numpy` and `pandas` code? Should we also update the docs to reflect that limitation?

I also strongly welcome feedback on the wasm\_exec library if there are implementation ideas that make it more functional.

| Just my opinions here. I've not commit bit & am relatively new to langchain.  This replaces the usage of the insecure `exec` function with a more secure library called [wasm\_exec](https://github.com/Jflick58/wasm_exec) TL;DR: Use `chroot` jails, `wasmtime` and a standalone Python3.11 WASM interpreter to safely execute arbitrary code  100% needed, and thanks!  Some questions before I officially submit this pr:   * **How critical is it that we support the execution of code containing 3rd-party dependencies?** The team behind the wasm interpreter I vendor with the library is working on porting `numpy` along with some of the c libs needed to enable broader package support.  It's better to get this in place first, and then worry about 3rd party deps later. The security concern massively outweighs feature depth.  * *If it is critical, then how critical is it to support Python versions below 3.11?* Right now the interpreter does support the use of an existing venv for accessing installed 3rd party deps, but the interpreter is only distributed in 3.11 which means I would either a) have to only support 3.11 b) have a 3rd split in the PythonRepl code base (base, AST, Wasm) or b) try to write some hacky and unpythonic code to try to dynamically create a new 3.11-based venv off of the currently active Python environment.  I also think it's not worth a lot of effort to support power Python versions. (b) & (c) feel like maintenance burdens, and simplicity is important in security-minded components. |

This seems dependent on the conversation below. Given that this is a big reason for the CVE that are flagging Langchain in different security scans, I'd advocate (for now) to make it a required dependency.

i would probably bias towards a separate util tbh. since this introduces a new dependency

I think this also goes back to the fundamental question of whether this should be an add-in or replace the default exec functionality. If it's the default replacement, then seems like leveraging the python util makes sense.

The goal of this PR is to offer better security in use of Python REPL, and passing in `globals()` looks like a massive security hole to me. I see a lot of code out there where people expose e.g. their API keys and other secrets as globals in memory space, and those could be a prompt injection target. The rest of your comments, [@hwchase17](https://github.com/hwchase17) seem to be towards making a higher security level optional, and I'd reluctantly accept that (for me, higher security should be the default), but if the user does opt for a tighter ship, then that `_globals=None` is IMO an important part of the picture.

agreed with [@uogbuji](https://github.com/uogbuji) but also right now the Wasm interpreter doesn't supported globals that can't be represented as a type that can be easily converted to string. Often the result of the globals function call are object types that can't be converted to string.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| sorry for the delay here. high level thoughts:   1. We almost certainly don't want to introduce this as a dependency for the main project 2. We want to support as flexible of python running for prototyping purposes as possible 3. We do not want people to be running this in production   I would suggest the following changes:   1. We will move the current python tools and anything that depends on them into `langchain.experimental` and make that a separate package. This should remove CVEs from core langchain, while also hopefullying making it clear its experimental, and also allowing for prototyping 2. I would encourage the creation of a separate `langchain_python` or the like respository where that uses wasm by default. we'd be happy to support this in a variety of ways (help setting up, help publicizing, help maintaining), but i think we'd prefer it to be a separate repository   thoughts? |

| Responded more in [#8092](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/8092)  As far as this goes, I'll probably take these changes and implement as a separate package. How would that jive with the story of `langchain.experimental` though? Seems confusing to me to have an unsafe and safe way of doing things, both as external packages and possibly publicized by LangChain. |
