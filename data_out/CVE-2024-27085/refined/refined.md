Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-27085:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the ability of users with invite privileges to inject arbitrarily large data into parameters used in the invite route. Specifically, the email, domain, and custom message fields within the invite functionality were not properly limited in length.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation and sanitization: The application did not enforce maximum length limits for parameters used in the invite route such as email, domain, and custom message.
- Vulnerable parameters: Email, domain and custom_message parameters in the invite functionality.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending requests with excessively large data in the vulnerable parameters, likely consuming excessive server resources and potentially leading to server crashes or slowdowns.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attack can be performed remotely over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user with the privilege to invite other users. This is typically a low-privileged role within the application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was patched by introducing length restrictions on the vulnerable parameters.
- The fix includes adding maximum length validations for email (500 characters), custom message (1000 characters) and domain (500 characters).
- The patch was introduced in the following versions: stable >= 3.2.1; beta >= 3.3.0.beta2; tests-passed >= 3.3.0.beta2.
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was assigned a CVSS score of 6.5, with the following vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
- Workarounds included disabling invites or restricting access to the invite functionality.
- The advisory states that the vulnerability was fixed by limiting the length of the invite parameters.
