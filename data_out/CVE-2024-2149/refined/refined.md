The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability (SQLi) in the "membership-management-system" PHP application, specifically in the `/settings.php` file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the "currency" field when updating system settings, which allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: Specifically, the application is vulnerable to a blind SQL injection, which can be exploited via the `extractvalue()` function in MySQL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database information leakage. An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database including user credentials and system configuration.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/settings.php`. The malicious SQL payload is injected through the "currency" form field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the application's admin panel, which is secured with default credentials, indicating a potential weakness in the initial setup. The attacker must also be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
