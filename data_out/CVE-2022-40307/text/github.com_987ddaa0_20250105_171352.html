efi: capsule-loader: Fix use-after-free in efi\_capsule\_write

```
A race condition may occur if the user calls close() on another thread
during a write() operation on the device node of the efi capsule.

This is a race condition that occurs between the efi_capsule_write() and
efi_capsule_flush() functions of efi_capsule_fops, which ultimately
results in UAF.

So, the page freeing process is modified to be done in
efi_capsule_release() instead of efi_capsule_flush().
