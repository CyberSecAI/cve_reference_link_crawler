Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-23909

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Uncontrolled search path in the Intel® FPGA SDK for OpenCL™ software technology.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The software does not properly control the search path it uses to load resources. This allows an attacker to potentially place malicious files in a location where the software will load them, leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Escalation of privilege. A local user could potentially gain higher privileges than intended by exploiting this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:** Local access by an authenticated user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the affected software is installed.
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, meaning they must have valid credentials to log in to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the file system to inject malicious files in a location used by the application.
- User interaction is required.

**Additional Information:**
- Intel is not releasing updates to mitigate this vulnerability.
- A Product Discontinuation Notice has been issued for the Intel® FPGA SDK for OpenCL™ software technology.
- Users are advised to migrate to the Intel® FPGA Add-on for oneAPI Base Toolkit.
