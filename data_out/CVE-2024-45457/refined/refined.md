Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The Spiffy Calendar plugin for WordPress (versions <= 4.9.13) is vulnerable to XSS. This means it doesn't properly sanitize user inputs, allowing malicious scripts to be injected into the website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts (e.g. JavaScript, HTML payloads) into the website. This could lead to:
    *   Redirects to malicious sites.
    *   Displaying unwanted advertisements.
    *   Other malicious actions that can compromise the site, manipulate user sessions, steal cookies etc.
    *   Generally, the site's security is compromised and allows attackers to perform actions as the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The specific attack vector is not detailed but it is likely through a plugin input that is not correctly sanitized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to inject code into the plugin's input. The required privilege is stated as "Contributor" which suggests a role within the WordPress system that can modify content, but more detail may be required.
