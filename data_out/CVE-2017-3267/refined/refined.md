Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-3267:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-3267

**Component:** Oracle Outside In Technology

**Sub-component:** Outside In Filters

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**  The document indicates a vulnerability within the Outside In Filters of Oracle Outside In Technology. While the specific nature of the vulnerability isn't detailed, the description implies a processing error, likely during the parsing of input data, leading to a vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** A vulnerability exists in how the Outside In filters process data, which can be triggered by network based input.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to a denial of service, which is a loss of availability. The confidentiality and integrity of the system are not affected.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, specifically over HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send malicious HTTP requests to a system that utilizes the vulnerable Oracle Outside In Technology component. No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:** Oracle Outside In Technology versions 8.5.2 and 8.5.3 are affected.

**Additional Notes:**
- The document notes that the CVSS score assumes that software passes data directly from the network to the vulnerable Outside In Technology code. If this isn't the case, the CVSS score (and thus, the risk) may be lower.
- The document also indicates that the protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code.
