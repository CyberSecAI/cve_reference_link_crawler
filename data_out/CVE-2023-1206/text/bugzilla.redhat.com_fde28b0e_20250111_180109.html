| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2175903#c0)  Alex    2023-03-06 18:10:51 UTC  ``` A flaw in the Linux Kernel found in the Linux kernel’s networking stack which permits attackers to force hash collisions in the IPv6 connection lookup table. This results in a significant increase in the cost of lookups, causing increased CPU utilization. This significant CPU usage increase in the Linux kernel subjected to a modified form of the classic IPv6 SYN-Flood. The actual impact of this issue may be a denial of service (due to heightened CPU usage) to hosts which can receive malicious IPv6 traffic.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2175903#c8)  Alex    2023-06-25 09:58:11 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2217240](show_bug.cgi?id=2217240 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2023-1206 kernel: hash collisions in the IPv6 connection lookup table [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=2175903#c19)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2023-08-16 18:56:19 UTC  ``` Is <https://git.kernel.org/linus/d11b0df7ddf1831f3e170972f43186dad520bfcc> the fix for this issue?
