Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-29833

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization of SVG files during upload. While the plugin attempts to remove `<script>` tags using a regular expression, this regex can be easily bypassed by adding a space at the end of the closing tag (`</script >`). This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code within the SVG file.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of script-related HTML tags in user-controlled input (SVG files). Specifically, the regular expression used to sanitize SVG files is too simplistic and can be bypassed, resulting in an XSS vulnerability.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can upload a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to upload files to the WordPress plugin's file manager.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could result in various impacts, including:
    *   **Data theft:** The injected script could steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive data.
    *   **Account compromise:** The attacker could perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as editing content, changing settings, or performing other privileged actions.
    *   **Malware distribution:** The injected script could redirect the user to a malicious site or download malware onto their computer.
    *   **Defacement:** The attacker could alter the appearance of the website.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `photo-gallery\filemanager\UploadHandler.php`.
*   The specific regular expression used for sanitization is `#<script(.\*?)>(.\*?)</script>#is`.
*   The bypass is achieved by adding a space to the closing tag: `</script >`

**Example Exploit (SVG File):**

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
<svg version="1.1" baseProfile="full" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<polygon id="triangle" points="0,0 0,50 50,0" fill="#009900" stroke="#004400"/>
<script type="text/javascript">
alert('XSS!');
</script >
</svg>
```
**Mitigation:**
*   The plugin should be upgraded to version 1.8.22 or later, which includes a fix for this vulnerability.
