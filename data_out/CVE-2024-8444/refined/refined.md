- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Download Manager plugin fails to sanitize shortcode parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a post via shortcodes that are executed when a user views the post. This could lead to arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser, session hijacking, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a user with contributor-level access by creating a post with a crafted shortcode containing malicious JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least a contributor role within the WordPress site in order to create the malicious post. The user viewing the page does not need to be logged in.
