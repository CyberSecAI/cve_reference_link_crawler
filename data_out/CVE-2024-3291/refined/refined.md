Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-3291:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: When installing Nessus Agent to a directory outside of the default location on a Windows host, Nessus Agent versions prior to 10.6.4 did not enforce secure permissions for sub-directories.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: Insecure directory permissions during installation in non-default locations. Specifically, subdirectories of the installation path lack proper access controls.

*   **Impact of Exploitation**: Local privilege escalation. A local attacker could gain elevated privileges on the system by exploiting the weak directory permissions in a non-default install location.

*   **Attack Vectors**: Local access. An attacker must have local access to the Windows machine where Nessus Agent is installed.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   Local access to the Windows host.
    *   The Nessus agent must be installed in a non-default location.
    *   The user must be able to write into the affected sub-directories, and the sub-directories must not have been secured by the user.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description by specifying that the vulnerability occurs in non-default installation locations, and the specific issue is with subdirectory permissions.
