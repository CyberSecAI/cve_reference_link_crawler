| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=163274#c0)  Jeff Sheltren    2005-07-14 18:21:39 UTC  ``` From Bugzilla Helper: User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.9) Gecko/20050711 Firefox/1.0.5  Description of problem: When processing a request, the CUPS scheduler would use case-sensitive matching on the queue name to decide which authorization policy should be used. However, queue names are not case-sensitive. An unauthorized user could print to a password-protected queue without needing a password.
