# USN-185-1: CUPS vulnerability

20 September 2005

CUPS vulnerability

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 4.10](/security/notices?release=warty)

## Details

A flaw was detected in the printer access control list checking in the

CUPS server. Printer names were compared in a case sensitive manner;

by modifying the capitalization of printer names, a remote attacker

could circumvent ACLs and print to printers he should not have access

to.

The Ubuntu 5.04 version of cupsys is not vulnerable against this.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=162405#c0)  Alessandro Crespi    2005-07-04 07:41:39 UTC  ``` From Bugzilla Helper: User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4  Description of problem: The Location directives in cupsd.conf are case sensitive, so if I define an ACL for a print queue named "printer", it is not applied if I print to "Printer" or "prinTer". It is clearly not possible to enter ACLs for all possible cases (for "Printer" it would mean 128 possibilities...).  This issue is documented and has already been fixed in CUPS 1.1.21rc1 (see <http://www.cups.org/str.php?L700>).   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): cups-1.1.17-13.3.27  How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: Add an ACL for a printer, for example:  <Location /printers/printer> ..... </Location>  Then print to it by using a different case for the name (e.g. Printer).  Actual Results:  You can print circumvent the ACL.  Expected Results:  The Location directive must be treated in a case-insensitive way, as print queue names are.  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=162405#c1)  Tim Waugh    2005-07-04 11:40:55 UTC  ``` Thank you for reporting this.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3: vulnerable Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4: not affected    ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=162405#c7)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2005-07-14 17:48:50 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2005-571.html>    ``` |  |
