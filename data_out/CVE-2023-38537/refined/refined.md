- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A race condition in a network transport subsystem.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap use-after-free.
- **Impact of exploitation:** App termination or unexpected control flow, with very low probability.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs in established or unsilenced incoming audio/video calls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would likely need to initiate or be involved in a call to trigger the race condition. The specific capabilities and positions required are not detailed.
