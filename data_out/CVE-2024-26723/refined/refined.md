The provided content relates to CVE-2024-26723.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a lack of null pointer checks when adding a network interface to a Link Aggregation Group (LAG) on the lan966x driver. When adding an interface to a LAG, the code iterates through all ports to identify those already in the LAG, but some ports may be NULL pointers if they are not probed, leading to a crash when attempting to dereference them.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The code attempts to access the `bond` member of a `lan966x_port` structure without checking if the port pointer or the bond pointer is NULL, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: Exploiting this vulnerability causes a kernel crash, resulting in a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network configuration: The vulnerability is triggered when configuring network interfaces using the `ip` command by adding a `lan966x` interface to a LAG bond.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to configure network interfaces on the system, which typically requires root or administrative privileges.
