The provided content includes information about a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Modern Loan Management System 1.0" by mayuri_k, but not a CVE with the ID CVE-2024-9089.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the `amount` parameter in `update_loan_record.php` is not properly sanitized or encoded before being displayed on the web page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `amount` parameter.
- When a victim views the affected page, the attacker's script will execute in the victim's browser.
- This allows an attacker to potentially:
    - Steal cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirect the victim to a malicious website.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the victim.
    - Modify the content of the page.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `amount` parameter in the `update_loan_record.php` file.
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload and injects it into this parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the `update_loan_record.php` script with a malicious payload.
- They must have the ability to modify the `amount` parameter, which likely requires user authentication or the ability to bypass authentication.
