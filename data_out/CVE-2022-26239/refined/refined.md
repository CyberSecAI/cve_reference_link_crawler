{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The permissions set by Remisol Advance during installation allow non-privileged users to overwrite and/or manipulate executables and libraries that run as the elevated SYSTEM user on Windows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure file permissions that allow non-privileged users to modify critical system files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A non-privileged user can gain SYSTEM/NT Authority user privileges by replacing legitimate service executables with malicious ones. This allows for complete control over the local Windows host.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to a workstation with the vulnerable software installed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Low-level access to a workstation (e.g., through weak passwords, default vendor passwords, or no password)."
