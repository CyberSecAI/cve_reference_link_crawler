## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Secure Copy Content Protection and Content Locking < 4.1.7 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=secure-copy-content-protection&sccp\_tab=tab5&status=saved
2. In the "Custom CSS" text area, enter the payload:
a { background-color: red; }
</style><script>alert(4444)</script>
3. See the XSS on the frontend

### Affects Plugins
