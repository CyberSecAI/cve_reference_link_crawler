- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to sanitize and escape user-controlled input within its settings, specifically in the "Custom CSS" text area.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with high privileges, such as an administrator, can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. When a user views the affected page, the injected script will execute, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or modifying the website's content.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must have administrator-level access to the WordPress dashboard and navigate to the plugin settings page. Then, they can inject the malicious script into the "Custom CSS" textarea. The XSS payload is triggered on the front-end when a user visits the website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have administrator-level privileges within the WordPress installation.
