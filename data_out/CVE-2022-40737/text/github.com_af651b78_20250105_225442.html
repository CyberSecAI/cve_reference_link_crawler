| Which version of the software are you using? This does not seem to be affecting the last commit on the master branch. Sorry, it is my problem. I use the [v1.6.0-639](https://github.com/axiomatic-systems/Bento4/releases/tag/v1.6.0-639) release version to test, and the use clang/clang++ 12.0.1 to compile the project in Ubuntu 18.04 operation system . While in the latest version,the problem has been fixed. Since the similar issues have not been comitted, I am trying to do more tests to make the issue can be reproduced in the latest commit version. Thanks for your reply! |
