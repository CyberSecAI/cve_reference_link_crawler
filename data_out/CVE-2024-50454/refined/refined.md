Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the SEOPress WordPress plugin. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is a failure to properly restrict access to certain functions based on user privileges. This means that a user without the required permissions can still execute those functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The specific impact is not detailed here, as it is said to "vary case by case". However, in general, broken access control can lead to unauthorized modification of data, privilege escalation, and other security breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability, they just need to be able to interact with the vulnerable plugin.
