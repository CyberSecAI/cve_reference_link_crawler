Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-33044:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the improper handling of the "clientType" parameter during the "global.login" sequence in Dahua devices. Specifically, setting the "clientType" to "NetKeyboard" bypasses authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the normal authentication mechanism by manipulating the `clientType` parameter in the login request. The system incorrectly accepts the "NetKeyboard" client type, even when the device doesn't support this functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Dahua device.
*   **Full Control:** Once authenticated (or bypassed), an attacker can potentially gain complete control of the device, depending on the privileges associated with the default admin account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attack vector is remote, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network.
*   **Protocol:** The vulnerability is present in the DHIP and HTTP/HTTPS protocols used by Dahua devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network or have network access to the vulnerable Dahua device.
*   **No Credentials Needed:** The attacker does not need valid login credentials to exploit this specific vulnerability. The authentication bypass allows the attacker to effectively circumvent the need for credentials.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability is triggered by sending a "global.login" request with the "clientType" parameter set to "NetKeyboard". This is unexpected behavior, as devices not supporting this functionality should not allow authentication bypass.

Example of a vulnerable login request:
```json
{
    "method": "global.login",
    "params":
    {
        "userName": "admin",
        "loginType": "Direct",
        "clientType": "NetKeyboard",
        "authorityType": "Default",
        "passwordType": "Default",
        "password": "Not Used"
    },
    "id": 1,
    "session": 0
}
```

**Affected Devices:**
* IPC/VTH/VTO devices with firmware older than June 2021 that do not support "NetKeyboard" functionality are affected.
