Due to unrestricted access to the Meta Model
Repository services in SAP NetWeaver AS Java, attackers can perform DoS attacks
on the application, which may prevent legitimate users from accessing it. This
can result in no impact on confidentiality and integrity but a high impact on
the availability of the application.
