The provided content contains detailed information about CVE-2021-42258.

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw found in the login form of BillQuick Web Suite. The application constructs SQL queries by concatenating strings, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The main vulnerability is the presence of concatenated SQL queries that enable blind SQL injection via the login form.
- **Use of `sa` account:** BillQuick Web Suite was often configured to use the `sa` (System Administrator) account for database authentication.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize user inputs, allowing malicious SQL code to be injected.
- **Error handling revealing sensitive info:**  The applicationâ€™s error handlers for the login page display full tracebacks, which could expose sensitive server-side code details.
- **Default/Insecure Configuration:** The software encourages the use of the "sa" account during the initial setup and install multiple times, this is a system administrator level account and is not appropriate for use in a production environment.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can access customer data stored in the BillQuick database, including sensitive employee information like permission data and encoded passwords.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, attackers can use the `xp_cmdshell` procedure to execute arbitrary code on the underlying Windows server.
- **Ransomware Deployment:** Attackers were able to gain initial access and deploy ransomware across the victim's network.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web Application:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web application's login form.
- **SQL Injection:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code via the username field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the BillQuick Web Suite server, specifically to the login page.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** Attackers require knowledge of SQL and SQL injection techniques.
- **Tooling:** Tools like sqlmap can automate the exploitation process.
