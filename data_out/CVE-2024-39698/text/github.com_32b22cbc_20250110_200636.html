# Code Signing Bypass on Windows in electron-updater < 6.3.0-alpha.6

High

[mmaietta](/mmaietta)
published
GHSA-9jxc-qjr9-vjxq
Jul 9, 2024

## Package

npm

electron-updater
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 6.3.0-alpha.5

## Patched versions

>= 6.3.0-alpha.6

## Description

### Observations

The file `packages/electron-updater/src/windowsExecutableCodeSignatureVerifier.ts` implements the signature validation routine for Electron applications on Windows. It executes the following command in a new shell (`process.env.ComSpec` on Windows, usually `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`):

[electron-builder/packages/electron-updater/src/windowsExecutableCodeSignatureVerifier.ts](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/blob/140e2f0eb0df79c2a46e35024e96d0563355fc89/packages/electron-updater/src/windowsExecutableCodeSignatureVerifier.ts#L35-L41)

Lines 35 to 41
in
[140e2f0](/electron-userland/electron-builder/commit/140e2f0eb0df79c2a46e35024e96d0563355fc89)

|  | execFile( |
| --- | --- |
|  | `set "PSModulePath="; chcp 65001 >NUL & powershell.exe`, |
|  | ["-NoProfile", "-NonInteractive", "-InputFormat", "None", "-Command", `"Get-AuthenticodeSignature -LiteralPath '${tempUpdateFile}' | ConvertTo-Json -Compress"`], |
|  | { |
|  | shell: true, |
|  | timeout: 20 \* 1000, |
|  | }, |

Because of the surrounding shell, a first pass by `cmd.exe` expands any environment variable found in command-line above.

### Exploitation

This creates a situation where `verifySignature()` can be tricked into validating the certificate of a different file than the one that was just downloaded. If the step is successful, the malicious update will be executed even if its signature is invalid.

### Impact

This attack assumes a compromised update manifest (server compromise, Man-in-the-Middle attack if fetched over HTTP, Cross-Site Scripting to point the application to a malicious updater server, etc.).

### Patch

This vulnerability was patched in [#8295](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/pull/8295), by comparing the path in the output of `Get-AuthenticodeSignature` with the intended one. The patch is available starting from 6.3.0-alpha.6.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
