### @mmaietta **[mmaietta](/mmaietta)** commented [Jul 4, 2024](#issue-2391494967)

To prevent env var expansion during the signature verification step when executed via cmd.exe -> powershell, we need to verify the LiteralPath of the scanned asset and compare the string against the original **intended** update filename

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I see that 6.3.1 is on npm but under the `next` tag rather than `latest`. Is it held back for more testing? When updating to 6.3.1 to resolve this security notice do we also need to update to a specific version of electron or electron builder? |

| It needs broader adoption before I can post to `latest`. For instance, electron-builder v25 has a blocking issue with AppImages that I'm currently working on resolving.  To leverage the fix in electron-updater 6.3.1, it does not require a specific version of electron or electron-builder. |
