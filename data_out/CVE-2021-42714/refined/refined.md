Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42714:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insecure permissions related to temporary file creation during the repair process of the Splashtop Remote Business Client for Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The Splashtop agent's installation uses the Windows Installer framework. The MSI file is cached in `c:\windows\installer`. During a repair operation, triggered by an unprivileged user, the Windows Installer service running under the SYSTEM context performs file operations in the user's `%TEMP%` folder, including executing temporary files.

-   **Lack of Proper Permission Control:** The vulnerability arises because the temporary files are created in a directory where an unprivileged user has write access, and these files are then executed with SYSTEM privileges during the repair operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows a local, unprivileged attacker to gain SYSTEM-level privileges on the affected Windows system.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the target machine.
-   **Repair Trigger:** The attacker triggers a repair operation using either the Windows Installer API or by running the command: `msiexec.exe /fa c:\windows\installer\[XXXXX].msi`. The `[XXXXX]` is the specific MSI file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a valid local user account on the Windows system where the vulnerable Splashtop Remote Business Client is installed.
-   **Ability to Trigger Repair:** The attacker must be able to trigger the repair process of the installed application using the Windows Installer framework.
-   **No Elevated Privileges Required Initially:** The attacker does not need any prior elevated privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 3.5.0.0 of the Splashtop Remote Business Client for Windows.
-   The vulnerability is considered easy to exploit, and a working exploit is trivial to produce.
-   The vulnerability was discovered by Ronnie Salomonsen of Mandiant.
-   Splashtop was informed of the issue on 15-Oct-2021, confirmed it on 19-Oct-2021, and released a patch on 25-Jan-2022.
