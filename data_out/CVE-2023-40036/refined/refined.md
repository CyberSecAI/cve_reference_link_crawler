{
  "CVE-2023-40036": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a diverged copy of the `uchardet` library. The vulnerability exists because a crafted file allows reading past the bounds of a globally allocated object buffer during file open operation. Specifically, the array index `order` in `CharDistributionAnalysis::HandleOneChar` depends on the input file content and can be set to a value greater than the size of the `mCharToFreqOrder` buffer, which leads to an out-of-bounds read.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Global buffer read overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "The exploitability of this issue is not clear. Potentially it may be used to leak internal memory allocation information.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Opening a crafted file in Notepad++"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted file that will be opened by the vulnerable application."
