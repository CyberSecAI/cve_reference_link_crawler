# Low-privileged user could run search as nobody in SplunkDeploymentServerConfig app

**Advisory ID:** SVD-2024-1002

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2024-45732](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45732)

**Published:** 2024-10-14

**Last Update:** 2024-10-14

**CVSSv3.1 Score:** 7.1, High

**CVSSv3.1 Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**CWE:** [CWE-862](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/862.html)

**Bug ID:** VULN-14891

## Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.3.1, and 9.2.0 versions below 9.2.3, and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.2.2403.103, 9.1.2312.200, 9.1.2312.110 and 9.1.2308.208, a low-privileged user that does not hold the “admin” or “power” Splunk roles could run a search as the “nobody” Splunk user in the SplunkDeploymentServerConfig app. This could let the low-privileged user access potentially restricted data.

## Solution

Upgrade Splunk Enterprise to versions 9.3.1, 9.2.3 or higher. Splunk Enterprise 9.1 versions and below are not affected.
Splunk is actively monitoring and patching Splunk Cloud Platform instances.

## Product Status

| Product | Version | Component | Affected Version | Fix Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.3 | SplunkDeploymentServerConfig | 9.3.0 | 9.3.1 |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.2 | SplunkDeploymentServerConfig | 9.2.0 to 9.2.2 | 9.2.3 |
| Splunk Cloud Platform | 9.2.2403 | SplunkDeploymentServerConfig | 9.2.2403.102 to 9.2.2403.102 | 9.2.2403.103 |
| Splunk Cloud Platform | 9.1.2312 | SplunkDeploymentServerConfig | 9.1.2312.100 to 9.1.2312.109 | 9.1.2312.110, 9.1.2312.200 |
| Splunk Cloud Platform | 9.1.2308 | SplunkDeploymentServerConfig | Below 9.1.2308.207 | 9.1.2308.208 |

## Mitigations and Workarounds

You can modify the local.meta file in the `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SplunkDeploymentServerConfig/metadata` directory to restrict write access to knowledge objects within Splunk apps.
Use the following metadata settings in each file to restrict access:
   `[]`
   `access = read : [ * ], write : [ admin ]`

To apply the same restrictions to other apps by default, you may add the same configuration to the local.meta file in the `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/<app name>/metadata` directory.

The vulnerability affects instances with [Splunk Web](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/DisableunnecessarySplunkcomponents) enabled, turning Splunk Web off is a possible workaround. See [Disable unnecessary Splunk Enterprise components](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/DisableunnecessarySplunkcomponents) and the [web.conf](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Webconf) configuration specification file for more information on disabling Splunk Web.

## Detections

* [Splunk Low-priv search as nobody SplunkDeploymentServerConfig app](https://research.splunk.com/application/f765c3fe-c3b6-4afe-a932-11dd4f3a024f/)

## Severity

Splunk rates this vulnerability as a 7.1, High, with a CVSSv3.1 vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N.

If the local.meta file in the app directory has the proper metadata settings, there should be no impact and the severity would be Informational.

If the Splunk Enterprise instance does not run Splunk Web, there should be no impact and the severity would be informational.
