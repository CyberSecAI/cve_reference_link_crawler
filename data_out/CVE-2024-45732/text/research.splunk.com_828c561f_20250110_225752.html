# Detection: Splunk Low-Priv Search as nobody SplunkDeploymentServerConfig App

Updated Date: 2024-10-17
ID: f765c3fe-c3b6-4afe-a932-11dd4f3a024f
Author: Rod Soto, Deivid Aguero
[Type: Hunting](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.3.1, and 9.2.0 versions below 9.2.3, and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.2.2403.103, 9.1.2312.200, 9.1.2312.110 and 9.1.2308.208, a low-privileged user that does not hold the âadminâ or âpowerâ Splunk roles could run a search as ânobodyâ in the SplunkDeploymentServerConfig app allowing access to potentially restricted data.

### Search

```
1
2| rest services/apps/local/SplunkDeploymentServerConfig
3
4| table label, splunk_server, eai:acl.perms.read, eai:acl.perms.write, eai:acl.can_change_perms
5
6| `splunk_low_priv_search_as_nobody_splunkdeploymentserverconfig_app_filter`

```
### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |

| splunk\_low\_priv\_search\_as\_nobody\_splunkdeploymentserverconfig\_app\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_low_priv_search_as_nobody_splunkdeploymentserverconfig_app_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

Requires access to REST Api.

### Known False Positives

This search displays effective permissions for SplunkDeploymentServerConfig. If permissions are inadequate they must be fixed. Please refer to the SVD-2024-1002 for more information about these permissions.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Please verify and adjust permissions on $splunk\_server$ for $label$ according to SVD-2024-1002 Advisory | 90 | 90 | 100 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
