Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-45732:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient access controls within the `SplunkDeploymentServerConfig` app in specific versions of Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud Platform. This allows a low-privileged user to execute searches with the permissions of the "nobody" user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** Low-privileged users, lacking "admin" or "power" roles, are able to run searches with the privileges of the "nobody" user within the `SplunkDeploymentServerConfig` app.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By running searches as the "nobody" user, a low-privileged user can bypass intended permission restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Access:** The primary impact is that a low-privileged user can gain unauthorized access to potentially restricted data that they wouldn't normally have access to.
*   **Potential Data Modification (Limited):**  The CVSS vector indicates low integrity impact, suggesting that while access is the primary concern, there is also a possibility of limited modification to some data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **User-initiated:** An attacker would need to be a low-privileged user with access to the Splunk instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privilege Access:** The attacker must have a low-privileged user account within the vulnerable Splunk instance.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Splunk instance.

**Summary of Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.3.1, 9.2.0 versions below 9.2.3, and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below specific versions (9.2.2403.103, 9.1.2312.200, 9.1.2312.110 and 9.1.2308.208).
*   The issue occurs specifically within the `SplunkDeploymentServerConfig` app.
*   The attacker can run searches using the 'nobody' user context.
*   The provided Splunk search query is used to identify instances where this vulnerability may be present.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).

**Mitigation and Workarounds:**

*   **Upgrade:** The primary solution is to upgrade to the fixed versions (Splunk Enterprise 9.3.1, 9.2.3, or higher, or the corresponding patched Splunk Cloud Platform versions).
*   **Restrict App Access:** Modify the `local.meta` files in the affected app's metadata directory to restrict write access using the provided settings (`access = read : [ * ], write : [ admin ]`).
*   **Disable Splunk Web:** As a workaround, disabling Splunk Web can prevent exploitation of this vulnerability

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided Splunk detection helps identify if the vulnerability is present in an environment.
*   The risk score of 90 highlights the severity of the vulnerability.
