- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could inject malicious code into specific pages of the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs valid credentials to access the web-based management interface of an affected device.
