{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insecure file system permissions that allows unauthorized users to access and modify system files, coupled with a lack of proper input validation which results in arbitrary code execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure permissions on system files",
      "Lack of input sanitization",
      "Command Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected device.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Uploading a file with a malicious name or path via the web interface",
       "Exploiting a command injection vulnerability via web interface"
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable multi-function peripheral (MFP) and the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the device. The attacker can also use a cross-site scripting(XSS) attack to steal cookies.",
	"additional_details": "The vulnerability is exploitable by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to /aplpx/server/10000000-0000-0000-0000-500000000000/remotecommand/settingapp/command/execute with a specifically crafted ‘filename’ parameter that is used in a command injection sink. The provided content then causes the device to execute the attacker provided code as root user, allowing for complete control of the device."
