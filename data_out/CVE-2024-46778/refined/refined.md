- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The code incorrectly checked the address of a boolean pointer `UnboundedRequestEnabled` instead of its dereferenced boolean value.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect pointer usage. The code was checking the pointer's address for truthiness instead of the boolean value it pointed to, leading to incorrect conditional logic.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The incorrect logic would lead to the conditional block not being executed as intended, which could potentially lead to incorrect calculation of `compbuf_reserved_space_64b`. This could lead to incorrect memory allocation or usage during display mode calculation on AMD GPUs.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when `CalculateSwathAndDETConfiguration` function is called, which is part of normal display mode setting procedures. There is no direct attacker control over the input, but if `UnboundedRequestEnabled` is intended to be used for enabling specific memory allocation procedures, the incorrect logic bypasses that mechanism if the pointer is not NULL regardless of the boolean value it points to.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to influence the display mode settings and the structure used by the `CalculateSwathAndDETConfiguration` function. This is not directly user controllable, it would be part of a malicious driver or through other system control means.
