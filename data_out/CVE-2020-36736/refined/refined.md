Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins and themes, which includes information relevant to CVE-2020-36736.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the CSRF vulnerabilities is the failure to properly validate nonces in various WordPress plugins and themes. This typically occurs when developers use conditional checks (e.g., `if (isset($_POST['nonce']) && ...)` ) before verifying the nonce, which can be bypassed if the nonce parameter is not set in the request. The correct way is to verify the nonce using `if( !isset($_POST['nonce']) || !wp_verify_nonce(...) )` which forces a check if it is present or returns false if not.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Missing Nonce Checks:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper nonce verification. Many plugins and themes check for the existence of a nonce before verifying it, but if the nonce is absent, the check is skipped, allowing unauthenticated actions.
-   **Incorrect Conditional Logic:**  Developers often use flawed logic with `isset()`, `empty()`, and boolean operators (`&&`, `||`), resulting in the nonce verification being bypassed under specific conditions, mainly when the nonce is not present in the request.
-   **Inconsistent Implementation:** There is no consistent pattern in vulnerability, as different plugins use different variables and different check logics, making it difficult for WAFs to universally protect against such bypasses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact of these CSRF vulnerabilities varies depending on the specific plugin or theme and the vulnerable action:

-   **Settings Manipulation:** Attackers could modify plugin settings, potentially causing denial of service or other malicious effects.
-   **Data Modification/Leakage:** Some plugins allow data manipulation, which could lead to data corruption or information disclosure.
-   **Content Manipulation:**  Attackers could change content by exploiting vulnerable save functions, and could also trigger specific functions, such as imports or exports.
-   **Privilege Escalation** By exploiting the vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially gain higher privileges if they can perform operations that would otherwise be restricted to users of certain roles.
-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** In some cases, exploiting CSRF vulnerabilities can be used as a vector for XSS attacks by saving malicious data to the database.
-   **Arbitrary Actions:** Attackers can cause authenticated users to perform unwanted actions such as deleting posts, changing settings, or activating plugins, without their consent or knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Social Engineering:** Attackers would typically use social engineering tactics to trick an authenticated user (often an administrator) into visiting a malicious website or clicking on a specially crafted link. This link would perform a forged request on the vulnerable WordPress site.
-   **Malicious Websites:** The attacker could embed malicious HTML forms or JavaScript on a website controlled by the attacker, which would then send forged requests to the vulnerable WordPress site when an authenticated user visits the site.
-   **Email Phishing:** The attacker could send emails with malicious links that would initiate forged requests on the vulnerable WordPress site when clicked by the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **No Direct Access:** The attacker does not need direct access to the vulnerable WordPress site.
-   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into performing an action (e.g., clicking a link or visiting a malicious page) to trigger the forged request.
-   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must know that the WordPress plugin or theme is vulnerable to CSRF and understand how to craft a malicious request to exploit the lack of nonce verification.
-   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate on the WordPress site itself but the victim does. The attack relies on the user's existing authenticated session with the targeted WordPress site.

**Specific instances from the provided content:**

*   **CartFlows Plugin (CVE-2020-36736)**: The CartFlows plugin versions 1.5.15 and below had CSRF vulnerabilities due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the `export_json`, `import_json`, and `status_logs_file` functions. This allowed unauthenticated attackers to import/export settings and trigger logs if they could trick a site administrator into performing an action. The fix was to ensure the nonce is present and valid by adding an `empty` check.
*   **Other Plugins and Themes**:  The content details CSRF vulnerabilities in numerous other WordPress plugins and themes, all stemming from similar issues with conditional nonce checks. Some of the other plugins mentioned in various parts of the document are: Post SMTP Mailer/Email Log, Forminator, Dokan, Defender Security, Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce, Style Kits, WP ERP, eCommerce Product Catalog, WP Project Manager, WP Private Content Plus, Better Search, Custom Banners, ElasticPress, WP Travel, Process Steps Template Designer, Qtranslate Slug, WC Marketplace, Custom css-js-php, Multiple Roles, Edwiser Bridge, WP Prayer, Slider Hero, Amministrazione Trasparente, Vuukle, WP EasyPay, Abandoned Cart Recovery for WooCommerce, Locations, Rucy, WP-Backgrounds Lite, WP Security Question, Event Espresso 4 Decaf, WordPress Photo Gallery, Opal Estate, Sync to Etsy Marketplace from WooCommerce, RAYS Grid, Sell Media, Ocean Extra, EWWW Image Optimizer, Customizr, Hueman, Absolute Reviews, Advanced Popups, Remove Schema, Sunshine Photo Cart, Ultimate Gift Cards For WooCommerce, wp-mpdf, Staff Directory Plugin, DW Question & Answer, Contact Form 7 Style, Paid Memberships Pro, Cool Timeline, Custom Field Template, Product Catalog X, NotificationX, Coupon Creator, Radio Buttons for Taxonomies, Menu Swapper, Coming Soon & Maintenance Mode Page, Woody ad snippets, Feed Them Social, Import / Export Customizer Settings, Easy Testimonials, RSS Aggregator by Feedzy, Top 10 â€“ Popular posts plugin for WordPress, Lightweight Sidebar Manager, WP Hotel Booking, Best WooCommerce Multivendor Marketplace Solution, and 10WebAnalytics.

In summary, the identified CSRF vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins and themes stem from the improper implementation of nonce checks, which allows attackers to trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions. The impact and severity vary across different plugins and themes and may range from minor settings changes to complete compromise. The content provided highlights the common coding errors that lead to such vulnerabilities and their widespread nature.
