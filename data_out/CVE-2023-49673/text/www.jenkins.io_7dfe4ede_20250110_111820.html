## Descriptions

### Exposure of system-scoped credentials in Jira Plugin

**SECURITY-3225
/
CVE-2023-49653**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`jira`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/jira)**

**Description:**

Jira Plugin 3.11 and earlier does not set the appropriate context for credentials lookup, allowing the use of system-scoped credentials otherwise reserved for the global configuration.

This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to access and capture credentials they are not entitled to.

Jira Plugin 3.12 defines the appropriate context for credentials lookup.

### Incorrect permission checks in Google Compute Engine Plugin

**SECURITY-2835
/
CVE-2023-49652**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`google-compute-engine`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/google-compute-engine)**

**Description:**

Google Compute Engine Plugin 4.550.vb\_327fca\_3db\_11 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in multiple HTTP endpoints.
This allows attackers with global Item/Configure permission (while lacking Item/Configure permission on any particular job) to do the following:

* Enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
  Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.
* Connect to Google Cloud Platform using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, to obtain information about existing projects.

Google Compute Engine Plugin 4.551.v5a\_4dc98f6962 requires Overall/Administer permission for the affected HTTP endpoints.

### CSRF vulnerabilities and missing permission checks in MATLAB Plugin allow XXE

**SECURITY-3193
/
CVE-2023-49654 (permission checks), CVE-2023-49655 (CSRF), CVE-2023-49656 (XXE)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`matlab`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/matlab)**

**Description:**

MATLAB Plugin determines whether a user-specified directory on the Jenkins controller is the location of a MATLAB installation by parsing an XML file in that directory.

MATLAB Plugin 2.11.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints implementing related form validation.

Additionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

Additionally, the plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
This allows attackers able to create files on the Jenkins controller file system to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML document that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

MATLAB Plugin 2.11.1 configures its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

Additionally, POST requests and Item/Configure permission are required for the affected HTTP endpoints.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin

**SECURITY-3256
/
CVE-2023-49673 (CSRF), CVE-2023-49674 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`neuvector-vulnerability-scanner`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/neuvector-vulnerability-scanner)**

**Description:**

NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin 1.22 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a connection test HTTP endpoint.
This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified hostname and port using attacker-specified username and password.
Additionally, this HTTP endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin 2.2 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected HTTP endpoint.

## Severity

* SECURITY-2835:
