The provided content relates to a fix for memory leaks in the Qualcomm QSEECOM driver, specifically within the UEFI secure application functionality. This fix is relevant to CVE-2023-52684, which, according to the provided description, is a placeholder for CVE description retrieval and will be linked to the correct CVE number once available.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability and the fix:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in error handling within the `qsee_uefi_get_variable`, `qsee_uefi_set_variable`, and `qsee_uefi_get_next_variable` functions of the `qcom_qseecom_uefisecapp.c` driver. Previously, if the `ucs2_strscpy` function failed (returning a negative value), the code would return an EFI error code directly, without first freeing the memory allocated for the SCM call's request data. This resulted in memory leaks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for memory leaks due to improper error handling.  Specifically, memory allocated for `req_data` was not being freed in some error scenarios, leading to a resource leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Resource Exhaustion:** Repeatedly triggering the error condition (e.g., by providing an invalid name) could lead to memory exhaustion, which could destabilize the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered during interaction with UEFI variables. Specifically, when:
    - getting a variable (`qsee_uefi_get_variable`)
    - setting a variable (`qsee_uefi_set_variable`)
    - getting the next variable (`qsee_uefi_get_next_variable`)
- Providing an invalid name during these operations will cause `ucs2_strscpy` to return a negative error and trigger the leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would need the ability to interact with the UEFI interface which is typically through privileged access.  This could be achieved through an application running with elevated permissions or by modifying the UEFI variables through privileged system tools.

**Fix:**
The fix modifies the error handling logic in the affected functions to jump to a `out_free` label, which is responsible for freeing the allocated memory. This is done by:
- Introducing a local variable `efi_status`.
- Changing the return statement to a `goto out_free;` statement.
- Setting the return value to `efi_status` at the `out_free:` label.
This ensures that memory allocated for SCM calls is freed correctly even when an error occurs during the string copy operation.

The commit also modifies `qsee_uefi_get_next_variable` function's error handling when  `qcom_qseecom_app_send` fails by jumping to the `out_free` label instead of returning directly.

In summary, the vulnerability is a memory leak caused by insufficient cleanup of allocated memory. The fix ensures that memory is properly freed in error cases, preventing memory leaks.
