- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of an upper limit on the `p2c` (PBES2 Count) parameter within the JWE (JSON Web Encryption) key management algorithms based on PBKDF2. This parameter controls the number of iterations used in the PBKDF2 key derivation function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the missing constraint on the `p2c` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrarily large number of iterations for the PBKDF2 function. This can lead to excessive computational load when processing a JWE.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By setting a very high value for the `p2c` parameter, an attacker can cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition due to the excessive CPU usage required for the key derivation process.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specifically crafted JWE token where the attacker sets a very large value for the `p2c` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to construct or modify a JWE token to include the malicious `p2c` parameter. This implies the attacker has some control or influence over the generation of JWTs processed by the vulnerable application.
