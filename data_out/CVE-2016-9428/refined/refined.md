Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9428:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `addMultirowsForm()` function in `anchor.c`. This function is responsible for handling multi-row form elements within HTML content.
*   The core issue is a heap out-of-bounds write due to incorrect calculation or handling of buffer sizes, specifically in `a->end.pos` which is used as an index to write to `l->lineBuf` and `l->propBuf`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow/Out-of-Bounds Write:** The `addMultirowsForm` function calculates an incorrect end position (`a->end.pos`) leading to a write outside of the allocated buffer (`l->lineBuf` and `l->propBuf`). Specifically `a->end.pos` can be greater than `l->size`
*   **Incorrect Size Calculation:** There is a flaw in calculating the correct size of the buffer, or the position, when processing multi-row forms.
*   **Lack of Bounds Checking:**  The code lacks sufficient checks to ensure that the calculated end position remains within the bounds of the allocated buffers before performing the write operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The out-of-bounds write corrupts heap memory. This leads to a segmentation fault due to overwriting critical data structures, such as `Lineprop`. As observed `pr` which is expected to have a valid address like 0x9c7f60, got corrupted and its highest byte was overwritten to 0x5b='['.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The segmentation fault can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:**  While not explicitly stated in the provided details, heap corruption vulnerabilities can potentially be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution if the attacker carefully crafts the input to overwrite specific data structures and gain control of the program's execution flow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HTML:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted HTML document, specifically one containing multi-row form elements, which triggers the vulnerability when parsed by `w3m`.
*   **Remote Exploitation:**  A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into opening a malicious HTML file through `w3m`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to serve malicious HTML:** The attacker needs to be able to serve or deliver a crafted HTML file to a user of `w3m`. This could be done through a malicious website, a phishing email, or other methods of delivering the file to the target.
*   **Understanding of `w3m` HTML Parsing:**  The attacker needs a general understanding of how `w3m` parses HTML, particularly how it handles form elements, to craft an exploit.
*   **No Special Privileges:**  The attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the target system, as the exploit would execute within the context of the `w3m` process.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided `github.com` content contains a fix for the issue, using an `assert()` statement to detect and confirm the out-of-bounds write. The fix involved ensuring `a->end.pos < l->size` before proceeding with the write operation.
*   The `openwall.com` content confirms this is a heap write vulnerability and assigns the CVE ID to the reported issue.
*  The `security.gentoo.org` confirms the vulnerability can be exploited remotely and was fixed in version 0.5.3-r9
