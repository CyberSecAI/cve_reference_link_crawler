In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

efi: fix NULL-deref in init error path

In cases where runtime services are not supported or have been disabled,
the runtime services workqueue will never have been allocated.

Do not try to destroy the workqueue unconditionally in the unlikely
event that EFI initialisation fails to avoid dereferencing a NULL
pointer.
