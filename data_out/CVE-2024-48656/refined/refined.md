Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input in the `school_year` GET parameter within the `rms.php` file. Specifically, the application does not prevent the inclusion of JavaScript code within this parameter, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS. Input from the `school_year` parameter in the URL is directly outputted into the HTML without any sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `school_year` parameter. This code will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the crafted URL.
- **Session hijacking:** The provided example payload `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` demonstrates that an attacker could steal a user's cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking and account compromise.
- **Defacement/malware:** Other malicious activities such as defacing the webpage or redirecting users to attacker-controlled sites can be performed with a similar payload.
- **Data theft:** Sensitive data could be accessed and exfiltrated by the injected script

**Attack vectors:**
- **GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `school_year` GET parameter in the URL with malicious JavaScript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload within the `school_year` parameter.
- The attacker has to trick a user into clicking on this malicious link. This could happen by sending an email, sharing on a social media or embedding the link on a webpage the victim is likely to visit.
