- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation within the `pull_file_v2_proc` function in the `libv2_sdk.so` library, specifically a missing input size check.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of the input size when processing file pull requests in the `v2_sdk_service`. This allows an attacker to send a crafted payload with an invalid size, triggering a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by crashing the `v2_sdk_service` running on the affected DJI drone devices, impacting the service's availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed over the network, and an adjacent attacker is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within the adjacent network to the drone and have the ability to send crafted payloads to the `v2_sdk_service` on port 10000. The CVSS score indicates that the attacker needs low privileges and user interaction is required, which seems to be in contrast with the adjacent attacker position, which is more consistent with no required user interaction.
