  "CVE-2016-3550": {
    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an implementation of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in breakouts of the Java sandbox or denial of service.  Specifically, a vulnerability was discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to information disclosure. An attacker could exploit this to expose sensitive data over the network. The vulnerability exists in the Hotspot component of Java SE and Java SE Embedded.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Oracle Java SE",
      "Oracle Java SE Embedded",
      "Oracle JRockit",
       "OpenJDK 7",
       "OpenJDK 8",
       "IcedTea"
    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Integer overflow in bytecode streams",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient protection of method handles",
        "Inadequate XML processing",
         "Improperly handled byte streams",
         "Inadequate input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Exposure of sensitive data over the network, Denial of Service (DoS)",
      "attack_vectors": [
         "Network-based exploitation of Java applets or Java Web Start applications",
          "Local exploitation by supplying crafted input to vulnerable APIs"
       ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Unauthenticated remote attacker who can execute code within a Java sandbox. Some vulnerabilities require user interaction (running a malicious Java applet or Java Web Start application).",
       "notes": "The severity of this vulnerability is dependent on the level of privileges of the user running the Java applet or Java Web Start application.  If a user runs the applet or application with administrator privileges then the impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability would be high.  If a user runs with non-administrator privileges, then the impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability would be low."
