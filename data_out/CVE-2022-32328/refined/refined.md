The provided content details a vulnerability in the "Fast Food Ordering System v1.0" by oretnom23. This vulnerability allows an attacker to delete arbitrary files on the server.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `delete_img` function within the `/ffos/classes/Master.php` file. The application uses a `path` parameter received via a POST request without proper validation or sanitization, which allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path. The application proceeds to delete this file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to delete any file on the server that the webserver's user has permissions to access, due to lack of validation of the user-provided file path.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize or validate the file path provided in the 'path' parameter.
- **Direct Object Reference:** The application uses the provided path directly to delete the files without checks, making it a direct object reference vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Loss:** Attackers can delete critical files, leading to data loss and potentially rendering the application unusable.
- **Denial of Service:** Deleting essential files can disrupt the functionality of the application, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **System Compromise:**  If an attacker can delete configuration files or other critical files, they can potentially compromise the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a POST request to `/ffos/classes/Master.php?f=delete_img`.
- **Path Parameter:** The attacker includes a 'path' parameter in the POST request body, specifying the full path to the file they want to delete.
- **URL Encoding:** The file path needs to be URL-encoded in the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Authentication (Potentially):** While not explicitly stated, the example request includes a `PHPSESSID` cookie, suggesting that authentication might be necessary to reach the vulnerable endpoint or at least to have the required permissions. The provided content gives the default admin credentials, 'admin/admin123', which if not changed, can grant full access.
- **Knowledge of target file paths:** The attacker must know or guess the path of the file they intend to delete.
