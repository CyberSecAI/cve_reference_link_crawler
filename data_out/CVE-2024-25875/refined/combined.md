# Content Grid Easy way to create complex layouts.

Creating nice looking content is not easy in a lot of Content Management Systems. But with our content grid concept, you can even create content, that looks like fancy magazines.

![](/build/theme/images/tour-img-1.png)

# SymfonyThe engine inside

We are using the full stack Symfony framework, Symfony is very wide used framework and loved by many developers. It has a big and active community and with Symfony inside we can provide a lot of nice features.

# Sylius Lets extend the code

With Sylius you are able to extend all models like article and page to your needs. You only update your model and form definitions, but enhavo will display it in a nice way.

![](/build/theme/images/tour-img-3.png)

# Wordpress like Usability that make sense

Wordpress is known for it’s good usability. We think that as well, that's why the layout is very similar. We also try to improve the usablity by showing the user only the elements he needs.

![](/build/theme/images/tour-img-4.png)

# Open Source Share what we have done

A good Content Management System needs to be Open Source. So everyone can use and extend it to his benifit. Enhavo is using the MIT License.
