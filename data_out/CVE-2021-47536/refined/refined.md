The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47536.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `smc_lgr_cleanup_early()` function was incorrectly deleting the list head instead of the actual link group from the link group list.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect list manipulation: The function used `list_del_init(lgr_list)` which was intended to remove the link group entry, but `lgr_list` was pointing to the list head, causing corruption of the list structure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: Since the actual link group was not removed from the list, and the function proceeded to `memset` the link group structure. This memory corruption could lead to a kernel panic or other undefined behavior.
- List corruption: The incorrect `list_del_init` call caused a list corruption, as evidenced by the provided kernel log.
- Kernel panic: The vulnerability can lead to a kernel panic, disrupting the system's operation.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered when `smc_lgr_cleanup_early()` is called as part of the cleanup process, likely during disconnection or link down scenarios in the SMC (Shared Memory Communications) subsystem.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the ability to trigger an SMC link down event. The attacker likely needs to be able to establish and then tear down an SMC connection.
