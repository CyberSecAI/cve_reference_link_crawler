- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from passing untrusted input to `flask.send_file` or using `os.path.join` with untrusted input, which can lead to path traversal attacks. Specifically, `os.path.join` ignores prior path components when it encounters an absolute path, allowing an attacker to provide a full path that bypasses intended directory restrictions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22, CWE-36). Unsafe usage of `flask.send_file` or `os.path.join` with attacker controlled input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can potentially access arbitrary files and directories on the server's file system, which may include application source code, configuration files, and sensitive system files. This can lead to information disclosure of sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the `filename` or `path` parameters in HTTP requests using path traversal sequences like `../` or absolute file paths.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints. No specific user interaction is needed.
