Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The CheckUser extension in MediaWiki was not properly checking if a username associated with an edit was suppressed when displaying results in Special:CheckUser and Special:Investigate pages, as well as through the CheckUser API. Even if an edit's summary was suppressed, the username of the user making the edit was still visible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Information Leakage: Suppressed usernames were being exposed in CheckUser results, violating user privacy and the purpose of suppression.
- Inconsistent Suppression: While edit summaries were correctly suppressed, the associated usernames were not, creating an inconsistency in the application of suppression.
- Multiple Affected Areas: The issue was found in Special:CheckUser, Special:Investigate, and the CheckUser API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privacy Violation: Users whose edits were suppressed to hide their identity could have their usernames exposed to individuals with CheckUser access.
- Circumvention of Suppression: The suppression feature intended to hide user identities was rendered ineffective in CheckUser results.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Viewing Special:CheckUser page: A user with CheckUser rights could view suppressed usernames while performing a check using the Special:CheckUser interface.
- Viewing Special:Investigate page: A user with CheckUser rights could view suppressed usernames while using the Special:Investigate interface.
- Accessing CheckUser API: A user with CheckUser rights could view suppressed usernames via the CheckUser API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- CheckUser Rights: An attacker needed to have CheckUser rights on the affected MediaWiki instance to exploit this vulnerability.
- Access to the affected pages/API: The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable Special:CheckUser or Special:Investigate pages or be able to make API calls to the CheckUser API.

**Additional Notes:**
- Logged Actions: The fix for edits was implemented, but logged actions (e.g., user rights changes) were not fully fixed due to a limitation in the data schema, which required a separate schema change.
- Patches: Multiple patches were created and deployed to address the vulnerability across different branches and versions of the MediaWiki software.
- Testing: Testing was performed by a user with CheckUser rights who did not have Oversight rights (OS) to confirm that suppressed usernames were not visible for non-OS users.
- Public Disclosure: The task was initially kept private until patches for the API and Special:Investigate were ready, and then again until a schema change for logged actions could be implemented. Eventually the task was made public.
- CVE Description Update: There was an error in the initial CVE description which referred to "checkuser access" instead of "suppress" which was reported and a request sent to Mitre for correction.
