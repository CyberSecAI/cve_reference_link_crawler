Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the WUZHICMS 4.1.0 Affiche (advertisement) module. The root cause is that the `content` parameter within the affiche editing functionality is not properly sanitized before being stored in the database and subsequently displayed to users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The application stores unsanitized user-provided input in the database and reflects it back to users.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `$formdata['content']` is not passed through the `remove_xss` function like other parameters such as 'title' and 'note'.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `content` field when creating or editing an Affiche.
- When other users view the affected affiche on the front end, the malicious JavaScript will execute in their browsers.
- This could lead to various attacks such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Stealing user information
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/index.php?m=affiche&f=index&v=edit` endpoint.
- The `form[content]` parameter includes the malicious JavaScript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the WUZHICMS admin panel.
- The attacker needs to have the necessary permissions to edit affiche/advertisements.
- Basic understanding of HTTP requests and HTML/JavaScript.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `coreframe\app\affiche\admin\index.php` within the `edit` function.
- The code retrieves the form data, but does not sanitize the `content` parameter using `remove_xss` before updating the database.
- The injected script is stored in the database and later displayed on the front-end, allowing the XSS attack to execute.
- The provided payload demonstrates this, injecting `<a href="javascript:alert(777)">XSS</a>` into the content field, which results in an alert box being triggered on the frontend.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided content includes the HTTP request to exploit the vulnerability, showing how the `content` parameter can be manipulated.
- The provided content also shows where the unsanitized data is stored and subsequently displayed to end users.
