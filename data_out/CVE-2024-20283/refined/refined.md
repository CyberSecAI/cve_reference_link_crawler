- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access controls on a specific API endpoint within Cisco Nexus Dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing proper access control mechanisms for the mentioned API endpoint, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access metrics and information about devices in the Nexus Dashboard cluster, potentially revealing cluster deployment details. This constitutes an information disclosure vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending queries to the vulnerable API endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated (i.e. have a valid user account) and have network access to the vulnerable Nexus Dashboard instance.
