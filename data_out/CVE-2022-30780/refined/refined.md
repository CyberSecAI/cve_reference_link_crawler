Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-30780:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how lighttpd handles HTTP requests with excessively long URLs. Specifically, the server does not properly manage memory when parsing long URLs, leading to a denial-of-service condition. A typo in the code, specifically in the `connection_read_header_more` function, was identified as the root cause and is fixed in version 1.4.59.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The lighttpd server fails to adequately validate the length of the URL in an incoming HTTP request.
- **Memory Management Issue:** The server doesn't handle the allocation of memory efficiently when processing oversized URLs, leading to a resource exhaustion.
- **Typo in Code:** A typo in `src/connections.c` caused incorrect memory allocation when handling large headers, which resulted in connections getting stuck in a `CLOSE_WAIT` state.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the lighttpd server to become unresponsive, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service. The server process consumes 100% CPU and becomes stuck in a loop.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The server's resources, mainly CPU and memory, are exhausted by processing oversized URLs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request over the network to the vulnerable lighttpd server.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attack can be performed by an unauthenticated attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send arbitrary HTTP requests to the vulnerable lighttpd server.
- The attacker can be remote.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was discovered while investigating connections stuck in the `CLOSE_WAIT` state that were causing high CPU usage in lighttpd.
- The problematic code is in the function `connection_read_header_more`.
- The vulnerability is triggered when oversized header requests are read across multiple calls to `read()`.
- A fix was made to the `connection_read_header_more` function, specifically the logic related to calculating the size of the memory block to be allocated.
- The fix is included in lighttpd version 1.4.59.
- The vulnerability is present in lighttpd versions 1.4.56, 1.4.57 and 1.4.58.
- The vulnerability can be triggered using HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, and HTTP/2 requests.
