- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `X-October-Request-Handler` header does not sanitize the AJAX handler name, allowing unescaped HTML to be reflected back in the response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to lack of sanitization of the `X-October-Request-Handler` header.
- **Impact of exploitation:** While the reflected XSS exists, it is considered low impact because it cannot be exploited through normal browser interactions. The unescaped value is only detectable when using a proxy interception tool.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the `X-October-Request-Handler` header with malicious HTML content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to modify the `X-October-Request-Handler` header, typically done via a proxy interception tool.

The content provides more details than the official CVE description, specifically mentioning the vector of attack and low impact due to the requirement of a proxy to detect.
