- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks in certain areas.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability, specifically the ability to delete poll answers without proper authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can force a logged-in user to delete poll answers without their knowledge or consent.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker leverages a CSRF attack by crafting a malicious link or form that, when triggered by a logged-in user, sends a request to delete poll answers. The specific URL used for the attack is `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=poll_settings&task=remove_answer&id=<<POLL_ID>>&answer_id=<<ANSWER_ID>>`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user into clicking the malicious link. The attacker does not need prior access to the WordPress backend.
