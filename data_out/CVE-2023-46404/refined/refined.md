{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient sandboxing of Python code execution within the PCRS web application. Specifically, the use of generator objects allows for escaping the sandboxed environment.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Python sandboxing",
      "Lack of proper input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution (RCE) on the server hosting the PCRS application.",
    "attack_vectors": "By submitting malicious code through the 'Questions' page or 'Code editor' page.",
      "required_capabilities": "Any authenticated user with minimal privileges is capable of exploiting this vulnerability."
  },
    "additional_details": {
    "vulnerable_versions": "PCRS version 3.11 d0de1e and prior with Python execution enabled are vulnerable.",
     "mitigation": "The vulnerability was partially mitigated in commits [fbaedd3](https://bitbucket.org/utmandrew/pcrs/commits/fbaedd361e1d206777af2d89a7064bed9c772957) and fully patched in commit [9326ad3](https://bitbucket.org/utmandrew/pcrs/commits/9326ad3b904976c520150a82cd6ad0c6dad44b06) . The recommended fix is to implement a secure sandboxing environment rather than attempting to sandbox the language itself.",
    "attack_details": "The exploit leverages generator objects and their associated frames (gi_frame) to navigate out of the sandboxed environment via f_back and execute arbitrary code. Additionally, unicode normalization was used to bypass basic sanitization checks.",
    "poc_example": "The provided PoC code demonstrates how to override the __eq__ method to import modules and then execute arbitrary commands using unicode normalization to bypass sanitization. The code provided as an example executes system commands and reads and deletes files."
