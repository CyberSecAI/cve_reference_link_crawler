Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10426

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the `refno` parameter in the `animalsadd.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries. The application directly uses user-provided input in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses:**
*   Lack of input validation and sanitization: The application does not validate or sanitize the `refno` parameter before using it in SQL queries.
*   Direct use of user input in SQL queries: The application directly uses the user-supplied `refno` parameter in SQL queries, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Unauthorized database access: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   Sensitive data leakage: Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database.
*   Data tampering: Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
*   Comprehensive system control: Attackers might gain control over the system by manipulating the database.
*   Service interruption: Attackers could potentially disrupt the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the `refno` parameter in the `animalsadd.php` file.
*   Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through this parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable `animalsadd.php` file, likely through a web interface or API.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the 'Pet Shop Management System In PHP With Source Code' version 1.0.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited using both error-based and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
*   The provided content includes example payloads for exploiting the vulnerability using sqlmap.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by XU RONGDA.
*   The suggested repairs include using prepared statements, input validation, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.
