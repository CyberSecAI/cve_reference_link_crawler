Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `live_check.shtml` page of the WAVLINK AERIAL X 1200M router firmware. This page allows unauthenticated access to sensitive router information.
*   The page utilizes an `exec cmd` function, potentially allowing command execution, although the document focuses on information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The primary weakness is the lack of authentication required to access the `/live_check.shtml` page. This allows any user, even those not logged into the router's admin interface, to view its contents.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The `live_check.shtml` page exposes sensitive information about the router, including:
    *   Firmware version
    *   MAC address
    *   Running processes
*   **Potential Command Execution:** While not directly exploited in the PoC, the mention of an `exec cmd` function suggests the presence of a potential Remote Code Execution vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain insights into the router's configuration, software version, and active processes. This information can be used to plan further attacks.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Knowledge of the firmware version and processes running on the router could help an attacker identify further vulnerabilities.  If the `exec cmd` function is exploitable, it could lead to arbitrary command execution, potentially allowing full control over the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is accessible to anyone on the same network as the router and to attackers with network access to the router.
*   **Direct URL Access:** The attack vector is as simple as directly accessing the `http://<router_ip>/live_check.shtml` URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable router or have some way to access the device's IP address (such as a VPN or port forwarding).
*   **No Authentication Needed:** The attacker does not need administrative credentials to exploit the information disclosure vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content focuses on information disclosure using the `live_check.shtml` page and doesn't demonstrate exploitation of the potentially present command execution vulnerability.
*   The provided images indicate that the output of the `live_check.shtml` file contains various router information, such as the output of shell commands, implying that the `exec cmd` functionality is directly tied to the content served via this page.
