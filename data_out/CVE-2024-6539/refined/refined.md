Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization or encoding when processing user-supplied data within the `/guestbook` and `/admin/guestbook` functionalities of the SpringBootCMS application. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the improper handling of user input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize or encode user-supplied input before displaying it on the `/guestbook` and `/admin/guestbook` pages. This makes it susceptible to stored XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the guestbook input field. When an admin user visits the `/admin/guestbook` page, the injected script will execute within their browser session.
*   **Session Hijacking/Account Takeover:** Through injected JavaScript, an attacker might steal cookies or session tokens, potentially leading to session hijacking or full admin account takeover.
*   **Malicious Actions:** The injected JavaScript code could also perform other malicious actions such as redirecting the user to a phishing website, modifying displayed content, or performing other unwanted actions on behalf of the victim admin user.
*   **Data Theft:** Sensitive information that is accessible to the admin user could be stolen and exfiltrated using JavaScript code injected via the XSS vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Guestbook Input Field:** The primary attack vector is via input submitted to the guestbook feature of the application. The provided PoC `<script>alert(/xss/)</script>` demonstrates the injection of an XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Post to Guestbook:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the guestbook feature, posting a comment.
*   **No Privilege Requirements:** The attacker does not require special privileges to inject the XSS payload initially. The vulnerability triggers when an admin views the `/admin/guestbook` page.
*   **Admin Victim:** The exploitation of this vulnerability is dependent on an administrator viewing the malicious comment on the `/admin/guestbook` page.
