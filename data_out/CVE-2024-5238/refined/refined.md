Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `grade` parameter in the `/view/timetable_insert_form.php` file of the "Complete Web-Based School Management System" is vulnerable to SQL injection. This indicates that user-supplied data is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user input provided through the `grade` parameter.
*   **Direct SQL Query Construction:** The application constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating user-supplied input, leading to the injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Leakage:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including user data or system-related data.
*   **Compromised System Security:** The SQL injection vulnerability could lead to a complete compromise of the system and could be used for malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is located in the `grade` parameter of a PHP file, which is likely accessible via an HTTP GET request.
*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker crafts a malicious SQL injection payload and sends it within the `grade` parameter to the vulnerable endpoint `/view/timetable_insert_form.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the application in order to send the malicious request.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** A basic knowledge of SQL injection syntax is necessary to craft the appropriate payload.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided payload `grade=(select(0)from(select(sleep(12)))v)` can be used to demonstrate the vulnerability by injecting a time-based blind SQL injection.
* The affected version is stated as "â‰¤1.0".
* The vulnerability was submitted by user `SSL_Seven_Security Lab_WangZhiQiang_XiaoZiLong`
