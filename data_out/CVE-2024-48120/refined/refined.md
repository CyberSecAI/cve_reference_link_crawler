- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating a new list in the Opportunities section. Specifically, the "Name" field allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected page. This could lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application and navigate to the "Opportunities" section, then "Create List" and insert a malicious payload into the "Name" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have a valid user account within the X2CRM application.
