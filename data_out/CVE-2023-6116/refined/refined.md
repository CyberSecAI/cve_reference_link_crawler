- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the affected Hanwha NVR/DVR products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows for remote code execution without authentication. The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating HTTP URL parameters which leads to a stack overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through manipulating HTTP URL parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated, but needs to be able to access the affected device's HTTP interface. They need to know or guess the base address of the stack memory. However, the report notes that this is difficult since the base address depends on the firmware version and configuration options.
