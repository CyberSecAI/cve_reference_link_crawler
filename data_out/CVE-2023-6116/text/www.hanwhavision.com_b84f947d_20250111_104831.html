RISK ANALYSIS

CVE

Review Opinion

Severity

An attacker could inject arbitrary attack code by

manipulating http url parameters. However, in order to

succeed in the attack, the base address of the stack

CVE-2023-6116

memory must be obtained. The default address depends on

firmware version, configuration option information, and the

attack is unlikely to succeed. Nevertheless, we believe that

High

this vulnerability has a significant impact on the product

because it allows arbitrary attacks without authentication.

◼  Solution and Required Action

-  As some models  do not fall under  Hanwha's  long-term firmware support policy when they

were  discontinued,  it  is  not  mandatory  to  distribute  firmware  that  corrects  security

vulnerabilities.  However,  since  Hanwha  takes  cybersecurity  matters  seriously,  we  distribute

corrected firmware out of consideration for customers in this case.

-  Please  update  the  affected  models  with  the  latest  firmware  as  soon  as  possible.  It  is

recommended to use the Wisenet Device Manager tool to download & update device firmware.

Firmware can also be downloaded from Hanwha Vision websites.

If  you  have  any  questions,  please  feel  free  to  reach  out  the  Hanwha  S-CERT  team  at

secure.cctv@hanwha.com or your local Technical Support Team.
