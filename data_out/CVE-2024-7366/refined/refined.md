Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the login functionality, specifically the `username` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because the `username` parameter provided in the `POST` request to `/ajax.php?action=login` is directly incorporated into the SQL query without adequate sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privileges:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and login with elevated privileges, potentially gaining full control over the application's data and functionality. This is achieved by injecting the SQL condition `admin' or '1'='1` which makes the query always true.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `/ajax.php?action=login`. The attacker modifies the `username` parameter in the request to inject SQL code.
- **Web Interface:** The attack is performed via the web interface login page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the application's login page.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to construct HTTP POST requests.
- **SQL Injection Knowledge:** Knowledge of SQL syntax and how to craft injection payloads is required to exploit this vulnerability effectively.

**Additional Information:**

- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to inject `admin' or '1'='1` as the username to bypass the login page.
- The vulnerable software is "SourceCodester Tracking/Monitoring Management System" version 1.0.
- The vulnerability is located in the `/ajax.php?action=login` URI.
