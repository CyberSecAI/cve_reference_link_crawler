The provided content relates to a fix for a resource leak in the Linux kernel's gpio-mockup driver, specifically when registering a chip. This corresponds to CVE-2022-48661.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- When creating a software node for the gpio-mockup driver, if the creation fails, a locally allocated string array `line_names` was not freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Resource leak: Memory allocated for `line_names` was not freed when the function `fwnode_create_software_node` returned an error.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The resource leak could potentially lead to memory exhaustion if the error path is frequently triggered, though the `gpio-mockup` driver is primarily used for testing and development and unlikely to be used in a production scenario.
 
**Attack vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is not exploitable directly by an attacker. It is a resource leak that would occur when the gpio-mockup driver's registration process fails.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No attacker interaction is needed. The issue arises when the software attempts to register a gpio-mockup chip and the software node creation fails. This would more likely occur during kernel initialization or due to misconfiguration.
