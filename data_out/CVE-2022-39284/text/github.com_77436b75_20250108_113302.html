| PHP Version 7.4 CodeIgniter4 Version 4.2.6 CodeIgniter4 Installation Method Manual (zip or tar.gz) Which operating systems have you tested for this bug? macOS Which server did you use? apache Database *No response* What happened? set\_cookie function in Helpers/cookie\_helper.php is not using the default value $secure i specified in app/Config/Cookie.php.  This used to work in CI3 because I think the default value of $secure param of set\_cookie function used to be null which later on fallback to default.\*\*\*\* Steps to Reproduce  1. Set public $secure = true in /app/Config/Cookie.php' 2. Call the helper function set\_cookie    ```         helper('cookie');         set_cookie([             'name' => 'pmw',             'value' => 2,             'samesite' => 'None',         ]);    ``` 3. CookieException::forInvalidSameSiteNone() is thrown although $secure was suppose to be true  Expected Output No exception Anything else? *No response* |

| You must set variable secure to true, by default function set\_cookie `secure = false`  ``` set_cookie([          'name' => 'pmw',          'value' => 2,          'secure' => true,          'samesite' => 'None', ]); ```  If you want create cookie with default config (see <https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/cookies.html#creating-cookies>) or you can using `set_cookie` helper  ``` $cookieConfig = config('cookie');   set_cookie([            'name'     => 'pmw',            'value'    => 2,            'expire'   => $cookieConfig->expires,            'domain'   => $cookieConfig->domain,            'path'     => $cookieConfig->path,            'prefix'   => $cookieConfig->prefix,            'secure'   => $cookieConfig->secure,            'httponly' => $cookieConfig->httponly,            'samesite' => $cookieConfig->samesite, ]); ``` |

| set\_cookie function uses new Cookie in its implementation which makes it get the default value of "domain", "samesite" and other non bool config values, but doesn't for "secure". Isn't that inconsistency? Won't it better for all of them to fallback to values in config? |

| When constructing the Cookie object, only the name attribute is required. All other else are optional. If the optional attributes are not modified, their values will be filled up by the default values saved in the Cookie class. To override the defaults currently stored in the class, you can pass a Config\Cookie instance or an array of defaults to the static Cookie::setDefaults() method. <https://codeigniter4.github.io/CodeIgniter4/libraries/cookies.html#creating-cookies>  Reading the user guide, I think the values in the Config file should be used for unspecified items. |
