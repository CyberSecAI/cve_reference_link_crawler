Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by commit `d66585d14b1160712a8a9bfaf9769dd3da0e9a83` in the Admidio project:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an insufficient check on uploaded file types within the CKEditor upload handler. Specifically, the code was only verifying the file extension against a list of allowed extensions but not validating the actual file content. This allowed a user to upload files with malicious content disguised with allowed extensions (e.g., a PHP file with a .jpg extension).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Upload:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation of uploaded file content. The system relied on the file extension, which is easily spoofed, to determine if a file is an image, rather than validating the actual file content.
*   **File Upload Bypass:** Attackers could bypass the intended file type restrictions by using an allowed extension for a malicious file and upload non-image files which could then potentially be executed on the server.
*   **Missing Image Validation:**  While `getimagesize` was used, it was used *after* the file was moved, if the move was successful, there was still an attempt to process the file as an image, if not it could be uploaded without any type of validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious file (e.g., a PHP file disguised as an image), an attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution on the server, leading to full control of the server, data breaches and other malicious actions.
*   **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the web server and the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CKEditor File Upload:** The attack vector is through the CKEditor's file upload functionality, which allows users to upload files for use in the editor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker would need to be an authenticated user with the ability to upload files through the CKEditor.
*   **Knowledge of Allowed Extensions:** The attacker must know which file extensions are allowed by the system and exploit the weakness of extension checks without validating file contents.

**Changes Introduced in the Commit:**

The commit addresses the vulnerability with the following changes:

1.  **Extension check:** In `FileSystemUtils.php`, the `allowedFileExtension` function now receives the full filename instead of the extension alone and it uses `pathinfo()` to extract the extension in lowercase before checking it against the allowed extensions.
2.  **File Validation:** It introduces the check of the image format using `getimagesize()` function **before** moving the file, this prevent the execution of non image files.
3.  **Error Handling:** Adds better error handling for exceptions during file uploads.
4.  **Consistency:** Fixes and aligns the function call of `allowedFileExtension()` to send a full file name on `TableFile.php`.
5.  **Error Handling:** Adds more comprehensive error checking and exception handling in the upload handler.

In summary, this commit addresses a critical security vulnerability in the file upload functionality that, if left unaddressed, could potentially lead to server compromise. The fix focuses on validating file content before moving it, making sure that only valid images are uploaded and processed.
