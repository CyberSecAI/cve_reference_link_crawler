Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-14798:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists within the Java SE and Java SE Embedded libraries. The specific nature of the vulnerability is not detailed in the provided text, but it is related to how the libraries handle certain data or operations.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper handling of data or operations in Java SE and Java SE Embedded libraries. This could potentially lead to unauthorized modification of data or access to sensitive information.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can lead to:
    *   Unauthorized modification of data (update/insert/delete access).
    *   Unauthorized read access to some Java SE and Java SE Embedded accessible data.
    *   Partial denial of service (partial DOS) on Java SE and Java SE Embedded.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   Exploitation can occur through multiple protocols.
*   User interaction is required.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send malicious input to the vulnerable Java SE/Java SE Embedded libraries.
*   The attacker is required to make the victim user to interact with the malicious input.
*   A network connection to the vulnerable system is required.

**Additional Technical Details and Observations:**

*   **OpenSUSE:** The openSUSE content indicates that CVE-2020-14798 is one of multiple vulnerabilities fixed in an update to `java-1_8_0-openj9`, suggesting the vulnerability exists in the OpenJ9 implementation.
*   **Oracle:** The Oracle advisory states that this vulnerability affects Java SE versions 7u271, 8u261, 11.0.8, and 15, as well as Java SE Embedded version 8u261. It also mentions that this vulnerability can be exploited by supplying data to APIs without necessarily using sandboxed Java applets.
*   **Gentoo:** The Gentoo advisory notes that the vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution, which is a more severe impact than mentioned in other sources. The advisory indicates that the vulnerability is fixed in versions >= `8.272_p10`.
*   **NetApp:** NetApp acknowledges the vulnerability and its impact on multiple products that incorporate Java SE. The risk is scored as low with a base score of 3.1 and the vector as CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N. NetApp also states this vulnerability requires user interaction.
*    **Debian:** Debian's security advisories confirm that this CVE, amongst others, is addressed in their respective OpenJDK 11 and 8 updates. This indicates that the flaw is present in both OpenJDK versions.
*   **CVSS Score:** The CVSS v3.1 score provided by NetApp (3.1) indicates a low severity, but this score needs to be seen with the context of the provided vulnerability vectors and impact.

In summary, CVE-2020-14798 is a vulnerability in Java SE/Embedded libraries, exploitable remotely through network and requires user interaction, potentially leading to unauthorized data modification, disclosure or partial denial of service. Different vendors' advisories highlight varied impacts, from data modification to potential arbitrary code execution, with varying CVSS scores and complexity, highlighting the variability in real-world scenarios.
