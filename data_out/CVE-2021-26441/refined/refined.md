- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `storport.sys` driver, which can lead to an integer overflow before writing to memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow leading to out-of-bounds memory write.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access, requiring the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
