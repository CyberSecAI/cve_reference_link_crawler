- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of a cryptographically weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in the generation of recovery tokens.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the use of a PRNG that is predictable or has a small output space. This allows attackers to guess recovery tokens due to their insufficient randomness.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can guess recovery tokens in a reasonable amount of time. This allows them to take over user accounts through the password recovery mechanism by gaining access to the reset link.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the user self-registration and password recovery mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have knowledge of the system's token generation process. They could also need to observe some generated tokens in order to discern patterns or predictability.
