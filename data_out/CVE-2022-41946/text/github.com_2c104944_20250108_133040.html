# TemporaryFolder on unix-like systems does not limit access to created files

Moderate

[davecramer](/davecramer)
published
GHSA-562r-vg33-8x8h
Nov 23, 2022

## Package

maven

org.postgresql
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 42.2.27
>= 42.3.0, < 42.3.8
>= 42.4.0, < 42.4.3
>= 42.5.0, < 42.5.1

## Patched versions

42.2.27, 42.2.27.jre7
42.3.8
42.4.3
42.5.1

## Description

**Vulnerability**

`PreparedStatement.setText(int, InputStream)`

and

`PreparedStatemet.setBytea(int, InputStream)`

will create a temporary file if the InputStream is larger than 51k

Example of vulnerable code:

```
String s = "some very large string greater than 51200 bytes";

PreparedStatement.setInputStream(1, new ByteArrayInputStream(s.getBytes()) );
```

This will create a temporary file which is readable by other users on Unix like systems, but not MacOS.

Impact

On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same system.

This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability.

When analyzing the impact of this vulnerability, here are the important questions to ask:

Is the driver running in an environment where the OS has other untrusted users.

If yes, and you answered 'yes' to question 1, this vulnerability impacts you.

If no, this vulnerability does not impact you.

Patches

Because certain JDK file system APIs were only added in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the version of the JDK you are using.

Java 1.8 and higher users: this vulnerability is fixed in 42.2.27, 42.3.8, 42.4.3, 42.5.1

Java 1.7 users: this vulnerability is fixed in 42.2.27.jre7

Java 1.6 and lower users: no patch is available; you must use the workaround below.

Workarounds

If you are unable to patch, or are stuck running on Java 1.6, specifying the java.io.tmpdir system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user will fix this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
