  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "source": "www.owasp.org_858657c2_20250110_201327.html",
      "root_cause": "The application fails to properly validate user-supplied input when constructing file paths, allowing an attacker to manipulate these paths to access or include unauthorized files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Input Validation",
        "Path Traversal"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can access arbitrary files and directories stored on the file system, including application source code, configuration files, and critical system files. This can lead to information disclosure, code execution, and potentially full system compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Manipulating file path variables with 'dot-dot-slash (../)' sequences or their variations",
        "Using absolute file paths",
        "Exploiting encoding issues (URL encoding, double encoding)",
        "Injecting null bytes to bypass validation routines",
         "Including files and scripts from external websites"
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply or manipulate the input that is used to construct the file path within the application. This is typically done through HTTP GET/POST parameters or cookies."
