*   **Web Management Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malicious request to the web management interface, which listens on TCP port 80 by default.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable router.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to craft a specific malicious login request to exploit the authentication bypass. No prior authentication is needed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-CAN-19549.
*   D-Link has released a hotfix firmware update to address the issue.
*   The provided CVSS score is 6.5, indicating a medium severity. The vector string is AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N.
