Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-36897:

**CVE-2022-36897**

*   **Vulnerable Plugin:** Compuware Xpediter Code Coverage Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 1.0.7 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.
*   **Weakness:** Missing authorization checks, leading to information disclosure.
*   **Impact:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can enumerate hosts and ports of Compuware configurations and credentials IDs stored in Jenkins. This information can potentially be used in conjunction with another vulnerability to capture credentials.
*   **Attack Vector:** By accessing specific HTTP endpoints in the plugin without proper authorization, an attacker can gather sensitive information.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.

**Summary:**

The Compuware Xpediter Code Coverage Plugin, in versions 1.0.7 and earlier, fails to implement proper permission checks on some of its HTTP endpoints. This vulnerability enables attackers with Overall/Read access to enumerate Compuware configuration details, including hosts, ports, and credential IDs. This information can be used in further attacks to compromise credentials.
