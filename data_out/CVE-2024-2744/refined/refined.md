- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Nextgen Gallery plugin fails to sanitize and escape certain settings, allowing for stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the "Tooltip text for Media RSS link" setting within the "NextGEN Media RSS" widget is vulnerable.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability due to lack of sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input in plugin settings.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that executes when a user interacts with the affected element (in this case, by hovering over the media RSS link). This can lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, or other malicious actions within the user's browser context.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - An attacker with administrative privileges (or other high-privilege users capable of modifying plugin settings) can inject the malicious JavaScript payload via the "Tooltip text for Media RSS link" within the "NextGEN Media RSS" widget.
    - The malicious code is then stored and executed when another user visits the site and hovers over the RSS link.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must have high-privilege access (e.g., administrator) to the WordPress dashboard to modify plugin settings.
    - The attacker does not need to interact with the targeted user directly, other than by having the target user browse the website.
