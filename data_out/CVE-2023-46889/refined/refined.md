{
  "CVE-2023-46889": {
    "Root cause": "Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information during the device setup phase.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The Meross MSH30Q creates an unprotected Wi-Fi access point during setup.",
      "The Wi-Fi password and network name are transmitted between the MSH30Q and the mobile application over the Wi-Fi network.",
      "Although the Wi-Fi password is encrypted, a part of the decryption algorithm is public, allowing for decryption with a complete algorithm reconstruction."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can intercept the Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password during the device setup phase.",
     "Attack vectors": "An attacker on the same Wi-Fi network as the device during its setup can intercept the traffic.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be within range of the unprotected Wi-Fi access point created by the MSH30Q during its setup phase and needs to be able to monitor the network traffic. They also need knowledge of the public part of the encryption algorithm to decrypt the password."
