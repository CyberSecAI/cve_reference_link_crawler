- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user could potentially perform actions that require higher privileges. The specific impact is dependent on the context of the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves exploiting the lack of proper access control checks within the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber (or any unprivileged user) to exploit the vulnerability.
