The provided content is related to CVE-2023-4568.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Insufficient access controls for XMLRPC operations in PaperCut NG. Specifically, the default configurations of allowed IP lists (`auth.providers.allowed-addresses`) are often set to a wildcard, which allows unauthenticated remote attackers to issue XMLRPC calls.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper access control:  Lack of proper authentication or authorization for XMLRPC calls.
- Default configuration: Wildcard configurations for allowed IP lists.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attackers can issue XMLRPC calls, which can lead to various impacts. The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates the ability to add a printer or get the application's configuration. Other impacts include the ability to modify print configurations, add rogue print devices, potentially extract sensitive data, or disrupt printing services.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack: Sending specially crafted XMLRPC requests to the PaperCut NG server over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to have network access to the PaperCut NG server, typically on port 9192.
- No authentication required: The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication due to the wildcard IP allowlists.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory notes that PaperCut's security staff has acknowledged the behavior but does not plan to provide a patch, recommending customers apply mitigations via product documentation.
- The affected versions are confirmed to be 22.0.12 and earlier, but later versions may also be vulnerable.
- Proof-of-concept XMLRPC requests for registering a printer and getting the global configuration are provided.
