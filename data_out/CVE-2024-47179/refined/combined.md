# Expression injection in Actions[¶](#expression-injection-in-actions "Link to this heading")

Using user-controlled input in GitHub Actions may lead to code injection in contexts like *run:* or *script:*.

Code injection in GitHub Actions may allow an attacker to exfiltrate any secrets used in the workflow and the temporary GitHub repository authorization token. The token might have write access to the repository, allowing an attacker to use the token to make changes to the repository.

## Recommendation[¶](#recommendation "Link to this heading")

The best practice to avoid code injection vulnerabilities in GitHub workflows is to set the untrusted input value of the expression to an intermediate environment variable and then use the environment variable using the native syntax of the shell/script interpreter (that is, not *${{ env.VAR }}*).

It is also recommended to limit the permissions of any tokens used by a workflow such as the GITHUB\_TOKEN.

## Example[¶](#example "Link to this heading")

The following example lets a user inject an arbitrary shell command:

```
on: issue_comment

jobs:
  echo-body:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - run: |
        echo '${{ github.event.comment.body }}'

```

The following example uses an environment variable, but **still allows the injection** because of the use of expression syntax:

```
on: issue_comment

jobs:
  echo-body:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    -  env:
        BODY: ${{ github.event.issue.body }}
      run: |
        echo '${{ env.BODY }}'

```

The following example uses shell syntax to read the environment variable and will prevent the attack:

```
on: issue_comment

jobs:
  echo-body:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - env:
        BODY: ${{ github.event.issue.body }}
      run: |
        echo "$BODY"

```

# RSSHub's `docker-test-cont.yml` workflow is vulnerable to Artifact Poisoning which may lead to a full repository takeover.

## Description

### Artifact Poisoning in `docker-test-cont.yml` workflow. (`GHSL-2024-178`)

The [`docker-test-cont.yml` workflow](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/blob/e08733f94c81440d19ee6a5fd5e915e9a65395f5/.github/workflows/docker-test-cont.yml) gets triggered when the `PR - Docker build test` workflow completes successfully:

```
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: [PR - Docker build test] # open, reopen, synchronized, edited included
    types: [completed]
```

It then collects some information about the Pull Request that triggered the triggering workflow and set some labels depending on the PR body and sender. If the PR also contains a `routes` markdown block, it will set the `TEST_CONTINUE` environment variable to `true`.

The workflow then downloads and extracts an artifact uploaded by the triggering workflow which is expected to contain a single `rsshub.tar.zst` file. However, this is not validates and the contents are extracted in the root of the workspace overriding any existing files:

```
- name: Fetch Docker image
  if: (env.TEST_CONTINUE)
  uses: dawidd6/action-download-artifact@v6
  with:
    workflow: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.workflow_id }}
    run_id: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}
    name: docker-image
```

After a few steps, the workflow installs the pnpm dependencies with:

```
- name: Install dependencies (pnpm) # require js-beautify
  if: (env.TEST_CONTINUE)
  run: pnpm i
```

Since the contents of the artifact have not been validated, it is possible for a malicious actor to send a Pull Request which uploads, not just the `rsshub.tar.zst` compressed docker image, but also a malicious `package.json` file with a script to run arbitrary code in the context of the [privileged workflow](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/actions/runs/10141104413/job/28037643579#step:1:17).

#### PoC

* Clone the repository
* Modify [`docker-test.yml`](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/blob/e08733f94c81440d19ee6a5fd5e915e9a65395f5/.github/workflows/docker-test.yml) workflow. Keep the original content but perform the following modifications:
  + Add the following step before the upload artifact step:

```
- name: Test Docker image
  run: bash scripts/docker/test-docker.sh

- name: Export Docker image
  run: |
    mkdir payload
    cd payload
    docker save rsshub:latest | zstdmt -o rsshub.tar.zst
    cat <<EOF > package.json
    ADD HERE THE CONTENTS OF THE ORIGINAL PACKAGE.JSON (ommitted for clarity) AND ADD A NEW PREINSTALL SCRIPT:
        `"preinstall": "echo COMPROMISED",`
    EOF

- name: Upload Docker image
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: docker-image
    path: payload
    retention-days: 1
```

* Create a Pull Request and add a valid `routes` comment in the body of the Pull Request
* Watch the execution of the vulnerable workflow log and look for the word `COMPROMISED` in it.

#### Impact

The workflow runs with [full-write privieges](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/actions/runs/10141104413/job/28037643579#step:1:17) which may allow a malicious actor to take over the Repository:

```
  Actions: write
  Attestations: write
  Checks: write
  Contents: write
  Deployments: write
  Discussions: write
  Issues: write
  Metadata: read
  Packages: write
  Pages: write
  PullRequests: write
  RepositoryProjects: write
  SecurityEvents: write
  Statuses: write

```
#### Remediation

Extract the artifact to a temporary directory and validate its contents.

## Summary

RSSHub’s `docker-test-cont.yml` workflow is vulnerable to Artifact Poisoning which may lead to a full repository takeover.

## Project

RSSHub

## Tested Version

Latest commit at the time of reporting.

## Details

### Artifact Poisoning in `docker-test-cont.yml` workflow. (`GHSL-2024-178`)

The [`docker-test-cont.yml` workflow](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/blob/e08733f94c81440d19ee6a5fd5e915e9a65395f5/.github/workflows/docker-test-cont.yml) gets triggered when the `PR - Docker build test` workflow completes successfully:

```
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: [PR - Docker build test] # open, reopen, synchronized, edited included
    types: [completed]

```

It then collects some information about the Pull Request that triggered the triggering workflow and sets some labels depending on the PR body and sender. If the PR also contains a `routes` markdown block, it will set the `TEST_CONTINUE` environment variable to `true`.

The workflow then downloads and extracts an artifact uploaded by the triggering workflow which is expected to contain a single `rsshub.tar.zst` file. However, this is not validated and the contents are extracted in the root of the workspace overriding any existing files:

```
- name: Fetch Docker image
  if: (env.TEST_CONTINUE)
  uses: dawidd6/action-download-artifact@v6
  with:
    workflow: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.workflow_id }}
    run_id: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}
    name: docker-image

```

After a few steps, the workflow installs the pnpm dependencies with:

```
- name: Install dependencies (pnpm) # require js-beautify
  if: (env.TEST_CONTINUE)
  run: pnpm i

```

Since the contents of the artifact have not been validated, it is possible for a malicious actor to send a Pull Request which uploads, not just the `rsshub.tar.zst` compressed docker image, but also a malicious `package.json` file with a script to run arbitrary code in the context of the [privileged workflow](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/actions/runs/10141104413/job/28037643579#step:1:17).

* Create a Pull Request and add a valid `routes` comment in the body of the Pull Request
* Watch the execution of the vulnerable workflow log and look for the word `COMPROMISED` in it.

#### Impact

The workflow runs with [full-write privileges](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/actions/runs/10141104413/job/28037643579#step:1:17) which may allow a malicious actor to take over the Repository:

```
  Actions: write
  Attestations: write
  Checks: write
  Contents: write
  Deployments: write
  Discussions: write
  Issues: write
  Metadata: read
  Packages: write
  Pages: write
  PullRequests: write
  RepositoryProjects: write
