- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CALL ME NOW plugin for WordPress, in versions 3.0 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site while they are authenticated.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, will perform actions on the WordPress site without the user's consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a crafted link or visiting a malicious page to perform actions on the WordPress site. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
