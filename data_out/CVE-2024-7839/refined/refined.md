Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `addbill.php` file of the Itsourcecode Billing System V1.0. This is caused by insufficient user input validation for the `owners_id` parameter. The application directly uses the value of this parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization. The `owners_id` parameter is directly used in SQL queries without being parameterized or sanitized.
- Lack of input sanitization: User-provided input is not sanitized or validated, allowing malicious SQL code to be injected.
- Direct use of user input in SQL queries: The application directly uses the user-controlled `owners_id` parameter within the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- Sensitive data leakage: Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
- Data tampering: Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- Comprehensive system control: Attackers could potentially gain control of the system.
- Service interruption: The vulnerability could lead to service disruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the `owners_id` parameter in the `addbill.php` file.
- Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through HTTP POST requests to the `addbill.php` file with a manipulated `owners_id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the `owners_id` parameter and its usage within the application's SQL queries.
- No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection.
- The provided payload `owners_id=1' AND (SELECT 4679 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))oUsN) AND 'wtle'='wtle` can be used to verify the vulnerability by observing the delay caused by the `SLEEP(5)` command.
- The vulnerability has been confirmed using sqlmap.
- The provided screenshots show the results of using sqlmap to exploit the vulnerability, including information about the database structure and content.
- The suggested repairs include:
    - Using prepared statements and parameter binding
    - Input validation and filtering
    - Minimizing database user permissions
    - Regular security audits
