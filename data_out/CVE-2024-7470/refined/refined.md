Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a command injection flaw present in the web interface of Raisecom gateway devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Command Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the affected device.
*   **Affected Component:** The vulnerability is specifically located within the `vpn_template_style.php` file in the web interface.
*  **Vulnerable Parameters**: The vulnerability is linked to the `sslvpn_config_mod` and `template/stylenum` parameters in the  `vpn_template_style.php` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would grant the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the system, potentially leading to:
*   Full system compromise
*   Data theft or manipulation
*   Denial of service
*   Installation of malware
*   Lateral movement within the network

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The primary attack vector is through the web interface of the Raisecom gateway devices.
*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers would likely craft malicious HTTP requests targeting the vulnerable `vpn_template_style.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web interface of the vulnerable Raisecom device. This could be either local network access or access through the internet if the web interface is exposed.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the specific vulnerable file (`vpn_template_style.php`) and the parameters that can be manipulated (`sslvpn_config_mod` and `template/stylenum`) to inject commands.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects specific models of Raisecom gateway devices: MSG1200, MSG2100E, MSG2200, and MSG2300 running version 3.90.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "critical".
*   The vulnerability was initially reported on GitHub.
