### Description

The Custom Twitter Feeds – A Tweets Widget or X Feed Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ctf\_auto\_save\_tokens function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the site's twitter API token and secret via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
