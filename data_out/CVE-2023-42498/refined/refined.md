Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the Language Override edit screen. Specifically, the `_com_liferay_portal_language_override_web_internal_portlet_PLOPortlet_key` parameter is vulnerable to reflected XSS.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input when rendering the language override edit screen, which allows execution of arbitrary script.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML. This can result in various impacts, such as:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Defacement of the web page.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Execution of arbitrary code in the victim's browser.
    *   Stealing of sensitive information.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes the malicious JavaScript in the `_com_liferay_portal_language_override_web_internal_portlet_PLOPortlet_key` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload within the vulnerable parameter.
    *   The victim must click on the crafted link (user interaction required).
    *   No special privileges or authenticated access is required to trigger the vulnerability.

*   **Affected Versions:**
    *   Liferay Portal 7.4.3.8 through 7.4.3.97
    *   Liferay DXP 2023.Q3 before patch 5
    *  Liferay DXP 7.4 update 4 through 92

*   **Fixed Versions:**
    *   Liferay Portal 7.4.3.98
    *   Liferay DXP 2023.Q3.5
