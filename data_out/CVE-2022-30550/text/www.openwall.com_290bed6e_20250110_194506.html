These incorrectly applied settings can lead to an unintended security configuration and can permit privilege escalation with certain configurations involving master user authentication.

One such configuration would be where an administrator wishes to use the same pam configuration or passwd file for both normal and master users but use the username_filter setting to restrict which of the users is able to be a master user.

Hi all, unfortunately two mistakes crept into this notification. Apologies for that.

The correct component for this is "auth", and the affected version should have been "2.2 and newer".
