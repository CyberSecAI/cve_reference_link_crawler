- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress WPBITS Addons For Elementor Page Builder Plugin, in versions 1.3.4.2 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin contains an XSS vulnerability, allowing injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could inject scripts like redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts would execute when users visit the site, potentially leading to malicious redirects, defacement, or other attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the vulnerable plugin, likely by injecting malicious script into input fields or other locations where it is not properly sanitized.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable plugin. The required privilege is "Contributor."
