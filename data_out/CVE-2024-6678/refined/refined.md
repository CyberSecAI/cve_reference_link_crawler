The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, but it specifically mentions **CVE-2024-6678**.

**Vulnerability:** Execute environment stop actions as the owner of the stop action job

*   **Root Cause:** An issue in GitLab CE/EE allows an attacker to trigger a pipeline as an arbitrary user under certain circumstances.
*   **Weaknesses:** The vulnerability stems from improper authorization and control when executing environment stop actions.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can trigger pipelines as arbitrary users, leading to potential unauthorized access, data modification, or denial of service depending on the pipeline's actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requires low privileges (PR:L), and no user interaction (UI:N) is required.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have low privileges within the system to exploit this vulnerability and trigger pipelines.
*   **CVSS Score:** 9.9 (Critical) - `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H`
*   **Affected Versions:** GitLab CE/EE versions prior to 17.1.7 (starting from 8.14), prior to 17.2.5 (starting from 17.2) and prior to 17.3.2 (starting from 17.3).
