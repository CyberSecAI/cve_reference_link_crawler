Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-de7b3ceca6
2022-09-26 00:16:09.376271
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : redis
Product : Fedora 37
Version : 7.0.5
Release : 1.fc37
URL : <https://redis.io>
Summary : A persistent key-value database
Description :
Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data
structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and
sorted sets.

You can run atomic operations on these types, like appending to a string;
incrementing the value in a hash; pushing to a list; computing set
intersection, union and difference; or getting the member with highest
ranking in a sorted set.

In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Redis works with an
in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either
by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending
each command to a log.

Redis also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave replication, with very
fast non-blocking first synchronization, auto-reconnection on net split
and so forth.

Other features include Transactions, Pub/Sub, Lua scripting, Keys with a
limited time-to-live, and configuration settings to make Redis behave like
a cache.

You can use Redis from most programming languages also.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

do DNS lookup before sending CLUSTER MEET (#11151) \* Fix crash when a key is
lazy expired during cluster key migration (#11176) \* Fix AOF rewrite to fsync
the old AOF file when a new one is created (#11004) \* Fix some crashes involving
a list containing entries larger than 1GB (#11242) \* Correctly handle scripts

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
