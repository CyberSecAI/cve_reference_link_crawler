For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wbx-sxss-fupl-64uHbcm5>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect Cisco Webex Meetings, which is cloud based. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2023-20132: Cisco Webex Meetings Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.  This vulnerability exists because the web interface does not properly validate user-supplied input during a webinar event practice session. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link during the session. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwe38541](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe38541)CVE ID: CVE-2023-20132Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 5.4CVSS Vector:CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N  **CVE-2023-20134: Cisco Webex Meetings File Upload Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files as recordings.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTML request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to upload arbitrary files to Cisco Webex Meetings as recordings.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
