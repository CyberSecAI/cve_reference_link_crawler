- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `cgiserver.cgi` process, which handles API requests, incorrectly assumes that the "param" field within a JSON command will always be a JSON object. When a string or other non-object type is provided for "param," the program attempts to access it as an object using the subscription operator, leading to an assertion failure and a crash of the `cgiserver.cgi` process, ultimately rebooting the device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20). The code does not properly validate the type of the "param" field in the JSON command, leading to an assertion failure when it's not an object.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of Service. A successful exploit causes the device to reboot, disrupting its normal operation.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the device's `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint with a JSON body where the "param" field is not a JSON object, but instead a string, such as an empty string "".
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device, and while most of the commands require an authenticated session, it can be combined with TALOS-2021-1420 to perform the API calls without authentication.
