- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Prototype pollution in Kibana
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Prototype pollution vulnerability that can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with access to ML and Alerting connector features, and write access to internal ML indices can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: 
    - Write access to the `.ml-anomalies*` hidden indices.
    - Read access to the Machine Learning feature.
    - Read access to the Actions & Connectors feature.
