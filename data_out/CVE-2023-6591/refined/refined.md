- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: High privilege users, such as admin, can inject malicious scripts into the popup custom content. When a user visits the blog, the injected script will be executed, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By adding a malicious payload into the "Custom Content" of a popup through the plugin's settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a high privilege user, like an admin.
