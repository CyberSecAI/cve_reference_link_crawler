  "CVE-2017-3651": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `mysqldump` client tool in MySQL and MariaDB did not properly handle database and table names containing newline characters.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious database user with privileges to create databases or tables could cause the `mysql` command to execute arbitrary shell or SQL commands when restoring a database backup created using the `mysqldump` tool.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "Database user restoring a backup created with a maliciously crafted table/database name with newlines via mysqldump",
        "Man in the Middle (MITM) attacker (in context of RHSA-2017:2787)"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
       "Database user with CREATE privileges (to create database/table names with newline characters)",
        "Man-in-the-middle attacker between client and server (in context of RHSA-2017:2787)"
