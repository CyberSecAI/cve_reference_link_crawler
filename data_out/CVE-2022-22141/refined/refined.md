- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Inappropriate access privileges for the named pipe created by the Long-term Data Archive Package.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls (CWE-264)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who has intruded into a computer with the affected software can delete arbitrary files using the system privileges of the running process.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have already gained access to the computer where the vulnerable software is installed. User interaction is required.
