    "weaknesses": [
      "The `urlize()` and `urlizetrunc()` template filters do not properly handle very large inputs with a specific sequence of characters, leading to excessive resource consumption."

      "The attacker can provide a malicious input string to the `urlize()` or `urlizetrunc()` template filters through user-provided data or other input vectors."

      "The attacker needs the ability to submit crafted input to the affected template filters."
