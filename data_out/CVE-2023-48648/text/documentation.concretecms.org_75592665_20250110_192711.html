## Security Fixes

* Updated the Guzzle HTTP library to 7.8 to ensure Concrete CMS is not vulnerable to Guzzle [CVE-2023-29197](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29197) Thank you Danilo Costa for reporting H1 2132287
* Fixed  Directories could be created with insecure permissions since file creation functions gave universal access (0777) to created folders by default. Excessive permissions could be granted when creating a directory with permissions greater than 0755 or when the permissions argument was not specified. The Concrete CMS Security team scored this 6.6 with CVSS v3 vector [AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1) Thanks tahabiyikli-vortex for reporting H12122245. Thanks Mlocati for providing the fix. Fixed in commit [11677](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/11677)
* Fixed  stored XSS on the Concrete Admin page by sanitizing uploaded file
  names. The Concrete CMS Security team scored this 3.5 with CVSS v3 vector [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N&version=3.1) Thanks @akbar\_jafarli for reporting H1 2149479. Fixed in commit [11695](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/11695)
