Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-48648:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from file creation functions that were granting universal access (0777) to newly created folders by default. This was due to insecure permissions being applied during directory creation.  Excessive permissions could be granted when creating a directory with permissions greater than 0755 or when the permissions argument was not specified.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure default file permissions for newly created directories.
- Failure to sanitize or validate the permission arguments for folder creation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to files or directories with excessive permissions.
- This could lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or denial of service, as indicated by the high impact scores (C:H, I:H, A:H) in the provided CVSS vector.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access is required (AV:N).
- The attack requires high privilege (PR:H) and high attack complexity (AC:H).
- The attacker does not need user interaction (UI:N) and scope is unchanged (S:U)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have high privileges within the Concrete CMS system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by tahabiyikli-vortex through HackerOne.
- A fix for this vulnerability was provided by Mlocati.
