Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `username` parameter within the `/simple-online-bidding-system/bidding/admin/ajax.php?action=login` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to a UNION based SQL injection via the username parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials, application configuration, or other confidential information. This is demonstrated in the provided proof-of-concept (POC) where the attacker is able to extract the database name.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can obtain sensitive server information via database queries.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint (`/simple-online-bidding-system/bidding/admin/ajax.php?action=login`).
- **Malicious Input:** The `username` parameter in the POST data is where the malicious SQL injection code is inserted.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable application.
- **HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how to send HTTP POST requests.
- **SQL Injection Knowledge:**  The attacker requires knowledge of SQL syntax and SQL injection techniques.
- **No Authentication Required:** The exploit can be triggered against the login form, which does not require prior authentication.
