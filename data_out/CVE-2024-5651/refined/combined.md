| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2290540#c0)  Avinash Hanwate    2024-06-05 09:56:32 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in fence agents that rely on SSH/Telnet could be abused to obtain a Remote Code Execution (RCE) primitive by supplying an arbitrary command to execute in the --ssh-path/--telnet-path arguments. A low-privilege user (i.e. a user with developer access) can create a specifically crafted FenceAgentsRemediation for a fence agent supporting  --ssh-path/--telnet-path arguments to execute arbitrary commands on the operator's pod. This RCE leads to a privilege escalation; first as the service account running the operator, then to another service account with cluster-admin privileges.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2290540#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-08-15 08:10:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Fence Agents Remediation 0.4 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:5453 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:5453](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A5453)   ``` |  |
