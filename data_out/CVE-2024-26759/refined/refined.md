{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition exists when skipping swap cache for SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO. If two or more threads swap in the same entry concurrently, they might obtain different pages. One thread could complete the swap in process, free the swap entry, and then swap out a modified page using the same entry before another thread finishes. This leads to a situation where the pte_same check passes incorrectly due to PTE reuse, causing the second thread to install a stale page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Race condition, ABA problem due to PTE reuse, potential for data corruption, potential data loss with ZRAM.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Data corruption, potential data loss, system instability.",
  "Attack vectors": "Multiple threads concurrently swapping in the same swap entry, particularly when skipping the swap cache (SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO). The provided reproducer uses multiple threads updating a shared memory region and another thread swapping out data using madvise to trigger the race.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to create multiple threads and control memory access/swap operations to trigger the race."
