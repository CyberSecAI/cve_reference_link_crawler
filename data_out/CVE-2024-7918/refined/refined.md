- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize or escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: High privilege users, like admins, can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings. These scripts will be executed when other users access the affected pages, potentially leading to actions such as session hijacking or arbitrary code execution in the user's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by navigating to the plugin's settings page in the WordPress admin panel, and injecting malicious Javascript code into fields like "Consumer Key".
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have admin-level privileges on the WordPress site to access the plugin settings page.
