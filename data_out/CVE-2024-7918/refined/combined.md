## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Pocket Widget <= 0.1.3 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=pocketwidget
2. For the Consumer Key, enter the payload: `ds"><script>alert(2)</script>`
3. Save the settings and see the XSS
