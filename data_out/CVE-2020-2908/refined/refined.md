    "summary": "Oracle VirtualBox Virtual USB Numeric Truncation Privilege Escalation Vulnerability",
    "details": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Oracle VirtualBox. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the virtual USB component. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of guest-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the hypervisor.",
