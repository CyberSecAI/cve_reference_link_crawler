{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `patchInto` function in the `@akbr/patch-into` package is vulnerable to prototype pollution.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Prototype Pollution vulnerability. The `patchInto` function allows modification of the `Object.prototype` by using the `__proto__` property in the arguments.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can alter the behavior of all objects inheriting from the affected prototype, potentially leading to denial of service, remote code execution, or cross-site scripting attacks, depending on the application's specific usage and affected gadgets.",
  "Attack vectors": "By calling the vulnerable `patchInto` function with an argument containing the `__proto__` property, an attacker can modify `Object.prototype`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to invoke the vulnerable `patchInto` function with crafted arguments."
