The provided document is an Adobe Security Bulletin (APSB24-28) that details multiple vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).  CVE-2024-36185 is listed within this bulletin.

**CVE-2024-36185 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weakness:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it, leading to the injection of malicious scripts into the application's data store.
*  **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected page or content.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based (AV:N). The attacker injects the malicious script through network requests.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker requires a low privilege account (PR:L) to inject the script. The user interaction (UI) is required, as the injected script will execute only when other users interact with the affected page. The attack requires a change in scope (S:C) meaning the XSS is stored and executed within a different scope/context of the application.
