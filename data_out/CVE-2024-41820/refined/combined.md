| **Describe the version** version about:   1. kubean `any`   **Describe the bug** Permissions from <https://github.com/kubean-io/kubean/blob/main/charts/kubean/templates/clusterrole.yaml> are too loose.  That may leads to malicious one can access the worker node which has deployments of Kubean, he/she can abuse these excessive permissions to do whatever he/she likes to the whole cluster.  Thanks for the [@younaman](https://github.com/younaman)(yang9467@umn.edu)'s reporting  **Expected behavior** The Kubean should use accurate verbs and resource types to restrain the permission that granted to the deployment. |

# A potential risk of kubean which can be leveraged to make a cluster-level privilege escalation

Moderate

[0ekk](/0ekk)
published
GHSA-3wfj-3x8q-hrpg
Aug 5, 2024

## Package

kubean
(Kubernetes)

## Affected versions

<=v0.17.5

## Patched versions

v0.18.1

## Description

### Impact

This ClusterRole has `*` verbs of `*` resources. If a malicious user can access the worker node which has kubean's deployment, he/she can abuse these excessive permissions to do whatever he/she likes to the whole cluster, resulting in a cluster-level privilege escalation.

### Patches

`>=v0.18.1`

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
