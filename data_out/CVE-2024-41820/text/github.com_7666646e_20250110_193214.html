| **Describe the version** version about:   1. kubean `any`   **Describe the bug** Permissions from <https://github.com/kubean-io/kubean/blob/main/charts/kubean/templates/clusterrole.yaml> are too loose.  That may leads to malicious one can access the worker node which has deployments of Kubean, he/she can abuse these excessive permissions to do whatever he/she likes to the whole cluster.  Thanks for the [@younaman](https://github.com/younaman)(yang9467@umn.edu)'s reporting  **Expected behavior** The Kubean should use accurate verbs and resource types to restrain the permission that granted to the deployment. |
