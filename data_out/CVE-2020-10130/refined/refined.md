The provided content is a changelog for SearchBlox version 9.1, which includes fixes for several security vulnerabilities. Specifically, it lists 6 Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities and 1 Privilege Escalation vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Stored Cross-site scripting: Improper sanitization of user-supplied data when stored and later displayed.
- Privilege Escalation: Improper access control allows a lower-privileged user to access administrative functions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in multiple fields such as:
  - Username field
  - Role field
  - Group, New-group fields
  - Add cluster node, Name of the cluster fields of Cluster
  - Multiple fields of Featured Results
- Privilege Escalation: Lower user has access to Admin Tab

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Stored XSS: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they view affected areas, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- Privilege Escalation: A lower privileged user can perform administrative actions, leading to unauthorized access and potential control over the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- XSS: By injecting malicious script in the vulnerable fields, which are stored and displayed to other users.
- Privilege Escalation: By exploiting the access control flaw, a low privileged user can directly access admin panel functionalities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- XSS: The attacker needs to be able to input data into the vulnerable fields. This may require some form of authenticated access depending on the application's design.
- Privilege Escalation: The attacker needs to have low-privileged user account.
