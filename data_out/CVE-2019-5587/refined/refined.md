- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The lack of a root file system integrity check at boot time in FortiOS VM appliances.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing integrity check allows modification of the VM image without detection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with read/write access to the VM image before it is booted can inject malicious implants, potentially leading to the execution of unauthorized code or commands.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs read/write access to the VM image before it's booted.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to modify the VM image before the appliance is started.
