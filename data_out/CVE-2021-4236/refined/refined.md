Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-4236:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the `github.com/ecnepsnai/web` library handles WebSocket connections. Specifically, the authentication method (`AuthenticateMethod`) set for a route was not being executed for WebSocket requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** WebSocket requests were not being subjected to the authentication checks defined by the `AuthenticateMethod`. This could allow unauthorized users to access WebSocket endpoints that should be protected.
*   **Nil Pointer Dereference:** The code assumes that the `UserData` returned by the authentication method will not be nil. When authentication isn't performed, the `userData` variable remains nil and can lead to a nil pointer dereference if the endpoint handler uses it without checking for nil.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could bypass authentication and gain access to sensitive WebSocket endpoints.
*   **Application Crash:** If the code relies on the `UserData` being non-nil, exploiting the authentication bypass vulnerability can lead to a nil pointer dereference and potentially crash the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, where an attacker sends a WebSocket request to the affected endpoint.
*   **WebSocket Endpoint:** The vulnerability affects WebSocket endpoints specifically, not standard HTTP request handlers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of WebSocket Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the URL of the vulnerable WebSocket endpoint.
*   **No Authentication Credentials Needed:**  The attacker doesn't need to provide valid authentication credentials, as the vulnerability allows bypassing the authentication mechanism.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The fix for this issue was introduced in commit `5a78f8d5c41ce60dcf9f61aaf47a7a8dc3e0002f`.
*   The vulnerability affects versions of `github.com/ecnepsnai/web` from `v1.4.0` before `v1.5.2`.
*   The specific vulnerable symbol is `Server.Socket`.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the `AuthenticateMethod` is called for WebSocket connections, as seen in the provided diff of `websocket.go`.
