# Vulnerability Report: GO-2021-0107

* CVE-2021-4236, GHSA-5gjg-jgh4-gppm, and 1 more
* Affects:
  github.com/ecnepsnai/web
* Published: Jul 28, 2021
* Modified: May 20, 2024

Web Sockets do not execute any AuthenticateMethod methods which may be set, leading to a nil pointer dereference if the returned UserData pointer is assumed to be non-nil, or authentication bypass.
This issue only affects WebSockets with an AuthenticateMethod hook. Request handlers that do not explicitly use WebSockets are not vulnerable.

## Affected Packages

* Path
  Go Versions
  Symbols
* [github.com/ecnepsnai/web](/github.com/ecnepsnai/web)
  from v1.4.0 before v1.5.2
  + [Server.Socket](/github.com/ecnepsnai/web#Server.Socket)
