### Summary
The provided content describes a directory traversal vulnerability leading to local file inclusion in the "Elementor Addon Elements" WordPress plugin, specifically in versions up to 1.12.12.

### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability stems from the `render` function in the `shape-separator.php` file. Specifically, the code was using `include EAE_PATH . 'modules/shape-separator/shapes/' . $settings['separator_shape'] . '.php';` to include a shape file based on user-controlled input `separator_shape` without proper sanitization or validation, leading to directory traversal.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **Path Traversal:** The plugin directly includes a file using a path constructed with user-provided input without proper validation, allowing attackers to traverse directories.
- **Local File Inclusion:** The vulnerability enables an attacker to include arbitrary PHP files from the server.

### Impact of exploitation
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Attackers can include and execute arbitrary PHP files, leading to potential exposure of sensitive data, including database credentials, configuration files, etc.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Depending on the included files, the attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code on the server.

### Attack vectors
- By manipulating the `separator_shape` parameter.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- **Authenticated User:** An authenticated user with contributor access or higher is required to exploit this vulnerability.
