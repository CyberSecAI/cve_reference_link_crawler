Revert "ALSA: hda: Flush interrupts on disabling"
[ Upstream commit 1a7f60b9df614bb36d14dc0c0bc898a31b2b506f ]
This reverts commit caa8422d01e983782548648e125fd617cadcec3f.
It turned out that this commit caused a regression at shutdown /
reboot, as the synchronize\_irq() calls seems blocking the whole
shutdown. Also another part of the change about shuffling the call
order looks suspicious; the azx\_stop\_chip() call disables the CORB /
RIRB while the others may still need the CORB/RIRB update.
Since the original commit itself was a cargo-fix, let's revert the
whole patch.

powerpc/powernv: Fix CPU idle to be called with IRQs disabled
[ Upstream commit 7d6475051fb3d9339c5c760ed9883bc0a9048b21 ]
Commit e78a7614f3876 ("idle: Prevent late-arriving interrupts from
disrupting offline") changes arch\_cpu\_idle\_dead to be called with
interrupts disabled, which triggers the WARN in pnv\_smp\_cpu\_kill\_self.
Fix this by fixing up irq\_happened after hard disabling, rather than
requiring there are no pending interrupts, similarly to what was done
done until commit 2525db04d1cc5 ("powerpc/powernv: Simplify lazy IRQ
handling in CPU offline").

sched/fair: Fix low cpu usage with high throttling by removing expiration of cpu-local slices
commit de53fd7aedb100f03e5d2231cfce0e4993282425 upstream.
It has been observed, that highly-threaded, non-cpu-bound applications
running under cpu.cfs\_quota\_us constraints can hit a high percentage of
periods throttled while simultaneously not consuming the allocated
amount of quota. This use case is typical of user-interactive non-cpu
bound applications, such as those running in kubernetes or mesos when
run on multiple cpu cores.
This has been root caused to cpu-local run queue being allocated per cpu
bandwidth slices, and then not fully using that slice within the period.
At which point the slice and quota expires. This expiration of unused
slice results in applications not being able to utilize the quota for
which they are allocated.
The non-expiration of per-cpu slices was recently fixed by
'commit 512ac999d275 ("sched/fair: Fix bandwidth timer clock drift
condition")'. Prior to that it appears that this had been broken since
at least 'commit 51f2176d74ac ("sched/fair: Fix unlocked reads of some
cfs\_b->quota/period")' which was introduced in v3.16-rc1 in 2014. That
added the following conditional which resulted in slices never being
expired.
if (cfs\_rq->runtime\_expires != cfs\_b->runtime\_expires) {
/\* extend local deadline, drift is bounded above by 2 ticks \*/
cfs\_rq->runtime\_expires += TICK\_NSEC;
Because this was broken for nearly 5 years, and has recently been fixed
and is now being noticed by many users running kubernetes
(https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577) it is my opinion
that the mechanisms around expiring runtime should be removed
altogether.
This allows quota already allocated to per-cpu run-queues to live longer
than the period boundary. This allows threads on runqueues that do not
use much CPU to continue to use their remaining slice over a longer
period of time than cpu.cfs\_period\_us. However, this helps prevent the
above condition of hitting throttling while also not fully utilizing
your cpu quota.
This theoretically allows a machine to use slightly more than its
allotted quota in some periods. This overflow would be bounded by the
remaining quota left on each per-cpu runqueueu. This is typically no
more than min\_cfs\_rq\_runtime=1ms per cpu. For CPU bound tasks this will
change nothing, as they should theoretically fully utilize all of their
quota in each period. For user-interactive tasks as described above this
provides a much better user/application experience as their cpu
utilization will more closely match the amount they requested when they
hit throttling. This means that cpu limits no longer strictly apply per
period for non-cpu bound applications, but that they are still accurate
over longer timeframes.
This greatly improves performance of high-thread-count, non-cpu bound
applications with low cfs\_quota\_us allocation on high-core-count
machines. In the case of an artificial testcase (10ms/100ms of quota on
80 CPU machine), this commit resulted in almost 30x performance
improvement, while still maintaining correct cpu quota restrictions.
That testcase is available at https://github.com/indeedeng/fibtest.

net: sched: sch\_sfb: don't call qdisc\_put() while holding tree lock
commit e3ae1f96accd21405715fe9c56b4d83bc7d96d44 upstream.
Recent changes that removed rtnl dependency from rules update path of tc
also made tcf\_block\_put() function sleeping. This function is called from
ops->destroy() of several Qdisc implementations, which in turn is called by
qdisc\_put(). Some Qdiscs call qdisc\_put() while holding sch tree spinlock,
which results sleeping-while-atomic BUG.
Steps to reproduce for sfb:
tc qdisc add dev ens1f0 handle 1: root sfb
tc qdisc add dev ens1f0 parent 1:10 handle 50: sfq perturb 10
tc qdisc change dev ens1f0 root handle 1: sfb

syzbot got a NULL dereference in bond\_update\_slave\_arr() [1],
happening after a failure to allocate bond->slave\_arr
A workqueue (bond\_slave\_arr\_handler) is supposed to retry
the allocation later, but if the slave is removed before
the workqueue had a chance to complete, bond->slave\_arr
can still be NULL.

rxrpc: Fix trace-after-put looking at the put peer record
commit 55f6c98e3674ce16038a1949c3f9ca5a9a99f289 upstream.
rxrpc\_put\_peer() calls trace\_rxrpc\_peer() after it has done the decrement
of the refcount - which looks at the debug\_id in the peer record. But
unless the refcount was reduced to zero, we no longer have the right to
look in the record and, indeed, it may be deleted by some other thread.
Fix this by getting the debug\_id out before decrementing the refcount and
then passing that into the tracepoint.
This can cause the following symptoms:

rxrpc: rxrpc\_peer needs to hold a ref on the rxrpc\_local record
commit 9ebeddef58c41bd700419cdcece24cf64ce32276 upstream.
The rxrpc\_peer record needs to hold a reference on the rxrpc\_local record
it points as the peer is used as a base to access information in the
rxrpc\_local record.
This can cause problems in \_\_rxrpc\_put\_peer(), where we need the network
namespace pointer, and in rxrpc\_send\_keepalive(), where we need to access
the UDP socket, leading to symptoms like:

rxrpc: Fix call ref leak
commit c48fc11b69e95007109206311b0187a3090591f3 upstream.
When sendmsg() finds a call to continue on with, if the call is in an
inappropriate state, it doesn't release the ref it just got on that call
before returning an error.
This causes the following symptom to show up with kasan:
BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in rxrpc\_send\_keepalive+0x8a2/0x940
net/rxrpc/output.c:635
Read of size 8 at addr ffff888064219698 by task kworker/0:3/11077
where line 635 is:
whdr.epoch = htonl(peer->local->rxnet->epoch);
The local endpoint (which cannot be pinned by the call) has been released,
but not the peer (which is pinned by the call).
Fix this by releasing the call in the error path.

The bug is that most callers of llc\_conn\_send\_pdu() assume it consumes a
reference to the skb, when actually due to commit b85ab56c3f81 ("llc:

Revert most of that commit, and instead make the few places that need
llc\_conn\_send\_pdu() to \*not\* consume a reference call skb\_get() before.

The bug is that llc\_sap\_state\_process() always takes an extra reference
to the skb, but sometimes neither llc\_sap\_next\_state() nor
llc\_sap\_state\_process() itself drops this reference.
Fix it by changing llc\_sap\_next\_state() to never consume a reference to
the skb, rather than sometimes do so and sometimes not. Then remove the
extra skb\_get() and kfree\_skb() from llc\_sap\_state\_process().

commit 40e220b4218bb3d278e5e8cc04ccdfd1c7ff8307 upstream.
Each slave interface of an B.A.T.M.A.N. IV virtual interface has an OGM
packet buffer which is initialized using data from netdevice notifier and
other rtnetlink related hooks. It is sent regularly via various slave
interfaces of the batadv virtual interface and in this process also
modified (realloced) to integrate additional state information via TVLV
containers.
It must be avoided that the worker item is executed without a common lock
with the netdevice notifier/rtnetlink helpers. Otherwise it can either
happen that half modified/freed data is sent out or functions modifying the
OGM buffer try to access already freed memory regions.

iommu/vt-d: Fix panic after kexec -p for kdump
commit 160c63f909ffbc797c0bbe23310ac1eaf2349d2f upstream.
This cures a panic on restart after a kexec operation on 5.3 and 5.4
kernels.
The underlying state of the iommu registers (iommu->flags &
VTD\_FLAG\_TRANS\_PRE\_ENABLED) on a restart results in a domain being marked as
"DEFER\_DEVICE\_DOMAIN\_INFO" that produces an Oops in identity\_mapping().

We use io\_kiocb->result == -EAGAIN as a way to know if we need to
re-submit a polled request, as -EAGAIN reporting happens out-of-line
for IO submission failures. This field is cleared when we originally
allocate the request, but it isn't reset when we retry the submission
from async context. This can cause issues where we think something
needs a re-issue, but we're really just reading stale data.

dmaengine: cppi41: Fix cppi41\_dma\_prep\_slave\_sg() when idle
commit bacdcb6675e170bb2e8d3824da220e10274f42a7 upstream.
Yegor Yefremov  reported that musb and ftdi
uart can fail for the first open of the uart unless connected using
a hub.
This is because the first dma call done by musb\_ep\_program() must wait
if cppi41 is PM runtime suspended. Otherwise musb\_ep\_program() continues
with other non-dma packets before the DMA transfer is started causing at
least ftdi uarts to fail to receive data.
Let's fix the issue by waking up cppi41 with PM runtime calls added to
cppi41\_dma\_prep\_slave\_sg() and return NULL if still idled. This way we
have musb\_ep\_program() continue with PIO until cppi41 is awake.

bam\_dma\_terminate\_all() will leak resources if any of the transactions are
committed to the hardware (present in the desc fifo), and not complete.
Since bam\_dma\_terminate\_all() does not cause the hardware to be updated,
the hardware will still operate on any previously committed transactions.
This can cause memory corruption if the memory for the transaction has been
reassigned, and will cause a sync issue between the BAM and its client(s).
Fix this by properly updating the hardware in bam\_dma\_terminate\_all().

KVM: vmx, svm: always run with EFER.NXE=1 when shadow paging is active
commit 9167ab79936206118cc60e47dcb926c3489f3bd5 upstream.
VMX already does so if the host has SMEP, in order to support the combination of
CR0.WP=1 and CR4.SMEP=1. However, it is perfectly safe to always do so, and in
fact VMX already ends up running with EFER.NXE=1 on old processors that lack the
"load EFER" controls, because it may help avoiding a slow MSR write. Removing
all the conditionals simplifies the code.
SVM does not have similar code, but it should since recent AMD processors do
support SMEP. So this patch also makes the code for the two vendors more similar
while fixing NPT=0, CR0.WP=1 and CR4.SMEP=1 on AMD processors.

virtio\_ring: fix stalls for packed rings
commit 40ce7919d8730f5936da2bc8a21b46bd07db6411 upstream.
When VIRTIO\_F\_RING\_EVENT\_IDX is negotiated, virtio devices can
use virtqueue\_enable\_cb\_delayed\_packed to reduce the number of device
interrupts. At the moment, this is the case for virtio-net when the
napi\_tx module parameter is set to false.
In this case, the virtio driver selects an event offset and expects that
the device will send a notification when rolling over the event offset
in the ring. However, if this roll-over happens before the event
suppression structure update, the notification won't be sent. To address
this race condition the driver needs to check wether the device rolled
over the offset after updating the event suppression structure.
With VIRTIO\_F\_RING\_PACKED, the virtio driver did this by reading the
flags field of the descriptor at the specified offset.
Unfortunately, checking at the event offset isn't reliable: if
descriptors are chained (e.g. when INDIRECT is off) not all descriptors
are overwritten by the device, so it's possible that the device skipped
the specific descriptor driver is checking when writing out used
descriptors. If this happens, the driver won't detect the race condition
and will incorrectly expect the device to send a notification.
For virtio-net, the result will be a TX queue stall, with the
transmission getting blocked forever.
With the packed ring, it isn't easy to find a location which is
guaranteed to change upon the roll-over, except the next device
descriptor, as described in the spec:
Writes of device and driver descriptors can generally be
reordered, but each side (driver and device) are only required to
poll (or test) a single location in memory: the next device descriptor after
the one they processed previously, in circular order.
while this might be sub-optimal, let's do exactly this for now.

entries based on a given mask")' the Qualcomm Falkor/Kryo errata 1003 is
no long applied.
The result of not applying errata 1003 is that MSM8996 runs into various
RCU stalls and fails to boot most of the times.
Give 1003 a "type" to ensure they are not filtered out in
update\_cpu\_capabilities().

arm64: Ensure VM\_WRITE|VM\_SHARED ptes are clean by default
commit aa57157be69fb599bd4c38a4b75c5aad74a60ec0 upstream.
Shared and writable mappings (\_\_S.1.) should be clean (!dirty) initially
and made dirty on a subsequent write either through the hardware DBM
(dirty bit management) mechanism or through a write page fault. A clean
pte for the arm64 kernel is one that has PTE\_RDONLY set and PTE\_DIRTY
clear.
The PAGE\_SHARED{,\_EXEC} attributes have PTE\_WRITE set (PTE\_DBM) and
PTE\_DIRTY clear. Prior to commit 73e86cb03cf2 ("arm64: Move PTE\_RDONLY
bit handling out of set\_pte\_at()"), it was the responsibility of
set\_pte\_at() to set the PTE\_RDONLY bit and mark the pte clean if the
software PTE\_DIRTY bit was not set. However, the above commit removed
the pte\_sw\_dirty() check and the subsequent setting of PTE\_RDONLY in
set\_pte\_at() while leaving the PAGE\_SHARED{,\_EXEC} definitions
unchanged. The result is that shared+writable mappings are now dirty by
default
Fix the above by explicitly setting PTE\_RDONLY in PAGE\_SHARED{,\_EXEC}.
In addition, remove the superfluous PTE\_DIRTY bit from the kernel PROT\_\*
attributes.

IB/hfi1: Avoid excessive retry for TID RDMA READ request
commit 9ed5bd7d22241ad232fd3a5be404e83eb6cadc04 upstream.
A TID RDMA READ request could be retried under one of the following
conditions:
- The RC retry timer expires;
- A later TID RDMA READ RESP packet is received before the next
expected one.
For the latter, under normal conditions, the PSN in IB space is used
for comparison. More specifically, the IB PSN in the incoming TID RDMA
READ RESP packet is compared with the last IB PSN of a given TID RDMA
READ request to determine if the request should be retried. This is
similar to the retry logic for noraml RDMA READ request.
However, if a TID RDMA READ RESP packet is lost due to congestion,
header suppresion will be disabled and each incoming packet will raise
an interrupt until the hardware flow is reloaded. Under this condition,
each packet KDETH PSN will be checked by software against r\_next\_psn
and a retry will be requested if the packet KDETH PSN is later than
r\_next\_psn. Since each TID RDMA READ segment could have up to 64
packets and each TID RDMA READ request could have many segments, we
could make far more retries under such conditions, and thus leading to
RETRY\_EXC\_ERR status.
This patch fixes the issue by removing the retry when the incoming
packet KDETH PSN is later than r\_next\_psn. Instead, it resorts to
RC timer and normal IB PSN comparison for any request retry.

ARC: perf: Accommodate big-endian CPU
commit 5effc09c4907901f0e71e68e5f2e14211d9a203f upstream.
8-letter strings representing ARC perf events are stores in two
32-bit registers as ASCII characters like that: "IJMP", "IALL", "IJMPTAK" etc.
And the same order of bytes in the word is used regardless CPU endianness.
Which means in case of big-endian CPU core we need to swap bytes to get
the same order as if it was on little-endian CPU.
Otherwise we're seeing the following error message on boot:
------------------------->8----------------------
ARC perf : 8 counters (32 bits), 40 conditions, [overflow IRQ support]

---[ end trace a75fb9a9837bd1ec ]---
------------------------->8----------------------
What happens here we're trying to register more than one raw perf event
with the same name "PMJI". Why? Because ARC perf events are 4 to 8 letters
and encoded into two 32-bit words. In this particular case we deal with 2
events:
\* "IJMP\_\_\_\_" which counts all jump & branch instructions
\* "IJMPC\_\_\_" which counts only conditional jumps & branches
Those strings are split in two 32-bit words this way "IJMP" + "\_\_\_\_" &
"IJMP" + "C\_\_\_" correspondingly. Now if we read them swapped due to CPU core
being big-endian then we read "PMJI" + "\_\_\_\_" & "PMJI" + "\_\_\_C".
And since we interpret read array of ASCII letters as a null-terminated string
on big-endian CPU we end up with 2 events of the same name "PMJI".

s390/idle: fix cpu idle time calculation
commit 3d7efa4edd07be5c5c3ffa95ba63e97e070e1f3f upstream.
The idle time reported in /proc/stat sometimes incorrectly contains
huge values on s390. This is caused by a bug in arch\_cpu\_idle\_time().
The kernel tries to figure out when a different cpu entered idle by
accessing its per-cpu data structure. There is an ordering problem: if
the remote cpu has an idle\_enter value which is not zero, and an
idle\_exit value which is zero, it is assumed it is idle since
"now". The "now" timestamp however is taken before the idle\_enter
value is read.
Which in turn means that "now" can be smaller than idle\_enter of the
remote cpu. Unconditionally subtracting idle\_enter from "now" can thus
lead to a negative value (aka large unsigned value).
Fix this by moving the get\_tod\_clock() invocation out of the
loop. While at it also make the code a bit more readable.
A similar bug also exists for show\_idle\_time(). Fix this is as well.

s390/cmm: fix information leak in cmm\_timeout\_handler()
commit b8e51a6a9db94bc1fb18ae831b3dab106b5a4b5f upstream.
The problem is that we were putting the NUL terminator too far:
buf[sizeof(buf) - 1] = '\0';
If the user input isn't NUL terminated and they haven't initialized the
whole buffer then it leads to an info leak. The NUL terminator should
be:
buf[len - 1] = '\0';

s390/unwind: fix mixing regs and sp
commit a1d863ac3e1085e1fea9caafd87252d08731de2e upstream.
unwind\_for\_each\_frame stops after the first frame if regs->gprs[15] <=
sp.
The reason is that in case regs are specified, the first frame should be
regs->psw.addr and the second frame should be sp->gprs[8]. However,
currently the second frame is regs->gprs[15], which confuses
outside\_of\_stack().
Fix by introducing a flag to distinguish this special case from
unwinding the interrupt handler, for which the current behavior is
appropriate.

HID: logitech-hidpp: rework device validation
commit 905d754c53a522aacf806ea1d3e7c929148c1910 upstream.
G920 device only advertises REPORT\_ID\_HIDPP\_LONG and
REPORT\_ID\_HIDPP\_VERY\_LONG in its HID report descriptor, so querying
for REPORT\_ID\_HIDPP\_SHORT with optional=false will always fail and
prevent G920 to be recognized as a valid HID++ device.
To fix this and improve some other aspects, modify
hidpp\_validate\_device() as follows:
- Inline the code of hidpp\_validate\_report() to simplify
distingushing between non-present and invalid report descriptors
- Drop the check for id >= HID\_MAX\_IDS || id < 0 since all of our
IDs are static and known to satisfy that at compile time
- Change the algorithms to check all possible report
types (including very long report) and deem the device as a valid
HID++ device if it supports at least one
- Treat invalid report length as a hard stop for the validation
algorithm, meaning that if any of the supported reports has
invalid length we assume the worst and treat the device as a
generic HID device.
- Fold initialization of hidpp->very\_long\_report\_length into
hidpp\_validate\_device() since it already fetches very long report
length and validates its value

HID: logitech-hidpp: split g920\_get\_config()
commit abdd3d0b344fdf72a4904d09b97bc964d74c4419 upstream.
Original version of g920\_get\_config() contained two kind of actions:
1. Device specific communication to query/set some parameters
which requires active communication channel with the device,
or, put in other way, for the call to be sandwiched between
hid\_device\_io\_start() and hid\_device\_io\_stop().
2. Input subsystem specific FF controller initialization which, in
order to access a valid 'struct hid\_input' via
'hid->inputs.next', requires claimed hidinput which means be
executed after the call to hid\_hw\_start() with connect\_mask
containing HID\_CONNECT\_HIDINPUT.
Location of g920\_get\_config() can only fulfill requirements for #1 and
not #2, which might result in following backtrace:

To solve this issue:
1. Split g920\_get\_config() such that all of the device specific
communication remains a part of the function and input subsystem
initialization bits go to hidpp\_ff\_init()
2. Move call to hidpp\_ff\_init() from being a part of
g920\_get\_config() to be the last step of .probe(), right after a
call to hid\_hw\_start() with connect\_mask containing
HID\_CONNECT\_HIDINPUT.

HID: fix error message in hid\_open\_report()
commit b3a81c777dcb093020680490ab970d85e2f6f04f upstream.
On HID report descriptor parsing error the code displays bogus
pointer instead of error offset (subtracts start=NULL from end).
Make the message more useful by displaying correct error offset
and include total buffer size for reference.
This was carried over from ancient times - "Fixed" commit just

HID: Fix assumption that devices have inputs
commit d9d4b1e46d9543a82c23f6df03f4ad697dab361b upstream.
The syzbot fuzzer found a slab-out-of-bounds write bug in the hid-gaff
driver. The problem is caused by the driver's assumption that the
device must have an input report. While this will be true for all
normal HID input devices, a suitably malicious device can violate the
assumption.
The same assumption is present in over a dozen other HID drivers.
This patch fixes them by checking that the list of hid\_inputs for the
hid\_device is nonempty before allowing it to be used.

xhci: Fix use-after-free regression in xhci clear hub TT implementation
commit 18b74067ac78a2dea65783314c13df98a53d071c upstream.
commit ef513be0a905 ("usb: xhci: Add Clear\_TT\_Buffer") schedules work
to clear TT buffer, but causes a use-after-free regression at the same time
Make sure hub\_tt\_work finishes before endpoint is disabled, otherwise
the work will dereference already freed endpoint and device related
pointers.
This was triggered when usb core failed to read the configuration
descriptor of a FS/LS device during enumeration.
xhci driver queued clear\_tt\_work while usb core freed and reallocated
a new device for the next enumeration attempt.
EHCI driver implents ehci\_endpoint\_disable() that makes sure
clear\_tt\_work has finished before it returns, but xhci lacks this support.
usb core will call hcd->driver->endpoint\_disable() callback before
disabling endpoints, so we want this in xhci as well.
The added xhci\_endpoint\_disable() is based on ehci\_endpoint\_disable()

usb: xhci: fix Immediate Data Transfer endianness
commit bfa3dbb343f664573292afb9e44f9abeb81a19de upstream.
The arguments to queue\_trb are always byteswapped to LE for placement in

bytes copied out of transfer\_buffer are already in the correct order.
Add a complementary byteswap so the bytes end up in the ring correctly.

USB: ldusb: fix ring-buffer locking
commit d98ee2a19c3334e9343df3ce254b496f1fc428eb upstream.
The custom ring-buffer implementation was merged without any locking or
explicit memory barriers, but a spinlock was later added by commit
9d33efd9a791 ("USB: ldusb bugfix").
The lock did not cover the update of the tail index once the entry had
been processed, something which could lead to memory corruption on
weakly ordered architectures or due to compiler optimisations.
Specifically, a completion handler running on another CPU might observe
the incremented tail index and update the entry before ld\_usb\_read() is
done with it.

usb-storage: Revert commit 747668dbc061 ("usb-storage: Set virt\_boundary\_mask to avoid SG overflows")
commit 9a976949613132977098fc49510b46fa8678d864 upstream.
Commit 747668dbc061 ("usb-storage: Set virt\_boundary\_mask to avoid SG
overflows") attempted to solve a problem involving scatter-gather I/O
and USB/IP by setting the virt\_boundary\_mask for mass-storage devices.
However, it now turns out that this interacts badly with commit
09324d32d2a0 ("block: force an unlimited segment size on queues with a
virt boundary"), which was added later. A typical error message is:
ehci-pci 0000:00:13.2: swiotlb buffer is full (sz: 327680 bytes),
total 32768 (slots), used 97 (slots)
There is no longer any reason to keep the virt\_boundary\_mask setting
for usb-storage. It was needed in the first place only for handling
devices with a block size smaller than the maxpacket size and where
the host controller was not capable of fully general scatter-gather
operation (that is, able to merge two SG segments into a single USB
packet). But:
High-speed or slower connections never use a bulk maxpacket
value larger than 512;
The SCSI layer does not handle block devices with a block size
smaller than 512 bytes;
All the host controllers capable of SuperSpeed operation can
handle fully general SG;
Since commit ea44d190764b ("usbip: Implement SG support to
vhci-hcd and stub driver") was merged, the USB/IP driver can
also handle SG.
Therefore all supported device/controller combinations should be okay
with no need for any special virt\_boundary\_mask. So in order to fix
the swiotlb problem, this patch reverts commit 747668dbc061.

USB: gadget: Reject endpoints with 0 maxpacket value
commit 54f83b8c8ea9b22082a496deadf90447a326954e upstream.
Endpoints with a maxpacket length of 0 are probably useless. They
can't transfer any data, and it's not at all unlikely that a UDC will
crash or hang when trying to handle a non-zero-length usb\_request for
such an endpoint. Indeed, dummy-hcd gets a divide error when trying
to calculate the remainder of a transfer length by the maxpacket
value, as discovered by the syzbot fuzzer.
Currently the gadget core does not check for endpoints having a
maxpacket value of 0. This patch adds a check to usb\_ep\_enable(),
preventing such endpoints from being used.
As far as I know, none of the gadget drivers in the kernel tries to
create an endpoint with maxpacket = 0, but until now there has been
nothing to prevent userspace programs under gadgetfs or configfs from
doing it.

ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix 2 front mics of codec 0x623
commit 8a6c55d0f883e9a7e7c91841434f3b6bbf932bb2 upstream.
These 2 ThinkCentres installed a new realtek codec ID 0x623,
it has 2 front mics with the same location on pin 0x18 and 0x19.
Apply fixup ALC283\_FIXUP\_HEADSET\_MIC to change 1 front mic
location to right, then pulseaudio can handle them.
One "Front Mic" and one "Mic" will be shown, and audio output works
fine.

ALSA: timer: Fix mutex deadlock at releasing card
commit a39331867335d4a94b6165e306265c9e24aca073 upstream.
When a card is disconnected while in use, the system waits until all
opened files are closed then releases the card. This is done via
put\_device() of the card device in each device release code.
The recently reported mutex deadlock bug happens in this code path;
snd\_timer\_close() for the timer device deals with the global
register\_mutex and it calls put\_device() there. When this timer
device is the last one, the card gets freed and it eventually calls
snd\_timer\_free(), which has again the protection with the global
register\_mutex -- boom.
Basically put\_device() call itself is race-free, so a relative simple
workaround is to move this put\_device() call out of the mutex. For
achieving that, in this patch, snd\_timer\_close\_locked() got a new
argument to store the card device pointer in return, and each caller
invokes put\_device() with the returned object after the mutex unlock.

ALSA: bebob: Fix prototype of helper function to return negative value
commit f2bbdbcb075f3977a53da3bdcb7cd460bc8ae5f2 upstream.
A helper function of ALSA bebob driver returns negative value in a

fuse: flush dirty data/metadata before non-truncate setattr
commit b24e7598db62386a95a3c8b9c75630c5d56fe077 upstream.
If writeback cache is enabled, then writes might get reordered with
chmod/chown/utimes. The problem with this is that performing the write in
the fuse daemon might itself change some of these attributes. In such case
the following sequence of operations will result in file ending up with the
wrong mode, for example:
int fd = open ("suid", O\_WRONLY|O\_CREAT|O\_EXCL);
write (fd, "1", 1);
fchown (fd, 0, 0);
fchmod (fd, 04755);
close (fd);
This patch fixes this by flushing pending writes before performing
chown/chmod/utimes.

ath6kl: fix a NULL-ptr-deref bug in ath6kl\_usb\_alloc\_urb\_from\_pipe()
[ Upstream commit 39d170b3cb62ba98567f5c4f40c27b5864b304e5 ]
The `ar\_usb` field of `ath6kl\_usb\_pipe\_usb\_pipe` objects
are initialized to point to the containing `ath6kl\_usb` object
according to endpoint descriptors read from the device side, as shown
below in `ath6kl\_usb\_setup\_pipe\_resources`:
for (i = 0; i < iface\_desc->desc.bNumEndpoints; ++i) {
endpoint = &iface\_desc->endpoint[i].desc;
// get the address from endpoint descriptor
pipe\_num = ath6kl\_usb\_get\_logical\_pipe\_num(ar\_usb,
endpoint->bEndpointAddress,
&urbcount);
......
// select the pipe object
pipe = &ar\_usb->pipes[pipe\_num];
// initialize the ar\_usb field
pipe->ar\_usb = ar\_usb;
}
The driver assumes that the addresses reported in endpoint
descriptors from device side to be complete. If a device is
malicious and does not report complete addresses, it may trigger
NULL-ptr-deref `ath6kl\_usb\_alloc\_urb\_from\_pipe` and
`ath6kl\_usb\_free\_urb\_to\_pipe`.
This patch fixes the bug by preventing potential NULL-ptr-deref
(CVE-2019-15098).

perf/aux: Fix tracking of auxiliary trace buffer allocation
[ Upstream commit 5e6c3c7b1ec217c1c4c95d9148182302b9969b97 ]
The following commit from the v5.4 merge window:
d44248a41337 ("perf/core: Rework memory accounting in perf\_mmap()")
... breaks auxiliary trace buffer tracking.
If I run command 'perf record -e rbd000' to record samples and saving
them in the \*\*auxiliary\*\* trace buffer then the value of 'locked\_vm' becomes
negative after all trace buffers have been allocated and released:
During allocation the values increase:
[52.250027] perf\_mmap user->locked\_vm:0x87 pinned\_vm:0x0 ret:0

[52.254263] perf\_mmap user->locked\_vm:0x408 pinned\_vm:0x80e ret:0
The value of user->locked\_vm increases to a limit then the memory
is tracked by pinned\_vm.
During deallocation the size is subtracted from pinned\_vm until
it hits a limit. Then a larger value is subtracted from locked\_vm
leading to a large number (because of type unsigned):

[64.267952] perf\_mmap\_close mmap\_user->locked\_vm:0x408 pinned\_vm:0x406
[64.268883] perf\_mmap\_close mmap\_user->locked\_vm:0x307 pinned\_vm:0x406
[64.269117] perf\_mmap\_close mmap\_user->locked\_vm:0x206 pinned\_vm:0x406

[64.270374] perf\_mmap\_close mmap\_user->locked\_vm:0xfffffffffffffe84 pinned\_vm:0x101
[64.270628] perf\_mmap\_close mmap\_user->locked\_vm:0xfffffffffffffe04 pinned\_vm:0x0
This value sticks for the user until system is rebooted, causing
follow-on system calls using locked\_vm resource limit to fail.
Note: There is no issue using the normal trace buffer.
In fact the issue is in perf\_mmap\_close(). During allocation auxiliary
trace buffer memory is either traced as 'extra' and added to 'pinned\_vm'
or trace as 'user\_extra' and added to 'locked\_vm'. This applies for
normal trace buffers and auxiliary trace buffer.
However in function perf\_mmap\_close() all auxiliary trace buffer is
subtraced from 'locked\_vm' and never from 'pinned\_vm'. This breaks the
ballance.

It caught the process in the middle of trace\_access\_unlock(). There is
no loop. So, it must be looping in the caller tracing\_read\_pipe()
via the "waitagain" label.
Crashdump analyze uncovered that iter->seq was completely zeroed
at this point, including iter->seq.seq.size. It means that
print\_trace\_line() was never able to print anything and
there was no forward progress.
The culprit seems to be in the code:
/\* reset all but tr, trace, and overruns \*/
memset(&iter->seq, 0,
sizeof(struct trace\_iterator) -
offsetof(struct trace\_iterator, seq));
It was added by the commit 53d0aa773053ab182877 ("ftrace:
add logic to record overruns"). It was v2.6.27-rc1.
It was the time when iter->seq looked like:
struct trace\_seq {
unsigned char buffer[PAGE\_SIZE];
unsigned int len;
};
There was no "size" variable and zeroing was perfectly fine.
The solution is to reinitialize the structure after or without
zeroing.

s390/uaccess: avoid (false positive) compiler warnings
[ Upstream commit 062795fcdcb2d22822fb42644b1d76a8ad8439b3 ]
Depending on inlining decisions by the compiler, \_\_get/put\_user\_fn
might become out of line. Then the compiler is no longer able to tell
that size can only be 1,2,4 or 8 due to the check in \_\_get/put\_user
resulting in false positives like
./arch/s390/include/asm/uaccess.h: In function ‘\_\_put\_user\_fn’:

SUNRPC: fix race to sk\_err after xs\_error\_report
[ Upstream commit af84537dbd1b39505d1f3d8023029b4a59666513 ]
Since commit 4f8943f80883 ("SUNRPC: Replace direct task wakeups from
softirq context") there has been a race to the value of the sk\_err if both
XPRT\_SOCK\_WAKE\_ERROR and XPRT\_SOCK\_WAKE\_DISCONNECT are set. In that case,
we may end up losing the sk\_err value that existed when xs\_error\_report was
called.
Fix this by reverting to the previous behavior: instead of using SO\_ERROR
to retrieve the value at a later time (which might also return sk\_err\_soft),
copy the sk\_err value onto struct sock\_xprt, and use that value to wake
pending tasks.

s390/cio: fix virtio-ccw DMA without PV
[ Upstream commit 05668e1d74b84c53fbe0f28565e4c9502a6b8a67 ]
Commit 37db8985b211 ("s390/cio: add basic protected virtualization
support") breaks virtio-ccw devices with VIRTIO\_F\_IOMMU\_PLATFORM for non
Protected Virtualization (PV) guests. The problem is that the dma\_mask
of the ccw device, which is used by virtio core, gets changed from 64 to
31 bit, because some of the DMA allocations do require 31 bit
addressable memory. For PV the only drawback is that some of the virtio
structures must end up in ZONE\_DMA because we have the bounce the
buffers mapped via DMA API anyway.
But for non PV guests we have a problem: because of the 31 bit mask
guests bigger than 2G are likely to try bouncing buffers. The swiotlb
however is only initialized for PV guests, because we don't want to
bounce anything for non PV guests. The first such map kills the guest.
Since the DMA API won't allow us to specify for each allocation whether
we need memory from ZONE\_DMA (31 bit addressable) or any DMA capable
memory will do, let us use coherent\_dma\_mask (which is used for
allocations) to force allocating form ZONE\_DMA while changing dma\_mask
to DMA\_BIT\_MASK(64) so that at least the streaming API will regard
the whole memory DMA capable.

perf/x86/amd: Change/fix NMI latency mitigation to use a timestamp
[ Upstream commit df4d29732fdad43a51284f826bec3e6ded177540 ]
It turns out that the NMI latency workaround from commit:
6d3edaae16c6 ("x86/perf/amd: Resolve NMI latency issues for active PMCs")
ends up being too conservative and results in the perf NMI handler claiming
NMIs too easily on AMD hardware when the NMI watchdog is active.
This has an impact, for example, on the hpwdt (HPE watchdog timer) module.
This module can produce an NMI that is used to reset the system. It
registers an NMI handler for the NMI\_UNKNOWN type and relies on the fact
that nothing has claimed an NMI so that its handler will be invoked when
the watchdog device produces an NMI. After the referenced commit, the
hpwdt module is unable to process its generated NMI if the NMI watchdog is
active, because the current NMI latency mitigation results in the NMI
being claimed by the perf NMI handler.
Update the AMD perf NMI latency mitigation workaround to, instead, use a
window of time. Whenever a PMC is handled in the perf NMI handler, set a
timestamp which will act as a perf NMI window. Any NMIs arriving within
that window will be claimed by perf. Anything outside that window will
not be claimed by perf. The value for the NMI window is set to 100 msecs.
This is a conservative value that easily covers any NMI latency in the
hardware. While this still results in a window in which the hpwdt module
will not receive its NMI, the window is now much, much smaller.

perf/core: Fix corner case in perf\_rotate\_context()
[ Upstream commit 7fa343b7fdc4f351de4e3f28d5c285937dd1f42f ]
In perf\_rotate\_context(), when the first cpu flexible event fail to
schedule, cpu\_rotate is 1, while cpu\_event is NULL. Since cpu\_event is
NULL, perf\_rotate\_context will \_NOT\_ call cpu\_ctx\_sched\_out(), thus
cpuctx->ctx.is\_active will have EVENT\_FLEXIBLE set. Then, the next
perf\_event\_sched\_in() will skip all cpu flexible events because of the
EVENT\_FLEXIBLE bit.
In the next call of perf\_rotate\_context(), cpu\_rotate stays 1, and
cpu\_event stays NULL, so this process repeats. The end result is, flexible
events on this cpu will not be scheduled (until another event being added
to the cpuctx).
Here is an easy repro of this issue. On Intel CPUs, where ref-cycles
could only use one counter, run one pinned event for ref-cycles, one
flexible event for ref-cycles, and one flexible event for cycles. The
flexible ref-cycles is never scheduled, which is expected. However,
because of this issue, the cycles event is never scheduled either.
$ perf stat -e ref-cycles:D,ref-cycles,cycles -C 5 -I 1000
time counts unit events
1.000152973 15,412,480 ref-cycles:D
1.000152973  ref-cycles (0.00%)
1.000152973  cycles (0.00%)
2.000486957 18,263,120 ref-cycles:D
2.000486957  ref-cycles (0.00%)
2.000486957  cycles (0.00%)
To fix this, when the flexible\_active list is empty, try rotate the
first event in the flexible\_groups. Also, rename ctx\_first\_active() to
ctx\_event\_to\_rotate(), which is more accurate.

sched/vtime: Fix guest/system mis-accounting on task switch
[ Upstream commit 68e7a4d66b0ce04bf18ff2ffded5596ab3618585 ]
vtime\_account\_system() assumes that the target task to account cputime
to is always the current task. This is most often true indeed except on
task switch where we call:
vtime\_common\_task\_switch(prev)
vtime\_account\_system(prev)
Here prev is the scheduling-out task where we account the cputime to. It
doesn't match current that is already the scheduling-in task at this
stage of the context switch.
So we end up checking the wrong task flags to determine if we are
accounting guest or system time to the previous task.
As a result the wrong task is used to check if the target is running in
guest mode. We may then spuriously account or leak either system or
guest time on task switch.
Fix this assumption and also turn vtime\_guest\_enter/exit() to use the
task passed in parameter as well to avoid future similar issues.

sched/fair: Scale bandwidth quota and period without losing quota/period ratio precision
[ Upstream commit 4929a4e6faa0f13289a67cae98139e727f0d4a97 ]
The quota/period ratio is used to ensure a child task group won't get
more bandwidth than the parent task group, and is calculated as:
normalized\_cfs\_quota() = [(quota\_us << 20) / period\_us]
If the quota/period ratio was changed during this scaling due to
precision loss, it will cause inconsistency between parent and child
task groups.
See below example:
A userspace container manager (kubelet) does three operations:
1) Create a parent cgroup, set quota to 1,000us and period to 10,000us.
2) Create a few children cgroups.
3) Set quota to 1,000us and period to 10,000us on a child cgroup.
These operations are expected to succeed. However, if the scaling of
147/128 happens before step 3, quota and period of the parent cgroup
will be changed:
new\_quota: 1148437ns, 1148us
new\_period: 11484375ns, 11484us
And when step 3 comes in, the ratio of the child cgroup will be
104857, which will be larger than the parent cgroup ratio (104821),
and will fail.
Scaling them by a factor of 2 will fix the problem.

btrfs: silence maybe-uninitialized warning in clone\_range
[ Upstream commit 431d39887d6273d6d84edf3c2eab09f4200e788a ]
GCC throws warning message as below:
‘clone\_src\_i\_size’ may be used uninitialized in this function
[-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
#define IS\_ALIGNED(x, a) (((x) & ((typeof(x))(a) - 1)) == 0)
^
fs/btrfs/send.c:5088:6: note: ‘clone\_src\_i\_size’ was declared here
u64 clone\_src\_i\_size;
^
The clone\_src\_i\_size is only used as call-by-reference
in a call to get\_inode\_info().
Silence the warning by initializing clone\_src\_i\_size to 0.
Note that the warning is a false positive and reported by older versions
of GCC (eg. 7.x) but not eg 9.x. As there have been numerous people, the
patch is applied. Setting clone\_src\_i\_size to 0 does not otherwise make
sense and would not do any action in case the code changes in the future.

ocfs2: clear zero in unaligned direct IO
[ Upstream commit 7a243c82ea527cd1da47381ad9cd646844f3b693 ]
Unused portion of a part-written fs-block-sized block is not set to zero
in unaligned append direct write.This can lead to serious data
inconsistencies.
Ocfs2 manage disk with cluster size(for example, 1M), part-written in
one cluster will change the cluster state from UN-WRITTEN to WRITTEN,
VFS(function dio\_zero\_block) doesn't do the cleaning because bh's state
is not set to NEW in function ocfs2\_dio\_wr\_get\_block when we write a
WRITTEN cluster. For example, the cluster size is 1M, file size is 8k
and we direct write from 14k to 15k, then 12k~14k and 15k~16k will
contain dirty data.
We have to deal with two cases:
1.The starting position of direct write is outside the file.
2.The starting position of direct write is located in the file.
We need set bh's state to NEW in the first case. In the second case, we
need mapped twice because bh's state of area out file should be set to
NEW while area in file not.

x86/xen: Return from panic notifier
[ Upstream commit c6875f3aacf2a5a913205accddabf0bfb75cac76 ]
Currently execution of panic() continues until Xen's panic notifier
(xen\_panic\_event()) is called at which point we make a hypercall that
never returns.
This means that any notifier that is supposed to be called later as
well as significant part of panic() code (such as pstore writes from
kmsg\_dump()) is never executed.
There is no reason for xen\_panic\_event() to be this last point in
execution since panic()'s emergency\_restart() will call into
xen\_emergency\_restart() from where we can perform our hypercall.
Nevertheless, we will provide xen\_legacy\_crash boot option that will
preserve original behavior during crash. This option could be used,
for example, if running kernel dumper (which happens after panic
notifiers) is undesirable.

riscv: Correct the handling of unexpected ebreak in do\_trap\_break()
[ Upstream commit 8bb0daef64e5a92db63ad1d3bbf9e280a7b3612a ]
For the kernel space, all ebreak instructions are determined at compile
time because the kernel space debugging module is currently unsupported.
Hence, it should be treated as a bug if an ebreak instruction which does
not belong to BUG\_TRAP\_TYPE\_WARN or BUG\_TRAP\_TYPE\_BUG is executed in
kernel space. For the userspace, debugging module or user problem may
intentionally insert an ebreak instruction to trigger a SIGTRAP signal.
To approach the above two situations, the do\_trap\_break() will direct
the BUG\_TRAP\_TYPE\_NONE ebreak exception issued in kernel space to die()
and will send a SIGTRAP to the trapped process only when the ebreak is
in userspace.

efi/x86: Do not clean dummy variable in kexec path
[ Upstream commit 2ecb7402cfc7f22764e7bbc80790e66eadb20560 ]
kexec reboot fails randomly in UEFI based KVM guest. The firmware
just resets while calling efi\_delete\_dummy\_variable(); Unfortunately
I don't know how to debug the firmware, it is also possible a potential
problem on real hardware as well although nobody reproduced it.
The intention of the efi\_delete\_dummy\_variable is to trigger garbage collection
when entering virtual mode. But SetVirtualAddressMap can only run once
for each physical reboot, thus kexec\_enter\_virtual\_mode() is not necessarily
a good place to clean a dummy object.
Drop the efi\_delete\_dummy\_variable so that kexec reboot can work.

The .config file and the generated include/config/auto.conf can
end up out of sync after a set of commands since
CONFIG\_CROSS\_COMPILE\_COMPAT\_VDSO is not updated correctly.
The sequence can be reproduced as follows:
$ make ARCH=arm64 CROSS\_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- defconfig
[...]
$ make ARCH=arm64 CROSS\_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- menuconfig
[set CONFIG\_CROSS\_COMPILE\_COMPAT\_VDSO="arm-linux-gnueabihf-"]
$ make ARCH=arm64 CROSS\_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-
Which results in:
arch/arm64/Makefile:62: CROSS\_COMPILE\_COMPAT not defined or empty,
the compat vDSO will not be built
even though the compat vDSO has been built:
$ file arch/arm64/kernel/vdso32/vdso.so
arch/arm64/kernel/vdso32/vdso.so: ELF 32-bit LSB pie executable, ARM,
EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked,
BuildID[sha1]=c67f6c786f2d2d6f86c71f708595594aa25247f6, stripped
A similar case that involves changing the configuration parameter
multiple times can be reconducted to the same family of problems.
Remove the use of CONFIG\_CROSS\_COMPILE\_COMPAT\_VDSO altogether and
instead rely on the cross-compiler prefix coming from the environment
via CROSS\_COMPILE\_COMPAT, much like we do for the rest of the kernel.

RDMA/mlx5: Add missing synchronize\_srcu() for MW cases
[ Upstream commit 0417791536ae1e28d7f0418f1d20048ec4d3c6cf ]
While MR uses live as the SRCU 'update', the MW case uses the xarray
directly, xa\_erase() causes the MW to become inaccessible to the pagefault
thread.
Thus whenever a MW is removed from the xarray we must synchronize\_srcu()
before freeing it.

RDMA/mlx5: Order num\_pending\_prefetch properly with synchronize\_srcu
[ Upstream commit aa116b810ac9077a263ed8679fb4d595f180e0eb ]
During destroy setting live = 0 and then synchronize\_srcu() prevents
num\_pending\_prefetch from incrementing, and also, ensures that all work
holding that count is queued on the WQ. Testing before causes races of the
form:
CPU0 CPU1
dereg\_mr()
mlx5\_ib\_advise\_mr\_prefetch()
srcu\_read\_lock()
num\_pending\_prefetch\_inc()
if (!live)
live = 0
atomic\_read() == 0
// skip flush\_workqueue()
atomic\_inc()
queue\_work();
srcu\_read\_unlock()
WARN\_ON(atomic\_read()) // Fails
Swap the order so that the synchronize\_srcu() prevents this.

RDMA/cm: Fix memory leak in cm\_add/remove\_one
[ Upstream commit 94635c36f3854934a46d9e812e028d4721bbb0e6 ]
In the process of moving the debug counters sysfs entries, the commit
mentioned below eliminated the cm\_infiniband sysfs directory.
This sysfs directory was tied to the cm\_port object allocated in procedure
cm\_add\_one().
Before the commit below, this cm\_port object was freed via a call to
kobject\_put(port->kobj) in procedure cm\_remove\_port\_fs().
Since port no longer uses its kobj, kobject\_put(port->kobj) was eliminated.
This, however, meant that kfree was never called for the cm\_port buffers.
Fix this by adding explicit kfree(port) calls to functions cm\_add\_one()
and cm\_remove\_one().
Note: the kfree call in the first chunk below (in the cm\_add\_one error
flow) fixes an old, undetected memory leak.

arm64: ftrace: Ensure synchronisation in PLT setup for Neoverse-N1 #1542419
[ Upstream commit dd8a1f13488438c6c220b7cafa500baaf21a6e53 ]
CPUs affected by Neoverse-N1 #1542419 may execute a stale instruction if
it was recently modified. The affected sequence requires freshly written
instructions to be executable before a branch to them is updated.
There are very few places in the kernel that modify executable text,
all but one come with sufficient synchronisation:
\* The module loader's flush\_module\_icache() calls flush\_icache\_range(),
which does a kick\_all\_cpus\_sync()
\* bpf\_int\_jit\_compile() calls flush\_icache\_range().
\* Kprobes calls aarch64\_insn\_patch\_text(), which does its work in
stop\_machine().
\* static keys and ftrace both patch between nops and branches to
existing kernel code (not generated code).
The affected sequence is the interaction between ftrace and modules.
The module PLT is cleaned using \_\_flush\_icache\_range() as the trampoline
shouldn't be executable until we update the branch to it.
Drop the double-underscore so that this path runs kick\_all\_cpus\_sync()
too.

arm64: Fix incorrect irqflag restore for priority masking for compat

Commit bd82d4bd2188 ("arm64: Fix incorrect irqflag restore for priority
masking") added a macro to the entry.S call paths that leave the
PSTATE.I bit set. This tells the pPNMI masking logic that interrupts
are masked by the CPU, not by the PMR. This value is read back by
local\_daif\_save().
Commit bd82d4bd2188 added this call to el0\_svc, as el0\_svc\_handler
is called with interrupts masked. el0\_svc\_compat was missed, but should
be covered in the same way as both of these paths end up in
el0\_svc\_common(), which expects to unmask interrupts.

The HWCAP framework will detect a new capability based on the sanitized
version of the ID registers.
Sanitization is based on a whitelist, so any field not described will end
up to be zeroed.
At the moment, ID\_AA64ISAR1\_EL1.FRINTTS is not described in
ftr\_id\_aa64isar1. This means the field will be zeroed and therefore the
userspace will not be able to see the HWCAP even if the hardware
supports the feature.
This can be fixed by describing the field in ftr\_id\_aa64isar1.

selftests/kselftest/runner.sh: Add 45 second timeout per test
[ Upstream commit 852c8cbf34d3b3130a05c38064dd98614f97d3a8 ]
Commit a745f7af3cbd ("selftests/harness: Add 30 second timeout per
test") solves the problem of kselftest\_harness.h-using binary tests
possibly hanging forever. However, scripts and other binaries can still
hang forever. This adds a global timeout to each test script run.
To make this configurable (e.g. as needed in the "rtc" test case),
include a new per-test-directory "settings" file (similar to "config")
that can contain kselftest-specific settings. The first recognized field
is "timeout".
Additionally, this splits the reporting for timeouts into a specific
"TIMEOUT" not-ok (and adds exit code reporting in the remaining case).

In siw\_qp\_llp\_write\_space(), 'sock' members should be accessed with

[ Upstream commit 955c1532a34305f2f780b47f0c40cc7c65500810 ]
If kzalloc() returns NULL, the error path doesn't stop the flow of
control from entering rtw\_hal\_read\_chip\_version() which dereferences the
null pointer. Fix this by adding a 'goto' to the error path to more
gracefully handle the issue and avoid proceeding with initialization
steps that we're no longer prepared to handle.
Also update the debug message to be more consistent with the other debug
messages in this function.

perf script brstackinsn: Fix recovery from LBR/binary mismatch
[ Upstream commit e98df280bc2a499fd41d7f9e2d6733884de69902 ]
When the LBR data and the instructions in a binary do not match the loop
printing instructions could get confused and print a long stream of
bogus  instructions.
The problem was that if the instruction decoder cannot decode an
instruction it ilen wasn't initialized, so the loop going through the
basic block would continue with the previous value.
Harden the code to avoid such problems:
- Make sure ilen is always freshly initialized and is 0 for bad
instructions.
- Do not overrun the code buffer while printing instructions
- Print a warning message if the final jump is not on an instruction
boundary.

perf map: Fix overlapped map handling
[ Upstream commit ee212d6ea20887c0ef352be8563ca13dbf965906 ]
Whenever an mmap/mmap2 event occurs, the map tree must be updated to add a new
entry. If a new map overlaps a previous map, the overlapped section of the
previous map is effectively unmapped, but the non-overlapping sections are
still valid.
maps\_\_fixup\_overlappings() is responsible for creating any new map entries from
the previously overlapped map. It optionally creates a before and an after map.
When creating the after map the existing code failed to adjust the map.pgoff.
This meant the new after map would incorrectly calculate the file offset
for the ip. This results in incorrect symbol name resolution for any ip in the
after region.
Make maps\_\_fixup\_overlappings() correctly populate map.pgoff.
Add an assert that new mapping matches old mapping at the beginning of
the after map.

btrfs: qgroup: Always free PREALLOC META reserve in btrfs\_delalloc\_release\_extents()
[ Upstream commit 8702ba9396bf7bbae2ab93c94acd4bd37cfa4f09 ]
[Background]
Btrfs qgroup uses two types of reserved space for METADATA space,
PERTRANS and PREALLOC.
PERTRANS is metadata space reserved for each transaction started by
btrfs\_start\_transaction().
While PREALLOC is for delalloc, where we reserve space before joining a
transaction, and finally it will be converted to PERTRANS after the
writeback is done.
[Inconsistency]
However there is inconsistency in how we handle PREALLOC metadata space.
The most obvious one is:
In btrfs\_buffered\_write():
btrfs\_delalloc\_release\_extents(BTRFS\_I(inode), reserve\_bytes, true);
We always free qgroup PREALLOC meta space.
While in btrfs\_truncate\_block():
btrfs\_delalloc\_release\_extents(BTRFS\_I(inode), blocksize, (ret != 0));
We only free qgroup PREALLOC meta space when something went wrong.
[The Correct Behavior]
The correct behavior should be the one in btrfs\_buffered\_write(), we
should always free PREALLOC metadata space.
The reason is, the btrfs\_delalloc\_\* mechanism works by:
- Reserve metadata first, even it's not necessary
In btrfs\_delalloc\_reserve\_metadata()
- Free the unused metadata space
Normally in:
btrfs\_delalloc\_release\_extents()
|- btrfs\_inode\_rsv\_release()
Here we do calculation on whether we should release or not.
E.g. for 64K buffered write, the metadata rsv works like:
/\* The first page \*/
reserve\_meta: num\_bytes=calc\_inode\_reservations()
free\_meta: num\_bytes=0
total: num\_bytes=calc\_inode\_reservations()
/\* The first page caused one outstanding extent, thus needs metadata
rsv \*/
/\* The 2nd page \*/
reserve\_meta: num\_bytes=calc\_inode\_reservations()
free\_meta: num\_bytes=calc\_inode\_reservations()
total: not changed
/\* The 2nd page doesn't cause new outstanding extent, needs no new meta
rsv, so we free what we have reserved \*/
/\* The 3rd~16th pages \*/
reserve\_meta: num\_bytes=calc\_inode\_reservations()
free\_meta: num\_bytes=calc\_inode\_reservations()
total: not changed (still space for one outstanding extent)
This means, if btrfs\_delalloc\_release\_extents() determines to free some
space, then those space should be freed NOW.
So for qgroup, we should call btrfs\_qgroup\_free\_meta\_prealloc() other
than btrfs\_qgroup\_convert\_reserved\_meta().
The good news is:
- The callers are not that hot
The hottest caller is in btrfs\_buffered\_write(), which is already
fixed by commit 336a8bb8e36a ("btrfs: Fix wrong
btrfs\_delalloc\_release\_extents parameter"). Thus it's not that
easy to cause false EDQUOT.
- The trans commit in advance for qgroup would hide the bug
Since commit f5fef4593653 ("btrfs: qgroup: Make qgroup async transaction
commit more aggressive"), when btrfs qgroup metadata free space is slow,
it will try to commit transaction and free the wrongly converted
PERTRANS space, so it's not that easy to hit such bug.
[FIX]
So to fix the problem, remove the @qgroup\_free parameter for
btrfs\_delalloc\_release\_extents(), and always pass true to
btrfs\_inode\_rsv\_release().

Btrfs: fix inode cache block reserve leak on failure to allocate data space
[ Upstream commit 29d47d00e0ae61668ee0c5d90bef2893c8abbafa ]
If we failed to allocate the data extent(s) for the inode space cache, we
were bailing out without releasing the previously reserved metadata. This
was triggering the following warnings when unmounting a filesystem:
$ cat -n fs/btrfs/inode.c
(...)
9268 void btrfs\_destroy\_inode(struct inode \*inode)
9269 {
(...)
9276 WARN\_ON(BTRFS\_I(inode)->block\_rsv.reserved);
9277 WARN\_ON(BTRFS\_I(inode)->block\_rsv.size);
(...)
9281 WARN\_ON(BTRFS\_I(inode)->csum\_bytes);
9282 WARN\_ON(BTRFS\_I(inode)->defrag\_bytes);
(...)
Several fstests test cases triggered this often, such as generic/083,
generic/102, generic/172, generic/269 and generic/300 at least, producing
stack traces like the following in dmesg/syslog:

dm snapshot: rework COW throttling to fix deadlock
[ Upstream commit b21555786f18cd77f2311ad89074533109ae3ffa ]
Commit 721b1d98fb517a ("dm snapshot: Fix excessive memory usage and
workqueue stalls") introduced a semaphore to limit the maximum number of
in-flight kcopyd (COW) jobs.
The implementation of this throttling mechanism is prone to a deadlock:
1. One or more threads write to the origin device causing COW, which is
performed by kcopyd.
2. At some point some of these threads might reach the s->cow\_count
semaphore limit and block in down(&s->cow\_count), holding a read lock
on \_origins\_lock.
3. Someone tries to acquire a write lock on \_origins\_lock, e.g.,
snapshot\_ctr(), which blocks because the threads at step (2) already
hold a read lock on it.
4. A COW operation completes and kcopyd runs dm-snapshot's completion
callback, which ends up calling pending\_complete().
pending\_complete() tries to resubmit any deferred origin bios. This
requires acquiring a read lock on \_origins\_lock, which blocks.
This happens because the read-write semaphore implementation gives
priority to writers, meaning that as soon as a writer tries to enter
the critical section, no readers will be allowed in, until all
writers have completed their work.
So, pending\_complete() waits for the writer at step (3) to acquire
and release the lock. This writer waits for the readers at step (2)
to release the read lock and those readers wait for
pending\_complete() (the kcopyd thread) to signal the s->cow\_count
semaphore: DEADLOCK.
The above was thoroughly analyzed and documented by Nikos Tsironis as
part of his initial proposal for fixing this deadlock, see:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2019-October/msg00001.html
Fix this deadlock by reworking COW throttling so that it waits without
holding any locks. Add a variable 'in\_progress' that counts how many
kcopyd jobs are running. A function wait\_for\_in\_progress() will sleep if
'in\_progress' is over the limit. It drops \_origins\_lock in order to
avoid the deadlock.

dm snapshot: introduce account\_start\_copy() and account\_end\_copy()
[ Upstream commit a2f83e8b0c82c9500421a26c49eb198b25fcdea3 ]
This simple refactoring moves code for modifying the semaphore cow\_count
into separate functions to prepare for changes that will extend these
methods to provide for a more sophisticated mechanism for COW
throttling.

io\_uring: fix up O\_NONBLOCK handling for sockets
[ Upstream commit 491381ce07ca57f68c49c79a8a43da5b60749e32 ]
We've got two issues with the non-regular file handling for non-blocking
IO:
1) We don't want to re-do a short read in full for a non-regular file,
as we can't just read the data again.
2) For non-regular files that don't support non-blocking IO attempts,
we need to punt to async context even if the file is opened as
non-blocking. Otherwise the caller always gets -EAGAIN.
Add two new request flags to handle these cases. One is just a cache
of the inode S\_ISREG() status, the other tells io\_uring that we always
need to punt this request to async context, even if REQ\_F\_NOWAIT is set.
