Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a "Broken Access Control" issue within the WordPress Nexter Theme. This means that there's a lack of proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, allowing users with insufficient privileges to perform actions they shouldn't be able to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is the failure to properly restrict access to certain functions or features, leading to unauthorized actions. Specifically, the theme lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token verification in a function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The impact is described as potentially "highly dangerous and expected to become mass exploited."
*   An unprivileged user can execute higher-privileged actions due to the broken access control.
*   The specific impact varies depending on the function affected.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the vulnerable function within the WordPress theme.
*   It is likely a remote attack vector, meaning the attacker does not need physical access to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a subscriber-level user (or potentially a lower privilege level), which means they are at least a registered user on the WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable function.

**Additional Details:**

*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.6, which is considered "High" severity.
*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects versions of the Nexter Theme up to and including 2.0.3.
*   **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.0.4.
*   **OWASP Top 10:** This vulnerability falls under the "A5: Broken Access Control" category of the OWASP Top 10.

**Mitigation:**
*   The primary mitigation is to update the Nexter Theme to version 2.0.4 or later.
*   Patchstack also provides a virtual patch to mitigate the issue by blocking attacks until an update can be applied.
