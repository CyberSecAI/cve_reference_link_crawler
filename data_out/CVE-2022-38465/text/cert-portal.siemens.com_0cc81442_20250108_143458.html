WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Expose the communication between the S7-1500 CPU and the HMI of the affected products only to

trusted network environments

• Protect access to the TIA Portal project and SINUMERIK NCU (including related memory cards)

from unauthorized actors

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINUMERIK MC is a CNC system for customized machine solutions.

SINUMERIK ONE is a digital-native CNC system with an integrated SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU for automa-
tion.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-38465

Affected products protect the built-in global private key in a way that cannot be considered sufﬁcient
any longer. The key is used for the legacy protection of conﬁdential conﬁguration data and the legacy
PG/PC and HMI communication.

This could allow attackers to discover the private key of a CPU product family by an ofﬂine attack
against a single CPU of the family. Attackers could then use this knowledge to extract conﬁdential
conﬁguration data from projects that are protected by that key or to perform attacks against legacy
PG/PC and HMI communication.
