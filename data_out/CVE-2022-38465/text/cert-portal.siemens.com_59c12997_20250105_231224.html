SSA-568427: Weak Key Protection Vulnerability in SIMATIC S7-1200
and S7-1500 CPU Families

Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.3

SUMMARY

SIMATIC S7-1200, S7-1500 CPUs and related products protect the built-in global private key in a way
that cannot be considered sufﬁcient any longer. The key is used for the legacy protection of conﬁdential
conﬁguration data and the legacy PG/PC and HMI communication.
This could allow attackers to discover the private key of a CPU product family by an ofﬂine attack against
a single CPU of the family. Attackers could then use this knowledge to extract conﬁdential conﬁguration
data from projects that are protected by that key or to perform attacks against legacy PG/PC and HMI
communication.

Siemens recommends to update both the affected products as well as the corresponding TIA Portal
project to the latest versions. TIA Portal V17 and related CPU ﬁrmware versions introduced protection of
conﬁdential conﬁguration data based on individual passwords per device and TLS-protected PG/PC and
HMI communication.

Additional details can be found in the related Siemens security bulletin SSB-898115 (https://cert-portal.
siemens.com/productcert/html/ssb-898115.html).

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Use legacy (i.e., not TLS-based) PG/PC and HMI communication only in trusted network environ-

ments

• Protect access to the TIA Portal project and CPU (including related memory cards) from unautho-

rized actors

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC Drive Controllers have been designed for the automation of production machines, combining
the functionality of a SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU and a SINAMICS S120 drive control.

SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller is a PC-based version of the SIMATIC S7-1500 Controller including
optional visualization in combination with central I/Os in a compact device.

SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU products have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial
environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU products have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial
environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller is a SIMATIC software controller for PC-based automation solutions.

SIMATIC S7-PLCSIM Advanced simulates S7-1200, S7-1500 and a few other PLC derivatives. Includes
full network access to simulate the PLCs, even in virtualized environments.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-38465

Affected products protect the built-in global private key in a way that cannot be considered sufﬁcient
any longer. The key is used for the legacy protection of conﬁdential conﬁguration data and the legacy
PG/PC and HMI communication.

This could allow attackers to discover the private key of a CPU product family by an ofﬂine attack
against a single CPU of the family. Attackers could then use this knowledge to extract conﬁdential
conﬁguration data from projects that are protected by that key or to perform attacks against legacy
PG/PC and HMI communication.
