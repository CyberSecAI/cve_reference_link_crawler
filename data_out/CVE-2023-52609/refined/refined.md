{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the binder driver between `mmput()` and `do_exit()`. When Task A calls `binder_update_page_range()` to allocate pages in Task B's address space, it first pins Task B's mm using `mmget_not_zero()`. If Task B calls `do_exit()` concurrently, the final `mmput()` may come from Task A. This can lead to the cleanup work (specifically, `____fput()`) from Task B being queued in Task A as TWA_RESUME. Task A might then sleep indefinitely waiting for a reply from the already dead Task B, causing a deadlock and delaying binder_deferred_release() and related death notifications.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition in binder driver's mm reference counting logic",
      "Incorrect task context for cleanup work using mmput()"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a deadlock, delayed binder_deferred_release(), and delayed death notifications, potentially leading to a denial of service or other unexpected behavior.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious actor could exploit this race by causing one task to allocate memory in another task's address space through the binder driver, and then causing the second task to exit concurrently.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the capability to interact with the binder driver and create a situation where one task allocates memory in another task's address space, and the second task exits during that process."
  },
    "fix": "The fix replaces `mmput()` with `mmput_async()`. This schedules the work in the corresponding mm->async_put_work WQ, thus preventing the race condition where the cleanup is done in the context of Task A and avoid the deadlock scenario when Task B exits prematurely."
