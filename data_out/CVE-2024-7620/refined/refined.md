Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-7620

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper file type validation in the `_import` function of the Customizer Export/Import plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not adequately verify the file type of uploaded files during the import process, allowing for arbitrary file uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin fails to validate the file type during the import process, allowing users to upload arbitrary files with potentially dangerous extensions.
*   **Missing File Type Validation:** The core issue is the absence of a robust check on the file's type before processing the uploaded file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker with administrative privileges can upload any file to the server.
*   **Remote Code Execution (Possible):** By uploading a malicious file (e.g., PHP file) and finding a way to execute it, an attacker could achieve remote code execution on the server, leading to a complete compromise of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network through the plugin's import functionality.
*   **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious file using the plugin's import feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with administrator-level access or higher. This means that the vulnerability is only exploitable by users with sufficient privileges.
*   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is only exploitable in conjunction with a race condition due to the fact that the uploaded file is deleted shortly after creation. This implies that an attacker would need to successfully race to execute the uploaded file before it is deleted.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided information notes that the vulnerability is only exploitable with a race condition since the uploaded file is deleted shortly after it's created.
* The fix in version 0.9.7.1 addresses this vulnerability, and users should upgrade to this version or later as soon as possible.
* The vulnerability was found by researcher Luk6785.
