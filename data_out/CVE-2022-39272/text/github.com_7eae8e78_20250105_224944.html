## Description

Flux controllers within the affected versions range are vulnerable to a denial of service attack. Users that have permissions to change Flux’s objects, either through a Flux source or directly within a cluster, can provide invalid data to fields `.spec.interval` or `.spec.timeout` (and structured variations of these fields), causing the entire object type to stop being processed.

The issue has two root causes: a) the Kubernetes type `metav1.Duration` not being fully compatible with the Go type `time.Duration` as explained on [upstream report](https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/issues/131); b) lack of validation within Flux to restrict allowed values.

### Workarounds

Admission controllers can be employed to restrict the values that can be used for fields `.spec.interval` and `.spec.timeout`, however upgrading to the latest versions is still the recommended mitigation.

### Credits

This issue was reported by Alexander Block ([@codablock](https://github.com/codablock)) through the Flux security mailing list (as [recommended](https://fluxcd.io/security/#report-a-vulnerability)).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
