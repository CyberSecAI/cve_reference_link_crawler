2.11

Dec 5, 2024

In this release, we’ve added a feature for Chrome users — Force preflight mode for prefetching in Chrome. What does it do?
To improve performance, Chrome preloads some pages. To maintain privacy (as Chrome sees it), it uses the private prefetch proxy to load page content. But this means that AdGuard DNS won’t even see the requests for preloaded pages and won’t be able to filter them.
To fix this, we’ve added a feature that forces Chrome to send a DNS request to AdGuard DNS before the user visits a preloaded resource. This allows AdGuard DNS to block the request if necessary.
Please note: this feature doesn’t disable page preloading. To turn it off, go to Chrome settings → Performance → Preload pages.
Changelog
Improvements
Simplified profile configuration names for macOS and iOS [#367](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS/issues/367)
Optimized display of requests in Statistics, Query log, and Traffic destination
Added search by description in Blocklists

Fixes
The Block domain and Add user rule buttons in Query log ignore request status
Companies per page selector glitches when opened [#855](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS/issues/855)

2.10

Nov 8, 2024

AdGuard DNS is once again the first to cross the finish line and take home all the medals! We’re proud to be the world’s first public DNS resolver to support [Structured DNS Errors (SDE)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-structured-dns-error/09/) even before it becomes an official standard.
What Structured DNS Errors are
Structured DNS Errors are additional text information in DNS responses that browsers can parse and convert to human-readable format. Currently, when a website is blocked due to DNS filtering, the user sees a generic error message and may not even realize it’s DNS-related. Structured DNS Errors can provide the user with a detailed error explanation, contact information, and the name of the responsible organization.
Unfortunately, we still need browsers to support SDE before users can actually experience this update. But for now, to see Structured DNS Errors in action, you can try our demo extension. It’s available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/oeinmjfnchfhaabhchfjkbdpmgeageen) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/dns-sde-extension/).
Other improvements: More personalized experience for users and organizations
Our audience includes individuals setting up DNS for their home as well as large organizations. To better understand each user’s needs, we’ve added an onboarding survey to gather information about goals and expected number of devices. This will help us personalize DNS in the future — for example, by providing more information about automation options for those who need it.

2.9

Oct 7, 2024

From custom rate limits to under-the-hood improvements, this release is designed to elevate your experience with AdGuard DNS like never before.
We always try to keep up with our users’ expectations, and this time is no exception. Team and Enterprise subscription users with a large number of devices connected to their account may sometimes encounter rate limits. That’s why in this update we've decided to add an option to set your own request limits.
![Rate limit](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/dns/v2-9/rate-limits-en.png)
We’ve also fixed a couple of bugs, added a couple of features, and updated instructions for routers.
Changelog
Improvements
Added the ability to set a custom Rate limit for Team and Enterprise subscription users
Updated Private DNS instructions for routers
Added information about the average number of requests per day
Added Brave and Ecosia searchers to Safe Search list

Fixes
New custom rules override previous rules
Device name not updated in filter logs after changing [#816](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS/issues/816)

2.8.1

Jul 22, 2024

We decided not to delay the release of the new version for long. AdGuard DNS v2.8.1 is already here, with fixed bugs and updated Knowledge base.
Changelog
Improvements
Added [User API description](https://adguard-dns.io/kb/private-dns/api/changelog) for automatically connected devices

Fixed
Page doesn't refresh after a server is deleted
Other small fixes

2.8

Jul 10, 2024

In this release, we’ve made it even easier to add many devices. We’ve already told you about [AdGuard DNS Client](https://adguard-dns.io/en/blog/adguard-dns-client.html), and now we’ve added another feature — automatic device connection.
We’ve also added a new tag in the country stats for situations where the IP address was not included in the response. Other improvements can be found in the changelog.
Automatic device connection
For some people, connecting new devices from the dashboard isn’t convenient. For example, if you’re setting up devices for the entire company, you may want to simplify the process.
Now you can create a special connection link and enter it in the device settings. We’ll detect the device and automatically connect it to the server.
In Servers → Server settings → Devices, we’ve added a template that will generate a link for the required device and protocol type. And if you prefer to create links manually, there are also instructions.
![Automatic device connection](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/dns/v2-8/autdev-en.png)
You can allow or prohibit automatic device connection using such links in Servers → Server settings → Devices.
Tag for countries that couldn’t be determined
We’ve been asked from time to time: why is Unknown destination often at the top of the country statistics? This category included requests where the country could not be determined from the IP address or the IP address was not provided.
Now these two cases are separated: Not applicable means that the response doesn’t include an IP address, and Unknown destination means that the country couldn’t be determined from the IP address.
Changelog
Improvements
Added a new section in Devices: Automatic device connection
Added a new request destination type in Statistics: Not applicable
Added a new device type in setup instructions: Other
Added stats period selector in Servers and Devices
Added a DNS server in Toronto

Fixes
Disabling statistics leads to problems loading the dashboard
Page loading error in Request destination
User filter data resets when the page is refreshed

2.7

Apr 22, 2024

Ever had that feeling when you get a haircut but no one seems to notice? Well, we definitely don’t want that. That’s why we’ve put in our best efforts to make sure AdGuard DNS v2.7 won’t go unnoticed: we’ve given the settings and the device connections pages a fresh new look, and we’ve added DNS-over-HTTPS with authentication to give it that final touch of novelty — and security. Let’s take a closer look at these improvements:
DNS-over-HTTPS with authentication
We’ve added the option to use DNS-over-HTTPS with authentication, which, in addition to the device identifier, provides a login and password for it. This can restrict access for unauthorized users and, as a result, enhance your security.
To enable this feature, head to settings of the device in which you’d like to use this authentication option, and change the DNS server to the one with authentication. By clicking Deny other protocols, other protocol usage options to disappear, leaving only the DNS-over-HTTPS authentication enabled and preventing its use by third parties.
![ DNS-over-HTTPS with authentication](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/dns/v2-7/http-auth/http-auth-en.png)
Settings redesign
The settings section has been given a fresh design to make it more user-friendly, aiming for increased efficiency and ease of use. The device configuration page has also undergone changes, allowing for more convenient device management, including the ability to delete all devices with a single click.
![Redesign](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/dns/v2-7/redesign/settings-en.png)
Сhangelog
Features
Added the ability to delete all devices from the server at once
Added the ability to choose the number of devices displayed in server settings
Added the ability to not overwrite user rules during import

Fixes
Fixed behavior of discount coupons during promotions
Made adjustments to the public setup instructions page for AdGuard DNS
YouTube restricted mode is not applied on Firefox [#753](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS/issues/753)

2.6

Mar 1, 2024

AdGuard DNS v2.6 is here to sprinkle a little magic into the lives of our Team and Enterprise plan users! This latest version unveils the world of dedicated IPv4 addresses, turning the sometimes daunting task of connecting devices to DNS servers into a breeze.
Dedicated IPv4 addresses
![Dedicated IPv4 addresses](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/dns/v2-6/ipv4-en.png)
The highlight of this version is the availability of dedicated IPv4 addresses. All you have to do is assign them to the devices of your choice, allowing you to easily connect to private DNS servers swiftly, with quick setup, without compromising your security and ensuring that no one else will be using your server. But how does it improve your experience with AdGuard DNS?
As a user, you’ve probably noticed that setting up AdGuard DNS is not always possible in some devices. For instance, setting up unencrypted DNS on Windows was a demanding task, and linking IP addresses required specialized support and was not always reliable. We hear you!
Since the previous version, we’ve started preparing AdGuard DNS so you can make the most out of encrypted DNS protocols. We began by introducing access settings in v2.5 to allow you to protect your DNS endpoints from unauthorized access, as these addresses are often targeted by various scanners. As a result, your stats may be overwhelmed with unwanted requests. With these settings, it became possible to specify which clients can use your DNS server, list clients that cannot use your DNS server, and specify domains that cannot be accessed via your DNS server.
And that’s how v2.5 set the stage for AdGuard DNS v2.6 to shine: from this new version, dedicated IPv4 addresses are available to you, and now you can enjoy this cool new feature designed especially for those who couldn’t connect to encrypted protocols on their devices.
Changelog
Features
Added instructions in case the device is not recognized on the main AdGuard DNS page
Added instructions for setting up AdGuard Private DNS via `dnsmasq service` for Linux users
Enabled blocking lists are now displayed at the top

Fixes
Incorrect error code is displayed when there is no Internet connection
The “Change subscription” text on the main settings page overlaps its field [#733](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS/issues/733)
Resetting the domain filter does not work in the Companies section
Overlapping text in the Statistics section
The FAQ section display issue on tablets
Incorrect instruction for setting up AdGuard Private DNS-over-TLS for OpenWRT routers

2.5.1

Dec 22, 2023

Recently, we released a major update to Private AdGuard DNS. A few minor bugs slipped through the cracks, but we fixed them in their tracks in this version. We also improved the Access settings interface — added tooltips and placeholders, changed the name of the button from Block to Block domain. In a word, we made the settings more intuitive and user-friendly.
Changelog
Fixes
Message "Not enough data. Continue using your device to see statistics here" in the Statistics section is shown if users have data [#704](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS/issues/704).
Incorrect display of access settings and ISP information in the Statistics section and Filtering log
Other minor fixes

2.5

Dec 18, 2023

It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas… And we’ve got some presents for you, especially if you want to gain more control over your traffic! Meet AdGuard DNS v2.5 with new Access settings and the expanded range of custom rules.
New Access settings
With this release, the new Access settings section became available. What can you set up there and what for? Let’s dive deeper into this topic.
![Access settings](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/dns/v2-5/AS-en.png)
If you go to Server settings → Advanced settings → Access settings, you’ll see three parameters:
Allowed clients. Here you can specify which clients can use your DNS server
Disallowed clients. Here you can specify the clients that are not allowed to use your DNS server
Disallowed domains. Here you can specify the domains (as well as wildcard and DNS filtering rules) that are not be allowed to access your DNS server

By customizing these fields, you’ll be able to protect your AdGuard DNS server from unauthorized access. Blocked requests will not appear in the Query log, and you will not need to pay for them.
There's another reason why we’ve added Access settings. We plan to implement dedicated IPv4 addresses in the nearest future. These addresses are often targeted by various scanners and can be vulnerable to DDoS attacks. To avoid cluttering your stats with these unwanted queries, it's crucial to have the ability to shield your dedicated address from unauthorized access.
More user rules
We know that many of you have been waiting for this: now you can increase the number of available custom rules by upgrading your subscription:
Starter — 100 rules
Personal — 1,000 rules
Team — from 5,000 to 50,000 rules
Enterprise — 50,000+ rules

Changelog
Features
Added the ability to set up private DNS in AdGuard VPN Browser Extension via the link
Added the ability to log client IP addresses and domains
Expanded information on queries in Query log
Added the new Top Clients section to Statistics

Fixes
Tooltips are shown in the AdGuard DNS settings
Impossible to buy a new subscription if the previous one expired
Problem with multi selector in Query Log
Link for setting up Private AdGuard DNS on Apple TV does not open
Data in Query Log is reset when refreshing the page
Incorrect numbering in public AdGuard DNS instructions

2.4

Nov 2, 2023

Here at AdGuard, your online security is our priority, but you already know that. What you probably don’t know yet is that AdGuard DNS v2.4 brings something really special to the table: we've added the ability to shield yourself from those freshly registered, not-so-friendly and often outright malicious domains.
Blocking recently registered malicious domains
Every day, thousands of newly registered domains are created. Most of them, unfortunately, are on the malicious side. These domains are primarily used in phishing attacks and malware distribution and can be used to leak sensitive data. Good news is, with AdGuard DNS v2.4, you don’t have to worry about them: finding the source of these domains used to be a challenge, but we are now able to block them directly on the DNS level, so you can enjoy the Internet more freely.
Redesigned instructions for setting up a Personal DNS
We're here to make your online world not just safer, but also easier to navigate: our revamped setup instructions are all about providing you with the utmost convenience and clarity when configuring your Personal DNS. Besides, if your OS of choice is Windows 11, you can now check the instructions designed specially for it.
![New design](https://cdn.adtidy.org/blog/new/xl6p62.png)
Updates in the Statistics section
Also, we are excited to introduce a new section in the Statistics tab. There, you can sort the traffic by two new categories: encrypted and unencrypted requests.
![Statistics](https://cdn.adtidy.org/blog/new/6aqsz1.png)
Welcome to a more secure and user-friendly experience!
Changelog
Features
Added the ability to block recently registered domains [#385](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS/issues/385)
Redesigned instructions for setting up the Personal DNS
Added a section in the Statistics for categorizing traffic into encrypted and unencrypted requests
Added instructions for setting up a Personal DNS for Windows 11

Fixes
Fixed the date and time display format for different locales

2.3

Aug 31, 2023

In this release, we're introducing two significant enhancements, both of which simplify the process of connecting devices to your DNS servers.
Dedicated IPv6 addresses
For devices that don’t support encrypted DNS protocols, connecting to your DNS servers has become much simpler! You don’t have to relink your device’s IP address every time it changes. Just enter the dedicated IP addresses in the device settings, and we’ll do the rest.
Not all devices and providers support IPv6. We’re planning to add IPv4 to Private AdGuard DNS soon.

Instructions for routers, TVs, and gaming consoles
In this version, we've also taken care of those who use DNS on devices that require manual setup. Now, when connecting a new device on the dashboard, you can specify the router, smart TV, or console model — and we'll provide you with instructions tailored to that model.
Changelog
Features
Added instructions on how to connect Private AdGuard DNS for routers, game consoles and smart TVs
Added an option to connect private DNS via a dedicated IPv6 address
Optimized filter selectors in Block lists, User rules, and Parental control sections

Fixes
The “Processed” filter also shows blocked entries in the query log [#657](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS/issues/657)
Wrong links for setting up public AdGuard DNS on Android
Subscription status goes beyond the block in some languages [#645](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS/issues/645)
Problem with authorization for some users
Discounts are displayed incorrectly in AdGuard DNS account

2.2.1

Aug 7, 2023

In this update, we have improved the DNS server performance, fixed a few issues, and released a new authorization service that will allow users to access their personal account quicker.
Changelog
Performance
The number of AdGuard DNS users is growing at an enormous rate, and the total number of requests per second has closely approached 2 million. Meanwhile, over 90% of these requests come to us through encrypted DNS protocols (DoT, DoH, DoQ, DNSCrypt). Therefore, in this release, we focused on improving the DNS server’s performance and achieved great success. We can now handle an astronomical number of requests with reasonable server power.
Features
Added Czech and Slovak languages
Improved readability of highlighted text in dark theme [#617](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS/issues/617)
Full DNS address now displayed when setting up a device in a mobile browser [#625](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS/issues/625)

Fixes
Misalignment of columns when the “Device not connected” indicator dot appears [#575](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS/issues/575)
AdGuard verification code auto-fill issue with two-factor authentication enabled in Safari [#314](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS/issues/314)
Email address auto-fill bug on the login page in Safari [#319](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS/issues/319)
Incorrect functioning of the `$dnsrewrite` modifier

2.2

Apr 24, 2023

The highlight of this release is the ability to customize the Team subscription — now you can choose the number of devices, servers, and monthly requests you want before purchasing it. Also, we've added the option to select a response code for blocked requests and, of course, fixed some bugs.
Changelog
Features
Added the ability to customize the Team subscription
Added more information about monthly traffic update [#490](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS/issues/490)
Added the option to select a response code for blocked requests
Added AdGuard DNS blog

2.1

Oct 20, 2022

AdGuard DNS now supports DNS-over-HTTP/3 in experimental mode. It was a challenge, but we made it. For now only AdGuard Home and dnsproxy fully support DNS-over-HTTP/3, but soon DoH3 will appear in other AdGuard products. However, we focus on DNS-over-QUIC and consider it more advanced, but we strive to support the other protocols too, and DoH3 is a proof of that.
![report](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/dns/report_en.png?123)
Another good news is that we will email AdGuard DNS users weekly and monthly reports with stats on requests, devices, and companies, which is convenient and visual. If there are too many reports, you can unsubscribe at any time.
Changelog
[Enhancement] Added the Apply button that appears after changing the server name
[Enhancement] Query log data cutoff in desktop mode [#366](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS/issues/366)

2.0.1

Jul 29, 2022

Check out the sixth beta version of AdGuard DNS (and hopefully the final one before the release). In it we’ve improved the dark theme: updated the map styles and QR-code, so that everything could be easily read and scanned. And, of course, we fixed some minor bugs. The private AdGuard DNS now runs smoother!
Changelog
[Enhancement] Updated map styles in the dark theme
[Enhancement] Added an option to disable iCloud Private Relay
[Fixed] QR code is not scanned in the dark theme
[Fixed] Autofill doesn’t work in Safari on macOS and iOS
[Fixed] Minor bug fixes in desktop и mobile versions

Jul 13, 2022

There are five fingers in a hand, five oceans on Earth, and five betas of the private AdGuard DNS. Today we're releasing the fifth beta of our DNS and we hope you'll rate it 5/5!
In this version we’ve implemented support for DDR (Discovery of Designated Resolvers) by [the latest draft of the new standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-add-ddr/). With this feature, an encrypted connection to the DNS server will be set up automatically on devices with DDR support, provided the device previously knew the server address. A computer or smartphone will send a request to the known address and receive all the necessary information to establish a secure connection.
DDR support appeared in [Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 22489](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/10/27/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22489/), which means that the feature will get into the release version after a while. When this happens, Windows and AdGuard DNS users will be automatically reconnected to encrypted DNS servers – public or private, depending on the services selected earlier.

We’ve also improved ECS (EDNS Client Subnet) implemented in the [third beta](https://adguard-dns.io/versions.html#0.3). Servers now respond with more precise IP addresses that better match your location. Furthermore, we are continuing to refine the open AdGuard DNS API, and now there are methods for getting statistics. All documentation is available at [Knowledge Base](https://adguard-dns.io/kb/private-dns/api/).
We’ve fixed some bugs and worked on the interface: authorization via Apple ID now works properly, the dark theme has become really dark, and the Query log is prettier than ever. French, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean were added to the dashboard, and we are committed to continue localizing the private AdGuard DNS, making it accessible to users from all over the world!
Changelog
[Enhancement] Added support for DDR (Discovery of Designated Resolvers)
[Enhancement] Statistic retrieval methods were added to the API
[Enhancement] Added an option to change subscription type
[Enhancement] Added an option to extend subscription
[Enhancement] Added support for Chinese, Japanese, Korean, French, and Italian
[Enhancement] Added the "Don’t ask again" checkbox to the system notification that appears when deleting user rules
[Fixed] After logging in via Apple ID the personal account opens instead of dashboard if the user has an AdGuard VPN subscription
[Fixed] In dark theme statistics blocks are highlighted in white
[Fixed] In dark theme text in some fields is grayed out
[Fixed] Some elements in the mobile version of the website are displayed incorrectly

0.4

Jun 21, 2022

The period of active "building" of the private AdGuard DNS is left behind, and now we're polishing the service to a shine. Just take a look at the current changelog and compare it to the one we published for the previous beta. The difference is obvious.
The fourth beta features dark theme and language selection – at the moment, the dashboard is translated into German, Spanish, and Russian. To find both options, go to Account settings. And some more good news: from now on all AdGuard VPN users with a subscription will get the Personal plan of the private AdGuard DNS for free.
We hope you’ll enjoy the new version. Use the service and leave feedback on any platform you like.
Changelog
[Enhancement] Added dark theme
[Enhancement] Added support for VPN subscriptions and information about VPN subscribers automatically getting a Personal DNS subscription
[Enhancement] Added German and Spanish localizations
[Enhancement] Improved search function in the filter section on mobile devices
[Enhancement] Supplemented instructions for different devices
[Enhancement] Added a link to DNS rules syntax in the query log dialog
[Fixed] The “View device settings” button doesn't work on iOS devices
[Fixed] The “Unable to renew subscription” popup hangs for too long

0.3.1

Jun 10, 2022

The recently released third beta of private AdGuard DNS was really good and brought a lot of useful features to users. However, as it turned out, it contained a few flaws. So that you don't have to deal with them anymore, we are releasing a patch v0.3.1 for private AdGuard DNS.
Changelog
[Fixed] Clicking the Block button in Query log deletes all existing user rules and replaces them with a new one [#265](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS/issues/265)
[Fixed] Unable to move devices between servers [#248](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardDNS/issues/248)
[Fixed] Incorrect links on the "Thanks for your purchase" page
[Fixed] Discount promo codes do not work correctly
[Fixed] There is no payment button in the mobile version of the website
[Fixed] Incorrect designation of the number of requests in Statistics

0.3

May 26, 2022

Meet the third beta version of private AdGuard DNS! We are steadily moving towards a full-fledged product, adding new features, changing and improving UI — everything to make you really enjoy using AdGuard DNS.
The version history – in front of your eyes
First and foremost, we've added a version history page for the AdGuard DNS service. Now you can see the full list of changes, learn about new features, and see how the work on private AdGuard DNS service is progressing.
Contribute to AdGuard DNS translation
Until now, private AdGuard DNS could only be used in English: first we had to make sure everything was working as it should. With this version we've extended the geography by adding the possibility to translate the dashboard into different languages. Help us make AdGuard DNS more accessible to everyone by participating in the translations! You can find a detailed article on how to use the Crowdin platform in our [Knowledge Base](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/adguard-translations). And if you already know how to use it, visit the [AdGuard DNS project in Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/adguard-websites/en#/adguard-dns.com). Select the Dashboard and choose the language you want, then you're ready to translate!
AdGuard DNS Knowledge Base
To make it easier to understand AdGuard DNS, we've added the [Knowledge Base](https://adguard-dns.io/kb/). You can see all the latest Knowledge Base changes in the [AdGuard DNS GitHub repository](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/KnowledgeBaseDNS).
Subscription
We've added a paid subscription on private AdGuard DNS. Subscription is not required during beta testing, but we'd appreciate it if you'd like to support us now.
DNS filters
We've also fixed DNS filters: eliminated the bug with the `/etc/hosts-style` rules failing to work and added support for rules with `$dnsrewrite`. By the way, you can read about the [DNS filtering syntax](https://adguard-dns.io/kb/general/dns-filtering-syntax/) in the Knowledge Base.
ECS support
The AdGuard DNS servers now support EDNS Client Subnet (ECS).
This feature allows users to get responses corrected for the location of the DNS user. We had long been hesitating to implement it in AdGuard DNS: ECS assumes handing over an anonymized user's IP address to the name server. In this version, we've solved the problem: instead of the user's IP address, we pass another address from approximately the same location as the user's.
New blocklists
We've added a lot of new blocklists — now it's even easier to customize AdGuard DNS. And if that's not enough, you can request and add more blocklists in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/HostlistsRegistry) (before you do that, read requirements for blocklists in the section “What Blocklists Can Be Added Here”).
Open API
AdGuard DNS now has an open API. If you want to integrate with AdGuard DNS, read the [documentation](https://adguard-dns.io/kb/private-dns/api/).
UI fixes and more
We've also fixed a lot of minor bugs and added some useful features.
Test private AdGuard DNS and leave feedback on any convenient platforms — it will help us become better.
Changelog
[Enhancement] Improved the appearance of the multiselect (element with the ability to select multiple values, such as countries, devices)
[Enhancement] For the device location, the Traffic Destination section uses data from its last activity
[Fixed] Incorrect detection for account time zone
[Fixed] Statistics and logs do not get cleared when their retention period is changed
[Fixed] Incorrect country detection for some domains
[Fixed] Significant delay in clearing logs and statistics
[Other] Added the option "Last 7 days" to date selector

Mar 16, 2022

We’ve all been waiting for it: we're proud to present the open beta of private AdGuard DNS! From now on, anyone can set up their own DNS server.
We took the best of AdGuard DNS and AdGuard Home and designed a product that would be flexible and customizable, meet the needs of "geeks", and have a user-friendly interface. We hope we succeeded! And now let's take a closer look at the best features of private AdGuard DNS.
Block/unblock domains
With a private DNS server, it is only you who decides which domains should be blocked and which shouldn’t — on each device! Connect your computer, smartphone, tablet or router and manage their requests as desired.
Blocklists management
You can also choose which domain blocking rules should be implemented. And those who aren't satisfied with dozens of pre-installed blocklists can import and export their own custom rules.
Advanced statistics
Now you can see the full statistics of your requests: how many requests were registered, to which companies, and to which countries. Besides, you can view this information for different dates, countries, and even for different devices connected to your DNS server. And of course, block and unblock requests on the go.
Parental control
To protect your child from online content you deem inappropriate, you can use Parental control. You can activate the safe search and manually specify domains for blocking as well as set the schedule: for instance, not allow your child to watch videos during homework.
Join beta testing
To take part in beta testing go to AdGuard DNS website and press \*Join beta\*\*\*, then sign up or log into your AdGuard account. You're done! Create your own DNS server and manage your requests — you are in control.

Sep 28, 2021

Great news: AdGuard DNS is advancing to a new level. We're about to release the product that many have yearned for so long — the private AdGuard DNS!
What a public DNS server blocks cannot be changed — it only has to be taken for granted. With your own DNS server, you'll be in control of all the query statistics and be able to choose which domains you want to block. It'll allow you to add blocklists and set up Parental control. And the user-friendly interface will make it no problem to get to grips with it all.
We added [a new website](https://adguard-dns.io/) where you can already see what the private AdGuard DNS interface will look like, learn how to connect to the public DNS server, and subscribe to the AdGuard DNS newsletter. If you do, we'll message you at launch and keep you up-to-date with the latest AdGuard news.
Thank you for your support! Stay tuned — and in the meantime, we're working to make sure the next release is to your liking.
