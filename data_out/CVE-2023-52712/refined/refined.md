- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper interface access control in a Huawei PC product.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Inadequate access control for the SMI handler interface.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to SMRAM leaks, potentially exposing sensitive data stored within the System Management RAM.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker with common permissions interacts with the SPI flash through the SMI handler interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires local access to the system and common user level permissions to interact with the SMI handler.
