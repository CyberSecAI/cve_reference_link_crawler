- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled resource consumption due to a large number of ICMP requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The device is vulnerable to uncontrolled resource consumption when a large number of ICMP requests are sent, leading to a crash. The vulnerability is present when the built-in web server is enabled but not completely set up.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can cause the device to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can send a large quantity of ICMP requests to the device over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected device. The attack complexity is rated as high because a misconfiguration is required.
