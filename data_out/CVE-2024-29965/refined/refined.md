- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Backups generated by Brocade SANnav before v2.3.1 and v2.3.0a are world-readable. These backups contain sensitive information, including passwords, the entire database with admin users, and switch configurations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Insecure file permissions on backup files
    - Storage of sensitive information in backups, including passwords and user information.
    - Weak encryption mechanism (custom encryption mechanism)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can recover backup files, restore them to a new malicious appliance, and retrieve the passwords of all the switches. This can lead to complete compromise of the SAN environment.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the appliance, either through web interface or command-line interface ("SSH").
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local attacker with the ability to access the backup files and restore them on a separate device.
