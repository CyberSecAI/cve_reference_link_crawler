    "CVE-2022-43427": {
      "summary": "The BMC AMI DevX Total Test Plugin 2.4.8 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints. This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure access control",
          "Improper authorization"

      "impact": "Attackers with Overall/Read permission can enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins, potentially leading to capturing the credentials using another vulnerability.",
