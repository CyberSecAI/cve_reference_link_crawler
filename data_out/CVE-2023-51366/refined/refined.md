- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Path traversal vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper path handling allows access to files outside of the intended directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers with user access can traverse the file system and read sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access, requires an existing user account on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs user-level access to the system.
