Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of input parameter validation in a REST command used for manipulating virtual disks. Specifically, some of the input parameters are directly passed to a bash script without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. By injecting malicious code into the input parameters, an attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The system fails to validate or sanitize user-provided input, leading to the possibility of injecting arbitrary data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with root privileges. This could lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, denial of service, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is triggered via a REST command, indicating it's exploitable remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected system to send the malicious REST command.
- **No authentication is mentioned:** The provided information indicates the vulnerability can be exploited with no authentication.

**Affected Product:**
- StarWind SAN & NAS v0.2 build 1633.

**Fixed in:**
- StarWind SAN & NAS V8 R12

**Mitigation:**
- Update to StarWind SAN & NAS V8 R12 or higher
