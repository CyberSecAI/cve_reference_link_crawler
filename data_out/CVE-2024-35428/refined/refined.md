{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The ZKTeco ZKBio CVSecurity software does not properly sanitize user-supplied input for the `delPath` variable, allowing directory traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated user can delete arbitrary local files from the server, leading to Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": "By manipulating the `delPath` variable in an HTTP request when adding a new audio file, an attacker can use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `/../../`) to target files outside of the intended directory.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the ZKTeco ZKBio CVSecurity application."
