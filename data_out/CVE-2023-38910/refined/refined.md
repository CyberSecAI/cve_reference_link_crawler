Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the "Carousel Widget" section of CSZ CMS 1.3.0. Specifically, the "Photo URL" and "YouTube URL" fields within the carousel widget editor do not adequately filter user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious scripts or HTML injected into the vulnerable fields are saved and then executed when a user views the page containing the carousel widget.
*   **HTML Injection:** Arbitrary HTML can also be injected into these fields, which can be used to alter the page's structure or content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies)
    *   Defacement of web pages
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user
    *   Potentially further compromise of the system
*   **Page Defacement:** HTML injection can lead to defacing or modifying website content.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the CSZ CMS administration panel, specifically by editing a carousel widget.
*   **Input Fields:** The "Photo URL" and "YouTube URL" fields within the carousel widget configuration are the direct attack vectors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a logged-in user with the privileges to access and modify the "Carousel Widget" section.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Fields:** The attacker needs to be aware of which fields are vulnerable to injection ("Photo URL" and "YouTube URL").

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in CSZ CMS version 1.3.0.
*   The provided proof of concept demonstrates successful XSS with the payload: `<div><p title="</div><svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>">`.
*   The document notes that an XSS vulnerability present in version 1.2.9 related to the 'name' field was fixed in the new version 1.3.0. However, this new vulnerability in different fields was discovered.
