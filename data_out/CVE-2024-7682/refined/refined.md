Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization of the `id` parameter in the `rw_i_nat.php` file of the "Job Portal Using PHP With Source Code" application. The application directly uses the unsanitized user-supplied input in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. User-provided input is directly embedded into SQL queries without validation or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized database access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Sensitive data leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Data tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
*   **System control:** Attackers may gain comprehensive control of the system
*  **Service interruption:** Attackers can potentially cause a service outage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a POST request to the `rw_i_nat.php` file.
*   **`id` Parameter:** The malicious SQL injection payload is inserted through the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **HTTP request crafting:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP POST requests.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The exploit does not require prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes proof-of-concept (POC) payloads for different SQL injection types: boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind, and UNION query.
*   The content mentions that the vulnerability was discovered by Liu Mingxuan and Liu Hang from Northwestern Polytechnical University.
*   The vulnerable software is "Job Portal Using PHP With Source Code" version 1.0
*   The affected file is `rw_i_nat.php`.
*   The vulnerability does not require a login.
*   The vulnerability was tested using sqlmap.
*   The content provides suggestions for remediation, including the use of prepared statements, input validation, and minimizing database user permissions.
