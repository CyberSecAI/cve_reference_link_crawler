- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper management of resources during IPv4 fragment reassembly in Cisco IOS XE Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability lies in the handling of IPv4 fragmented packets during reassembly.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specifically sized fragmented packets to an affected device or through a Virtual Fragmentation Reassembly (VFR)-enabled interface on an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to send crafted fragmented packets to the target device.
