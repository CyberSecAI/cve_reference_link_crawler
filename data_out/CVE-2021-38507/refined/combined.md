## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird 91.3

Announced
November 3, 2021
Impact
high
Products
Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Thunderbird 91.3

*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*
This advisory was updated January 17, 2023 to add CVE-2021-43529. This fix was included in the original release of Thunderbird 91.3, but did not appear in the advisory published at that time.

#### [#CVE-2021-43529: Memory corruption when processing S/MIME messages](#CVE-2021-43529)

Reporter
Tavis Ormandy
Impact
critical
##### Description

Thunderbird versions prior to 91.3.0 are vulnerable to the heap overflow described in CVE-2021-43527 when processing S/MIME messages. Thunderbird versions 91.3.0 and later will not call the vulnerable code when processing S/MIME messages that contain certificates with DER-encoded DSA or RSA-PSS signatures.
Note: This advisory was added on January 17, 2023 after discovering it was inadvertently left out of the original advisory. The fix was included in the original release of Thunderbird 91.3.

##### Description

Microsoft introduced a new feature in Windows 10 known as Cloud Clipboard which, if enabled, will record data copied to the clipboard to the cloud, and make it available on other computers in certain scenarios. Applications that wish to prevent copied data from being recorded in Cloud History must use specific clipboard formats; and Thunderbird before version 91.3 did not implement them. This could have caused sensitive data to be recorded to a user's Microsoft account.
*This bug only affects Thunderbird for Windows 10+ with Cloud Clipboard enabled. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Valentin Gosu, and Andrew McCreight reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 91.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Valentin Gosu, and Andrew McCreight reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 93 and Firefox ESR 91.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

                 CVE-2021-43546

Multiple security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox
web browser, which could potentially result in the execution
of arbitrary code, information disclosure or spoofing.

Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Firefox. Support
for the 78.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now
following the 91.x releases.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
91.4.1esr-1~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.

For the detailed security status of firefox-esr please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/firefox-esr>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

#### [#CVE-2021-38503: iframe sandbox rules did not apply to XSLT stylesheets](#CVE-2021-38503)

Reporter
Armin Ebert
Impact
high
##### Description

The iframe sandbox rules were not correctly applied to XSLT stylesheets, allowing an iframe to bypass restrictions such as executing scripts or navigating the top-level frame.

#### [#CVE-2021-38505: Windows 10 Cloud Clipboard may have recorded sensitive user data](#CVE-2021-38505)

Reporter
Sergey Galich
Impact
high
##### Description

Microsoft introduced a new feature in Windows 10 known as Cloud Clipboard which, if enabled, will record data copied to the clipboard to the cloud, and make it available on other computers in certain scenarios. Applications that wish to prevent copied data from being recorded in Cloud History must use specific clipboard formats; and Firefox before versions 94 and ESR 91.3 did not implement them. This could have caused sensitive data to be recorded to a user's Microsoft account.
*This bug only affects Firefox for Windows 10+ with Cloud Clipboard enabled. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2021-38506: Firefox could be coaxed into going into fullscreen mode without notification or warning](#CVE-2021-38506)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan
Impact
high
##### Description

Through a series of navigations, Firefox could have entered fullscreen mode without notification or warning to the user. This could lead to spoofing attacks on the browser UI including phishing.

#### [#CVE-2021-38507: Opportunistic Encryption in HTTP2 could be used to bypass the Same-Origin-Policy on services hosted on other ports](#CVE-2021-38507)

Reporter
Takeshi Terada
Impact
high
##### Description

The Opportunistic Encryption feature of HTTP2 (RFC 8164) allows a connection to be transparently upgraded to TLS while retaining the visual properties of an HTTP connection, including being same-origin with unencrypted connections on port 80. However, if a second encrypted port on the same IP address (e.g. port 8443) did not opt-in to opportunistic encryption; a network attacker could forward a connection from the browser to port 443 to port 8443, causing the browser to treat the content of port 8443 as same-origin with HTTP. This was resolved by disabling the Opportunistic Encryption feature, which had low usage.

#### [#CVE-2021-43530: Universal XSS in Firefox for Android via QR Code URLs](#CVE-2021-43530)

Reporter
Hafiizh
Impact
high
##### Description

A Universal XSS vulnerability was present in Firefox for Android resulting from improper sanitization when processing a URL scanned from a QR code.
*This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1736886](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1736886)

#### [#CVE-2021-38508: Permission Prompt could be overlaid, resulting in user confusion and potential spoofing](#CVE-2021-38508)

Reporter
Raphael
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By displaying a form validity message in the correct location at the same time as a permission prompt (such as for geolocation), the validity message could have obscured the prompt, resulting in the user potentially being tricked into granting the permission.

##### References

* [Bug 1366818](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1366818)

#### [#CVE-2021-43531: Web Extensions could access pre-redirect URL when their context menu was triggered by a user](#CVE-2021-43531)

Reporter
Rob Wu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a user loaded a Web Extensions context menu, the Web Extension could access the post-redirect URL of the element clicked. If the Web Extension lacked the WebRequest permission for the hosts involved in the redirect, this would be a same-origin-violation leaking data the Web Extension should have access to. This was fixed to provide the pre-redirect URL. This is related to CVE-2021-43532 but in the context of Web Extensions.

* [Bug 1659155](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1659155)

#### [#CVE-2021-38509: Javascript alert box could have been spoofed onto an arbitrary domain](#CVE-2021-38509)

Reporter
Ademar Nowasky Junior
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Due to an unusual sequence of attacker-controlled events, a Javascript `alert()` dialog with arbitrary (although unstyled) contents could be displayed over top an uncontrolled webpage of the attacker's choosing.

* [Bug 1718571](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1718571)

#### [#CVE-2021-38510: Download Protections were bypassed by .inetloc files on Mac OS](#CVE-2021-38510)

Reporter
Hou JingYi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The executable file warning was not presented when downloading .inetloc files, which can run commands on a user's computer.
*Note: This issue only affected Mac OS operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1731779](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1731779)

#### [#CVE-2021-43532: 'Copy Image Link' context menu action could have been abused to see authentication tokens](#CVE-2021-43532)

Reporter
Ademar Nowasky Junior
Impact
low
##### Description

The 'Copy Image Link' context menu action would copy the final image URL after redirects. By embedding an image that triggered authentication flows - in conjunction with a Content Security Policy that stopped a redirection chain in the middle - the final image URL could be one that contained an authentication token used to takeover a user account. If a website tricked a user into copy and pasting the image link back to the page, the page would be able to steal the authentication tokens. This was fixed by making the action return the original URL, before any redirects.

Reporter
Taiga Shirakura
Impact
low
##### Description

When parsing internationalized domain names, high bits of the characters in the URLs were sometimes stripped, resulting in inconsistencies that could lead to user confusion or attacks such as phishing.

#### [#CVE-2021-43534: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 94 and Firefox ESR 91.3](#CVE-2021-43534)

Reporter
Mozilla developers
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Valentin Gosu, and Andrew McCreight reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 93 and Firefox ESR 91.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/93.0.4577.63 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

This report is about a Firefox's bug in opt-in process of OE (Opportunistic Encryption, RFC 8164).

Let's say the association between 80 (unencrypted) and 443 (encrypted) is made by opt-in checking using .well-known JSON. Then content from port 443 (i.e. alternative service) is treated as if it is provided from port 80. It means, by design, opted-in encrypted content can be read by unencrypted content thanks to Same Origin Policy.

---

## ■example.jp (IPAddr: 1.1.1.1) 80 - Open to the internet. /.well-known/http-opportunistic is placed. 443 (h2) - Same as port 80. 8443 (TLS) - It serves secret file.

The problem is that Firefox performs opt-in checking only in the first h2 connection to alternative service. This means active network attacker can forward second or sebsequent connection to a port other than 443 (8443 port above, encrypted, not opted-in). The encrypted content from 8443 port can be read by unencrypted content. This way, Firefox's implementation of OE put non opted-in TLS ports at risk.

An attack example is as follows. The attacker controls DNS records and has a server (2.2.2.2) on the internet. Port 8443 on example.jp (1.1.1.1) is the attack target.

---

## ■Attacker's server (IPAddr: 2.2.2.2) 80 - It serves a copy of .well-known JSON file and a page for attack.

(1)

Attacker manipulates DNS record: example.jp. 0 IN A 2.2.2.2.

Attacker configures port forwarding: 2.2.2.2:8443 to 1.1.1.1:443.

(2)

Victim user navigates to <http://example.jp/> (2.2.2.2).

> Alt-Svc: h2="example.jp:8443"; ma=120
>
> <iframe src="/test"></iframe>
>
> <script>
>
> // Get iframe source repeatedly
>
> setInterval(() => {
>
> var i = frames[0];
>
> i.location.reload();
>
> setTimeout(() => {console.log(i.document.body.textContent)}, 1000);
>
> }, 5000);
>
> </script>

Opt-in is OK because h2 connection to example.jp:8443 (2.2.2.2:8443) is forwarded to 1.1.1.1:443.

(3)

Attacker restores DNS record: example.jp. 0 IN A 1.1.1.1.

Attacker then shuts down port forwarding running at 2.2.2.2:8443.

JavaScript in (2) now fetches content from 8443 TLS with no errors.

Possible fix for this issue is to perform opt-in checking upon every new h2 connection to alternative service (obviously, non opted-in ports could detect this kind of attack by checking Alt-Used or Host header (port number), but necessity for such defense is not mentioned in RFC).

One more thing to note is that, incompliant with last paragraph of RFC 7838 section 2.4, Firefox checks ALPN protocol name ONLY on the first connection to alternative service. In other words, no protocol name checking is performed in the second and subsequent connections (same goes for upgrading http/1.1 TLS to h2). This increases the possibility of successful exploitation including cross-protocol attack, so it's safer to limit alternative service connections to h2/h3 only.

Seems pretty serious. A service needs to opt-in, but it seems like any would do. However, if a pair of ports (one unsecured, one secured) opt in, then all secured ports on the same host are vulnerable to this sort of exfiltration.

I think that the answer is essentially as suggested: request `/.well-known/http-opportunistic` from the alternative. What I suspect is happening here is that we do that, but the request to the alternative is being cached with the original <http://example.jp> origin. Attributing the request to that origin is what the spec requires. However, we probably aren't being sufficiently careful about segmenting the cache for these requests. Adding an additional origin attribute with the identity of the alternative for this entry might be necessary to avoid picking up a cache entry that was made on a previous connection to an alternative.

+Dragana who might be better able to work through the networking code here.

I'm less sure about the ALPN name check. In part because that check is not especially effective. That text was added to the spec to manage the risk of protocol version downgrade, but we have since learned a lot more about that (and invented new ways to downgrade things without detection; thanks QUIC). I don't think that we need to do anything that acknowledge that we are not compliant with that requirement. I don't see any significant security consequence from that. Yes, we might get worse TLS configuration if we attempt http/1.1, but our baseline profile is not so far from the h2 requirements that this is worth scrambling to put a fix in. That said, if we can ensure that we validate ALPN when we make requests to alternatives, it wouldn't hurt to do so. (I might track that part separately.)

I am not sure that I understand the last sentence. Are you suggesting to make the cache entry connected to a of a H2 connection. As long as a connection that was verified is alive the AltSvc can be used?

Anyway knowing our implementation, this can be fix (somewhat easy) but the consequence will be that the feature is even less often used.

Currently we do not block requests and wait for a validation to happen. If we require validation every time and we do not block, the feature will be use even less often.

Doing a proper fix, i.e. blocking requests, will need a bigger refactoring. Usage of this feature is not high to justify the refactoring at the moment.

I would suggest rather disabling the feature.

This would have been mitigated if the altSvc port was authenticated as well, but it is not.

I'm suggesting that you perform the validation for every connection that is used this way, but you allow the confirmation request to be cached to make it more performant, using an expanded cache key that includes the identity of the alternative. That would make the validation fast in those cases where the alternative doesn't move, but would ensure that validation is robust to changes in the alternative (including hostnames).

Of course, if this is easier to fix another way, even if it it means slower validation, that might be better.

(We can't validate the port number. That is in most ways a good thing, because validating ports is not a useful concept. I'm glad our forebears didn't authenticate it as port numbers are a poor substitute for identifying a service. I would say the same for ALPN as a protocol is not a service either. Not authenticating port is only not good in the sense that we have to deal with the ways that ports can swap around, like this case here.)

Calling this `sec-high` because it's a same-origin policy violation against the port that didn't opt-in. How serious would depend on how many servers use this kind of set up (an opted-in TLS port and other TLS services not opted-in).

Multiple security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox
web browser, which could potentially result in the execution
of arbitrary code, information disclosure or spoofing.

Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Firefox. Support
for the 78.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now
following the 91.x releases.

Between 78.x and 91.x, Firefox has seen a number of feature updates. For
more information please refer to
<https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/91.0esr/releasenotes/>

For the oldstable distribution (buster) one more final toolchain update
is needed, updated packages will shortly be available as 91.4.1esr-1~deb10u1

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problem have been fixed in
version 91.4.1esr-1~deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.

For the detailed security status of firefox-esr please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/firefox-esr>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
