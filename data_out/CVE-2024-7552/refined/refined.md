Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-7552 (based on the context of the content)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of input sanitization when processing user-controlled SpEL (Spring Expression Language) expressions. Specifically, the `org.datagear.persistence.support.ConversionSqlParamValueMapper#evaluateVariableExpression` function evaluates SpEL expressions without any filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SpEL Expression Injection:** The application directly evaluates user-provided input as a SpEL expression, allowing attackers to inject malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server where the application is running. This can lead to complete compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Data Schema Page Editing and Deletion Functions:** The vulnerability is present in the Data Schema page's editing and deletion functions. Specifically the vulnerable API interfaces are `/{schemaId}/{tableName}/edit` and `/{schemaId}/{tableName}/delete`.
- **User-Controlled Input:**  The SpEL expression is injected via data stored within the database which can be controlled by the user, which will then be processed when editing or deleting that data schema.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the DataGear application.
- **Database Access:** The attacker needs to be able to add a malicious entry to the database linked to the Data Schema.
- **Access to Data Schema Page:** The attacker needs access to the Data Schema page in the DataGear application.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code resides in `ConversionSqlParamValueMapper.java`
The function call chain for the vulnerable endpoints is:

**`/{schemaId}/{tableName}/edit`:**
```
DefaultPersistenceManager#get ->
DefaultPersistenceManager#buildUniqueRecordCondition ->
DefaultPersistenceManager#mapToSqlParamValue ->
ConversionSqlParamValueMapper#map ->
ConversionSqlParamValueMapper#resolveExpressionIf ->
ConversionSqlParamValueMapper#evaluateVariableExpressions ->
ConversionSqlParamValueMapper#evaluateVariableExpression
```
**`/{schemaId}/{tableName}/delete`:**
```
DefaultPersistenceManager#delete ->
DefaultPersistenceManager#buildUniqueRecordCondition ->
DefaultPersistenceManager#mapToSqlParamValue ->
ConversionSqlParamValueMapper#map ->
ConversionSqlParamValueMapper#resolveExpressionIf ->
ConversionSqlParamValueMapper#evaluateVariableExpressions ->
ConversionSqlParamValueMapper#evaluateVariableExpression
```
**Vulnerable Versions:**
- DataGear version 5.0.0 and earlier

**Mitigation:**
- The issue was fixed in version 5.1.0.

**Example Exploit:**
- The provided example uses the following SpEL code to execute a command, opening the calculator application on a MacOS system:
`#{T(java.lang.String).forName('java.lang.Runtime').getRuntime().exec('open -a Calculator')}`
-  A malicious database entry can be crafted with this SpEL expression in a field to trigger the vulnerability.
