  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insecure access control in user management function. The function checks if the provided session ID (SID) is valid and if the user ID (UID) is 8 (administrator). However, it does not prevent unprivileged users from modifying other unprivileged user accounts by providing a valid SID and setting UID=8.",

    "impact": "An attacker with a valid unprivileged session ID can add, remove, or modify user accounts. This could lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or further system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted POST request to the `/user_management/accounts.cgi` endpoint by providing a valid SID and setting UID to 8.",
   "required_capabilities": "Attacker requires a valid session ID obtained from a legitimate unprivileged user."
