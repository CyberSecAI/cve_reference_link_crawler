# Information disclosure through Python's "format" functionality

Moderate

[dataflake](/dataflake)
published
GHSA-8xv7-89vj-q48c
Sep 6, 2023

## Package

AccessControl

## Affected versions

<= 4.3, <= 5.7, <=6.1

## Patched versions

4.4, 6.2

Zope

<=4.8.8, <= 5.8.3

4.8.9, 5.8.4

## Description

### Impact

Python's "format" functionality allows someone controlling the format string to "read" objects accessible (recursively) via attribute access and subscription from accessible objects. Those attribute accesses and subscriptions use Python's full blown `getattr` and `getitem`, not the policy restricted `AccessControl` variants `_getattr_` and `_getitem_`. This can lead to critical information disclosure.

`AccessControl` already provides a safe variant for `str.format` and denies access to `string.Formatter`. However, `str.format_map` is still unsafe.

Affected are all users who allow untrusted users to create `AccessControl` controlled Python code and execute it.

### Patches

A fix will be introduced in the versions 4.4 and 6.2.

### Workarounds

There are no workarounds.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
