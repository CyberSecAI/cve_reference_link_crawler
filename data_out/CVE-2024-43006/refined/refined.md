Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability lies in the ask/show.php file, specifically at line 21. After retrieving the content parameter from the database, the application passes it through the stripfxg() function, which removes HTML character escaping, leading to the execution of injected scripts.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize user-provided content before displaying it on the page.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of a user's browser when they view the affected page. This could lead to:
    -Stealing cookies
    -Stealing session tokens
    -Other sensitive information being exposed
    -Potential for account hijacking

Attack vectors:
The attacker sends a specially crafted POST request to /user/ask_edit.php?action=add, embedding malicious JavaScript code within the 'content' parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to submit POST requests to the /user/ask_edit.php endpoint. No special privileges or positions are mentioned, implying an attacker can be any user able to submit the form with the mentioned parameters.
