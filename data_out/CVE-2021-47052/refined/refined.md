The provided content relates to a memory leak fix in the Linux kernel's `sa2ul` crypto driver, specifically addressing CVE-2021-47052.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `sa_run` function in `drivers/crypto/sa2ul.c` had two error return paths after calling `dma_map_sgtable` where the allocated `rxd` was not being freed, resulting in a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: Allocated memory for `rxd` was not freed in certain error conditions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion due to the unreleased memory on repeated use of the vulnerable code path.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the error return paths in `sa_run` function, by causing failure in `dma_map_sgtable`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the execution of the `sa_run` function and have some influence over the input to cause errors.
