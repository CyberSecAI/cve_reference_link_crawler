Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-41120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `pages/9_ðŸ”²_Vector_Data_Visualization.py` file.
*   The application takes a user-supplied URL as input.
*   This URL is passed to the `gpd.read_file` method, which fetches and processes the data from the given URL without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application makes requests to arbitrary URLs specified by the user. This is a blind SSRF because the application doesn't return the content of the response to the user but is still vulnerable to the issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can make the server send requests to internal resources or external services by controlling the URL passed as input, which can lead to the following:
    *   **Internal Port Scanning:** Attackers can probe internal services to find open ports and running services.
    *   **Access to Internal Services:** They can attempt to access internal web pages or APIs, potentially gaining access to sensitive data.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Making the server request large files from other servers could lead to server overload and denial of service.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** In some instances, an attacker might be able to exfiltrate data by sending requests to an external server they control with sensitive information encoded in the URL.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the user-controlled `url` variable within the `Vector Data Visualization` page of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker only needs the ability to interact with the application through its web interface.
*   No special privileges or internal network access is needed. The attacker can be anyone with access to the streamlit-geospatial application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates the SSRF by making the server fetch a local file from an attacker-controlled server.
*   The fix implemented in commit `c4f81d9616d40c60584e36abb15300853a66e489` addresses the vulnerability by introducing a whitelist of trusted URLs, and only makes requests if the provided URL is on the whitelist, preventing the SSRF by limiting the scope of allowed requests.
