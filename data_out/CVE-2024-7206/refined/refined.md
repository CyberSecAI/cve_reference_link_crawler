- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ability to extract firmware via a serial port connection and the lack of proper security measures allowing modification of the firmware, specifically the SSL certificate.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Firmware extraction vulnerability via serial port.
    - Lack of integrity checks on the firmware during updates enabling the attacker to modify and re-flash the device.
    - Hardcoded SSL pinning bypass that allows man-in-the-middle attacks by replacing the legitimate certificate with a malicious one.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Decryption of TLS communication between the device and the cloud server.
    - Extraction of secrets to clone the device.
    - Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, allowing for eavesdropping and manipulation of communication between the device and the server.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Physical access to the device to disassemble it.
    - Connecting the device to a PC via a serial port.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Physical access to the device.
    - Ability to disassemble the device.
    - Knowledge of serial port communication.
    - Technical skills to extract, modify, and re-flash firmware.
