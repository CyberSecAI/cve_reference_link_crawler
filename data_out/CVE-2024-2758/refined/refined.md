Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-2758:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper rate limiting on HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames within Tempesta FW. Specifically, rate limits are not enabled by default and when configured, they are either set too high to effectively block attacks using empty CONTINUATION frames, or too low to handle legitimate traffic. This results in the possibility of an attacker overwhelming the system with a large number of these frames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Lack of Default Rate Limiting:** The most significant weakness is that Tempesta FW does not enable rate limits for HTTP/2 traffic by default.
- **Improperly Configured Rate Limits:** When configured, the rate limits may not be set to effectively mitigate the attack using empty CONTINUATION frames
- **Unbounded Resource Consumption:** The lack of proper limits leads to a situation where an attacker can send an unlimited number of CONTINUATION frames, leading to excessive memory and CPU resource consumption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is the ability to launch a DoS attack against Tempesta FW installations, causing the system to become unavailable.
- **Out-of-Memory (OOM):** An attacker can trigger an OOM condition on the Tempesta FW host by flooding it with CONTINUATION frames.
- **CPU Resource Exhaustion:** Processing a large number of CONTINUATION frames, especially those that are HPACK Huffman encoded, can lead to excessive CPU utilization, further contributing to the DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the vulnerable Tempesta FW server.
- **HTTP/2 Protocol:** The attack exploits a weakness in the handling of HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target Tempesta FW server.
- **HTTP/2 Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand the HTTP/2 protocol and how to construct malicious packets with CONTINUATION frames.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is specifically related to Tempesta FW versions prior to 0.7.1
- Patched versions (0.7.1 and later) include fixes for empty HTTP/2 frames and default rate limits, which mitigate the OOM.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by setting appropriate rate limits on parameters like `http_max_header_list_size`, `http_header_cnt`, and `max_concurrent_streams`.

The provided content includes additional context about related vulnerabilities in other implementations and vendor responses to the broader issue of HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frame attacks, but the core vulnerability for CVE-2024-2758 lies within the inadequate rate limiting of Tempesta FW.
