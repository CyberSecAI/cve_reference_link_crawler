```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `Set3G`'s JSON `param` parser assumes that the `param` JSON element is an object, but it can be a string which leads to an assertion failure.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Input Validation",
    "The code does not validate if the JSON element is of type `object` before accessing it using the subscription operator."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a crafted HTTP request, causing the device to reboot.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP request with a JSON body that contains a \"Set3G\" command and an empty string as the \"param\" value.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device. While some of the described vulnerabilities require a logged-in user, the vulnerability can be exploited without authentication by using TALOS-2021-1420."
