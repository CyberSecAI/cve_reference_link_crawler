Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-2805:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a boundary check and type check issue within the Java code. Specifically, it appears to be related to how method types are handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Boundary Check Issue:**  There is an inadequate check on the boundaries or limits when processing method types, which can lead to out-of-bounds access.
*   **Type Check Issue:** There's a flaw in how types are checked and handled, which could lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allows for exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sandbox Bypass:** Successful exploitation of this issue could lead to a bypass of the Java sandbox restrictions. This can lead to arbitrary code execution which may lead to unauthorized takeover of Java, a partial or complete denial of service (DoS) of Java, or to the unauthorized reading or modification of a subset or all of the data accessible to the Java process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered remotely.
*   The attack vector involves some user interaction in the form of a user having to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to craft specific input or exploit the vulnerability through a method call that triggers the boundary or type check issue.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but they do need to induce a user to execute the malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in multiple Java implementations including OpenJDK and Oracle JDK/JRE, requiring fixes across these various projects.
*   Several sources mention that this vulnerability was fixed in the April 2020 CPU (Critical Patch Update).
*   The vulnerability is present in Java versions 7, 8 and 11.
*   NetApp has identified a number of their products that are vulnerable to this issue.

In summary, CVE-2020-2805 is a critical vulnerability due to its potential to bypass the Java sandbox. This allows an attacker to gain control of the Java process which can be used to execute arbitrary code, cause denial of service and/or access sensitive information. The vulnerability is triggered through crafted inputs or method calls and has a relatively high CVSS score of 8.3.
