{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a value retrieved from the database ($schoolname) in a subsequent SQL query without proper sanitization, leading to a second-order SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Second-order SQL injection. The application first stores unsanitized user input into the database, and later uses this stored value in another SQL query without proper sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Data loss and potential database shutdown. An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to modify or delete data in the `schoolinfo` table. They can also cause a database shutdown by injecting a shutdown command through SQL injection.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to inject malicious SQL code in the `schoolname` field, which is then stored in the database. Subsequently, the application uses this value in a vulnerable query.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to modify the `schoolname` field, likely through the application's interface where school information can be updated. This would require a user with permissions to edit school information."
