The provided content relates to CVE-2024-25728.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A bug in the split tunneling feature of ExpressVPN's Windows application caused DNS requests to be routed to the user's ISP's DNS server instead of ExpressVPN's server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- DNS requests were not being properly routed through the VPN when the "Only allow selected apps to use the VPN" split tunneling mode was active.
- This resulted in a DNS leak where the user's ISP could see the domains being visited.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The user's ISP could track the domains being visited, compromising their privacy.
- Although the ISP could see the domains visited, they could not see the individual web pages, searches, or other online behavior, as the content of the user's online traffic remained encrypted.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the user enables the "Only allow selected apps to use the VPN" split tunneling mode within the ExpressVPN Windows app versions 12.23.1 to 12.72.0

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker is the user's ISP.
- No special capabilities are needed from the attacker beyond having control over the user's DNS server. The attacker has a passive observation point.

**Additional details:**
- The issue affected less than 1% of users, specifically those using the split tunneling feature on the Windows version of the app.
- ExpressVPN temporarily removed the split tunneling feature in version 12 to mitigate the issue.
-  The vulnerability was reported by a CNET reviewer, Attila Tomaschek
- ExpressVPN released version 12.73.0 which addresses this issue, as well as an audit report to verify the fix.
