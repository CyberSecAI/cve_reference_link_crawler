- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application lacks access control for accessing files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control (CWE-284).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker with low privileges can gain access to sensitive information. The attacker could potentially also modify data, since the CVSS vector includes a high impact for integrity.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated with low privileges (PR:L). The attack requires high attack complexity (AC:H).
