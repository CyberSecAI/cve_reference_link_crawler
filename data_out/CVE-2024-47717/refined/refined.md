Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-47717.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the `kvm_pmu_clear_snapshot_area` function in the RISC-V KVM implementation attempting to zero out the PMU snapshot area in guest memory before freeing the data. This occurs during guest teardown or when the guest changes the PMU snapshot area of a VCPU.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Null pointer dereference:** The `kvm_vcpu_write_guest` function is called with `kvpmu->sdata` which can be NULL, leading to a crash. Specifically, this occurs when the guest is forcefully powered-off during guest tear down. This also happens if the guest reclaims the previous PMU snapshot for a different purpose.
- **Incorrect memory management:** The code attempts to write to guest memory that may no longer be valid.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: The NULL pointer dereference leads to a kernel panic, resulting in denial of service for the host.

**Attack vectors:**
- Forcefully powering off a guest with SBI PMU snapshot enabled.
- Changing PMU snapshot area of a VCPU

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to control or trigger the power-off of a guest that has SBI PMU snapshot enabled.
- The attacker must have the ability to change PMU snapshot area of a VCPU.
- The attacker would need to have a guest running on a vulnerable system.
