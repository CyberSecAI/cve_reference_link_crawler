Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Translation module in Liferay Portal versions 7.4.3.12 through 7.4.3.36 does not properly check permissions before allowing users to export web content for translation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing authorization check:** The system fails to verify if a user has the necessary permissions to export web content for translation. This allows any user, even unauthenticated ones, to potentially access the exported data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized data access:** An attacker can download the XLIFF translation file of web content pages without proper authorization, potentially exposing sensitive information within the content.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted URL:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted URL to download the XLIFF translation file for a specific web content page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote attacker:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any specific privileges to exploit this vulnerability. They simply need to know or guess a valid resource identifier.
