- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from improper validation of user-supplied data within the parsing of J2K files. This lack of validation leads to a write operation that extends beyond the boundaries of an allocated memory object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires user interaction, as the target must either visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious J2K file or host a malicious webpage that triggers the vulnerability when processed by the vulnerable software. The attacker does not require any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability, only that the user interacts with the crafted content.
