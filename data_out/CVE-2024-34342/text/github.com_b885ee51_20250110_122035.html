By default, pdfjs-dist optimizes some path resolution logic by compiling
a JavaScript function on the fly. The function is built using string
concatenation and no effort is made at sanitizing the parts it is
built from. These parts could contain user-input which leads to a code
injection vulnerability. This commit disables this default behavior.
An alternative is to upgrade pdfjs-dist to v4.2.67 or later.

```
By default, pdfjs-dist optimizes some path resolution logic by compiling
a JavaScript function on the fly. The function is built using string
concatenation and no effort is made at sanitizing the parts it is
built from. These parts could contain user-input which leads to a code
injection vulnerability. This commit disables this default behavior.
An alternative is to upgrade pdfjs-dist to v4.2.67 or later.

| This PR is associated with the fix for [CVE-2024-4367](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/security/advisories/GHSA-wgrm-67xf-hhpq) .  The advisory currently mentions `<= 4.1.392`, but in practice the version ranges are different, the precise details are below. Despite the presence of a version range that is unaffected by this specific bug, I still recommend using the latest versions only (v4.2.67+) because these older versions are also affected by another vulnerability ([CVE-2018-5158](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7jg2-jgv3-fmr4 "CVE-2018-5158"); I've filed a PR to update the right metadata in Github's advisory database at [github/advisory-database#4456](https://github.com/github/advisory-database/pull/4456)).

This is an odd way to increment a for loop.

If you think we can do better, please file an issue and write a PR, thank you.

Just for your information, each command is followed by its arguments where their length depends on the command.

So here, after `i++`, `i` is the position for the first argument, and then each `case` will increment it depending on the number of arguments.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Apologies -- I didn't realize `i` was also being incremented in the switch block. I withdraw my comment.
