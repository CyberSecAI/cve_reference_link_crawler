react-pdf displays PDFs in React apps. If PDF.js is used to load a malicious PDF, and PDF.js is configured with `isEvalSupported` set to `true` (which is the default value), unrestricted attacker-controlled JavaScript will be executed in the context of the hosting domain. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.7.3 and 8.0.2.
