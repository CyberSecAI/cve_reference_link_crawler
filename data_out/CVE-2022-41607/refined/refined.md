The provided content is related to CVE-2022-41607.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, also known as a path traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Path Traversal (CWE-22): The application programmable interface (API) of ETIC Telecom Remote Access Server (RAS) versions 4.5.0 and prior is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could read sensitive files from the server, including:
  - SSH private keys
  - Passwords
  - Scripts
  - Python objects
  - Database files
  - other potentially sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is exploitable through the application's API.
- The attack vector is adjacent network access with low complexity (AV:A/AC:L)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be on the adjacent network.
- The attacker needs to have high privileges on the device (PR:H)
