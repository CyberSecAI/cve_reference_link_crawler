## Executive Summary / tl;dr

Following on from our previous 22.1.1 security hardening release, PaperCut NG and PaperCut MF 22.1.3 contains patches to address vulnerabilities identified through our security uplift program, which includes internal pen testing, code audits as well as engagement with industry leading partners in the infosec community. We recommend all customers plan an upgrade to this release.

PaperCut would like to thank the infosec community who have assisted with our continued security uplift for PaperCut NG/MF over the last few months. In particular we would like to thank Naveen Sunkavally and the team at Horizon 3, researchers at Trend Micro and researchers from Tenable, Inc.

## Security Issues Addressed

### Potential Denial of Service Issue (CVE-2023-3486)

We want to thank the security researchers at Tenable who reported a means that could allow an unauthenticated attacker with direct server IP access to upload arbitrary files into a target directory. This could be used to fill up the server’s hard disk and prevent the PaperCut server from operating as expected. This issue is also known as “TRA-2023-23” by Tenable.

This vulnerability has been rated with a CVSS score of 7.4:
(CVSSv3 Vector: [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C&amp;version=3.1))

*Note: Tenable are looking to publicly disclose additional information in the upcoming weeks.*

*Update: Tenable released their public disclosure on 28th August 2023, titled [PaperCut NG Unauthenticated File Upload](https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2023-23).*

### Chained Path Traversal in Authenticated API (CVE-2023-39143)

The security research team at Horizon3.ai carried out complex security research to identify two path traversal vulnerabilities which could be potentially leveraged to read and write arbitrary files. Direct server IP access is required. The Horizon3.ai team has worked with PaperCut to mitigate and validate our fixes.

The PaperCut development team would like to thank Naveen and the research team at Horizon3.ai. We would like to acknowledge their sophisticated research methods as finding and demonstrating the issue required chaining multiple complex steps together. It is probably some of the most in-depth research that has ever been applied to PaperCut.

This vulnerability has been rated with a CVSS score of 8.4:
(CVSSv3 Vector: [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1))

*Note: Horizon3.ai are looking to publicly disclose additional information in the upcoming weeks.*

*Update: Horizon3.ai released their disclosure on 5th August 2023: [CVE-2023-39143: PaperCut Path Traversal/File Upload RCE Vulnerability](https://www.horizon3.ai/cve-2023-39143-papercut-path-traversal-file-upload-rce-vulnerability/)*

### Third Party Library Update (ZDI-CAN-21013)

A vulnerability was found in a third party dependency used to support the PostgreSQL database (CVE-2022-21724). Someone who already has administrator access to a PaperCut server could use this exploit to gain further privileges. Thanks to the team at TrendMicro that demonstrated that PaperCut could be potentially susceptible to this third party dependency issue.

*Note: TrendMicro are looking to publicly disclose additional information in the upcoming weeks.*

### Miscellaneous security improvements

A number of pre-emptive security improvements were made as a result of code audits, pen tests and security reviews. Changes were made in line with our security uplift initiative.

## FAQs

Q Where can I get the upgrade?

The **Check for updates** link in the PaperCut NG/MF admin interface allows customers to download the latest version of PaperCut NG or MF. You will find this at **PaperCut NG/MF Admin interface > About > Version info > Check for updates**.

You can also find your PaperCut partner or reseller information on the **Help** tab (or **About** tab in older versions) on the PaperCut Web admin interface.

Alternatively, direct downloads are available on the [upgrade page](https://www.papercut.com/products/upgrade/). It’s easy to identify your edition of PaperCut - it’s on the **About** tab and in the footer of your PaperCut Web admin login.

Q What products are impacted by these vulnerabilities?

See the *“Impacted Product Status”* section above for a detailed list.

Q Is there anything I should be aware of before applying the upgrade?

Yes, potentially. If you are upgrading from a version prior to 22.1.1 you should read the [upgrade checklist for 22.1.1](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/22-1-1-upgrade-checklist).

Otherwise if you’re using KM production series devices with Integrated Scanning, ensure you review [Known Issue CDSS-2840](https://papercut.com/support/known-issues/?id=CDSS-2840#mf). This will hopefully be resolved in PaperCut MF version 23.0.0.

Q I am running an old version. Do I need to upgrade to a prior version before upgrading to 22.1.3?

No. This release includes all previous fixes released, and you can upgrade directly to this release from any previous version of PaperCut NG/MF.

Q I’m running version 20.x or 21.x and due to operational reasons, I can’t upgrade to 22. Are hotfixes available for these older versions?

*Please note that this answer has been updated as of 12th September 2023.*

Updates are now available for older supported builds. These updates contain fixes for the key security vulnerabilities listed above:
