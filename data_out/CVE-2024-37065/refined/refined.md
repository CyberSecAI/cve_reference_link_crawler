The provided content is a security advisory for CVE-2024-37065, detailing a vulnerability in the Skops library.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure deserialization of model data within the Skops library. Specifically, the library allows for the loading of arbitrary functions and their subsequent execution when compiling `OperatorFuncNode` nodes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502):** Skops allows loading of `TypeNode` and `OperatorFuncNode` which enable the loading of arbitrary functions, including built-in functions like `eval`.
*   **Arbitrary Function Execution:** The `OperatorFuncNode` allows calling a specified function within the `operator` module. With Python 3.11+, `operator.call` can be used to execute any loaded function, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can craft a malicious model that, when loaded, executes arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to full system compromise, depending on the privileges of the process loading the model.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Model Loading:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user or system into loading a specially crafted Skops model.
*   **Trusted Parameter Bypass:** Even if the user attempts to limit trusted types, the vulnerability can still be exploited through certain library functions that set the trusted parameter to `True`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Provide Malicious Model:** The attacker must be able to provide a malicious Skops model to a system that uses the library.
*   **User Interaction (Potentially):** Exploitation requires the victim to load the malicious model file, which could occur due to user interaction or through an automated process.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Skops v0.6 and newer.
*   The advisory provides a proof-of-concept payload that uses the `eval` function to execute arbitrary code.
*   The advisory also mentions that the vulnerability can be exploited in multiple parts of the codebase, including the command-line update tool
