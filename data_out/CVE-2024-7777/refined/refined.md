Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

*   The Wordfence article explicitly mentions `CVE-2024-7777` and describes an arbitrary file read and deletion vulnerability in the "Contact Form by Bit Form" plugin, which matches the provided CVE ID.
*   The Trac links provided by Wordfence point to the vulnerable functions in the `AdminAjax.php` file within the specified plugin.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The plugin suffers from insufficient file path validation in multiple functions. This means that the plugin does not properly sanitize or restrict file paths provided by a user (in this case, an administrator).

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue. By manipulating input, an attacker can read and delete files outside of the intended directory.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can read the contents of arbitrary files on the server. This includes sensitive data such as configuration files, database credentials, and user information.
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Attackers can delete arbitrary files on the server. Deleting critical files, such as `wp-config.php`, can lead to complete disruption of the WordPress site.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Deleting `wp-config.php` can lead to remote code execution by forcing a reinstallation of wordpress and then setting up a new administrative user with malicious intent.

**5. Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through the WordPress AJAX interface, specifically, by sending requests to `AdminAjax.php`.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated Administrator Access:** An attacker needs to have administrator-level access or higher to exploit the vulnerability. This means an attacker would first have to compromise the WordPress admin panel to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code resides in the `AdminAjax.php` file of the Bit Form plugin.
*   Specific functions within this file are vulnerable, including:
    *   `deleteAForm` (line 829)
    *   `deleteBlukForm` (line 852)
    *    `deleteBlukFormEntries` (line 875)
    *   `duplicateFormEntry` (line 898)
*  These functions are called using WordPress AJAX actions and do not validate the file paths being supplied in the requests.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability exists in plugin versions `2.0` to `2.13.9`, and is patched in version `2.13.10`.
