- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The TinyMCE notification system displayed HTML content unfiltered, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unfiltered HTML in notifications.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the current user within the TinyMCE UI. This could also impact integrations using TinyMCE notifications.
- **Attack vectors:** Requires a user to have already inserted crafted malicious content into the editor and triggered a notification.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to insert malicious content that can trigger a TinyMCE notification and a user to interact with the notification.
