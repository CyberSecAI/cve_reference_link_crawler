Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw located in the `pda/reportshop/next_detail.php` file of Tongda OA software.
- The `$repid` parameter within this script is not properly sanitized or validated before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the lack of proper input sanitization of the `$repid` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Compromise:** Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to:
    - Data extraction: Accessing sensitive information stored in the database.
    - Data manipulation: Modifying or deleting data.
    - Potential further compromise of the system.
- The provided example demonstrates that the attacker can determine the database name (in this case, `td_oa`).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is via a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `next_detail.php` endpoint.
- **Manipulated `repid` Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the `repid` parameter of the GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server hosting the Tongda OA application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the location of the vulnerable script (`pda/reportshop/next_detail.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`repid`).
- **Basic SQL knowledge:** Attacker requires to be familiar with SQL to craft injection payloads.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable software is identified as Beijing Tongda Xinke Technology Co., Ltd Tongda OA versions v2017 to v11.10.
- The provided exploit examples demonstrate how to extract the database name using SQL injection techniques such as `substr` and `char` functions.
- The exploit leverages the `information_schema.columns` to generate an error that can be used for blind SQL injection techniques.
