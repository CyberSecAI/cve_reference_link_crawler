- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Sensitive information is included in diagnostic files exported by the @CT application. The archive containing more detailed information is protected with a hardcoded password within the @CT application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inclusion of sensitive information in diagnostic files, use of a hardcoded password.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Loss of confidentiality through analysis of the diagnostic files. Attackers can access sensitive information about the appliance by using the hardcoded password.
- **Attack vectors**: Downloading and analyzing diagnostic files exported by the @CT application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires high privileges (PR:H) and high complexity (AC:H) to access the diagnostic files from the network (AV:N) and exploit this vulnerability.
