- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization controls on some REST API endpoints in Cisco NDFC.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient authorization controls on specific REST API endpoints.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker can read or write files, perform limited network-admin functions, like reading device configuration information, uploading files, and modifying uploaded files.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted API requests to the vulnerable REST API endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker.
