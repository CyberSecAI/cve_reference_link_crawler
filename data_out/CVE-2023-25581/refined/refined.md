Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-25581:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `InternalAttributeHandler` class of the `pac4j-core` library. Specifically, the `restore` method deserializes untrusted data from a string attribute if it starts with the prefix `{#sb64}`. The `prepare` method doesn't check if a string value already starts with this prefix, making it vulnerable to injection. If an attacker can control an attribute value that gets stored, they can inject a serialized Java object with this prefix, leading to the deserialization of the object when the attribute is restored.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure deserialization: The application deserializes untrusted data without proper validation or sanitization.
- Lack of input validation: The `prepare` method does not check if a string value already starts with the `{#sb64}` prefix before serializing it.
- Reliance on prefix: The vulnerability relies on a prefix to determine if a value should be deserialized which is easily spoofable if the attacker controls the attribute values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By crafting a malicious serialized Java object, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable application.
- Other potential impacts: Even if RCE is not immediately achievable, insecure deserialization can potentially lead to privilege escalation, arbitrary file access, and denial-of-service attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Injection of malicious string attributes: An attacker can inject a specially crafted string containing a serialized Java object with the `{#sb64}` prefix into an attribute of the `UserProfile` class. This could be an attribute such as `username` or `email`, or any attribute that gets stored by the application.
-  The application will then store and restore the data via the prepare and restore methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to control attribute values: The attacker needs to be able to control the value of at least one attribute stored in the `UserProfile` to inject their malicious payload. This may be done via normal application functionality.
- Knowledge of Java serialization: The attacker needs to be familiar with Java object serialization and have the means to create a serialized object for exploitation, like using `ysoserial`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in `pac4j-core` versions prior to 4.0.
- The vulnerability exists because the `InternalAttributeHandler` class stores and retrieves various types of attributes. When it comes to storing objects of an arbitrary type, it uses Java serialization with `ObjectInputStream` and adds a special prefix `{#sb64}`.
- Although a `RestrictedObjectInputStream` is used it does not prevent all deserialization attacks.
- The provided `ysoserial` link references a tool that is often used to exploit Java deserialization vulnerabilities.
- The Portswigger link provides further explanation of general insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.
