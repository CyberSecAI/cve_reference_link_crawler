Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the Faculty Evaluation System v1.0, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist in various input fields throughout the application.
- Reflected XSS vulnerability is also present via the 'page' parameter in the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution within the context of the victim's browser.
- This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, credential theft, or other malicious activities.
- Stored XSS means the malicious script is saved in the system and triggers each time a user visits the affected page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Stored XSS:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into various input fields, such as:
    - User profile fields (First Name, Last Name)
    - Subject, Description fields under "Manage subject"
    - Class-related fields under "Manage class"
    - Year field under "Manage academic year"
    - Question field under "Manage questionnaire"
    - Criteria field in "Manage criteria"
    - Faculty details fields (School ID, First Name, Last Name)
    - Student details fields (School ID, First Name, Last Name)
- **Reflected XSS:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `page` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to input data into the vulnerable fields.
- For stored XSS, a higher privilege user can inject the payload, and lower privilege users become the victim when accessing the affected page.
- For reflected XSS, the attacker needs to craft a URL containing the malicious payload.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to visit the malicious URL or visit the page with stored payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the Faculty Evaluation System.
- The identified vulnerabilities are classified as A03-Injection type in OWASP TOP 10 2021.
- CHT Security discovered and reported the vulnerability.
- The exploit can be triggered with simple XSS syntax such as `<script>alert(1)</script>`, `<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>` , and more complex payloads.
