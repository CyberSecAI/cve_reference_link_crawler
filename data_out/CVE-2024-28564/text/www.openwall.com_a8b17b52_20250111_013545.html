Hi Tianyu,

Indeed, it seems so! I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

I conducted a search on MITRE for the library and found several current CVEs,
but I did not come across this specific report. Given that they are fairly recent,
there might have been a period during which they were not yet visible in public searches.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention!

Best regards,

Michael Knap
