The content is related to CVE-2023-49595.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow in the `rollback_control_code` function within the Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK's `boa` web server. The vulnerability occurs due to a lack of bounds checking when processing a user-provided string parameter during URL decoding, leading to a buffer overflow when copying to the fixed-size stack buffer `tmpBuf`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121). The `rollback_control_code` function copies data into a fixed-size buffer (`tmpBuf`) without verifying the length of the input string after performing URL decode sequence replacements.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by overwriting the stack with attacker-controlled data due to the buffer overflow in `rollback_control_code`.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/boafrm/formWlEncrypt` API of the `boa` web server with a long `pskValue<wlan_id>` parameter. The web server processes this request, eventually passing the value to the vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device's web interface, and knowledge of the API is needed to construct the malicious request. Authentication to the device's web interface might also be required, with default credentials potentially allowing exploitation.
