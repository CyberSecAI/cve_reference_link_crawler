**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the Intelligence plugin not preventing direct access to the `/vendor/levelten/intel/realtime/index.php` file and the `display_errors` setting being enabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated full path disclosure vulnerability.
- Insecure direct object reference due to lack of access control on the `index.php` file.
- Enabled `display_errors` setting which leaks sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of the full path of the web application.
- This information can be used to aid other attacks, but by itself is not useful without other existing vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Unauthenticated attacker directly accesses `/vendor/levelten/intel/realtime/index.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the web application and have knowledge of the vulnerable file location.
