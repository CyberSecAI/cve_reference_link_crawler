Today, I want to follow up the previous post ([https://medium.com/@mfortinsec/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-phpjabbers-part-2-4fa5e2ccfe2e](/%40mfortinsec/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-phpjabbers-part-2-4fa5e2ccfe2e)) about some additional vulnerabilities discovered through a recent collaborative security research project. This was done through a local group called the Atlantic CyberSecurity Collective.

Our team, consisting of a diverse and talented group of researchers, has conducted an extensive security review on the PHPJabbers collection of scripts, and during our research, we came across some significant security vulnerabilities. It’s worth mentioning that these vulnerabilities, if exploited, could potentially pose serious threats to user data and the overall integrity of these products. We submitted our findings to MITRE, a globally recognized cybersecurity standards organization. Consequently, these vulnerabilities were validated and assigned the following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers:

* CVE-2023–40748
* CVE-2023–40749
* CVE-2023–40750
* CVE-2023–40751
* CVE-2023–40752
* CVE-2023–40753
* CVE-2023–40754
* CVE-2023–40755
* CVE-2023–40756
* CVE-2023–40757
* CVE-2023–40758
* CVE-2023–40759
* CVE-2023–40760
* CVE-2023–40761
* CVE-2023–40762
* CVE-2023–40763
* CVE-2023–40764
* CVE-2023–40765
* CVE-2023–40766
* CVE-2023–40767

Note that we are all professionals with full time jobs and other responsibilities. With the sheer amount of products in the PHP Jabbers lineup and limited time available, we weren’t able to assess every single product. There is a lot of code reuse in those applications, so it would be safe to assume most vulnerabilities are present in other products.

Members of the research group conducted some additional research in PHP Jabbers products and found vulnerabilities which aren’t addressed in this disclosure.

We informed the PHP Jabbers team through their online forms, but were completely ignored. Each of our attempts at communicating these vulnerabilities was met with silence and an almost instantaneous “closed” status to our submitted tickets.

Our intentions behind sharing this information aren’t to tarnish the vendor’s reputation or stir up panic among its user base. Instead, we aim to encourage proactive and transparent collaboration within the cybersecurity community. It’s crucial to remember that we all share the same goal — enhancing the overall security of products and fostering a safer digital world for users.

In the sections to follow, we will delve into each of the identified vulnerabilities:

“

If you need programming done for your site PHPJabbers will get the job done for you. They worked with me on my project until it was exactly as I envisioned it would be. They work fast too and stay with you until you're satisfied with the work they produced for you. I'll definitely be back again for any other programming needs I have in the future. My hat's off to this team! Thank you so much for your expertise in writing my program! It turned out perfect!

“

When I learned that I'd have to send some money into the ether to a group of code and Bulgarian script writers completely unknown to me, well I was a little apprehensive. But my friend John testified that they were a great bunch to work with. Well, I can now give witness too. Brilliant bunch of guys, very responsive, attentive, keen to please. I am thrilled with the results and won't hesitate to use them many times over. I'm not, nor never will be a hard coder. Nice to know that PHPJabbers and their support team has me covered.

“

PHPJabbers.com is a one-stop solution for all your web-based needs! Straight up! I have had a privilege working with PHPJabbers where they went head on with several projects and brought outstanding results. Their support time is really great - I usually get a reply within 10 - 15 minutes. If I don't, then I automatically assume they are either working on my project or they are not in the office ;-)

Their PHP scripts are very well thought out as a programmer's perspective and everything is wrote and thought out from scratch! They have tied me in a long-lasting relationship. I keep coming back to them every time I need help!

Thank you, especially Alexander 'Sasho' Valkanov for being an excellent support!
