Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL Injection vulnerability in the pharmacy-management-system. Specifically, the vulnerability lies within the `preview.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries through the `invoice_number` parameter in the `/preview.php` URI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privileges:** The vulnerability can be exploited to potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify or delete sensitive data, and possibly escalate privileges.
    
**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `/preview.php` endpoint. The `invoice_number` parameter within the URL is vulnerable to SQL Injection.
- The provided `sqlmap` command demonstrates this, indicating the parameter is injectable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No specific authentication is mentioned as a requirement for exploitation. However, cookies such as 'Admin-Token' are present in the request, which might indicate that the attacker must bypass authorization, or this token itself could be a target.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/preview.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`invoice_number`).

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided `sqlmap` command and the example request demonstrate a typical SQL injection attack, where the attacker manipulates the `invoice_number` to inject SQL commands.
- The request example also provides IP address and port, which might provide useful information for targeting the system.
- The specific version of the affected product code base is identified (commit<=a2efc8442931ec9308f3b4cf4778e5701153f4e5).
