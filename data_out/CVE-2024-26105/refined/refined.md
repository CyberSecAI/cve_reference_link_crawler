    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)",
      "CWE-79"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
     "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely (AV:N) with low attack complexity (AC:L). An attacker with low privileges (PR:L) can inject malicious scripts, which will be executed when a user interacts with the affected application component (UI:R).",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L) to inject malicious scripts. A user interaction (UI:R) is needed for the injected script to execute."
