- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Input Validation vulnerability in prior Dell BIOS versions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper input validation. Sending malicious input to an SMI (System Management Interrupt) allows an attacker to bypass security controls in SMM (System Management Mode).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Bypassing security controls in SMM, potentially leading to compromise of the affected systems. The vulnerability allows for high confidentiality and integrity impact with low availability impact.
- **Attack vectors**: Locally authenticated malicious user sending crafted input to an SMI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local access with high privileges on the target system.
