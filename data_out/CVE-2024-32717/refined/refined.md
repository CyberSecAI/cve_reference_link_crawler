Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a "Broken Access Control" issue in the SchedulePress WordPress plugin. This means that the plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in certain functions. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Broken Access Control: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks.
- Allows unauthorized access to privileged actions

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user (specifically mentioned as a "Subscriber") can perform actions they should not be able to. The specific impact of this depends on the function being exploited and what it allows the user to do. 
- The content notes that this vulnerability is considered "moderately dangerous and expected to become exploited".

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the vulnerable plugin functionality that is missing access control checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs to have "Subscriber" level privileges on the WordPress site.
