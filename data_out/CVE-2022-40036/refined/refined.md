Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an improper authorization vulnerability in the `/adminGetUserList` endpoint. This endpoint allows access to sensitive user information without proper permission checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks before allowing access to the `/adminGetUserList` endpoint. This allows unauthorized users to access sensitive data.
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The vulnerability leads to the exposure of sensitive user information including usernames and passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can gain access to user credentials, including passwords.
- **Account Takeover:** With exposed credentials, attackers can potentially take over user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Access to the Vulnerable Endpoint:** An attacker can directly access the `/adminGetUserList` endpoint after logging in with a regular user account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Registered Account:** An attacker needs a registered user account on the system to log in and access the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Basic Knowledge of Application Endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the existence of `/adminGetUserList` endpoint.
