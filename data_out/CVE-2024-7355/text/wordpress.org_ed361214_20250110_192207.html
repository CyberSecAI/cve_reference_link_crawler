I had quite a complex chart to create so I purchased the premium version which isn’t expensive. I did have an issue with the layout but the tech support guys fixed it the same day.

Great module with great support!
It would even be better if there would be a drag and drop function and if you could create more complicated charts, but the current features are solid.
