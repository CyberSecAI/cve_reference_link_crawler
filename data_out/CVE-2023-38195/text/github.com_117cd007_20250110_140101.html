| A vulnerability has been found affecting Seq instances that use external ([SQL Server](https://docs.datalust.co/docs/using-sql-server-as-a-metastore) or [PostgreSQL](https://docs.datalust.co/docs/using-postgresql-as-a-metastore)) metadata storage.  A high level of existing access/privilege is required in order to exploit the vulnerability (a level of infrastructure access normally held by administrative users is required).  Datalust advises that all Seq instances using SQL Server or PostgreSQL metadata storage should be updated to Seq `2023.2.9489` or later.  **Affected versions:** Seq versions prior to `2023.2.9489` using SQL Server or PostgreSQL metadata storage are affected. **Fix version:** `2023.2.9489`. **CVE#:** [CVE-2023-38195](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hwvv-cf85-p845 "CVE-2023-38195") Detecting use of the SQL Server or PostgreSQL metadata store Seq normally uses a local filesystem-based store for configuration data. In some environments, SQL Server or PostgreSQL may be used instead. External metadata storage requires additional opt-in configuration as well as infrastructure provisioning.  The easiest way to confirm whether SQL Server or PostgreSQL is in use is to download a diagnostic report from *Settings > Diagnostics* in the Seq UI, and look for either:  ``` Using SQL Metastore           : Yes  ```  or  ``` Using PostgreSQL Metastore    : Yes  ```  in the *Server Configuration* section.  Otherwise, if a diagnostic report is not available, use of external metadata storage can be detected by the presence of a value in any of the following:   * The `metastore.postgres.connectionString` or `metastore.msSql.connectionString` settings, accessed using either `seq config get` or `seq secret get` from an Administrative PowerShell prompt (Windows), or * The `metastore.postgres.connectionString` or `metastore.msSql.connectionString` settings, accessed using either `seqsvr config get` or `seqsvr secret get` from a shell prompt within the Docker container, or * The `SEQ_METASTORE_POSTGRES_CONNECTIONSTRING` or `SEQ_METASTORE_MSSQL_CONNECTIONSTRING` environment variables (Windows and Docker). |
