```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `at_cmd_get_name` function in the RT-Thread AT server lacks a length check when copying data from `cmd_buffer` to `cmd_name`. This results in a stack buffer overflow if the length of the command exceeds the buffer size of `cmd_name`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability could lead to a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution if the overflow can be exploited to overwrite critical data or execution flow.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted command to the RT-Thread AT server that is longer than the buffer allocated for the command name (`cmd_name`).",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send commands to the RT-Thread AT server, meaning they would need network access to a device running the vulnerable RT-Thread configuration or a means to provide input to the AT server interface."
