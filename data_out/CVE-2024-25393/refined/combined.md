| Hi,  I would like to report another potential vulnerability in the current version of RT-Thread. Please let me know if you plan to ask for a CVE ID in case the vulnerability is confirmed. I'm available if you need further clarifications. Potential stack buffer overflow in RT-Thread AT serverSummary I spotted a potential stack buffer overflow vulnerability at the following location in the RT-Thread AT server source code: <https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/blob/master/components/net/at/src/at_server.c#L410> Details Lack of length check in the `at_cmd_get_name()` function could lead to a stack buffer overflow at the marked line:  ``` #ifdef AT_USING_SERVER ... static rt_err_t at_cmd_get_name(const char *cmd_buffer, char *cmd_name) {     rt_size_t cmd_name_len = 0, i = 0;      RT_ASSERT(cmd_name);     RT_ASSERT(cmd_buffer);      for (i = 0; i < strlen(cmd_buffer); i++)     {         if (*(cmd_buffer + i) == AT_CMD_QUESTION_MARK || *(cmd_buffer + i) == AT_CMD_EQUAL_MARK                 || *(cmd_buffer + i) == AT_CMD_CR                 || (*(cmd_buffer + i) >= AT_CMD_CHAR_0 && *(cmd_buffer + i) <= AT_CMD_CHAR_9))         {             cmd_name_len = i;             rt_memcpy(cmd_name, cmd_buffer, cmd_name_len); /* VULN: cmd_buffer is AT_SERVER_RECV_BUFF_LEN bytes (256), while cmd_name is only AT_CMD_NAME_LEN bytes (16); therefore, it might be possible to overflow past the cmd_name buffer with a carefully crafted cmd_buffer */             *(cmd_name + cmd_name_len) = '\0';              return RT_EOK;         }     }      return -RT_ERROR; } ``` Impact If the unchecked input above is confirmed to be attacker-controlled and crossing a security boundary, the impact of the reported buffer overflow vulnerability could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution. |

| Hi, it's been one month since I reported this vulnerability, and I wanted to ask if you have any update. As standard practice, I plan to request a CVE ID for every confirmed vulnerability. I also intend to publish an advisory by February at the latest, unless there's a specific reason to postpone. Thanks! |

### Multiple vulnerabilities in RT-Thread RTOS

> *“Security is in the mind of the programmer and in the mind of the designer.*
>
> *Not so much in the code.”*
>
> *— Alisa Esage*

### Summary

Welcome to another episode in [my journey](https://security.humanativaspa.it/ost2-zephyr-rtos-and-a-bunch-of-cves/) as a glorified static analysis tool for real-time operating systems!

This time, our target of choice is [RT-Thread](https://www.rt-thread.io/), an open-source, community-based **real-time operating system (RTOS)**. RT-Thread can be used in sensing nodes, wireless connection chips, and many other resource-constrained scenarios. It is also widely applied in gateways, IPC, smart speakers, and other high-performance **IoT applications**.

I reviewed RT-Thread’s [source code](https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread) hosted on GitHub and identified multiple **security vulnerabilities** that may cause memory corruption and security feature bypass. Their impacts range from **denial of service** to potential **arbitrary code execution**.

During the source code review I also audited the [lwIP](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/) and [TinyDir](https://github.com/cxong/tinydir) codebases on which some RT-Thread functionalities depend, and found [some](https://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/lwip.git/commit/?id=ee1523630a81fffa6b7d93dd0c7a6191de5856cd) [additional](https://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/lwip.git/commit/?id=b413b040936f48d4cd9ed632ac579542c710efae) [vulnerabilities](https://github.com/cxong/tinydir/security/advisories/GHSA-jf5r-wgf4-qhxf) that were subsequently fixed by the respective maintainers.

My detailed **advisories** are available here:

* <https://github.com/hnsecurity/vulns/blob/main/HNS-2024-05-rt-thread.txt>
* <https://github.com/hnsecurity/vulns/blob/main/HNS-2023-04-tinydir.txt>

### Background

After my [recent vulnerability disclosures](https://security.humanativaspa.it/ost2-zephyr-rtos-and-a-bunch-of-cves/), I decided to keep assisting open-source projects in the IoT space in finding and fixing security vulnerabilities by **reviewing their source code**. RT-Thread was selected as a target of interest. Other RTOSes will be featured in future [advisories](https://github.com/hnsecurity/vulns) and writeups. So, [stay tuned](https://security.humanativaspa.it/tag/iot/).

During this review, I made use of my [Semgrep C/C++ ruleset](https://security.humanativaspa.it/semgrep-ruleset-for-c-c-vulnerability-research/) to identify hotspots in code on which to focus my attention. I also took advantage of this opportunity to [improve and update](https://security.humanativaspa.it/big-update-to-my-semgrep-c-cpp-ruleset/) the ruleset.

### Vulnerabilities

The **vulnerabilities** resulting from my source code review are:

* [CVE-2024-24335](https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/issues/8271) – Buffer overflow in RT-Thread dfs\_v2 romfs filesystem

Since a few months, I’ve started to consistently keep track of my research efforts using the excellent [Be Focused](https://xwavesoft.com/be-focused-pro-for-iphone-ipad-mac-os-x.html) pomodoro timer app. Therefore, I know that it took me about **32 hours** to complete this project (not including the time spent for the disclosure process).

A nice graph that shows I was busy dealing with other stuff between September and October

### Disclosure and fixes

I reported the vulnerabilities discussed in this article to RT-Thread in November 2023, by opening [issues](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=author%3A0xdea+rt-thread&s=created&type=issues) on GitHub [as directed](https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/issues/8250) by the maintainers. Following my [request](https://www.cve.org/ReportRequest/ReportRequestForNonCNAs), MITRE assigned **CVE IDs** to all vulnerabilities in February 2024.

RT-Thread developers have fixed some of the vulnerabilities discussed in this advisory. However, some of the reported vulnerabilities are still open. Even though not all vulnerabilities were fixed, I decided to go ahead with public disclosure after about 90 days since the initial reports. This decision was taken mainly based on the fact that the **vulnerability reports were already publicly accessible** as GitHub issues.

The detailed coordinated disclosure **timeline** follows:

* 2023-11-12: Asked on GitHub how to report potential security issues.
* 2023-11-13: RT-Thread founder replied to open issues directly on GitHub.
* 2023-11-20: Opened the first issue on GitHub.
* 2023-11-24: First vulnerability fixed; reported some other vulnerabilities.
* 2023-11-28: Second (and third) vulnerability fixed.
* 2023-12-24: Asked maintainers for updates.
* 2024-01-17: Requested the first batch of CVE IDs from MITRE.
* 2024-01-26: Informed maintainers of plan to publish advisory in February.
* 2024-02-02: Requested the second batch of CVE IDs from MITRE.
* 2024-02-07: CVE IDs for all reported vulnerabilities assigned by MITRE.
* 2024-02-08: Communicated CVE IDs and new 2024-03-05 publication date.
* 2024-02-18: Maintainers acknowledge publication date and inform about new fixes.
* 2024-03-05: Published advisory and writeup.

Please check the official RT-Thread channels for further information about fixes.

### Acknowledgments

I would like to thank RT-Thread, lwIP, and TinyDir developers for the time dedicated to triaging the reported vulnerabilities. I would also like to thank MITRE for assigning CVE IDs upon my request.

--[ 1 - Summary
"Security is in the mind of the programmer and in the mind of the designer.Not so much in the code."  -- Alisa Esage
RT-Thread [1] is an open-source, community-based real-time operating system(RTOS). RT-Thread can be used in sensing nodes, wireless connection chips,and many other resource-constrained scenarios. It is also widely applied ingateways, IPC, smart speakers, and other high-performance IoT applications.
We reviewed RT-Thread's source code hosted on GitHub [2] and identifiedmultiple security vulnerabilities that may cause memory corruption andsecurity feature bypass. Their impacts range from denial of service topotential arbitrary code execution.
We also audited the lwIP [3] and TinyDir [4] codebases on which someRT-Thread functionalities depend, and found some additional vulnerabilitiesthat were subsequently fixed by the respective maintainers.
--[ 2 - Background
After our recent vulnerability disclosures [5] in the IoT space, we decidedto keep assisting open-source projects in finding and fixing securityvulnerabilities by reviewing their source code. RT-Thread was selected as atarget of interest. Other RTOSes will be featured in future advisories andwriteups.
During this review, we made use of our Semgrep C/C++ ruleset [6] toidentify hotspots in code on which to focus our attention. We also tookadvantage of this opportunity to improve and update the ruleset [7].
--[ 3 - Vulnerabilities
The vulnerabilities resulting from our source code review are brieflydescribed in the following sections.
--[ 3.1 - CVE-2024-24335 - Buffer overflow in RT-Thread dfs\_v2 romfs filesystem
We spotted a buffer overflow vulnerability at the following location in theRT-Thread dfs\_v2 romfs filesystem source code:
\* /components/dfs/dfs\_v2/filesystems/romfs/dfs\_romfs.c
Lack of length check in the `dfs\_romfs\_getdents()` function could lead to abuffer overflow at the marked line:```cstatic int dfs\_romfs\_getdents(struct dfs\_file \*file, struct dirent \*dirp, uint32\_t count){ rt\_size\_t index; const char \*name; struct dirent \*d; struct romfs\_dirent \*dirent, \*sub\_dirent;
 dirent = (struct romfs\_dirent \*)file->vnode->data; if (check\_dirent(dirent) != 0) { return -EIO; } RT\_ASSERT(dirent->type == ROMFS\_DIRENT\_DIR);
 /\* enter directory \*/ dirent = (struct romfs\_dirent \*)dirent->data;
 /\* make integer count \*/ count = (count / sizeof(struct dirent)); if (count == 0) { return -EINVAL; }
 index = 0; for (index = 0; index < count && file->fpos < file->vnode->size; index++) { d = dirp + index;
 sub\_dirent = &dirent[file->fpos]; name = sub\_dirent->name;
 /\* fill dirent \*/ if (sub\_dirent->type == ROMFS\_DIRENT\_DIR) d->d\_type = DT\_DIR; else d->d\_type = DT\_REG;
 d->d\_namlen = rt\_strlen(name); d->d\_reclen = (rt\_uint16\_t)sizeof(struct dirent); rt\_strncpy(d->d\_name, name, rt\_strlen(name) + 1); /\* VULN: buffer overflow if rt\_strlen(name) is larger than sizeof(d->d\_name) due to missing length check \*/
 /\* move to next position \*/ ++ file->fpos; }
 return index \* sizeof(struct dirent);}```
Note: dfs\_v1 romfs in /components/dfs/dfs\_v1/filesystems/romfs/dfs\_romfs.cis not affected, because the string copy operation is implementeddifferently:```c len = rt\_strlen(name); RT\_ASSERT(len <= RT\_UINT8\_MAX); d->d\_namlen = (rt\_uint8\_t)len; d->d\_reclen = (rt\_uint16\_t)sizeof(struct dirent); rt\_strncpy(d->d\_name, name, DFS\_PATH\_MAX);```
Even if the assertion is compiled-out in production code, `len` is not usedfor the copy operation anyway. Therefore, unless `DFS\_PATH\_MAX` is largerthan `sizeof(d->d\_name)`, this code should be safe.

--[ 3.2 - CVE-2024-24334 - Heap buffer overflows in RT-Thread dfs\_v2 dfs\_file
We spotted some heap buffer overflow vulnerabilities at the followinglocation in the RT-Thread dfs\_v2 dfs\_file source code:
\* /components/dfs/dfs\_v2/src/dfs\_file.c
Lack of length check in the the `dfs\_nolink\_path()` function could lead toheap buffer overflows at the marked lines:```cstatic char \*dfs\_nolink\_path(struct dfs\_mnt \*\*mnt, char \*fullpath, int mode){ int index = 0; char \*path = RT\_NULL; char link\_fn[DFS\_PATH\_MAX] = {0}; struct dfs\_dentry \*dentry = RT\_NULL;

--[ 3.3 - CVE-2024-25389 - Weak random source in RT-Thread rt\_random driver
We noticed a weak random source at the following location in the RT-Threadrt\_random driver source code:
\* /components/drivers/misc/rt\_random.c
Weak random generator in the the `calc\_random()` function:```cstatic rt\_uint16\_t calc\_random(void){ seed = 214013L \* seed + 2531011L; return (seed >> 16) & 0x7FFF; /\* return bits 16~30 \*/}

We spotted a heap buffer overflow vulnerability at the following locationin the RT-Thread wlan driver source code:
\* /components/drivers/wlan/wlan\_mgnt.c
Since `len` is a signed integer in the `rt\_wlan\_send\_to\_thread()` function,a small negative value could lead to a buffer overflow at the marked lines:```c#ifdef RT\_WLAN\_WORK\_THREAD\_ENABLE...static rt\_err\_t rt\_wlan\_send\_to\_thread(rt\_wlan\_event\_t event, void \*buff, int len){ struct rt\_wlan\_msg \*msg;
