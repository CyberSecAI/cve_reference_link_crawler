| Hi,  I would like to report another potential vulnerability in the current version of RT-Thread. Please let me know if you plan to ask for a CVE ID in case the vulnerability is confirmed. I'm available if you need further clarifications. Potential stack buffer overflow in RT-Thread AT serverSummary I spotted a potential stack buffer overflow vulnerability at the following location in the RT-Thread AT server source code: <https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/blob/master/components/net/at/src/at_server.c#L410> Details Lack of length check in the `at_cmd_get_name()` function could lead to a stack buffer overflow at the marked line:  ``` #ifdef AT_USING_SERVER ... static rt_err_t at_cmd_get_name(const char *cmd_buffer, char *cmd_name) {     rt_size_t cmd_name_len = 0, i = 0;      RT_ASSERT(cmd_name);     RT_ASSERT(cmd_buffer);      for (i = 0; i < strlen(cmd_buffer); i++)     {         if (*(cmd_buffer + i) == AT_CMD_QUESTION_MARK || *(cmd_buffer + i) == AT_CMD_EQUAL_MARK                 || *(cmd_buffer + i) == AT_CMD_CR                 || (*(cmd_buffer + i) >= AT_CMD_CHAR_0 && *(cmd_buffer + i) <= AT_CMD_CHAR_9))         {             cmd_name_len = i;             rt_memcpy(cmd_name, cmd_buffer, cmd_name_len); /* VULN: cmd_buffer is AT_SERVER_RECV_BUFF_LEN bytes (256), while cmd_name is only AT_CMD_NAME_LEN bytes (16); therefore, it might be possible to overflow past the cmd_name buffer with a carefully crafted cmd_buffer */             *(cmd_name + cmd_name_len) = '\0';              return RT_EOK;         }     }      return -RT_ERROR; } ``` Impact If the unchecked input above is confirmed to be attacker-controlled and crossing a security boundary, the impact of the reported buffer overflow vulnerability could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution. |

| Hi, it's been one month since I reported this vulnerability, and I wanted to ask if you have any update. As standard practice, I plan to request a CVE ID for every confirmed vulnerability. I also intend to publish an advisory by February at the latest, unless there's a specific reason to postpone. Thanks! |
