Package        : git
Version        : 1:2.20.1-2+deb10u9
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-1387 CVE-2023-25652 CVE-2023-25815 CVE-2023-29007
                 CVE-2024-32002 CVE-2024-32004 CVE-2024-32021 CVE-2024-32465
Debian Bug     : 1034835 1071160

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in git, a fast, scalable and
distributed revision control system.

CVE-2019-1387

    It was possible to bypass the previous check for this vulnerability
    using parallel cloning, or the --recurse-submodules option to
    git-checkout(1).

CVE-2023-25652

    Feeding specially-crafted input to 'git apply --reject' could
    overwrite a path outside the working tree with partially controlled
    contents, corresponding to the rejected hunk or hunks from the given
    patch.

CVE-2023-25815

    Low-privileged users could inject malicious messages into Git's
    output under MINGW.

CVE-2023-29007

    A specially-crafted .gitmodules file with submodule URLs longer than
    1024 characters could be used to inject arbitrary configuration into
    $GIT_DIR/config.

CVE-2024-32002

    Repositories with submodules could be specially-crafted to write
    hooks into .git/ which would then be executed during an ongoing
    clone operation.

CVE-2024-32004

    A specially-crafted local repository could cause the execution of
    arbitrary code when cloned by another user.

CVE-2024-32021

    When cloning a local repository that contains symlinks via the
    filesystem, Git could have created hardlinks to arbitrary
    user-readable files on the same filesystem as the target repository
    in the objects/ directory.

CVE-2024-32465

    When cloning a local repository obtained from a downloaded archive,
    hooks in that repository could be used for arbitrary code execution.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:2.20.1-2+deb10u9.

We recommend that you upgrade your git packages.

Subject: git: 5 vulnerabilities fixed

Team,

The Git project released new security bug-fix versions today, May 14th,
2024: v2.45.1, v2.44.1, v2.43.4, v2.42.2, v2.41.1, v2.40.2, and v2.39.4.

The addressed issues are:

 * CVE-2024-32002
 * (<https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-8h77-4q3w-gfgv>):

   Recursive clones on case-insensitive filesystems that support symbolic
   links are susceptible to case confusion that can be exploited to
   execute just-cloned code during the clone operation.

   This allows the attack where a recursive clone would first initialize a
   submodule, then replace its parent directory with a symbolic link into
   the `.git/` directory where the second stage of the recursive clone
   would then write e.g. hooks that would be immediately executed before
   the user has had a chance to inspect what is getting executed.

   Credit for finding the vulnerability goes to Filip Hejsek, credit for
   fixing it goes to Johannes Schindelin.

 * CVE-2024-32004
 * (<https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-xfc6-vwr8-r389>):

   Repositories can be configured to execute arbitrary code during local
   clones. To address this, the ownership checks introduced in v2.30.3
   are now extended to cover cloning local repositories.

   The most obvious attack vector is to prepare a local partial clone that
   is intentionally missing objects, override in its config what
   `upload-pack` executable use, and then talk another user on the same
   machine to clone that. This will run that configured `upload-pack`
   executable under using person's permissions.

   Credit for finding the vulnerability goes to Filip Hejsek, credit for
   fixing it goes to Johannes Schindelin.

 * CVE-2024-32020
 * (<https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-5rfh-556j-fhgj>):

   Local clones may end up hardlinking files into the target repository's
   object database when source and target repository reside on the same
   disk. If the source repository is owned by a different user, then
   those hardlinked files may be rewritten at any point in time by the
   untrusted user.

   This vulnerability allows a bait-and-switch attack where individual
   objects are replaced in already-indexed pack file; Git will not verify
   that the object's contents match its recorded object ID in that case.

   Credit for finding and for fixing the vulnerability goes to Patrick
   Steinhardt.

 * CVE-2024-32021
 * (<https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-mvxm-9j2h-qjx7>):

   When cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks via the
   filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files
   on the same filesystem as the target repository in the objects/
   directory.

   This allows the same attack vector that CVE-2022-39253 tried to
   prevent, by exploiting a time-of-check-time-of-use race.

   Credit for finding and for fixing the vulnerability goes to Patrick
   Steinhardt.

 * CVE-2024-32465
 * (<https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-vm9j-46j9-qvq4>):

   It is supposed to be safe to clone untrusted repositories, even those
   unpacked from zip archives or tarballs originating from untrusted
   sources, but Git can be tricked to run arbitrary code as part of the
   clone.

   The attack vectors are the same as for the CVEs mentioned above that
   involve local clones, but social-engineering is required to manipulate
   a user into unpacking a `.zip` file and running Git commands on the
   unpacked files.

   Credit for finding and for fixing the vulnerability goes to Jeff King.

Note: the defense-in-depth protection in these new Git versions causes a
regression when cloning repositories enabled with Git LFS. The clone will
fail with an error message. The remedy is to call `git lfs pull` in the
fresh clone.

Thanks,
Johannes

# Local clone may hardlink arbitrary user-readable files into the new repository's "objects/" directory

Low

[dscho](/dscho)

GHSA-mvxm-9j2h-qjx7
May 14, 2024

## Package

git

## Affected versions

v2.45.0 v2.44.0 <=v2.43.3 <=v2.42.1 v2.41.0 <=v2.40.1 <=v2.39.3

## Patched versions

v2.45.1 v2.44.1 v2.43.4 v2.42.2 v2.41.1 v2.40.2 v2.39.4

## Description

### Summary

When cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks via the

filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files on the

same filesystem as the target repository in the `objects/` directory.

### Details

Cloning a local repository over the filesystem may create hardlinks to

arbitrary user-owned files on the same filesystem in the target Git

repository's `objects/` directory.

When cloning a repository over the filesystem (without explicitly specifying

the `file://` protocol or `--no-local`), the optimizations for local cloning

will be used, which include attempting to hard link the object files instead of

copying them.

While the code includes checks against symbolic links in the source repository,

which were added during the fix for CVE-2022-39253, these checks can still be

raced because the hard link operation ultimately follows symlinks. If the

object on the filesystem appears as a file during the check, and then a symlink

during the operation, this will allow the adversary to bypass the check and

create hardlinks in the destination objects directory to arbitrary,

user-readable files.

### PoC

Since the code will stop attempting to create hard links after the first

failure, it is easiest to repro against a repository with just a single object.

1. Create a repository with an object:

```
```
mkdir simplerepo
cd simplerepo
git init
echo 'bla' | git hash-object -w --stdin
cd ..
git clone simplerepo --bare
```

```

2. Debug the cloning of that repository over an NFS mount, and break

   on link:

```
```
% lldb -- $GITBINARY clone /tmp/mount/simplerepo.git cloned
(lldb) b --one-shot true --name link
(lldb) r
...
(lldb) p (char*)$x0
(char *) 0x00006000034c0180 "/private/tmp/mount/simplerepo.git/objects/a7/f8d9e5dcf
(lldb) p (char*)$x1
(char *) 0x00006000034c0100 "cloned/.git/objects/a7/f8d9e5dcf3a68fdd2bfb727cde12029
```

```

3. From the NFS server, replace the file in the source repository with

   a symbolic link to any of the victim's files on the same mount

   point they are cloning to:

```
```
% rm -f objects/a7/f8d9e5dcf3a68fdd2bfb727cde12029875260b
% ln -s /Users/certl/.gitconfig objects/a7/f8d9e5dcf3a68fdd2bfb727cde12029875260b
```

```

4. Continue the clone, observing afterwards as the victim that the

   `.git/objects/a7/f8d9e5dcf3a68fdd2bfb727cde12029875260b` file is a

   hard link to the location as specified in the symlink created by

   the attacker in the previous step:

```
```
(lldb) c
(lldb) q
% ls -i cloned/.git/objects/a7/f8d9e5dcf3a68fdd2bfb727cde12029875260b
31241553 cloned/.git/objects/a7/f8d9e5dcf3a68fdd2bfb727cde12029875260b
% ls -i /Users/certl/.gitconfig
31241553 /Users/certl/.gitconfig
```

```
### Impact

An adversary can cause the user to hardlink arbitrary files into their

repository's `objects/` directory.

This issue has originally been reported by Apple Security Engineering and Architecture (SEAR).
