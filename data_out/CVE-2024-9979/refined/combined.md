### @davidhewitt **[davidhewitt](/davidhewitt)** commented [Oct 2, 2024](#issue-2562627798)

***Note: this is a patch fix for 0.22.4, the PR is targeting that branch, not `main`.***

As per discussion in [#4528](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/4528), borrowing from a weakref is definitely unsafe and high risk for use-after-free; any arbitrary Python code could in theory remove the last strong reference.

In 0.23 we will straight-up remove these unsound methods, but in 0.22.4 we can't really do that so the mitigation proposed here is to switch to leak the upgraded reference when "borrowing" from the weakref. This avoids use-after-free in favour of the more gentle memory leak. The methods are also all deprecated as a nudge for users to shift away from them ASAP.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| It may be the lesser evil in this case, but I have found out the hard way that python lacks overflow checking on it's reference counts. So a reference count leak, repeated a sufficiently large number of times on the same object, can lead to a use after free.  "sufficiently large number of times" is unlikely to happen on 64-bit platforms but is far more plausible on 32-bit platforms. |

| Hmm, that's a good point. I mean this also just straight-up ensures a memory leak before the overflow too, so it's definitely unpleasant for users and they should move to the owned methods which don't have any of this mess. |

### Description

The family of functions to read "borrowed" values from Python weak references
were fundamentally unsound, because the weak reference does itself not have
ownership of the value. At any point the last strong reference could
be cleared and the borrowed value would become dangling.

In PyO3 0.22.4 these functions have all been deprecated and patched to leak a
strong reference as a mitigation. PyO3 0.23 will remove these functions entirely.

At any point the last strong reference could be cleared and the borrowed value would become dangling.  In PyO3 0.22.4 these functions have all been deprecated and patched to leak a strong reference as a mitigation. PyO3 0.23 will remove these functions entirely.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2318646#c1)  Lumír Balhar    2024-10-15 09:50:58 UTC  ``` The patch in the latest version is huge: <https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/4590/files>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2318646#c2)  Charalampos Stratakis    2024-10-15 18:19:58 UTC  ``` The weakref python types were added in <https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/3835>, that is version 0.22.0.   We ship 0.15.2 in the bundled crates of cryptography.  The only file that we ship which has some change through the fix is here: <https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/commit/26abde5f858286b78c755da3b2627e4d13b4b234#diff-f7a0cd3c685f42419e34ce7c1be728ffc394d644b49715ae7112a2d6f45849f6>  Also this fix is related to free-threaded python. This requires more investigation but from my initial finding we should not be affected.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2318646#c3)  Lumír Balhar    2024-10-16 10:52:54 UTC  ``` You are right. The python-cryptography in RHEL 8 and 9 and also the versions in the alternative stacks Python 3.11 and 3.12 are too old to include the vulnerable code. The only exception is RHEL 10 where we have version 43.0.0 and that bundles pyo3 version 0.22.0: <https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/47aced28c8f27b4dbb61f4fc79af444a18279463>  The freethreading implementation for pyo3 hasn't been finished yet: <https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/47aced28c8f27b4dbb61f4fc79af444a18279463>   ``` |  |
