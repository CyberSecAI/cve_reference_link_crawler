| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2318646#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-10-14 21:01:48 UTC  ``` The family of functions to read "borrowed" values from Python weak references were fundamentally unsound, because the weak reference does itself not have ownership of the value. At any point the last strong reference could be cleared and the borrowed value would become dangling.  In PyO3 0.22.4 these functions have all been deprecated and patched to leak a strong reference as a mitigation. PyO3 0.23 will remove these functions entirely.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2318646#c1)  Lumír Balhar    2024-10-15 09:50:58 UTC  ``` The patch in the latest version is huge: <https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/4590/files>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2318646#c2)  Charalampos Stratakis    2024-10-15 18:19:58 UTC  ``` The weakref python types were added in <https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/3835>, that is version 0.22.0.   We ship 0.15.2 in the bundled crates of cryptography.  The only file that we ship which has some change through the fix is here: <https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/commit/26abde5f858286b78c755da3b2627e4d13b4b234#diff-f7a0cd3c685f42419e34ce7c1be728ffc394d644b49715ae7112a2d6f45849f6>  Also this fix is related to free-threaded python. This requires more investigation but from my initial finding we should not be affected.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2318646#c3)  Lumír Balhar    2024-10-16 10:52:54 UTC  ``` You are right. The python-cryptography in RHEL 8 and 9 and also the versions in the alternative stacks Python 3.11 and 3.12 are too old to include the vulnerable code. The only exception is RHEL 10 where we have version 43.0.0 and that bundles pyo3 version 0.22.0: <https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/47aced28c8f27b4dbb61f4fc79af444a18279463>  The freethreading implementation for pyo3 hasn't been finished yet: <https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/47aced28c8f27b4dbb61f4fc79af444a18279463>   ``` |  |
