### @davidhewitt **[davidhewitt](/davidhewitt)** commented [Oct 2, 2024](#issue-2562627798)

***Note: this is a patch fix for 0.22.4, the PR is targeting that branch, not `main`.***

As per discussion in [#4528](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/4528), borrowing from a weakref is definitely unsafe and high risk for use-after-free; any arbitrary Python code could in theory remove the last strong reference.

In 0.23 we will straight-up remove these unsound methods, but in 0.22.4 we can't really do that so the mitigation proposed here is to switch to leak the upgraded reference when "borrowing" from the weakref. This avoids use-after-free in favour of the more gentle memory leak. The methods are also all deprecated as a nudge for users to shift away from them ASAP.

Sorry, something went wrong.

   = The family of functions to read "borrowed" values from Python weak
references
     were fundamentally unsound, because the weak reference does itself
not have
     ownership of the value. At any point the last strong reference
could
     be cleared and the borrowed value would become dangling.

In PyO3 0.22.4 these functions have all been deprecated and patched
to leak a strong reference as a mitigation. PyO3 0.23 will remove these
functions entirely.
   = Announcement: [PyO3/pyo3#4590](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/4590)
   = Solution: Upgrade to >=0.22.4 (try `cargo update -p pyo3`)
   = pyo3 v0.22.2
     └── pumpkin-py v0.1.0

| It may be the lesser evil in this case, but I have found out the hard way that python lacks overflow checking on it's reference counts. So a reference count leak, repeated a sufficiently large number of times on the same object, can lead to a use after free.  "sufficiently large number of times" is unlikely to happen on 64-bit platforms but is far more plausible on 32-bit platforms. |

| Hmm, that's a good point. I mean this also just straight-up ensures a memory leak before the overflow too, so it's definitely unpleasant for users and they should move to the owned methods which don't have any of this mess. |
