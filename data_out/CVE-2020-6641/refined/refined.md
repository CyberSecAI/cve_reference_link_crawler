Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6641:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an "Insecure Direct Object Reference" within the FortiPresence GUI.
- Specifically, there are two authorization bypass vulnerabilities related to user-controlled keys in the FortiPresence administration interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The system is vulnerable to IDOR due to the lack of proper access control. The interface uses user-controlled keys to access data.
- **Authorization Bypass:** Attackers can bypass authorization checks by manipulating parameters related to "portal manager" or "portal users," leading to unauthorized data access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain unauthorized access to some user data. The specific type and scope of user data is not specified.
- The impact is categorized as "Improper access control" and has a CVSS v3 score of 4.3, indicating a medium severity.
- Successful exploitation can lead to the exposure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the FortiPresence administration interface.
- Attackers would exploit the interface by manipulating the parameters used to request data via "portal manager" or "portal users".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user with access to the FortiPresence administration interface to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker would need to have the ability to manipulate the HTTP requests sent to the server.
- No specific privileges are mentioned, however, it implies a lower level of access is needed, as mentioned in the CVSS score as "PR:L" (Low Privileges Required).
