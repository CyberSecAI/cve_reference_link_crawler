# SSH key password bypassed by not entering anything in as the password during ssh auth

Moderate

[Eugeny](/Eugeny)
published
GHSA-3cjp-w4cp-m9c8
Sep 27, 2023

## Package

warpgate
(Binary)

## Affected versions

<0.8.0

## Patched versions

0.8.1

## Description

### Summary

The SSH key verification for a user can be bypassed by sending an SSH key offer without a signature. This allows bypassing authentication under following conditions:

* The attacker knows the username and a valid target name
* The attacker knows the user's public key
* Only SSH public key authentication is required for the user account

### Severity

Moderate

6.2

# CVSS overall score

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-43660

### Weaknesses
