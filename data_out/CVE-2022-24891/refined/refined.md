{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is an incorrect regular expression for \"onsiteURL\" in the antisamy-esapi.xml configuration file, which fails to sanitize URLs with the \"javascript:\" scheme.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') [CWE-79]"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can inject malicious code into a web page through a URL containing the 'javascript:' scheme that is not properly sanitized.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to inject a crafted URL into the application that is processed using the vulnerable configuration."
  },
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in the default 'antisamy-esapi.xml' configuration file and can be mitigated by either updating the configuration file with the correct regex or updating to ESAPI version 2.3.0.0 or later, though it is noted that simply upgrading the jar dependency is not enough and the configuration file must also be updated. The updated regular expression for 'onsiteURL' is provided as '^(?!//)(?![\p{L}\p{N}\\\.\#@\$%\+&amp;;\-\_~,\?=/!]\*(&amp;colon))[\p{L}\p{N}\\\.\#@\$%\+&amp;;\-\_~,\?=/!]\*'. Also, the 'htmlTitle' and 'offsiteURL' regular expressions have been updated in the latest version of the file."
