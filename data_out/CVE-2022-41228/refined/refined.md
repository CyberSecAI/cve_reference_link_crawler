**CVE-2022-41228**
*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher Plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing permission check. Also, the form validation method does not require POST requests, leading to a CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2022-41227).
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified webserver using attacker-specified username and password.
*  **Attack vectors**:
    *   An attacker could exploit the missing permission check by sending a request to the vulnerable form validation method.
    *   An attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability by tricking a user into sending a request to the vulnerable form validation method.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
