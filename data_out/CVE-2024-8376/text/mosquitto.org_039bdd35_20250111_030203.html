# Eclipse Mosquittoâ¢

## An open source MQTT broker

---

Eclipse Mosquitto is an open source (EPL/EDL licensed) message broker that
implements the MQTT protocol versions 5.0, 3.1.1 and 3.1. Mosquitto
is lightweight and is suitable for use on all devices from low
power single board computers to full servers.

The MQTT protocol provides a lightweight method of carrying
out messaging using a publish/subscribe model. This makes it
suitable for Internet of Things messaging such as with low
power sensors or mobile devices such as phones, embedded
computers or microcontrollers.

The Mosquitto project also provides a C library for
implementing MQTT clients, and the very popular mosquitto\_pub
and mosquitto\_sub command line MQTT clients.

Mosquitto is part of the [Eclipse
Foundation](https://eclipse.org/), and is an [iot.eclipse.org](https://iot.eclipse.org/)
project. The development is driven by [Cedalo](https://cedalo.com/mqtt-broker-pro-mosquitto/).

## Download and Security

Mosquitto is highly portable and available for a wide range of
platforms. Go to the dedicated [download
page](download) to find the source or binaries for your platform.

Read the [Change Log](ChangeLog.txt) to find out
about recent releases.

Use the <security> page to find out
how to report vulnerabilities or responses to past security
issues.

## Test

You can have your own instance of Mosquitto running in
minutes, but to make testing even easier, the Mosquitto Project
runs a test server at
[test.mosquitto.org](https://test.mosquitto.org/) where
you can test your clients in a variety of ways: plain MQTT,
MQTT over TLS, MQTT over TLS (with
[client certificate](https://test.mosquitto.org/ssl/)),
MQTT over WebSockets and MQTT over WebSockets with TLS.

Alternatively, Cedalo offers a free 14-day cloud trial or a
30-day on-premises trial with basic HA configuration. [Sign
