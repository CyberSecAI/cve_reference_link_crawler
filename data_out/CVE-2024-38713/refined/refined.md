Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WP Photo Album Plus Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The plugin has a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This allows malicious actors to inject arbitrary scripts into the website.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful XSS exploit could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts, like redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads, which would be executed when users visit the website. This can lead to various malicious actions, including user data theft, session hijacking, and website defacement.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the plugin, which is vulnerable to XSS. Specific details on how the XSS is triggered were not provided, but the general nature of XSS implies the attacker would need to insert malicious scripts through the plugin's input handling or output display.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into the website. The required privilege is listed as "Subscriber", suggesting an attacker with relatively low privileges may be able to exploit the issue.
