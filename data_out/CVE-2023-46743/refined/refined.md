Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-46743

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the `userCanWrite` query parameter is handled by the Collabora server within the `DefaultWopi.java` file. The server caches this parameter, which dictates whether a user can edit a document. This caching occurs even if the user token changes, leading to inconsistencies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The system fails to properly enforce access control based on individual user permissions, instead, it uses the write permissions of the first user to open the file.
- **Caching Issue:** The caching mechanism of the `userCanWrite` parameter is not correctly implemented and persists across different users and sessions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Users with only view rights can gain edit access to a document if another user with edit rights opened it first.
- **Loss of Data Integrity**: Users with only view rights can modify the document when they should not be able to.
- **Denial of Service**: Users with edit rights might be prevented from editing the file if a user with view right opened it first.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is considered **physical (P)** according to the CVSS metrics, because an attacker needs to have some level of access to the application to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account on the affected XWiki system.
- The attacker also needs to access the same document as other users.
- The attacker needs to have a different right than other users that have access to the same document.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in versions of Application Collabora prior to 1.3.
- The issue is located in the `DefaultWopi.java` file, specifically around line 98.
- The patch was introduced in commit `60c6e404ee369915a955d981dd0d0c102bf9ad28`.
- The CVSS score is 7.4 with a vector string of CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
