### Root cause of vulnerability
The application was exposing database connection details (database name, username, and database host) in error messages when a connection to the database failed.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
The vulnerability is caused by the exposure of sensitive database connection information in error messages. Specifically, the application did not properly sanitize error messages related to database connection failures, leading to information disclosure.

### Impact of exploitation
An attacker could gain knowledge of the database infrastructure, including the database name, username, and host. This information could be used in subsequent attacks to target the database directly. The impact is rated as moderate because the information could facilitate further attacks, though it does not directly grant access or control over the database.

### Attack vectors
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker does not need any special access or interaction. They only need to cause a database connection error, which could potentially happen during normal application usage.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application in a way that could potentially trigger a database connection error. This doesn't require any specific privileges or a position inside the network. The vulnerability can be triggered remotely.
