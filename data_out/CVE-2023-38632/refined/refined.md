Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `Receive` function within the `tcpsocket.hpp` file of the `async-sockets-cpp` project. This occurs because the `recv` function can receive more data than the allocated buffer size, but the code does not account for this possibility, leading to a write past the end of the buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack buffer overflow:** The `tempBuffer` is allocated on the stack with a fixed size (`BUFFER_SIZE`). The `recv` function reads data from the socket into this buffer. However, if the received data exceeds `BUFFER_SIZE`, the subsequent write at `tempBuffer[messageLength] = '\0';` overwrites the stack beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crashing the application:** The stack buffer overflow overwrites stack memory, causing the application to crash due to a segmentation fault or address sanitizer error.
- **Potential for code execution:** While not explicitly demonstrated, stack buffer overflows can potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution by overwriting return addresses or other critical stack data.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeatedly triggering the overflow can crash the server, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote network connection:** An attacker can connect to a TCP server using this vulnerable code and send a large packet of bytes (larger than `BUFFER_SIZE`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the vulnerable server application (TCP).
- The attacker must be able to send network data to the server.
- The attacker does not need prior knowledge of the application, only the ability to send a TCP packet.

**Additional Details:**
- The `tempBuffer` is 4096 bytes according to the ASAN output.
- The vulnerability is located around lines 102-110 in the `tcpsocket.hpp` file.
- The issue was fixed in commit `78641cfde398d2cd71649f6911ee1bf4953498c0`.
- The provided ASAN output clearly shows the stack buffer overflow occurring due to writing past the bounds of `tempBuffer`.
- The developer initially believed the `recv` function would not write past buffer, which is incorrect.
