  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A flawed mitigation for an RX IRQ flood in the pmac_zilog serial driver resulted in a spinlock recursion and a subsequent kernel crash.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The mitigation code in `pmz_receive_chars` attempted to disable the receiver and print an error message upon encountering a receive interrupt flood. However, this error message invoked `pmz_console_write`, which attempted to lock a spinlock that was already locked in the interrupt handler `pmz_interrupt`. This caused a spinlock recursion, leading to a kernel BUG splat when `CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y` was set and even when it wasn't fatal, the serial port rx function ceases to work.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation results in a kernel crash (BUG splat) when CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y. When not fatal, serial port rx function ceases to work, leading to a denial of service for the serial port.",
  "Attack vectors": "An RX IRQ flood on the pmac_zilog serial port triggers the flawed mitigation code, leading to the crash. The trigger may not be under direct attacker control, but may result from a hardware issue, or potentially by sending specific data patterns via the serial interface, although there's no evidence it can easily be triggered via data injection. The vulnerability was triggered by QEMU.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to cause an RX IRQ flood on the pmac_zilog serial port. This could be achieved by exploiting a hardware issue causing the flood or by sending a specific data pattern over the serial line. The attacker doesn't need to be in privileged position, since the crash happens within the kernel context."
