{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input in the 'Themes' module of the MyBB Admin CP. Specifically, HTML can be injected through theme settings that are then displayed within the Admin CP interface.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Persistent Cross-site scripting (XSS). The injected HTML is stored in the database and rendered without proper sanitization, leading to the XSS.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious HTML, which will be executed in the context of an administrator's session when they access the themes page in the Admin CP. This could allow an attacker to perform administrative actions on the forum (if an admin interacts with the malicious injected code), potentially leading to complete compromise of the forum.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a remote, authenticated user with high privileges to access Admin CP and edit themes settings. The injected payload is persistent.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be an authenticated user with administrator privileges within the MyBB forum (to access the Admin CP and modify theme settings). They need to be able to craft malicious HTML code."
