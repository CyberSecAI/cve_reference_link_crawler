Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the relevant details regarding CVE-2022-21935:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from CISA directly mentions CVE-2022-21935, and the advisory from Johnson Controls lists it as a vulnerability that affects Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS Servers. Thus, the content is relevant to this CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability, as described in the CISA advisory, is an "Unverified Password Change". This means that the affected products do not properly verify password change requests. This allows for passwords to be guessed at a high rate.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unverified Password Change (CWE-620):** The system doesn't properly authenticate or verify the user initiating a password change, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks and unauthorized password resets.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to the affected Metasys servers.
*   **Compromised Passwords:** Attackers can easily guess passwords because of the unverified password change mechanism.
*   **Injection of malicious code:** When combined with the XSS vulnerabilities, attackers may be able to inject malicious code into the web interfaces.
*   **Complete System Control:** Gaining access through a compromised password could allow an attacker full control of the affected systems depending on the level of access of the user.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability through network access, as indicated by the CVSS vector (AV:A).  This means that the attacker needs to be on the same network segment, or have some form of access to the network segment where the server resides.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker must have network access to the Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS server.
*   **No special privileges required:** The vulnerability can be exploited even with no prior account on the server.
*   **Repeated attempts to guess the password:** The vulnerability allows attackers to make repeated password change requests, due to the lack of verification.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided text mentions the vulnerabilities being present in Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS versions 10 and 11, and provides patches to mitigate the vulnerabilities.
*   This CVE is often mentioned along with two Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, CVE-2022-21937 and CVE-2022-21938, as seen in the CISA advisory.
*   The Johnson Controls advisories (JCI-PSA) and the CISA advisory provide mitigation steps such as updating the Metasys servers to the latest patched versions (10.1.5 for version 10 and 11.0.2 for version 11).
