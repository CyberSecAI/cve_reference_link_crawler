- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS servers allow passwords to be guessed at a high rate due to insufficient password change verification.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unverified Password Change (CWE-620)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow unauthorized users to compromise passwords.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent network access with a high complexity.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be on an adjacent network and does not require privileges or user interaction. The attack has a high complexity.
