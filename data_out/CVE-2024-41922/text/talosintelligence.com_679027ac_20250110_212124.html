# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2024-2061

## Veertu Anka Build registry log files directory traversal vulnerability

##### October 3, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2024-41922

##### SUMMARY

A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the log files download functionality of Veertu Anka Build 1.42.0. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information. An attacker can make an unauthenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Veertu Anka Build 1.42.0

##### PRODUCT URLS

Anka Build - <https://veertu.com/download-anka-build/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.5 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

##### CWE

CWE-22 - Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (‘Path Traversal’)

##### DETAILS

Anka Build is a suite of software tools designed for macOS virtualization, specifically for testing macOS or iOS applications in CI/CD environments. The suite comprises three main components: Controller, Registry, and Nodes. Anka Build Controller is centralized dashboard for managing nodes, VM instances, templates, tags, and logs. Anka Build Registry serves as the central repository for macOS VM templates and tags, facilitating easy access and version control. Anka Build Nodes are macOS hosts that run on-demand VM instances.

The default installation of the Controller LaunchDaemon runs on the port 80 and the Registry LaunchDaemon runs on the port 8089.

A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the Anka Build Controller and Registry LaunchDaemons. This vulnerability is triggered when an HTTP GET request is sent to the controller URI `/api/v1/registry/log` or to the Registry URI `/log`. Both requests ultimately invoke the `veertu.com/veertu/registry/log_server.(*LogServer).HandleLogOutput` method within the `anka-registry` binary. The decompiled code for the `veertu.com/veertu/registry/log_server.(*LogServer).HandleLogOutput` method is as follows:

```
  a2 = (unsigned int *)http_responsewriter.tab;
  v4 = net_url__ptr_URL_Query(x3_0->URL);
  service_param.ptr = (char *)&service;
  service_param.len = 7LL;
  service_value = net_url_Values_Get(v4, service_param); //<------------------- (1)
  if ( service_value.len )
  {
    v32.data = a2_8;
    v32.tab = a2;
    veertu_com_veertu_registry_log_server__ptr_LogServer_streamLog(a1, v32, a3, service_value); //<------------------- (2)
  }

```

At `(1)`, the `service` parameter value is obtained from the URL. At `(2)`, `veertu.com/veertu/registry/log_server.(*LogServer).streamLog` method is called. This method, in turn, calls `veertu.com/veertu/registry/backend/disklogserver.(*Backend).TailServiceLog`. The decompile code of `veertu.com/veertu/registry/backend/disklogserver.(*Backend).TailServiceLog` is as follows:

```
 while ( (unsigned __int64)&v12 <= *(_QWORD *)(v3 + 16) )
  {
    v19 = a1;
    ptr = service_value.ptr;
    len = service_value.len;
    runtime_morestack_noctxt(a1, service_value.ptr, service_value.len);
    a1 = v19;
    service_value.ptr = ptr;
    service_value.len = len;
  }
  LogFilePath = veertu_com_veertu_registry_backend_disklogserver__ptr_Backend_getLogFilePath(a1, service_value); //<---------------- (3)
  if ( LogFilePath.1.tab )
  {
    LogFilePath.0.ptr = 0LL;
    LogFilePath.0.len = (size_t)LogFilePath.1.tab;
    LogFilePath.1.tab = LogFilePath.1.data;
  }

  [...]

    v4 = os_Stat(LogFilePath.0.ptr, LogFilePath.0.len);
    filesize = (*(__int64 (__golang **)(__int64))(v4 + 56))(v5);
    v6 = runtime_newobject(&type_ZLVnh7lF);
    if ( filesize - 0x100000 > 0 )
      *v6 = filesize - 0x100000;
    LogFilePath.0.ptr = (char *)github_com_hpcloud_tail_TailFile(
                                  v18,
                                  v11,
                                  v6,
                                  1LL,
                                  1LL,
                                  1LL,
                                  0LL,
                                  0LL,
                                  (unsigned __int8)v12,
                                  v13,
                                  v14,
                                  v15);   //<---------------(4)

```

At `(3)`, the `TailServiceLog` method invokes the `veertu.com/veertu/registry/backend/disklogserver.(*Backend).getLogFilePath` method. In `getLogFilePath`, the value of the `service` parameter is appended to the log directory path without any validation for directory traversal characters such as dot-dot-slash (../). Subsequently, the extension `.log` is added to the new path. This log path is returned by `getLogFilePath` and assigned to the `LogFilePath` variable.

At `(4)`, the `github.com/hpcloud/tail.TailFile` method is called, which emulates the BSD `tail` program, displaying the last part of the file returned by the `getLogFilePath` method.

Here, the `service` HTTP Parameter is vulnerable to path traversal. By utilizing `dot-dot-slash (../)` sequences or their variations, it may be possible to access and download arbitrary log files from the system where the Registry `LaunchDaemon` is installed.

##### VENDOR RESPONSE

Fixed in 1.43.0 of the Anka Build Cloud.
