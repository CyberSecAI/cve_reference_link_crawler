Insgesamt sind viele Blocks enthalten und es funktioniert auch alles. Ich habe mich jedoch für Otter entschieden, weil das Plugin WP Product Review Lite nicht mehr unterstützt und durch einen Block in Otter ersetzt wird. Laut Beschreibung soll es möglich sein, die Daten zu importieren, was für mich der ausschlaggebende Punkt war, mich für Otter zu entscheiden. Leider habe ich einem falschen Versprechen geglaubt und muss nun doch alles händisch umarbeiten. Hätte ich nicht schon angefangen und das Design angepasst, hätte ich auch jedes andere Plugin nutzen können.

Only been using it a few days, and I’m a newbie to WP so everything is a learning curve. So far I have managed to get all of the Otter features that I wanted for my site to work fine. I still have many more to explore as I develop my site.

I have never used a more frustrating plugin. Basic options are not intuitive. Want to change the text color? Hunt for it, under one of two “Highlight” options. Want to see the actual plugin options by clicking the Otter Blocks link in the dashboard? Nope, it will never load. There are 5 tabs on that page and not a single one will load, the wheel just spins around and around. And sloooooow….WP is already pretty inefficient with your time. Otter Blocks really steps that up a notch. Combined with having to hunt for basic features, you won’t get much done in an hour. Decide you want to remove it because it is awful? No can do, friend, your site is now broken. You’re going to have to repair the entire thing.
