Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling SVG file uploads via the REST API in the Otter Blocks plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize SVG files, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code within them.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately sanitize user-supplied data, specifically during SVG file uploads.
- **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin fails to properly escape the uploaded SVG content, allowing the injected scripts to execute when the SVG file is accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages containing the uploaded SVG file.
- The malicious scripts execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Data theft.
    - Defacement of web pages.
    - Redirection to malicious websites.
    - Other malicious activities within the context of the victim's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **REST API SVG File Uploads:** The vulnerability is exploited by uploading a malicious SVG file through the plugin's REST API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have at least Author-level access to the WordPress site.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Otter Blocks plugin up to and including 3.0.4.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 3.0.5.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Francesco Carlucci and reported through the Wordfence bug bounty program.
- The vulnerability is classified as a medium severity issue with a CVSS score of 6.4.
