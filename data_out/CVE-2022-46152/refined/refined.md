Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-46152:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `cleanup_shm_refs()` function in OP-TEE OS does not properly validate the `num_params` argument, which is received from the normal world via a System Management Call (SMC). This lack of validation leads to an out-of-bounds array access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Validation of Array Index (CWE-129):** The `cleanup_shm_refs()` function iterates through an array using `num_params` without checking if it exceeds the bounds of the allocated arrays (`saved_attr` and `param->u`).
- **Out-of-bounds Read:** When `num_params` is greater than `TEE_NUM_PARAMS`, the loop in `cleanup_shm_refs()` reads data from beyond the allocated size of the `saved_attr` array located on the stack.
- **Dangling Pointer Vulnerability:**  If the out-of-bounds read of `saved_attr` results in a value corresponding to a shared memory type, the function attempts to release memory using `mobj_put()` with an out-of-bounds index into `param->u` array, leading to potential use-after-free condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker in the normal world can escalate privileges to the secure world by crafting a malicious SMC call.
- **Arbitrary Memory Access/Corruption:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially read arbitrary memory on the stack, and potentially free fake-objects in the secure world by manipulating the parameters, leading to corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SMC Call:** The attacker must be able to execute System Management Calls (SMC) from the normal world to the secure world. The `OPTEE_MSG_CMD_OPEN_SESSION` or `OPTEE_MSG_CMD_INVOKE_COMMAND` commands can be used.
- **Malicious `num_params`:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted `optee_msg_arg` structure with a `num_params` value greater than `TEE_NUM_PARAMS` (which is 4). This will bypass the check in copy_in_params and reach the vulnerable code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Normal World Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the normal world environment.
- **Ability to Execute SMC Instructions:** The attacker needs to be able to execute SMC instructions to communicate with the secure world. This typically requires a privileged position in the normal world, but this can be specific to the implementation.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when `copy_in_params()` returns an error because `num_params` is greater than `TEE_NUM_PARAMS`, which causes `cleanup_shm_refs()` to be called.
- The fix implemented is to cap the `num_params` value in the loop within `cleanup_shm_refs()` to `MIN(TEE_NUM_PARAMS, num_params)`.
