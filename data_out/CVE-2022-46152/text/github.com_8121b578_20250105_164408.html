core: tee\_entry: fix array out of bounds check in cleanup\_shm\_refs()

```
cleanup_shm_refs() can be called with num_params larger than what has
been used by copy_in_params(). If num_params is larger than
TEE_NUM_PARAMS copy_in_params() will return an error and
cleanup_shm_refs() is called to clean up.

This leads to accessing uint64_t saved_attr[TEE_NUM_PARAMS] in
entry_invoke_command() or entry_open_session() out of bounds and
possibly also the u[TEE_NUM_PARAMS] array in struct tee_ta_param.

So fix this by capping num_params TEE_NUM_PARAMS in cleanup_shm_refs().
