- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the web server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can read device information, leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is accessible through the web server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device. The CVSS vector `AV:A` indicates Adjacent network attack vector. The attacker does not need to be authenticated (`PR:N`).
