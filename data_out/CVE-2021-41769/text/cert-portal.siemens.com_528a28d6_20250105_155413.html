WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has not identiﬁed any additional speciﬁc workarounds or mitigations. Please follow the General
Security Recommendations.

Product speciﬁc mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to
build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is
therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are
in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the
grid design.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

Recommended security guidelines to Digital Grid Products can be found at:

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIPROTEC 5 devices provide a range of integrated protection, control, measurement, and automation
functions for electrical substations and other ﬁelds of application.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-41769

An improper input validation vulnerability in the web server could allow an unauthenticated user to
access device information.
