{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability occurs due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data during file uploads. Specifically, the application does not prevent the upload of a file with an .shtml extension containing a malicious XSS payload. When this file is accessed through a direct link, the browser executes the injected JavaScript code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application allows an attacker to upload a malicious file containing a XSS payload, which is then executed when accessed through its link.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves uploading a specially crafted file with an .shtml extension containing an XSS payload through the application's upload functionality.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have an account with permission to upload assets in the Cockpit CMS."
