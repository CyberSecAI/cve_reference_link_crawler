      "rootCause": "The `interface_authorized_store()` function in `drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c` acquires a device lock on an ancestor device by calling `usb_deauthorize_interface()`, which locks the interface's parent USB device. If another process already owns this lock and tries to remove the interface, it results in a deadlock. The removal procedure waits for sysfs attribute callbacks to complete, but `usb_deauthorize_interface()` cannot complete until the device lock is released, and the lock won't be released until the removal is finished.",
