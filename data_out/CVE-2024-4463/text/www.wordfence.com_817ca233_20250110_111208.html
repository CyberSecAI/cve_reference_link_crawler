### Description

The Squelch Tabs and Accordions Shortcodes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 0.4.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation when saving plugin settings. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
