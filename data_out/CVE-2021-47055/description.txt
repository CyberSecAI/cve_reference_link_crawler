In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mtd: require write permissions for locking and badblock ioctls

MEMLOCK, MEMUNLOCK and OTPLOCK modify protection bits. Thus require
write permission. Depending on the hardware MEMLOCK might even be
write-once, e.g. for SPI-NOR flashes with their WP# tied to GND. OTPLOCK
is always write-once.

MEMSETBADBLOCK modifies the bad block table.
