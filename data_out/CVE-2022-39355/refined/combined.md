# Improper validation of email during Patreon authentication

Critical

[jomaxro](/jomaxro)
published
GHSA-fvj9-f67v-qpr4
Oct 26, 2022

## Package

discourse-patreon
(Discourse)

## Affected versions

< 0c88b9bf

## Patched versions

>= 846d0121

## Description

### Impact

On sites with Patreon login enabled, this vulnerability could be used to take control of a victim's forum account.

### Patches

This vulnerability is patched in the latest version of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login.

### Workarounds

Disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.

### Severity

Critical

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
