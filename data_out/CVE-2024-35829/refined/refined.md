{
  "cveId": "CVE-2024-35829",
  "related": true,
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "A memory leak occurs in the `lima_heap_alloc` function within the Lima DRM driver when `lima_vm_map_bo` fails. Resources allocated during the buffer object creation are not properly deallocated in this error scenario.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper resource deallocation on error",
      "Memory leak"
    ],
    "impact": "Memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion, potentially causing system instability or denial of service.",
    "attackVectors": "Triggering a scenario where `lima_vm_map_bo` fails during buffer object allocation.",
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to trigger the buffer object allocation within the Lima DRM driver and cause the `lima_vm_map_bo` to fail."
