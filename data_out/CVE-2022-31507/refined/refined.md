The content is related to CVE-2022-31507.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the insecure use of `os.path.join` with untrusted input. Specifically, when `os.path.join` receives an absolute path, it disregards any preceding path segments and operates solely on the provided absolute path. This behavior allows an attacker to bypass intended directory restrictions when constructing file paths.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability: The application uses `os.path.join` to combine a base directory with user-provided input to construct a file path. This allows an attacker to manipulate the path parameter using `../` sequences or absolute paths, potentially gaining access to arbitrary files and directories on the server.
- Unsafe use of `flask.send_file`: The `flask.send_file` function is used to send a file to the user, but is vulnerable because it uses the insecurely constructed path from the `os.path.join` operation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive information like source code, configuration files, or user data.
- Partial denial of service: By repeatedly requesting large files, an attacker could potentially cause a partial denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack can be carried out over the network by sending a crafted request to the application's job browsing endpoint. The `path` parameter within the URL is attacker-controlled, allowing manipulation to access files outside the intended directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the application.
- No specific user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
