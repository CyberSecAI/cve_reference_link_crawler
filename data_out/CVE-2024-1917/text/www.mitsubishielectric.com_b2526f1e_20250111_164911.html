Mitigations/Workarounds

Mitsubishi  Electric  recommends that  customers  take  the  following  mitigation  measures  to  minimize  the  risk of  exploiting  these
vulnerabilities:
- Use a firewall, virtual private network (VPN), etc. to prevent unauthorized access when Internet access is required.
- Use within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts through firewalls.
- Restrict physical access to the affected product as well as to the personal computers and the network devices that can communicate

with it.

- Install antivirus software on your personal computer that can access the affected product.
