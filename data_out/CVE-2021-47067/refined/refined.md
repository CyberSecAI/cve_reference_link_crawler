The provided content is related to CVE-2021-47067.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A bug in the Tegra30 voltage regulator driver code caused a lockup when the voltage spread was out of range. The maximum spread requirement was not accounted for when the CPU regulator had no consumers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a logic error in the `tegra30_voltage_update` function within the `drivers/soc/tegra/regulators-tegra30.c` file. Specifically, the minimum voltage `cpu_min_uV` was incorrectly assigned when the CPU regulator had no consumers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability results in a system lockup, which effectively denies service.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by enabling system-wide DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling) in the device tree of a Tegra30 based system (observed on the Ouya game console). This would cause the voltage spread to go out of range triggering the lockup.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to enable system-wide DVFS. This typically requires privileged access or the ability to modify the device tree configuration.
