Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2538

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check within the `ajax_save_permalink` function in the Permalink Manager Lite plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to verify if the user has the necessary permission to edit the post before allowing the permalink modification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The core issue is the lack of authorization checks before updating post permalinks via the `ajax_save_permalink` function.
- **Direct Object Reference:** The `permalink-manager-edit-uri-element-id` parameter allows an attacker to specify the post ID for which the permalink should be modified, even if they do not have the necessary permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Post Slug Modification:** Authenticated users (Author role or higher) can modify the permalinks of any post, including posts from other users, regardless of their intended permissions.
- **Content Hijacking:** By setting all post permalinks to point to a single attacker-controlled post, the attacker can effectively hijack the website's content. When any page is accessed, the content of the attacker's post will be displayed instead.
- **Private Post Exposure:** Permalinks of privately published posts by the admin can be modified, potentially leading to unauthorized access or exposure of sensitive content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least "Author" privileges.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable `action` (`pm_save_permalink`) and the `permalink-manager-edit-uri-element-id` parameter used to specify the target post.
- **Access to Admin AJAX Endpoint:** The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint of the WordPress website.
