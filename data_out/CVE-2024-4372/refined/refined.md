- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "Carousel Slider" fails to sanitize and escape specific user-supplied parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website, potentially leading to actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with editor-level privileges can create a new slider and inject the malicious script into the "URL View" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have at least editor-level access to the WordPress website.
