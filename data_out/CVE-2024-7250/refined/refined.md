Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `cmdagent` executable in Comodo Internet Security Pro improperly handling symbolic links, which can be abused to delete files.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core vulnerability is a symlink following issue within the `cmdagent` executable, leading to an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability.

*  **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code within the context of the SYSTEM user.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. The attacker exploits the vulnerability by creating a symbolic link to manipulate the deletion of arbitrary file.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.

This advisory provides more details than the standard CVE description, specifically detailing the symlink manipulation and the affected executable (`cmdagent`).
