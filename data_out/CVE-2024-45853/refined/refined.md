{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the use of `pickle.loads` on a custom model built via the Build Your Own Model (BYOM) process within the `predict` method of the `ModelWrapperUnsafe` class.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution on the server where the MindsDB instance is running.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker with authentication to the MindsDB instance can upload a malicious pickle object as part of a custom model, which will be deserialized when a predict query is executed, triggering arbitrary code execution.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to a MindsDB instance and must change the BYOM engine from the default 'venv' to 'inhouse' in the MindsDB config."
