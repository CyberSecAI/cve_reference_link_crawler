{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks CSRF checks when deleting polls.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can make a logged-in user delete polls without their consent or knowledge.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that submits a form to the vulnerable endpoint on the WordPress site when a logged-in user visits the page. The form contains hidden fields that trigger the poll deletion.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious webpage or include the malicious code in another way into an active session, and the user must have the capability to delete polls within the targeted WordPress application. The attacker has no direct interaction with the vulnerable wordpress site other than through the victims browser"
