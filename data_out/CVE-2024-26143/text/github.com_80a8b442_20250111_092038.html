# Possible XSS Vulnerability in Action Controller translation

Low

[jhawthorn](/jhawthorn)
published
GHSA-9822-6m93-xqf4
Feb 26, 2024

## Package

bundler

rails
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

>= 7.0.0

## Patched versions

7.1.3.1, 7.0.8.1

## Description

# Possible XSS Vulnerability in Action Controller

There is a possible XSS vulnerability when using the translation helpers

(`translate`, `t`, etc) in Action Controller. This vulnerability has been

assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2024-26143](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9822-6m93-xqf4 "CVE-2024-26143").

Versions Affected: >= 7.0.0.

Not affected: < 7.0.0

Fixed Versions: 7.1.3.1, 7.0.8.1

## Impact

Applications using translation methods like `translate`, or `t` on a

controller, with a key ending in "\_html", a `:default` key which contains

untrusted user input, and the resulting string is used in a view, may be

susceptible to an XSS vulnerability.

For example, impacted code will look something like this:

```
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @message = t("message_html", default: untrusted_input)
    # The `show` template displays the contents of `@message`
  end
end
```

To reiterate the pre-conditions, applications must:

* Use a translation function from a controller (i.e. *not* I18n.t, or `t` from

  a view)
* Use a key that ends in `_html`
* Use a default value where the default value is untrusted and unescaped input
* Send the text to the victim (whether that's part of a template, or a

  `render` call)

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the

workarounds immediately.

## Releases

The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

## Workarounds

There are no feasible workarounds for this issue.

## Patches

To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for

the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a

single changeset.

* 7-0-VULN.patch - Patch for 7.0 series
