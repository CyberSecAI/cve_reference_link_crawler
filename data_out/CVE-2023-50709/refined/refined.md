Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50709:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a denial-of-service (DoS) issue within the `@cubejs-backend/api-gateway` package in versions prior to v0.34.34. A specially crafted request to the Cube API endpoint can make the API unavailable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the lack of proper handling of specific requests, allowing a malicious actor to exploit the API and cause a DoS. This suggests a vulnerability related to resource management or improper parsing of request parameters/headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition, rendering the entire Cube API unavailable. This can severely disrupt any service dependent on the Cube API.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). This implies that the attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L) to send a malicious request. No user interaction (UI:N) is required. The attack complexity (AC:L) is low, suggesting it's relatively easy to execute.
