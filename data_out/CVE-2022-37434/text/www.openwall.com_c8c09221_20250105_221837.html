Expanding this for the benefit of list members and the archives:

The CVE description is:

    zlib through 1.2.12 has a heap-based buffer over-read or buffer overflow
    in inflate in inflate.c via a large gzip header extra field.

    NOTE: only applications that call inflateGetHeader are affected. Some
    common applications bundle the affected zlib source code but may be unable
    to call inflateGetHeader (e.g., see the nodejs/node reference).

where the nodejs reference is to:

<https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/75b68c6e4db515f76df73af476eccf382bbcb00a/deps/zlib/inflate.c#L762-L764>

The reproducer is posted at <https://github.com/ivd38/zlib_overflow> and
notes the issue was found by Evgeny Legerov of @intevydis - who is
presumably our original poster here.

The initial fix upstream was:

     If the extra field was larger than the space the user provided with
     inflateGetHeader(), and if multiple calls of inflate() delivered
     the extra header data, then there could be a buffer overflow of the
     provided space. This commit assures that provided space is not
     exceeded.

from <https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/eff308af425b67093bab25f80f1ae950166bece1>

*but* the curl developers found that crashed in their testing, as reported
in comments on the above commit and <https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/9271>
so a followup fix upstream today made sure not to dereference state->head
until *after* the check for it not being NULL:
