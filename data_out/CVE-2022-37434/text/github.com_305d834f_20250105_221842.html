This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fix a bug when getting a gzip header extra field with inflate().

```
If the extra field was larger than the space the user provided with
inflateGetHeader(), and if multiple calls of inflate() delivered
the extra header data, then there could be a buffer overflow of the
provided space. This commit assures that provided space is not
exceeded.

Neither. This bug is not present in any released version of zlib. It was introduced two commits ago on the develop branch of zlib. (Is it standard practice to issue CVEs for unreleased code?)

Oh, I think I get it now. I was talking about [CVE-2022-37434](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cfmr-vrgj-vqwv "CVE-2022-37434").

Looking at it now, this commit fixes the [CVE-2022-37434](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cfmr-vrgj-vqwv "CVE-2022-37434") and the commit [1eb7682](https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/1eb7682f845ac9e9bf9ae35bbfb3bad5dacbd91d) fixes the segfault introduced by this commit. Is this assumption correct?

That is definitely not standard practice.

~~To me this CVE entry is merely a false-positive (from a technical point of view, since no affected version was released) if my assumption turns out to be right.~~

[@DanielRuf](https://github.com/DanielRuf)

Looking at <https://github.com/madler/zlib/blame/master/inflate.c> the bug is at least 11 years old. It appears the affected code was committed in [9811b53](https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/9811b53dd9e8f67015c7199fff12b5bfc6965330) as zlib 1.2.2.1

[@piru](https://github.com/piru) thanks for checking this.

Hm, I'm not sure why but the changelog says 2004, but the commit was in 2011.

Maybe the project was uploaded to GitHub afterwards and the commit timestamps are not the right ones.

<https://zlib.net/fossils/> says also 2004. So if this is the first affected version (which would have to be verified), then it means that we at least have a definitive list of affected versions and a relevant CPE (1.2.2.1 - <= 1.2.12).

See also <https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/9811b53dd9e8f67015c7199fff12b5bfc6965330.patch>

So if the changelog is right, then all versions since 2004 (1.2.2.1) are affected?

[zlib/ChangeLog](https://github.com/madler/zlib/blob/21767c654d31d2dccdde4330529775c6c5fd5389/ChangeLog#L801)

|  | - Add inflateGetheader() to retrieve gzip headers |
| --- | --- |

Can someone verify this?

Because this contradicts the statement from [eff308a#commitcomment-80753451](https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/eff308af425b67093bab25f80f1ae950166bece1#commitcomment-80753451):

Which was in reply to [eff308a#commitcomment-80706024](https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/eff308af425b67093bab25f80f1ae950166bece1#commitcomment-80706024):

> Hi, [@madler](https://github.com/madler) was this CVE introduced in the zlib-1.2.12 version, or this CVE affects the older 1.2.11 version as well?

Or maybe there is some misunderstanding, which needs some clarification.

It's of course possible that the code originates from even earlier. It as *at least* 11 years old.

There appears to be confusion between the actual bug causing the vulnerability in the first place and the buggy (initial) fix for the vulnerability.

The initial fix was never released and it was buggy, but that doesn't make the CVE invalid in any way.

[@piru](https://github.com/piru) based on your clarification my understanding is that this does affect existing releases. Is there a release planned with the fix? From <https://zlib.net/> the most recent releases looks like it came out March 27 which I assume was before this issue.

Sorry, something went wrong.

According to the CVE there are no released versions that contain the fix. Is there a way to get a notification when there is one?
