Z_SYNC_FLUSH requests that inflate() flush as much","  output as possible to the output buffer.  Z_BLOCK requests that inflate()","  stop if and when it gets to the next deflate block boundary.  When decoding","  the zlib or gzip format, this will cause inflate() to return immediately","  after the header and before the first block.  When doing a raw inflate,","  inflate() will go ahead and process the first block, and will return when it","  gets to the end of that block, or when it runs out of data.","","    The Z_BLOCK option assists in appending to or combining deflate streams.","  To assist in this, on return inflate() always sets strm-\u003edata_type to the","  number of unused bits in the last byte taken from strm-\u003enext_in, plus 64 if","  inflate() is currently decoding the last block in the deflate stream, plus","  128 if inflate() returned immediately after decoding an end-of-block code or","  decoding the complete header up to just before the first byte of the deflate","  stream.  The end-of-block will not be indicated until all of the uncompressed","  data from that block has been written to strm-\u003enext_out.  The number of","  unused bits may in general be greater than seven, except when bit 7 of","  data_type is set, in which case the number of unused bits will be less than","  eight.  data_type is set as noted here every time inflate() returns for all","  flush options, and so can be used to determine the amount of currently","  consumed input in bits.","","    The Z_TREES option behaves as Z_BLOCK does, but it also returns when the","  end of each deflate block header is reached, before any actual data in that","  block is decoded.  This allows the caller to determine the length of the","  deflate block header for later use in random access within a deflate block.","  256 is added to the value of strm-\u003edata_type when inflate() returns","  immediately after reaching the end of the deflate block header.","","    inflate() should normally be called until it returns Z_STREAM_END or an","  error.  However if all decompression is to be performed in a single step (a","  single call of inflate), the parameter flush should be set to Z_FINISH.  In","  this case all pending input is processed and all pending output is flushed;","  avail_out must be large enough to hold all of the uncompressed data for the","  operation to complete.  (The size of the uncompressed data may have been","  saved by the compressor for this purpose.)  The use of Z_FINISH is not","  required to perform an inflation in one step.  However it may be used to","  inform inflate that a faster approach can be used for the single inflate()","  call.  Z_FINISH also informs inflate to not maintain a sliding window if the","  stream completes, which reduces inflate's memory footprint.
