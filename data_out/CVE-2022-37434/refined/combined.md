Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-15da0cf165
2022-08-31 10:14:39.516425
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : rsync
Product : Fedora 35
Version : 3.2.5
Release : 1.fc35
URL : <https://rsync.samba.org/>
Summary : A program for synchronizing files over a network
Description :
Rsync uses a reliable algorithm to bring remote and host files into
sync very quickly. Rsync is fast because it just sends the differences
in the files over the network instead of sending the complete
files. Rsync is often used as a very powerful mirroring process or
just as a more capable replacement for the rcp command. A technical
report which describes the rsync algorithm is included in this
package.

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3103-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : zlib
Version        : 1:1.2.11.dfsg-1+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-37434
Debian Bug     : 1016710

Evgeny Legerov reported a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in
the inflate operation in zlib, which could result in denial of service
or potentially the execution of arbitrary code if specially crafted
input is processed.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
1:1.2.11.dfsg-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your zlib packages.

For the detailed security status of zlib please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/zlib>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-25e4dbedf9
2022-08-18 02:02:57.709676
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : rsync
Product : Fedora 36
Version : 3.2.5
Release : 1.fc36
URL : <https://rsync.samba.org/>
Summary : A program for synchronizing files over a network
Description :
Rsync uses a reliable algorithm to bring remote and host files into
sync very quickly. Rsync is fast because it just sends the differences
in the files over the network instead of sending the complete
files. Rsync is often used as a very powerful mirroring process or
just as a more capable replacement for the rcp command. A technical
report which describes the rsync algorithm is included in this
package.

## Description

zlib through 1.2.12 has a heap-based buffer over-read or buffer overflow in inflate in inflate.c via a large gzip header extra field. NOTE: only applications that call inflateGetHeader are affected. Some common applications bundle the affected zlib source code but may be unable to call inflateGetHeader (e.g., see the nodejs/node reference).

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fix a bug when getting a gzip header extra field with inflate().

```
If the extra field was larger than the space the user provided with
inflateGetHeader(), and if multiple calls of inflate() delivered
the extra header data, then there could be a buffer overflow of the
provided space. This commit assures that provided space is not
exceeded.

Neither. This bug is not present in any released version of zlib. It was introduced two commits ago on the develop branch of zlib. (Is it standard practice to issue CVEs for unreleased code?)

Oh, I think I get it now. I was talking about [CVE-2022-37434](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cfmr-vrgj-vqwv "CVE-2022-37434").

Looking at it now, this commit fixes the [CVE-2022-37434](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cfmr-vrgj-vqwv "CVE-2022-37434") and the commit [1eb7682](https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/1eb7682f845ac9e9bf9ae35bbfb3bad5dacbd91d) fixes the segfault introduced by this commit. Is this assumption correct?

That is definitely not standard practice.

~~To me this CVE entry is merely a false-positive (from a technical point of view, since no affected version was released) if my assumption turns out to be right.~~

Looking at <https://github.com/madler/zlib/blame/master/inflate.c> the bug is at least 11 years old. It appears the affected code was committed in [9811b53](https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/9811b53dd9e8f67015c7199fff12b5bfc6965330) as zlib 1.2.2.1

[@piru](https://github.com/piru) thanks for checking this.

Hm, I'm not sure why but the changelog says 2004, but the commit was in 2011.

Maybe the project was uploaded to GitHub afterwards and the commit timestamps are not the right ones.

<https://zlib.net/fossils/> says also 2004. So if this is the first affected version (which would have to be verified), then it means that we at least have a definitive list of affected versions and a relevant CPE (1.2.2.1 - <= 1.2.12).

See also <https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/9811b53dd9e8f67015c7199fff12b5bfc6965330.patch>

So if the changelog is right, then all versions since 2004 (1.2.2.1) are affected?

[zlib/ChangeLog](https://github.com/madler/zlib/blob/21767c654d31d2dccdde4330529775c6c5fd5389/ChangeLog#L801)

|  | - Add inflateGetheader() to retrieve gzip headers |
| --- | --- |

Can someone verify this?

Because this contradicts the statement from [eff308a#commitcomment-80753451](https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/eff308af425b67093bab25f80f1ae950166bece1#commitcomment-80753451):

Which was in reply to [eff308a#commitcomment-80706024](https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/eff308af425b67093bab25f80f1ae950166bece1#commitcomment-80706024):

> Hi, [@madler](https://github.com/madler) was this CVE introduced in the zlib-1.2.12 version, or this CVE affects the older 1.2.11 version as well?

Or maybe there is some misunderstanding, which needs some clarification.

It's of course possible that the code originates from even earlier. It as *at least* 11 years old.

There appears to be confusion between the actual bug causing the vulnerability in the first place and the buggy (initial) fix for the vulnerability.

The initial fix was never released and it was buggy, but that doesn't make the CVE invalid in any way.

[@piru](https://github.com/piru) based on your clarification my understanding is that this does affect existing releases. Is there a release planned with the fix? From <https://zlib.net/> the most recent releases looks like it came out March 27 which I assume was before this issue.

/\* \* Change history: \* \* 1.2.beta0 24 Nov 2002 \* - First version -- complete rewrite of inflate to simplify code, avoid \* creation of window when not needed, minimize use of window when it is \* needed, make inffast.c even faster, implement gzip decoding, and to \* improve code readability and style over the previous zlib inflate code \* \* 1.2.beta1 25 Nov 2002 \* - Use pointers for available input and output checking in inffast.c \* - Remove input and output counters in inffast.c \* - Change inffast.c entry and loop from avail\_in >= 7 to >= 6 \* - Remove unnecessary second byte pull from length extra in inffast.c \* - Unroll direct copy to three copies per loop in inffast.c \* \* 1.2.beta2 4 Dec 2002 \* - Change external routine names to reduce potential conflicts \* - Correct filename to inffixed.h for fixed tables in inflate.c \* - Make hbuf[] unsigned char to match parameter type in inflate.c \* - Change strm->next\_out[-state->offset] to \*(strm->next\_out - state->offset) \* to avoid negation problem on Alphas (64 bit) in inflate.c \* \* 1.2.beta3 22 Dec 2002 \* - Add comments on state->bits assertion in inffast.c \* - Add comments on op field in inftrees.h \* - Fix bug in reuse of allocated window after inflateReset() \* - Remove bit fields--back to byte structure for speed \* - Remove distance extra == 0 check in inflate\_fast()--only helps for lengths \* - Change post-increments to pre-increments in inflate\_fast(), PPC biased? \* - Add compile time option, POSTINC, to use post-increments instead (Intel?) \* - Make MATCH copy in inflate() much faster for when inflate\_fast() not used \* - Use local copies of stream next and avail values, as well as local bit \* buffer and bit count in inflate()--for speed when inflate\_fast() not used \* \* 1.2.beta4 1 Jan 2003 \* - Split ptr - 257 statements in inflate\_table() to avoid compiler warnings \* - Move a comment on output buffer sizes from inffast.c to inflate.c \* - Add comments in inffast.c to introduce the inflate\_fast() routine \* - Rearrange window copies in inflate\_fast() for speed and simplification \* - Unroll last copy for window match in inflate\_fast() \* - Use local copies of window variables in inflate\_fast() for speed \* - Pull out common wnext == 0 case for speed in inflate\_fast() \* - Make op and len in inflate\_fast() unsigned for consistency \* - Add FAR to lcode and dcode declarations in inflate\_fast() \* - Simplified bad distance check in inflate\_fast() \* - Added inflateBackInit(), inflateBack(), and inflateBackEnd() in new \* source file infback.c to provide a call-back interface to inflate for \* programs like gzip and unzip -- uses window as output buffer to avoid \* window copying \* \* 1.2.beta5 1 Jan 2003 \* - Improved inflateBack() interface to allow the caller to provide initial \* input in strm. \* - Fixed stored blocks bug in inflateBack() \* \* 1.2.beta6 4 Jan 2003 \* - Added comments in inffast.c on effectiveness of POSTINC \* - Typecasting all around to reduce compiler warnings \* - Changed loops from while (1) or do {} while (1) to for (;;), again to \* make compilers happy \* - Changed type of window in inflateBackInit() to unsigned char \* \* \* 1.2.beta7 27 Jan 2003 \* - Changed many types to unsigned or unsigned short to avoid warnings \* - Added inflateCopy() function \* \* 1.2.0 9 Mar 2003 \* - Changed inflateBack() interface to provide separate opaque descriptors \* for the in() and out() functions \* - Changed inflateBack() argument and in\_func typedef to swap the length \* and buffer address return values for the input function \* - Check next\_in and next\_out for Z\_NULL on entry to inflate() \* \* The history for versions after 1.2.0 are in ChangeLog in zlib distribution. \*/

/\* inflate() uses a state machine to process as much input data and generate as much output data as possible before returning. The state machine is structured roughly as follows:
 for (;;) switch (state) { ... case STATEn: if (not enough input data or output space to make progress) return; ... make progress ... state = STATEm; break; ... }
 so when inflate() is called again, the same case is attempted again, and if the appropriate resources are provided, the machine proceeds to the next state. The NEEDBITS() macro is usually the way the state evaluates whether it can proceed or should return. NEEDBITS() does the return if the requested bits are not available. The typical use of the BITS macros is:
 NEEDBITS(n); ... do something with BITS(n) ... DROPBITS(n);
 where NEEDBITS(n) either returns from inflate() if there isn't enough input left to load n bits into the accumulator, or it continues. BITS(n) gives the low n bits in the accumulator. When done, DROPBITS(n) drops the low n bits off the accumulator. INITBITS() clears the accumulator and sets the number of available bits to zero. BYTEBITS() discards just enough bits to put the accumulator on a byte boundary. After BYTEBITS() and a NEEDBITS(8), then BITS(8) would return the next byte in the stream.
 NEEDBITS(n) uses PULLBYTE() to get an available byte of input, or to return if there is no input available. The decoding of variable length codes uses PULLBYTE() directly in order to pull just enough bytes to decode the next code, and no more.
 Some states loop until they get enough input, making sure that enough state information is maintained to continue the loop where it left off if NEEDBITS() returns in the loop. For example, want, need, and keep would all have to actually be part of the saved state in case NEEDBITS() returns:
 case STATEw: while (want < need) { NEEDBITS(n); keep[want++] = BITS(n); DROPBITS(n); } state = STATEx; case STATEx:
 As shown above, if the next state is also the next case, then the break is omitted.
 A state may also return if there is not enough output space available to complete that state. Those states are copying stored data, writing a literal byte, and copying a matching string.
 When returning, a "goto inf\_leave" is used to update the total counters, update the check value, and determine whether any progress has been made during that inflate() call in order to return the proper return code. Progress is defined as a change in either strm->avail\_in or strm->avail\_out. When there is a window, goto inf\_leave will update the window with the last output written. If a goto inf\_leave occurs in the middle of decompression and there is no window currently, goto inf\_leave will create one and copy output to the window for the next call of inflate().
 In this implementation, the flush parameter of inflate() only affects the return code (per zlib.h). inflate() always writes as much as possible to strm->next\_out, given the space available and the provided input--the effect documented in zlib.h of Z\_SYNC\_FLUSH. Furthermore, inflate() always defers the allocation of and copying into a sliding window until necessary, which provides the effect documented in zlib.h for Z\_FINISH when the entire input stream available. So the only thing the flush parameter actually does is: when flush is set to Z\_FINISH, inflate() cannot return Z\_OK. Instead it will return Z\_BUF\_ERROR if it has not reached the end of the stream. \*/

Debian Security Advisory DSA-5218-1                   security@debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/security/>                     Salvatore Bonaccorso

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : zlib
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-37434
Debian Bug     : 1016710

Evgeny Legerov reported a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in
the inflate operation in zlib, which could result in denial of service
or potentially the execution of arbitrary code if specially crafted
input is processed.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.2.11.dfsg-2+deb11u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your zlib packages.

For the detailed security status of zlib please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/zlib>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

Subject: Re: zlib buffer overflow

Expanding this for the benefit of list members and the archives:

The CVE description is:

    zlib through 1.2.12 has a heap-based buffer over-read or buffer overflow
    in inflate in inflate.c via a large gzip header extra field.

    NOTE: only applications that call inflateGetHeader are affected. Some
    common applications bundle the affected zlib source code but may be unable
    to call inflateGetHeader (e.g., see the nodejs/node reference).

where the nodejs reference is to:

<https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/75b68c6e4db515f76df73af476eccf382bbcb00a/deps/zlib/inflate.c#L762-L764>

The reproducer is posted at <https://github.com/ivd38/zlib_overflow> and
notes the issue was found by Evgeny Legerov of @intevydis - who is
presumably our original poster here.

The initial fix upstream was:

     If the extra field was larger than the space the user provided with
     inflateGetHeader(), and if multiple calls of inflate() delivered
     the extra header data, then there could be a buffer overflow of the
     provided space. This commit assures that provided space is not
     exceeded.

from <https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/eff308af425b67093bab25f80f1ae950166bece1>

*but* the curl developers found that crashed in their testing, as reported

## Description

zlib through 1.2.12 has a heap-based buffer over-read or buffer overflow in inflate in inflate.c via a large gzip header extra field. NOTE: only applications that call inflateGetHeader are affected. Some common applications bundle the affected zlib source code but may be unable to call inflateGetHeader (e.g., see the nodejs/node reference).

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
