- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the ability of an authenticated user to manipulate command variables. This manipulation causes the system to print sensitive information, specifically Auth, Priv, and SSL key store passwords, in unencrypted logs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the insecure handling of command variables leading to plaintext password exposure in logs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain access to sensitive credentials, including authentication, privilege, and SSL keys, by examining the logs. Although the advisory does not specifically mention it, access to these credentials would likely allow an attacker to perform actions they are not normally authorized to perform.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves an authenticated user manipulating command variables.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Brocade SANnav system to exploit the vulnerability.
