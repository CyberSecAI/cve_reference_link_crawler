Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw present in the `/quiz_board.php` file of the Simple Realtime Quiz System. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed via the `quiz` parameter, leading to the injection of malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privileges:** The successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to privilege escalation. An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify database content, or potentially take control of the underlying server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/quiz_board.php` endpoint.
- **`quiz` parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `quiz`, which is part of the URI. The attacker injects malicious SQL code through this parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application to send the malicious HTTP request.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability and the vulnerable parameter (`quiz`) to craft the malicious request.
- **No authentication required:** The provided exploit does not show any evidence of authentication requirements, implying that the SQLi can be exploited without authentication.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided `sqlmap` command and the sample `a.txt` file showcase a practical example of how an attacker can test and exploit this vulnerability using the `sqlmap` tool.
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the SourceCodester Simple Realtime Quiz System.
- The impact is specified as potentially leading to an escalation of privileges.
