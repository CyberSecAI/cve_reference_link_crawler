Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper session management within the alf.io Docker image. Specifically, user sessions are not terminated correctly when a user is invalidated or deleted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-613:** Improper Session Management - The core issue is the failure to properly invalidate or terminate user sessions after the user's account has been invalidated or deleted. This allows users to retain access to the admin area even after their access should have been revoked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain or maintain access to the admin area even after the user account has been invalidated/deleted.
- **Confidentiality Impact (Low):** Potential unauthorized access to some confidential information within the admin area.
- **Integrity Impact (Low):** Possible unauthorized modification of some data.
- **Availability Impact (High):** The system's availability could be significantly impacted as unauthorized users might manipulate the system or cause disruptions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be launched over the network, indicating that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have a user account with low-level privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
