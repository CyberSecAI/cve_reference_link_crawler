{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises because the WebSocket handler for GraphQL operations in Quarkus is placed before the authorization checks. This allows requests over WebSockets to bypass authentication if no role-based permissions are specified on the GraphQL operation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper authorization checks for WebSocket connections",
      "Lack of role-based permission enforcement on GraphQL operations over WebSockets",
      "Inconsistent security enforcement between HTTP and WebSocket endpoints"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can access information and functionality outside of normal granted API permissions by sending requests via WebSockets without authentication.",
    "attack_vectors": "Sending a GraphQL request over a WebSocket without proper authentication.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to establish a WebSocket connection to the vulnerable endpoint and send GraphQL requests. No special permissions are required.",
        "additional_information": "The vulnerability is exploitable only when no role-based permissions (@RolesAllowed) are specified on the GraphQL operation. If role-based permissions are specified, a NullPointerException occurs due to the lack of an associated security identity in the WebSocket handler context before the authorization check.",
    "fixed_version": "quarkus 3.6.0"
  }
