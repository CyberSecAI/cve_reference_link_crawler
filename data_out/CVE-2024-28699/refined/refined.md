The provided content is related to CVE-2024-28699. It describes a memory leak vulnerability found in the `pdf2json` project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the improper memory management within the `GString::copy()`, `Page::getLinks()`, and `GString::resize()` functions of the `pdf2json` library. Specifically, memory is allocated using `new` or `new[]` but not deallocated with `delete` or `delete[]`, leading to memory leaks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leaks in `GString::copy()`, `Page::getLinks()`, and `GString::resize()`.
- The issue is triggered when processing a specially crafted PDF file that causes errors during xref table reconstruction and triggers calls to the vulnerable functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory leaks can lead to increased memory consumption over time.
- If the memory leaks are severe enough, it could eventually lead to program instability, reduced performance, or even denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted PDF file using the `pdf2json` utility.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PDF file to be processed by the vulnerable application.
- The attacker must also have the ability to execute the `pdf2json` utility with the malicious file as input.

**Additional Details:**
- The report indicates that the vulnerability was detected using LeakSanitizer during a fuzzing process.
- The specific lines of code triggering the leaks are provided in the report, allowing developers to pinpoint the issue.
- The issue is reproducible on Ubuntu 20.04 TLS.
