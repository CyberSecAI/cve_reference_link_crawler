# Incorrect Authorization in commands API

Moderate

[Jackenmen](/Jackenmen)
published
GHSA-5jq8-q6rj-9gq4
Jul 10, 2024

## Package

pip

Red-DiscordBot
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=3.5.0, <3.5.9

## Patched versions

3.5.10

## Description

### Impact

Due to a bug in Red's Core API, 3rd-party cogs using the [`@commands.can_manage_channel()`](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/framework_checks.html#redbot.core.commands.can_manage_channel) command permission check without additional permission controls may authorize a user to run a command even when that user doesn't have permissions to manage a channel.

None of the core commands or core cogs are affected. The maintainers of the project are not aware of any *public* 3rd-party cog utilizing this API at the time of writing this advisory.

The [`@commands.mod_or_can_manage_channel()`](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/framework_checks.html#redbot.core.commands.mod_or_can_manage_channel), [`@commands.admin_or_can_manage_channel()`](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/framework_checks.html#redbot.core.commands.admin_or_can_manage_channel), and [`@commands.guildowner_or_can_manage_channel()`](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/framework_checks.html#redbot.core.commands.guildowner_or_can_manage_channel) command permission checks are unaffected.

CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:L/SA:N/AU:Y/R:U/RE:L

### Patches

The problem was patched in PR [#6398](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/pull/6398) and later released in version [3.5.10](https://pypi.org/project/Red-DiscordBot/3.5.10/).

### Workarounds

Any cog using the [`@commands.can_manage_channel()`](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/framework_checks.html#redbot.core.commands.can_manage_channel) command permission check should be unloaded until an upgrade to a patched version can be performed.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Description of the changes

[Red-DiscordBot/redbot/core/commands/requires.py](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/blob/ad1e1aa2ba804cceae29757b48cce0c0c0ae4703/redbot/core/commands/requires.py#L791-L806)

|  | def can\_manage\_channel(\*, allow\_thread\_owner: bool = False) -> Callable[[\_T], \_T]: |
| --- | --- |
|  | """Restrict the command to users with permissions to manage channel. |
|  |  |
|  | This check properly resolves the permissions for `discord.Thread` as well. |
|  |  |
|  | This check can be overridden by rules. |
|  |  |
|  | Parameters |
|  | ---------- |
|  | allow\_thread\_owner: bool |
|  | If ``True``, the command will also be allowed to run if the author is a thread owner. |
|  | This can, for example, be useful to check if the author can edit a channel/thread's name |
|  | as that, in addition to members with manage channel/threads permission, |
|  | can also be done by the thread owner. |
|  | """ |
|  | return \_can\_manage\_channel\_deco(allow\_thread\_owner) |

`@commands.can_manage_channel` passes the `bool` value `allow_thread_owner` as the first parameter to `_can_manage_channel_deco`

[Red-DiscordBot/redbot/core/commands/requires.py](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/blob/ad1e1aa2ba804cceae29757b48cce0c0c0ae4703/redbot/core/commands/requires.py#L763-L778)

|  | def \_can\_manage\_channel\_deco( |
| --- | --- |
|  | privilege\_level: Optional[PrivilegeLevel] = None, allow\_thread\_owner: bool = False |
|  | ) -> Callable[[\_T], \_T]: |
|  | async def predicate(ctx: "Context") -> bool: |
|  | if utils.can\_user\_manage\_channel( |
|  | ctx.author, ctx.channel, allow\_thread\_owner=allow\_thread\_owner |
|  | ): |
|  | return True |
|  |  |
|  | if privilege\_level is not None: |
|  | if await PrivilegeLevel.from\_ctx(ctx) >= privilege\_level: |
|  | return True |
|  |  |
|  | return False |
|  |  |
|  | return permissions\_check(predicate) |

`_can_manage_channel_deco` expects the first parameter to be a `PrivilegeLevel`. When a `bool` is passed instead, the eventual comparison results in `if await PrivilegeLevel.from_ctx(ctx) >= <bool>`.

[Red-DiscordBot/redbot/core/commands/requires.py](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/blob/ad1e1aa2ba804cceae29757b48cce0c0c0ae4703/redbot/core/commands/requires.py#L97-L117)

Lines 97 to 117
in
[ad1e1aa](/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/commit/ad1e1aa2ba804cceae29757b48cce0c0c0ae4703)

|  | class PrivilegeLevel(enum.IntEnum): |
| --- | --- |
|  | """Enumeration for special privileges.""" |
|  |  |
|  | # Maintainer Note: do NOT re-order these. |
|  | # Each privilege level also implies access to the ones before it. |
|  | # Inserting new privilege levels at a later point is fine if that is considered. |
|  |  |
|  | NONE = enum.auto() |
|  | """No special privilege level.""" |
|  |  |
|  | MOD = enum.auto() |
|  | """User has the mod role.""" |
|  |  |
|  | ADMIN = enum.auto() |
|  | """User has the admin role.""" |
|  |  |
|  | GUILD\_OWNER = enum.auto() |
|  | """User is the guild level.""" |
|  |  |
|  | BOT\_OWNER = enum.auto() |
|  | """User is a bot owner.""" |

Since `enum.auto` increments starting from `1`, and `bool`s are interpreted as an int of `0` or `1`, the `PrivilegeLevel` requirement is always passed. As a result, this check always passes, regardless of the channel state or the permissions of the invoker. This is not the case for all other checks that use the `_can_manage_channel_deco` helper, as those checks explicitly pass a `PrivilegeLevel`.
### Have the changes in this PR been tested?
