Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of input sanitization and validation of the `id` parameter in the `delete.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter, which is then directly used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The application directly embeds user-controlled input into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can manipulate the database by executing arbitrary SQL queries. This could lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Accessing or extracting sensitive data from the database.
    *   **Data Modification:** Modifying existing data.
    *   **Data Deletion:** Deleting data from the database.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Potentially disrupting the application by making changes to the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, gaining higher level privileges by exploiting database functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exposed through the `delete.php` script, specifically through the `id` parameter in the URL query string.
*   The attacker can craft a malicious URL with the `id` parameter containing SQL injection payload and send a request to this script. For example:  `http://localhost/delete.php?id=4 AND (SELECT 8445 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))pmFJ)`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `delete.php` script.
*   The attacker needs a valid `PHPSESSID` cookie to access the application.
*   The attacker doesn't necessarily need to be authenticated, but they must know the structure of the database to craft effective SQL injection payloads.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided content includes a proof-of-concept using SQLMap to demonstrate the vulnerability, confirming it can be automatically exploited.
*   The vulnerable code is located within `core/functions/asset.php` (where the SQL query is constructed) and `delete.php` where user input is taken directly into the query
