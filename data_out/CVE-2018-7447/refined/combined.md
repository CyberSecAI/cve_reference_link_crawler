| Description: mojoportal is prone to multiple persistent cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to sanitize user-supplied input. The 'Title' and 'Subtitle' fields of 'Blog' page are vulnerable.  Impact: Attacker can execute arbitrary code in the browser of a random user.  Affected version: all  CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:P/I:P/A:P  Credit: Preethi Koroth (@p3core0ath)  Thanks. |

| This is not an issue because these fields are only accessible by admins and this is a content management system. As a content management system, admins have to have the ability to add scripts to their pages. Further, the content wysiwyg editors also allow admins to add scripts to a page. While it would be silly to add them to the title or subtitle fields, it's not a vulnerability.  You are effectively calling site admins attackers if you think this is a problem.  Please close the CVE. |

| [@JosephMDavis](https://github.com/JosephMDavis) since it's pretty inconceivable anyone would want script in blog title or subtitle, wouldn't it be prudent to prevent execution when these are rendered on page? That would address OP's concern without any impact on mojo functionality. Or am I missing something? |

| Hi Crispin,  I've already done so in my copy. I'll push to the repo soon.  I just don't think it makes sense to call this a vulnerability and give the impression mojo has a security flaw like this.  Thanks, Joe |

| [@JosephMDavis](https://github.com/JosephMDavis) agreed. And blog posts can never be created by anonymous users. But this seems like a safe and sensible change anyway. |

| [@CrispinF](https://github.com/CrispinF) I would argue that it's not any safer or prudent, as you can still put scripts (and rightfully so) in the excerpt and and body of the post. I would agree, however, that it makes more sense to have these inputs output text only, as we can change the markup with the theme.skin. |

| To clarify, [@ElijahFowler](https://github.com/ElijahFowler) I meant "sensible" as in it should help close this CVE. And I meant "safe" as in this change won't remove any useful functionality. |
