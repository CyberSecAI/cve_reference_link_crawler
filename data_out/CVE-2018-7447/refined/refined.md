Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The mojoportal application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the 'Title' and 'Subtitle' fields of the 'Blog' page. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability is persistent because the malicious scripts are stored in the database and executed whenever the blog page is rendered.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the browser of a random user who views the affected blog page. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the 'Title' and 'Subtitle' fields of the 'Blog' page. An attacker with the ability to create or edit blog posts can inject malicious scripts into these fields.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be an administrator or have the rights to edit or create blog posts. This is because the vulnerable fields are typically only accessible to users with these elevated permissions.

While it was initially argued that this was not a vulnerability because only admins can access these fields, the developers eventually agreed it was prudent to prevent script execution in these specific fields, indicating that there is a security risk. A fix was implemented to address the issue.
