Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21635:

**1. Verification:**

The content from both `www.oracle.com` and `security.netapp.com` explicitly mentions CVE-2022-21635. Both sources describe it as a vulnerability affecting MySQL Server. The NetApp advisory specifically states: "Certain MySQL versions are susceptible to multiple vulnerabilities...". So, the content is related to this CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability exists within the `InnoDB` component of MySQL Server.
- It's related to the optimizer, data dictionary or privileges and replication, according to the Oracle advisory for other related CVEs.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- The vulnerability is within the `InnoDB` storage engine, which is a core part of MySQL server responsible for handling data storage and retrieval.
- The nature of the vulnerability can be a high impact vulnerability.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Oracle:** The Oracle document notes this specific vulnerability could lead to "unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all of the MySQL Server accessible data, or to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DoS) of MySQL Server."
- **NetApp:** NetApp's advisory mirrors this, stating exploitation may result in "unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all of the MySQL Server accessible data, or to a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DoS) of MySQL Server."

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is primarily over the network via the MySQL protocol.
- The Oracle Risk Matrix also notes `MySQL protocol`.
- Access to the server can be from the Network.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Oracle:** Requires a "high" level of privileges on the server to exploit this vulnerability.
- **NetApp:** The NetApp advisory does not specify explicitly needed privileges but indicates exploitation is possible via the network. The CVSS scores in the NetApp document for CVE-2022-21635 lists "PR:H", indicating the need for "High" privileges. This confirms that an attacker would need high privileges.
- The CVSS vector string is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H` , meaning the Attack Vector is Network, Attack Complexity is Low, Privileges Required is High and Scope is Unchanged.

**Additional Notes:**
- The NetApp advisory provides specific links to patches for their affected products.
- The Oracle advisory provides a risk matrix detailing the potential impact.
- Both sources refer to "Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2022" for further details on the context of this and other related vulnerabilities.

In summary, CVE-2022-21635 is a vulnerability within the InnoDB component of MySQL Server that can be exploited by a high-privilege attacker on the network, leading to potential data breaches, DoS or system takeover.
