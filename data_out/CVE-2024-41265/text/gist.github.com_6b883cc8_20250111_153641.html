|  | [Suggested description] |
| --- | --- |
|  | cortex v0.42.1 is configured to skip TLS certificate verification, |
|  | possibly allowing attackers to execute a man-in-the-middle attack. |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  | In Cortex CLI, the export command, which triggers the makeOperatorRequest |
|  | function within cortexlabs/cortex/cli/cluster/lib\_http\_client.go, |
|  | establishes TLS connections with InsecureSkipVerify set to true. |
|  | This configuration allows the client to bypass TLS certificate verification, |
|  | undermining the security of the TLS connection and exposing the |
|  | application to potential man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. |
|  |  |
|  | The problematic code snippet is as follows: |
|  |  |
|  | client := &http.Client{ |
|  | Timeout: timeout, |
|  | Transport: &http.Transport{ |
|  | TLSClientConfig: &tls.Config{InsecureSkipVerify: true}, |
|  | }, |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | response, err := client.Do(request) |
|  |  |
|  | Potential Impact |
|  | Disabling TLS certificate verification in this manner makes the application susceptible to: |
