### Description

The Smart Online Order for Clover plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'moo\_deactivateAndClean' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to deactivate the plugin and drop all plugin tables from the database.
