Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-25162:

**Root Cause:** Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)

**Vulnerability:** The affected Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC iQ-F series CPU modules are vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition caused by specially crafted network packets. The devices do not properly validate the input, leading to a crash or other malfunction.

**Impact:**
*   Successful exploitation can cause a DoS condition, disrupting the normal operation of the affected device.
*   Unlike CVE-2022-25161, this vulnerability (CVE-2022-25162) does NOT require a system reset for recovery.
*   The impact is limited to a temporary loss of availability/communication, and does not include data loss or disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through the network.
*   **Network Packets:**  Attackers send specially crafted packets to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the affected device.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication or user interaction is required for a successful attack.
*   **Low Attack Complexity**: The attack is considered to have a low level of complexity to perform.

*   FX5S-xMy/z (x=30,40,60,80, y=T.R, z=ES,ESS): Version 1.000.

**Mitigations:**
*   **Firmware Updates:** Apply the recommended firmware updates provided by Mitsubishi Electric (versions 1.270, 1.073, 1.030, 1.031 or later depending on the model).
*   **Network Security:**
    *   Use firewalls or VPNs to prevent unauthorized access.
    *   Restrict connections using firewalls or the IP filter function to limit access from untrusted networks/hosts.
*   **Contact Mitsubishi Electric:** Contact a Mitsubishi Electric representative for mitigation guidance regarding affected models for which updated firmware isn't directly available.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is related to CVE-2022-25161, but CVE-2022-25161 causes more severe DoS which requires a system reset to recover.
*   The provided documents confirm that no known public exploits target these vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Anton Dorfman of Positive Technologies.
