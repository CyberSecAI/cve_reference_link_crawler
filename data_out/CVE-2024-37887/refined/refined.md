Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37887:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how Nextcloud handles recurrence exceptions in shared calendar events. Specifically, when a user shares a calendar, the system does not properly restrict access to recurrence exceptions associated with private events.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Private event details, specifically recurrence exceptions, are being exposed to users who have been granted access to the calendar. This violates the intended privacy of the events.
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The system fails to enforce proper access control regarding recurrence exceptions for shared calendars.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to private calendar event details, specifically the recurrence exceptions. This could expose sensitive information related to the timing or modifications of private events.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access via the web interface or CalDAV.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have been granted access to a shared calendar that contains private events with recurrence exceptions.
- The attacker needs to be a valid Nextcloud user with access to the shared calendar.
- The attacker needs to view the shared calendar through the web interface or a CalDAV client.
