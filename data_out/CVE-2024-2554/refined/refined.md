Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: SQL injection in `edit-task.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** The application directly uses user-supplied input from the `task_id` GET parameter in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Weakness:**  SQL Injection. Specifically, the `task_id` variable from the GET request is directly embedded into the SQL query: `$sql = "SELECT * FROM task_info WHERE task_id='$task_id' ";`
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In this case, the sleep function is used, indicating a time-based blind SQL injection.
*   **Attack Vector:**  By crafting malicious SQL injection payloads in the `task_id` parameter of the URL, specifically via HTTP GET request.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and needs knowledge of SQL to craft the exploit.

**Vulnerability 2: SQL injection in `task-details.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** Similar to the first vulnerability, the `task_id` GET parameter is directly used in an SQL query without sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection. The vulnerable line is `$sql = "SELECT a.*, b.fullname FROM task_info a LEFT JOIN tbl_admin b ON(a.t_user_id = b.user_id) WHERE task_id='$task_id'";`
*   **Impact:**  Same as the first vulnerability, data exfiltration, modification or deletion through arbitrary SQL query execution. The provided sleep function indicates a time-based blind SQL injection.
*   **Attack Vector:** Through manipulating the `task_id` parameter in the URL using HTTP GET request.
*    **Required Capabilities:** Similar to vulnerability 1, the attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests, and knowledge of SQL to craft the exploit.

**Vulnerability 3: SQL injection in `update-employee.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** The `admin_id` GET parameter is directly used in an SQL query without sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection, via the following line: `$sql = "SELECT * FROM tbl_admin WHERE user_id='$admin_id' ";`
*   **Impact:**  Same as the previous vulnerabilities, data exfiltration, modification, or deletion through arbitrary SQL query execution. Time based SQL injection via sleep function.
*   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `admin_id` parameter in the URL via HTTP GET request.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  The attacker requires ability to send HTTP requests, and knowledge of SQL to craft the exploit.

**Vulnerability 4: SQL injection in `update-admin.php`**

*   **Root Cause:**  Direct usage of the `admin_id` GET parameter in an SQL query without proper sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection. The vulnerable line is: `$sql = "SELECT * FROM tbl_admin WHERE user_id='$admin_id' ";`
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries leading to data compromise. This is also a time based blind SQL injection.
*   **Attack Vector:** By injecting SQL code into the `admin_id` parameter of the URL via HTTP GET request.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests, and SQL knowledge to create the exploit.

**Summary**

The provided content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in a Task Management System. These vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user-supplied input in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to perform malicious actions on the database. The attack vectors are through GET requests with malicious payloads in the `task_id` or `admin_id` parameters. All four vulnerabilities are time-based blind SQL injections.
