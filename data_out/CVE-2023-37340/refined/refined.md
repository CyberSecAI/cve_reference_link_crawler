{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the parsing of PNG files within Kofax Power PDF. Specifically, there is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during PNG file processing.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write vulnerability. The insufficient validation allows writing past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a user opening or visiting a malicious file or page containing a specially crafted PNG file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PNG file to a target user. User interaction (opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious page) is required for exploitation."
