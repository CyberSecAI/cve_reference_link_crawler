## Descriptions

### Terrapin SSH vulnerability in Trilead API Plugin

**SECURITY-3333
/
CVE-2023-48795**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`trilead-api`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/trilead-api)**

**Description:**

Trilead API Plugin bundles the [Jenkins projectâ€™s fork of the Trilead SSH2 library](https://github.com/jenkinsci/trilead-ssh2/) for use by other plugins.

Trilead API Plugin 2.133.vfb\_8a\_7b\_9c5dd1 and earlier, except 2.84.86.vf9c960e9b\_458, bundles versions of Jenkins/Trilead SSH2 that are susceptible to [CVE-2023-48795](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48795) ([Terrapin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrapin_attack)).
This vulnerability allows a machine-in-the-middle attacker to reduce the security of an SSH connection.

Trilead API Plugin 2.141.v284120fd0c46 updates the bundled Jenkins/Trilead SSH2 library to version `build-217-jenkins-274.276.v58da_75159cb_7`, which by default removes the affected ciphers and encryption modes.

### Improper input sanitization in HTML Publisher Plugin

**SECURITY-3301
/
CVE-2024-28149**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`htmlpublisher`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/htmlpublisher)**

**Description:**

[SECURITY-784 / CVE-20218-1000175](/security/advisory/2018-04-16/#SECURITY-784) is a path traversal vulnerability in HTML Publisher Plugin 1.15 and earlier.
The fix for it retained compatibility for older reports as a fallback.

In HTML Publisher Plugin 1.16 through 1.32 (both inclusive) this fallback for reports created in HTML Publisher Plugin 1.15 and earlier does not properly sanitize input.
This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to do the following:

* Implement stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
* Determine whether a path on the Jenkins controller file system exists, without being able to access it.

HTML Publisher Plugin 1.32.1 removes support for reports created before HTML Publisher Plugin 1.15.
Those reports are retained on disk, but may no longer be accessible through the Jenkins UI.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in HTML Publisher Plugin

**SECURITY-3302
/
CVE-2024-28150**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`htmlpublisher`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/htmlpublisher)**

**Description:**

HTML Publisher Plugin 1.32 and earlier does not escape job names, report names, and index page titles shown as part of the report frame.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

HTML Publisher Plugin 1.32.1 escapes job names, report names, and index page titles when creating a new report.
HTML Publisher Plugin 1.32.1 checks reports created in earlier releases for the presence of unsafe characters in the report frame, and refuses to show these frames if unsafe characters are identified.

### Path traversal vulnerability in HTML Publisher Plugin

**SECURITY-3303
/
CVE-2024-28151**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`htmlpublisher`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/htmlpublisher)**

**Description:**

HTML Publisher Plugin 1.32 and earlier archives invalid symbolic links in report directories on agents and recreates them on the controller.
Attackers with Item/Configure permission can use them to determine whether a path on the Jenkins controller file system exists, without being able to access it.

HTML Publisher Plugin 1.32.1 does not archive symbolic links.

### Incorrect trust policy behavior for pull requests from forks in Bitbucket Branch Source Plugin

**SECURITY-3300
/
CVE-2024-28152**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`cloudbees-bitbucket-branch-source`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cloudbees-bitbucket-branch-source)**

**Description:**

Multibranch Pipelines with Bitbucket branch source can be configured to discover pull requests from forks.
The trust policy is set to "Forks in the same account" by default.

In Bitbucket Branch Source Plugin 866.vdea\_7dcd3008e and earlier, except 848.850.v6a\_a\_2a\_234a\_c81, this trust policy allows changes to Jenkinsfiles from users without write access to the project when using Bitbucket Server.
This allows attackers able to submit pull requests from forks to change the Pipeline behavior.

In Bitbucket Branch Source Plugin 871.v28d74e8b\_4226, the "Forks in the same account" trust policy does not extend trust to Jenkinsfiles modified by users without write access to the project.

|  | Pipelines using Bitbucket Cloud are unaffected by this issue. |
| --- | --- |

### Stored XSS vulnerability in OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin

**SECURITY-3344
/
CVE-2024-28153**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`dependency-check-jenkins-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/dependency-check-jenkins-plugin)**

**Description:**

OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin 5.4.5 and earlier does not escape vulnerability metadata from Dependency-Check reports on the Jenkins UI.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control workspace contents or CVE metadata.

OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin 5.4.6 escapes vulnerability metadata from Dependency-Check reports.

### Sensitive information exposure in build logs by MQ Notifier Plugin

**SECURITY-3180
/
CVE-2024-28154**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`mq-notifier`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/mq-notifier)**

**Description:**

MQ Notifier Plugin has a global option to log the JSON payload it sends to RabbitMQ in the build log.
This includes the build parameters, some of which may be sensitive, and they are not masked.

In MQ Notifier Plugin 1.4.0 and earlier, this option is enabled by default.
This results in unwanted exposure of sensitive information in build logs.

MQ Notifier Plugin 1.4.1 disables the global option to log the JSON payload it sends to RabbitMQ by default.
This option is disabled when updating from a previous release and needs to be re-enabled by administrators who want to use this feature.

### Missing permission checks in AppSpider Plugin

**SECURITY-3144
/
CVE-2024-28155**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`jenkinsci-appspider-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/jenkinsci-appspider-plugin)**

**Description:**

AppSpider Plugin 1.0.16 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to obtain information about available scan config names, engine group names, and client names.

AppSpider Plugin 1.0.17 requires Item/Configure permission for the affected HTTP endpoints.

### SSL/TLS certificate validation disabled by default in Delphix Plugin

**SECURITY-3215
/
CVE-2024-28161**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`delphix`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/delphix)**

**Description:**

Delphix Plugin provides a global option for administrators to enable or disable SSL/TLS certificate validation for Data Control Tower (DCT) connections.

In Delphix Plugin 3.0.1 this option is set to disable SSL/TLS certificate validation by default.

In Delphix Plugin 3.0.2 this option is set to enable SSL/TLS certificate validation by default.

|  | Delphix Plugin 3.0.2 inverts the semantics of the existing option. Administrators who update from version 3.0.1 to 3.0.2 will need to toggle this option to have the previously configured behavior. |
| --- | --- |

### Improper SSL/TLS certificate validation in Delphix Plugin

**SECURITY-3330
/
CVE-2024-28162**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`delphix`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/delphix)**

**Description:**

Delphix Plugin provides a global option for administrators to enable or disable SSL/TLS certificate validation for Data Control Tower (DCT) connections.

In Delphix Plugin 3.0.1 through 3.1.0 (both inclusive) an option change from disabled validation to enabled validation fails to take effect until Jenkins is restarted.

Delphix Plugin 3.1.1 applies the configuration change immediately when switching from disabled validation to enabled validation.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in docker-build-step Plugin

**SECURITY-3200
/
CVE-2024-2215 (CSRF), CVE-2024-2216 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`docker-build-step`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-build-step)**

**Description:**

docker-build-step Plugin 2.11 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint implementing a connection test.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified TCP or Unix socket URL.
Additionally, the plugin reconfigures itself using the provided connection test parameters, affecting future build step executions.

Additionally, this endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-3333 / CVE-2023-48795
Trilead API Plugin bundles the Jenkins project's fork of the Trilead SSH2
library for use by other plugins.

Trilead API Plugin 2.133.vfb_8a_7b_9c5dd1 and earlier, except
2.84.86.vf9c960e9b_458, bundles versions of Jenkins/Trilead SSH2 that are
susceptible to CVE-2023-48795 (Terrapin). This vulnerability allows a
machine-in-the-middle attacker to reduce the security of an SSH connection.

SECURITY-3301 / CVE-2024-28149
SECURITY-784 / CVE-20218-1000175 is a path traversal vulnerability in
HTML Publisher Plugin 1.15 and earlier. The fix for it retained
compatibility for older reports as a fallback.

In HTML Publisher Plugin 1.16 through 1.32 (both inclusive) this fallback
for reports created in HTML Publisher Plugin 1.15 and earlier does not
properly sanitize input. This allows attackers with Item/Configure
permission to do the following:

* Implement stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
* Determine whether a path on the Jenkins controller file system exists,
  without being able to access it.

SECURITY-3302 / CVE-2024-28150
HTML Publisher Plugin 1.32 and earlier does not escape job names, report
names, and index page titles shown as part of the report frame.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

SECURITY-3303 / CVE-2024-28151
HTML Publisher Plugin 1.32 and earlier archives invalid symbolic links in
report directories on agents and recreates them on the controller.
Attackers with Item/Configure permission can use them to determine whether
a path on the Jenkins controller file system exists, without being able to
access it.

SECURITY-3300 / CVE-2024-28152
Multibranch Pipelines with Bitbucket branch source can be configured to
discover pull requests from forks. The trust policy is set to "Forks in the
same account" by default.

In Bitbucket Branch Source Plugin 866.vdea_7dcd3008e and earlier, except
848.850.v6a_a_2a_234a_c81, this trust policy allows changes to Jenkinsfiles
from users without write access to the project when using Bitbucket Server.
This allows attackers able to submit pull requests from forks to change the
Pipeline behavior.

SECURITY-3344 / CVE-2024-28153
OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin 5.4.5 and earlier does not escape
vulnerability metadata from Dependency-Check reports on the Jenkins UI.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control workspace contents or CVE
metadata.

SECURITY-3180 / CVE-2024-28154
MQ Notifier Plugin has a global option to log the JSON payload it sends to
RabbitMQ in the build log. This includes the build parameters, some of
which may be sensitive, and they are not masked.

In MQ Notifier Plugin 1.4.0 and earlier, this option is enabled by default.
This results in unwanted exposure of sensitive information in build logs.

SECURITY-3144 / CVE-2024-28155
AppSpider Plugin 1.0.16 and earlier does not perform permission checks in
several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to obtain information
about available scan config names, engine group names, and client names.

SECURITY-3215 / CVE-2024-28161
Delphix Plugin provides a global option for administrators to enable or
disable SSL/TLS certificate validation for Data Control Tower (DCT)
connections.

In Delphix Plugin 3.0.1 this option is set to disable SSL/TLS certificate
validation by default.

SECURITY-3330 / CVE-2024-28162
Delphix Plugin provides a global option for administrators to enable or
disable SSL/TLS certificate validation for Data Control Tower (DCT)
connections.

In Delphix Plugin 3.0.1 through 3.1.0 (both inclusive) an option change
from disabled validation to enabled validation fails to take effect until
Jenkins is restarted.

SECURITY-3200 / CVE-2024-2215 (CSRF) & CVE-2024-2216 (permission check)
docker-build-step Plugin 2.11 and earlier does not perform a permission
check in an HTTP endpoint implementing a connection test.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an
attacker-specified TCP or Unix socket URL. Additionally, the plugin
reconfigures itself using the provided connection test parameters,
affecting future build step executions.

Additionally, this endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a
cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-3280 / CVE-2024-28156
Build Monitor View Plugin 1.14-860.vd06ef2568b_3f and earlier does not
escape Build Monitor View names.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to configure Build Monitor Views.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-3249 / CVE-2024-28157
GitBucket Plugin 0.8 and earlier does not sanitize Gitbucket URLs on build
views.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to configure jobs.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-3325 / CVE-2024-28158 (CSRF) & CVE-2024-28159 (permission check)
Subversion Partial Release Manager Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier does not
perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Item/Read permission to trigger a build.

Additionally, this endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a
cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-3248 / CVE-2024-28160
iceScrum Plugin 1.1.6 and earlier does not sanitize iceScrum project URLs
on build views.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to configure jobs.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
