To play a radio station, you first need to add a new player. You can do this by navigating to the Radio Player page on your WordPress dashboard and clicking the Add New button. Here, you can enter the player details, such as the name, audio source, and player skin.

**💻 Display the Player**

After adding a new player, you can display it on your website in various ways.

You can also display the player on any page or post by using the Radio Player Gutenberg block or Elementor widget.

**📌 Display the Sticky Player**

**🌐 Play HTTP Streams**

By following these simple steps, you can easily add and display a radio player on your WordPress website using the Radio Player plugin.

### 🔀 Radio Player Proxy Add-on

Recent updates in modern browsers have introduced stringent rules against mixed content.

As a result, if a stream link isn’t SSL-encrypted but your website is, it won’t play. Therefore, it’s crucial to ensure your stream links are SSL-secured.

**Play HTTP Streams** – HTTP Stream Player – Addon facilitates the playback of HTTP (non-SSL) radio streams on HTTPS-enabled websites. Serving as a bridge, it retrieves the radio stream and delivers it to the player as an HTTPS stream.

**Fix Metadata Display** – If your website server struggles to retrieve stream data including current track title, artist, artwork and recent play history, the plugin can display the current song title for you.

## FAQ

### 1. Why isn’t the stream metadata (like current track title, artist, and artwork) appearing in the player?

If the stream metadata isn’t appearing in the player, several factors might be responsible. Below are potential causes and troubleshooting steps:

**Presence of Metadata:** First, ascertain if the stream even has metadata. If it doesn’t, the player can’t display details like the current song title.

**Player Configuration:** Ensure the “Show Track Title” option is activated within the player controls settings. This ensures that any available metadata gets displayed.

**Server Configuration – allow\_url\_fopen:** The allow\_url\_fopen setting on the server must be enabled for the player to fetch the metadata from the stream. If you’re unsure about this setting, contact your web hosting provider. If you possess server access rights, you might be able to modify this setting yourself.

**Metadata Proxy Settings:** If after the above steps the metadata remains undisplayed, consider activating the Metadata Proxy settings. This can typically be found under the HTTP player settings tab within the plugin settings page.

**Further Assistance:** Have you followed all the provided steps but still encounter issues? We’re here to help. Reach out to us for more tailored assistance.
