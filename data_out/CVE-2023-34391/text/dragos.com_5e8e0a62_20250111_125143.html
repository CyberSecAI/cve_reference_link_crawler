## Celebrated by Customers

“We are convinced that Dragos has significantly helped us increase our overall security posture – as well as our ability to provide the best service possible to our customers. We couldn’t ask for anything better.”

Joe Reilly,
Director of Operational Technology, OUC

“The Dragos OT Watch team, enabled by Dragos Platform technology, provides a level of visibility into our assets and threats that we did not have the expertise nor the bandwidth to do on our own.”

Doug Short,
CIO & CISO Trinity River Authority of Texas

“We immediately saw value as the Dragos Platform showed us in detail what was running on all the networks.”

Wind Farm Operator

“What’s been helpful with Dragos is not just the technology, but the expertise that they bring to the table. Koch can now identify ICS/OT threats, rapidly pinpoint malicious behavior on their ICS/OT networks, provide an in-depth context of alerts, and reduce false positive alerts for complete threat detection.”

Gabe Green
CISO, Koch Industries

“We were initially focused on anomaly detection software and originally thought that we would benefit from the ability to see and react to alerts. But we quickly realized that the majority of those solutions just weren’t as mature as we needed. This awareness led us to consider OT visibility platforms in general, and the conversation pretty much started and stopped with Dragos.”

Electric and Water Utility
Ciso

“With the visibility provided by the Dragos Platform, automated monitoring capabilities alert the security team to potentially malicious behavior between assets and communications, so they can rapidly investigate and respond before attackers can progress.”

Oil and Gas
Ciso
