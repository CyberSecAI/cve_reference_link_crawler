# Submit #401826: Windmill Labs Windmill CE 1.380.0 Excessive Iteration[info](?kb.submission)

| Title | Windmill Labs Windmill CE 1.380.0 Excessive Iteration |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Lack of rate limiting could lead to account takeover. Details By knowing the HTTP request schema, an attacker can fetch the https://domain.com/api/workspaces/users URI, and Brute force the 32 character token (as specified in the cookie crate in the back-end code). They will anywhere between 3 days to infinity (or indefinite if they choose to brute force tokens created by users without expiry date) to do so to find a valid credential. Lack of rate limiting may allow an attacker to brute force a valid session token and gain unauthorized access to the account. |
