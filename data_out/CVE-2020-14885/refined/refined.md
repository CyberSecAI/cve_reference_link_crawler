Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-14885:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is located within the `shader_generate_main` function of Oracle VirtualBox.
- It stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. This lack of validation allows for a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:**  The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the program tries to access memory outside the designated buffer. This is a classic memory safety issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. The vulnerability allows an attacker to read data from memory locations beyond the intended buffer.
- **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** While this vulnerability itself doesn't directly escalate privileges, it can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution within the hypervisor context. This could ultimately lead to a privilege escalation if combined with another vulnerability that provides the ability to execute code.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have the ability to execute high-privileged code on the guest operating system. The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **High-Privileged Code Execution:** The attacker must already have a foothold within the guest system with the ability to execute high-privileged code. This suggests this is a secondary vulnerability, requiring the attacker to already have control of a guest instance.

**Additional Details:**

- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.3 with a vector of AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N. This indicates a Local attack vector, a High Privileges Required, and a High Confidentiality impact.
- **Affected Product:** Oracle VirtualBox versions prior to 6.1.18 are affected. The Oracle advisory indicates VirtualBox versions prior to 6.1.16 are vulnerable.
- **Patch Availability:** Oracle has released an update to patch this vulnerability.
- **Reported by:** An anonymous researcher working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
- **Mitigation:** The Gentoo security advisory recommends upgrading to version 6.1.18 or later to remediate this vulnerability.
