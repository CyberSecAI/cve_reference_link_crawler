{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically a lack of sanitization of user-supplied message content.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "HTML Injection (CWE-79)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML into messages, which can be used to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. In this case, the injected iframe was used to create a new admin user. This could lead to full control over the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "A user with permissions to send messages crafts a message containing a malicious iframe. This message is then sent to an admin user. When the admin views the message, the iframe is loaded, executing the injected code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs an account with message sending permissions and must target an admin user."
