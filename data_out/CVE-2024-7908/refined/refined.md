{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow occurs due to the function `setDefResponse` in `/www/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` copying the `IpAddress` parameter from a user request into a stack variable without proper bounds checking.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploitation could allow an attacker to overwrite data on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP request with a large `IpAddress` parameter to the `/www/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the affected device, therefore requiring network access. No authentication requirements are mentioned."
