{
  "CVE-2024-2700": {
    "status": "relevant",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "Quarkus captures local environment variables from the `quarkus.*` namespace during the application's build process. These captured variables are then inherited by the resulting application at runtime.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Leak of local configuration properties",
        "Improper handling of environment variables"
      ],
      "impact": "The built application may inherit sensitive configuration values that were intended for development or CI environments only. This could lead to dangerous behavior, such as unintended database modifications or bypassing TLS certificate verification if these properties are not overridden during deployment.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Configuration injection via inherited environment variables"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to gain access to the application's deployment environment after the application has been built to observe the leaked variables."
    },
        "affected_products": [
        "Red Hat build of Quarkus",
        "Red Hat AMQ Streams",
        "Red Hat OpenShift Serverless",
        "Red Hat build of Apicurio Registry",
         "Red Hat build of Apache Camel"
