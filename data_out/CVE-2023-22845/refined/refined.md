```
Root cause of vulnerability: The `cmap_first` variable, which is read from the Targa image header, is not validated, allowing it to be set to arbitrary values that may cause out-of-bounds reads when used as an offset into the palette data.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Out-of-bounds read in the `TGAInput::decode_pixel()` function. Specifically, a crafted TGA image file can set the `cmap_first` field to an arbitrary value that when used to calculate a memory offset, exceeds the allocated buffer for the palette data.

Impact of exploitation: Information disclosure. The out-of-bounds read allows an attacker to potentially read sensitive information from the application's memory.

Attack vectors: A specially crafted Targa image file. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger the vulnerability when opened by the vulnerable software.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted TGA file to the application that uses the vulnerable OpenImageIO library.
