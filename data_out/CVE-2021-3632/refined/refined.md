Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3632:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Keycloak handles passwordless authentication using WebAuthn. Specifically, if a user has no registered security devices or keys for passwordless login, an attacker can register a new device and gain control of the account. This occurs during the "normal" registration dialog when a user without a token attempts to log in via passwordless login.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Passwordless Registration:**  The system allows new security devices/keys to be registered for an account during the passwordless login flow when no devices are already registered. This bypasses the intended security mechanism.
- **Lack of Device Ownership Verification:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that when no device is present for a user, any attacker can register a new device, effectively taking over the account.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Hijacking:** An attacker can take complete control of a user's account by registering a new security device during the passwordless login process. This allows the attacker to bypass the need for a password, gain unauthorized access, and perform malicious actions under the compromised account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **WebAuthn Passwordless Login Flow:** The attack is initiated by attempting to log in to an account without any previously registered security device, and then registering a new device.
- **No Device Registered Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user has no previously registered device for passwordless login.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Target Account:** The attacker needs to know the username of a target account.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Keycloak instance to initiate the login process.
- **Timing:** The attack is most effective if the user has not yet registered a device for passwordless login or has deleted their last token.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the WebAuthn passwordless login flow, which is a tech preview feature for RHSSO 7.4.7, but can be enabled by the administrator.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves preventing registration of a new device during a passwordless login attempt when no device was previously registered, and it disables user setup for passwordless authentication via `isUserSetupAllowed()`, as evidenced by the code diff: `return false;`
- This issue was addressed in Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.4 for RHEL 6,7,8 and  7.4.9.
