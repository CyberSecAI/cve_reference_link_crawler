Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45015:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `search.php` resource of the Online Bus Booking System v1.0 where the `date` parameter is not validated or sanitized before being used in an SQL query. This lack of input sanitization allows for SQL injection.
*   **Weakness:** The application is susceptible to SQL Injection (SQLi) due to the direct inclusion of user-supplied input into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:** An attacker could extract sensitive information from the database, including user data, bus schedules, and other potentially confidential details.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could modify or delete data within the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, an attacker might be able to gain higher levels of access to the system.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker might be able to disrupt the availability of the application.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via HTTP requests. The attacker would manipulate the `date` parameter in a POST request to `search.php`.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability (unauthenticated). They only need network access to the vulnerable system.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Code:**
    ```php
    $source = $_POST['source'];
    $destination = $_POST['destination'];
    $date = $_POST['date'];
    ...
    $query = "SELECT * FROM posts WHERE post_via LIKE '%$source%$destination%' AND post_date='$date'";

    $search_query = mysqli_query($connection,$query);
    ```
*   The code snippet shows that the `$date` parameter from the POST request is directly embedded into the SQL query without any form of escaping or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through this parameter.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `search.php` file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is part of a set of SQL injection issues identified in the Online Bus Booking System v1.0.
*   The vendor is identified as Projectworlds Pvt. Limited.
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 9.8, indicating a critical severity.
*   The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, and there is no patch currently available.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Fluid Attacks' Offensive Team.
