  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to create a user with a custom object ID that starts with `role:`, which can then be used to gain role privileges.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation of user object IDs.",
      "Lack of checks for specific prefixes in object IDs during user creation and session validation."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can acquire the privileges of a specific role by creating a user with a crafted object ID. This can lead to unauthorized access, data modification, or other malicious activities depending on the role's permissions.",
    "attack_vectors": "The primary attack vector is through the user creation endpoint. An attacker can send a crafted request to create a new user with a specially formed objectId.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create new users and the server must have the `allowCustomObjectId` option enabled."
