2. Vulnerability

2.1. Affected Products

The vulnerability described in this document was reported for the following product versions:

• Ada Web Server - aws 20.00 (20191009)

The vulnerability impacts the generated random values within the aws modules:

• The Random Number Generator of Ada is not cryptographically secure, and some of aws random values

should use a Cryptographically Secure Pseudo Random Numbers Generator.

• The implementation of the Random_String() function in the src/core/aws-utils.adb module
introduces a bias in the generated random string values, where the values "1" and "2" have a much higher
frequency than any other character.

The vulnerability described in this document applies to the following product versions:

• Ada Web Server - aws < 25.1

2.2. Severity and Impact

CVSS v3.1 score: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:U/RL:U/RC:C)

This issue can possibly cause a session hijack attack on an Ada Web Server if an attacker extracts sufficient PRNG
data from legitimate requests, the secret state of the Meresenne Twister PRNG may be retrieved.

A CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) has been created for that case, and will be referred as
CVE-2024-41708.

2.3. Detailed Description

Thanks to another great investigation work by Chris Culnane and Ty Wilson-Brown a vulnerability on the the Ada
Web Server has been discovered.
The implementation of the Random_String() function in the src/core/aws-utils.adb module introduces a
bias in the generated random string values, where the values "1" and "2" have a much higher frequency than any
other character.

Moreover, the Numerics.Discrete_Random module is used for random numbers generation, but the PRNG is
not Cryptographically Secure. At least for the session ID and the session private key generation, a CSPRNG
(Cryptographically Secure Pseudo Random Numbers Generator) should be used.

The internal state of the Meresenne Twister PRNG may be retrieved, and lead to a session hijacking attack.

3. Solution

3.1. Workarounds

There is no workaround.

3.2. Correction

The vulnerability described in this document is corrected in the following product versions:

• Ada Web Server - aws > 25.0
• GNAT Components Collection - Core packages - gnatcoll > 25.0

It also requires
Starting from build date 20240717, the Ada Web Server component is fixed on wavefront.
the update of GNAT Components Collection - Core packages, which contains a new CSPRNG package named
GNATCOLL.Random.

4. Appendix

4.1. CVSS Score Justification

Justification

Met-
ric
AV:N A vulnerability exploitable with Network access means the vulnerable component is bound to the network
stack and the attacker’s path is through OSI layer 3 (the network layer). Such a vulnerability is often
termed ‘remotely exploitable’ and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable one or more network
hops away (e.g. across layer 3 boundaries from routers).

AC:L Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect

repeatable success against the vulnerable component.

PR:N The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files

to carry out an attack.

UI:N The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.
S:U An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same authority. In this case the

vulnerable component and the impacted component are the same.

C:H There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being
divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the
disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact.
I:H There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.
A:N There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.
E:U No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical.
RL:U There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.
RC:C Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).
Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor
of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability.

                            A W S - Ada Web Server
                                24.0 release

Authors:
   Dmitriy Anisimkov
   Pascal Obry

AWS stand for Ada Web Server. It is a small yet powerful HTTP component to
embed in any applications. It means that you can communicate with your
application using a standard Web browser and this without the need for a Web
Server. AWS is fully developed in Ada with GNAT.

AWS support SOAP/WSDL, Server Push, HTTPS/SSL, client HTTP, hotplug
modules...

AWS comes with SOAP/WSDL support, two tools are proposed:

   ada2wsdl   which generates a WSDL document from an Ada spec

   wsdl2aws   which generates stubs/skeletons AWS code from a WSDL document

Both tools have mapping for standard Ada types but also supports Ada
enumerations, character, records and arrays.

The SOAP implementation has been validated on <http://validator.soapware.org/>.
This on-line service is not available anymore but the current implementation
is validated against the Apache/AXIS SOAP implementation to ensure the
interoperability. Some users have also reported to have used AWS/SOAP with
.NET and gSOAP without trouble.

Non upward compatible changes
-----------------------------

Note that the changes listed below can introduce non upward compatibility.
In such a case we try to give proper advice on how to change the code
to work properly. Of course we try to avoid this as much as possible
but we really prefer to have a clean API instead of keeping awkward
implementations.

- The SSL initialization API has been reworked to have support for
  certificate and host verification.

  By default AWS is now checking for certificate and host validity.
  The parameter Certificate_Required has been renamed
  Check_Certificate for clarity on the AWS.Net.SSL.Intialize call.

  Setting Check_Certificate to False makes AWS behave as in previous
  version (but this is not recommanded) for security reasons.

- To support SMTP secure STARTTLS switching protocol the parameter to
  SMTP.Initialize has been changed from Secure to Security and
  instead of a boolean it takes a Secure_Connection enumeration which
  can be No, TLS or STARTTLS.

  If Secure was set to False, Security must be No.

  If Secure was set to True, Security should probably be TLS except if
  the STARTTLS swicthing protocol is to be used.

Obsolescent features
--------------------

In each new version we try to be upward compatible with previous
version. This is really important, but in some cases it seems that a
"redesign" of the API would be good in the long term. All obsolescent
features will be listed in this section. Those features will be
removed in the next version. Note that you can check usage of those
features in your application by using the GNAT's -gnatwj option as we
have tagged all obsolescent features with a pragma.

   Templates_Parser module (sources and documentation) is provided as
   a separate download and must be unpacked into the AWS root's
   directory.

   If AWS is used from GitHub, Templates_Parser will be downloaded
   automatically as a sub-module.

GNU/Ada - GNAT
   <https://www.adacore.com/gnatpro>

   Or the GNAT compiler coming with your GNU/Linux distribution.

XML/Ada (optional):
   <https://github.com/AdaCore/xmlada>

   You need this library only for the AWS SOAP support.

Libadalang/Ada (optional):
   <https://www.adacore.com/libadalang>
   <https://github.com/AdaCore/libadalang>

   You need this library only for the AWS WSDL support.

OpenSSL (optional):

   You need to install manually the development libraries (>= 3.0.x).

LibreSSL (optional):

   You need to install manually the development libraries (>= 2.8.0).
   LibreSSL is an implementation fully compatible with OpenSSL, you
   just have to configure AWS as with OpenSSL.

GNUTLS (optional):

   You need to install manually the development libraries. AWS needs at
   least version 3.6.x of GNUTLS.

OpenLDAP library (optional) :

   Sources for UNIX or Win32:
      <http://www.openldap.org/>

   Win32:
      AWS binding will use to the Microsoft LDAP dynamic library.
