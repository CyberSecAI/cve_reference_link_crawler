These scripts are executed when visitors access the site, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable by injecting malicious scripts into the vulnerable parts of the plugin. The content does not specify which specific part of the plugin is vulnerable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
