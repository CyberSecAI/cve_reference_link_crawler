Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-43410:

**CVE-2022-43410**

* **Vulnerable Plugin:** Mercurial Plugin
* **Root Cause:** The Mercurial plugin's webhook endpoint `/mercurial/notifyCommit` discloses job names to unauthorized users. This endpoint is designed to notify Jenkins of changes to a Mercurial SCM repository, and it triggers polling for all jobs configured with the specified repository. The vulnerability arises because the endpoint's output reveals which jobs were triggered or scheduled for polling, including jobs that the user doesn't have access to.
* **Weakness:** Information disclosure vulnerability. The output of the webhook endpoint provides information about triggered or scheduled jobs, including those that the user has no permission to access.
* **Impact:** Attackers with knowledge of Mercurial repository URLs can obtain information about the existence of Jenkins jobs configured with that repository. This allows unauthorized users to enumerate configured jobs, which can be a stepping stone for more targeted attacks.
* **Attack Vector:**
    *   The `/mercurial/notifyCommit` endpoint can be accessed through GET requests without authentication.
    *   Attackers need to know the Mercurial repository URLs configured within Jenkins to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker does not require authentication to access the vulnerable endpoint.
    *   The attacker needs knowledge of a Mercurial repository URL configured in Jenkins.

**Summary:**

The Mercurial Plugin's webhook endpoint exposes information about job names to unauthorized users, allowing an attacker who knows a Mercurial repository URL to learn which Jenkins jobs are configured to use it. This vulnerability is addressed in Mercurial Plugin version 1260.vdfb_723cdcc81 and later by checking user permissions before revealing job names.
