- Root cause of vulnerability: Stack overflow in the `fromAddressNat` function due to unbounded copy of user-controlled input.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The `mitInterface` parameter from a POST request is directly used in a `sprintf` function, writing to a local stack variable without proper bounds checking.
- Impact of exploitation: Overwriting the function's return address, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Attack vectors: Sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/addressNat` endpoint with a long string in the `mitInterface` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable Tenda AC18 router.
