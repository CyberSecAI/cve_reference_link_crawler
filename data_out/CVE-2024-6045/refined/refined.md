The provided content relates to CVE-2024-6045.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a combination of hidden functionality (CWE-912) and the use of hard-coded credentials (CWE-798). A specific URL triggers the enabling of the telnet service on the affected devices. Attackers then utilize hardcoded credentials to gain access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Hidden functionality: A specific URL can be used to enable the telnet service.
- Hard-coded credentials: The devices contain hardcoded credentials which allow an attacker to login after enabling the telnet service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker on the same network to gain elevated access to the device's management features. This access enables them to potentially configure or manipulate the device, leading to a loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed by sending a request to a specific URL on the device within the same network.
- After the telnet service is enabled, attackers can log in using hard-coded credentials obtained through reverse engineering the firmware.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
- The attacker does not require prior authentication.
- The attacker must know the specific URL to enable the telnet service and have obtained the hardcoded credentials by reverse engineering the firmware.
