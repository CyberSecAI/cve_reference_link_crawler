**Regarding the Security Update for Your D-Link Device**

Installing firmware updates is critical in addressing security vulnerabilities in your D-Link devices. D-Link strongly urges all users to install the relevant updates and regularly check for further updates. After downloading the firmware update, it is essential to ALWAYS validate its success by comparing the firmware version on your product interface to the firmware update version.

Please note that beta software, beta firmware, or a hot-fix release is still undergoing rigorous testing before its official release. This ensures that the software is of the highest quality and meets our stringent standards. However, it is essential to understand that the user assumes all risk and liability for its use. D-Link does not provide express or implied warranties regarding the suitability or usability of the beta software, beta firmware, or hot-fix release. D-Link will not be liable for any direct, indirect, special, or consequential loss suffered by any party due to their use of the beta firmware, beta software, or hit-fix release.

NOTE: Our products have different hardware revisions, so please check your device’s hardware revision before downloading the corresponding firmware update. The hardware revision can be found on the product label next to the serial number or on the device's web interface.

**\*\*In the Event Automatic Forced Update Fails to new firmware**

As this is a critical and required firmware update, if your D-Link Mobile Application does not report the fixed firmware version or newer, you can manually download the patched updates on 06/17/2024 and upload the firmware to the device's web GUI.

The link to firmware updates is <https://support.dlink.com/>; search for your model. If you require help with a manual update, this page also has links for Customer Care Help.
