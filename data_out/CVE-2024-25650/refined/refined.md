- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure key exchange between Delinea PAM Secret Server and Distributed Engine.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the insecure exchange of the Symmetric Key between Delinea PAM Secret Server 11.4 and the Distributed Engine 8.4.3. This key is used to encrypt RabbitMQ messages. A PAM administrator can obtain this key via crafted payloads sent to the `/pre-authenticate`, `/authenticate`, and `/execute-and-respond` REST API endpoints.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can impersonate the Engine and exfiltrate sensitive information from the messages published in the RabbitMQ exchanges without being audited in the application.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted payloads to the `/pre-authenticate`, `/authenticate`, and `/execute-and-respond` REST API endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a PAM administrator to exploit this vulnerability.
