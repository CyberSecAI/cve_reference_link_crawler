Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the `MembershipM-PHP` application, specifically in the `edit-type.php` file. User-supplied input from the `membership_type` field is stored directly into the database without adequate sanitization. This unsanitized data is later displayed on the `view-type.php` page without encoding, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be executed in the user's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw. Malicious JavaScript code is injected through a form, stored persistently in the database, and executed when a victim user views the affected page.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input in the `membership_type` field before storing it in the database.
- **Lack of Output Encoding:** The application fails to properly encode the data retrieved from the database before rendering it on the webpage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal sensitive information, such as session cookies, which can lead to session hijacking.
- **Session Hijacking:** Successful exploitation allows malicious scripts to hijack user sessions, potentially granting attackers unauthorized access to accounts.
- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious or phishing websites.
- **Webpage Defacement:** Attackers can alter the appearance of the web page, potentially misleading users or damaging the application's reputation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:**  An attacker exploits the vulnerability via the web interface of the application, specifically the `edit-type.php` page.
- **Input field:** The attack vector is the `membership_type` input field on the form.
- **Persistence:** The injected script is stored in the database and executed each time an authorized user accesses the `view-type.php` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the application:** The attacker must have access to the web application and the ability to interact with the `edit-type.php` page, which typically would require a user account with the necessary permission to modify membership types.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware that the `membership_type` field is vulnerable to XSS and be capable of crafting a malicious payload.
