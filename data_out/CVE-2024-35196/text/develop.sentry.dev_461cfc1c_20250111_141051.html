# Slack Integration

##

## [Create a Slack App](#create-a-slack-app)

To use Sentry’s Slack integration you’ll need to create a Slack app. Navigate to [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps/) and click **Create New App**.

[![Create](/_next/image/?url=%2Fmdx-images%2Fcreate-465GXV3O.png%23591x491&w=1200&q=75)](/mdx-images/create-465GXV3O.png)

After naming your app and connecting your workspace, navigate to **Basic Information**. Here you’ll find your Client ID, Client Secret, and Verification token that lets your app access the Slack API.

Here’s where you’ll connect your self-hosted Sentry instance to your newly created Slack app.

Copy your Client ID, Client Secret, and Signing Secret and paste them into `~/.sentry/config.yml` or `~/.sentry/sentry.conf.py`.

YAMLCopied
```
slack.client-id: <client id>
slack.client-secret: <client secret>
slack.signing-secret: <signing secret>

```

If you're a Sentry employee, you can set the `slack.client-id` and `slack.client-secret` in `devlocal.py` inside `getsentry` instead.

**NOTE**: If you're doing local Sentry development, you should usse ngrok and install the Slack integration from the ngrok subdomain or it will fail to install. Refer to [Developing with Ngrok](https://develop.sentry.dev/development-infrastructure/ngrok/) for more information.

After you update the `config.yml`, `sentry.conf.py`, or `devlocal.py` you need to restart your Sentry server to continue configuring the Slack app.

##### Note (for self-hosted users)

After changing configuration files, re-run the `./install.sh` script, to rebuild and restart the containers. See the [configuration section](/self-hosted/#configuration) for more information.

Now that you’ve created your app and updated your Sentry config, you can navigate to **Interactivity & Shortcuts** under **Features**.

Toggle on **Interactivity**.

Now you’ll be able to enter your **Request URL** (this is the location of your self-hosted Sentry) and **Options Load URL**:

BashCopied
```
Request URL: {YOUR_DOMAIN}/extensions/slack/action/
Options Load URL: {YOUR_DOMAIN}/extensions/slack/options-load/

```

Navigate to **OAuth & Permissions** to configure the Redirect URLs.

[![OAuth](/_next/image/?url=%2Fmdx-images%2Foauth-2MDZGAUO.png%23502x499&w=1080&q=75)](/mdx-images/oauth-2MDZGAUO.png)

Click **Add a new Redirect URL**, enter the URL, and click **Add**. Set the URL to:

BashCopied
```
{YOUR_DOMAIN}/extensions/slack/setup/

```

Click **Save URLs**.

On the same page under **Scopes** you'll need to add **Bot Scopes** and **User Scopes**.

Add the following scopes to **Bot Scopes**:

* `channels:read`
* `chat:write`
* `chat:write.customize`
* `chat:write.public`
* `commands`
* `groups:read`
* `im:history`
* `im:read`
* `links:read`
* `links:write`
* `team:read`
* `users:read`

Add the following scopes to **User Scopes**:

* `links:read`
* `users:read`
* `users:read.email`

You have the option to set 'Restrict API Token Usage' on this page if you want to limit use of your app’s OAuth tokens to a list of IP addresses and ranges you provide.

Navigate to **Event Subscriptions** and toggle “On”. Here you will enter another Request URL: `{YOUR_DOMAIN}/extensions/slack/event/`

You’ll see “Verified” when you’ve entered the correct URL.

[![Events](/_next/image/?url=%2Fmdx-images%2Fevents-HMOXLAHS.png%23735x265&w=1920&q=75)](/mdx-images/events-HMOXLAHS.png)

When you enter the 'Request URL', Slack tries to verify it. The request will fail if you didn’t configure the client keys/secret and restart Sentry to ensure those config changes were picked up. If it fails to validate, first make sure your Sentry instance is running and Slack can talk to it (Slack [doesn’t have an IP range](https://twitter.com/slackapi/status/567110311476350976?lang=en)).

Still on the **Event Subscription** page, go to **Subscribe to bot events** and add the following bot user events:

* `link_shared`
* `message.im`

and next go to **Subscribe to events on behalf of users** and add the following event:

* `link_shared`

Lastly, still on that page, go to **App Unfurl Domains**, click **Add Domain** to enter your domain and click Done.

At the bottom of the page, click **Save Changes**.

Navigate to **App Home**, under **Features**. Here is where you can edit your bot's display name (this is the name that will be displayed when alerts are triggered).

[![Bot](/_next/image/?url=%2Fmdx-images%2Fbot-KL2J5DMS.png%23562x434&w=1200&q=75)](/mdx-images/bot-KL2J5DMS.png)

If you plan on having Slack alerts sent to specific users (`@person`) in addition to channels, toggle on the **Messages Tab** under **Show Tabs** in the **App Home** page.

Navigate to **Slash Commands** under **Features**. Click **Create New Command** and enter the following values:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Command | `/{yourname}-sentry` |
| Request URL | `{YOUR_DOMAIN}/extensions/slack/commands/` |

##### Note

When creating the slash command, don’t use `/sentry`. Do something like `/{your_name}-sentry`. If multiple apps are installed with the same slash command, the most recently installed one takes over.

At the bottom of the page, click **Save**.

Now you can use Slack with Sentry! See our [documentation on installing and configuring the Slack integration for your projects](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/notification-incidents/slack/) to take advantage of multi-channel Alert routing.
