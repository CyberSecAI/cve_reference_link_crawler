# Detection: Splunk Disable KVStore via CSRF Enabling Maintenance Mode

Updated Date: 2024-10-16
ID: 34bac267-a89b-4bd7-a072-a48eef1f15b8
Author: Rod Soto
[Type: TTP](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.3.1, 9.2.3, and 9.1.6 and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.2.2403.108, 9.1.2312.204, and 9.1.2308.211, a low-privileged user that does not hold the âadminâ or âpowerâ Splunk roles could change the maintenance mode state of App Key Value Store (KVStore) through a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

### Search

```
1`splunkda` method=GET uri_path IN ("/services*", /"servicesNS*") AND uri_path = "*kvstore/maintenance/change" AND uri_query IN ("*mode=t*", "*mode=1*")
2| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by user host uri clientip
3| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
4| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
5| `splunk_disable_kvstore_via_csrf_enabling_maintenance_mode_filter`

```
### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [security\_content\_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml) | `convert timeformat="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" ctime($field$)` |
| splunk\_disable\_kvstore\_via\_csrf\_enabling\_maintenance\_mode\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_disable_kvstore_via_csrf_enabling_maintenance_mode_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Notable | Yes |
| Rule Title | `%name%` |
| Rule Description | `%description%` |
| Notable Event Fields | user, dest |
| Creates Risk Event | True |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type TTP. These detections will use Risk Based Alerting and generate Notable Events.
### Implementation

Requires access to internal indexes and web service enabled.

### Known False Positives

This search will produce false positives, operator must verify the context of access and the use of GET request against KVStore specifiying maintenance mode, especially non admin users.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Potential CSRF attack against $user$ and $host$ by placing KVStore into Maintenance Mode. | 25 | 50 | 50 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
