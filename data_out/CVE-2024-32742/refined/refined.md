- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The device has an unrestricted USB port that can be used to boot an alternative operating system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing immutable root of trust in hardware (CWE-1326). The device allows booting from a USB drive without restriction.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can boot a malicious OS, gaining complete read/write access to the filesystem, allowing for full compromise of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to the device is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have physical access to the device and the ability to boot from a USB drive.
