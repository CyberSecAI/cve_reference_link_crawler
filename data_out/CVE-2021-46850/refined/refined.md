Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerabilities related to CVE-2021-46850:

**1. CVE-2021-28379 - CSRF Remote Code Execution in `UploadHandler.php` (Mentioned in myvesta commit)**

*   **Root Cause:** This vulnerability is present in `UploadHandler.php`.
*   **Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) leading to potential Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially achieve remote code execution on the affected system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting a CSRF vulnerability, requiring the victim to perform an action (like clicking a malicious link) or browsing a malicious site while authenticated to the vulnerable system.
*  **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs a way to trick the victim into sending the malicious request.

**2. Local Privilege Escalations in Vesta Control Panel (Multiple)**

These are mentioned in the `myvesta` commit log.

*   **Root Cause:** Vulnerabilities in multiple scripts and commands within the VestaCP.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Local privilege escalation from user to admin via `v-add-web-domain`.
    *   Local privilege escalation in `v-generate-ssl-cert` (potential user to admin or root).
    *  Local privilege escalation in `/web/api/` via `v-make-tmp-file` (potentially admin to root).
   *   Admin to root escalation in `v-activate-vesta-license`.

*   **Impact:** An attacker with a low-privileged user account on a VestaCP system can escalate their privileges to admin or even root.
*  **Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in the mentioned scripts/commands.
*   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs a low-privilege shell access to the VestaCP system.

**3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `/web/add/ip/`**

*   **Root Cause:** Vulnerability in the `/web/add/ip/` component of VestaCP.
*   **Vulnerability:** XSS vulnerability allows admin users to escalate to other admins.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the admin interface, potentially gaining access to other admin accounts.
*   **Attack Vector:** By injecting the malicious script via the vulnerable parameter in the `/web/add/ip/` page
*   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs admin access to inject the script.

**4. Command Injection in `v-activate-vesta-license` (Exploit-DB 49674 and Github commit)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `v_sftp_licence` parameter in `/edit/server/` allows command injection.
*   **Vulnerability:** The `v_sftp_licence` parameter in the VestaCP admin interface is vulnerable to command injection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to the `/edit/server/` page with malicious commands in the `v_sftp_licence` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a VestaCP admin.
*   **Additional Info:** This vulnerability is detailed on Exploit-DB (ID: 49674). The provided exploit code shows an example of injecting a command that attempts to overwrite `/etc/shadow`.

**5. Necro Python Bot exploits VestaCP (blog.talosintelligence.com)**

*   **Root Cause:** The Necro bot includes exploits for various web applications, including VestaCP. Specifically it utilizes "VestaCP 0.9.8 - 'v_sftp_licence' Command Injection".
*   **Vulnerability:** The Necro Bot actively exploits the command injection vulnerability in `v_sftp_licence` in VestaCP 0.9.8
*   **Impact:** A successful exploit allows remote code execution, and the bot can then perform actions like installing crypto-miners, conducting DDoS attacks, or stealing data.
*   **Attack Vector:** The bot scans for vulnerable systems and uses exploits, including the command injection in VestaCP.
*   **Attacker Capability:** The Necro bot is capable of automatic remote exploitation, using a list of vulnerabilities.
* **Additional Info:** This bot also exploits other vulnerabilities like VMWare vSphere, SCO OpenServer, etc. The Necro bot uses a polymorphic engine to evade detection, and a user-mode rootkit to hide its presence. The bot also installs a Monero miner and a javascript miner by injecting malicious code into web files (.html, .js, .php)

**Relevance to CVE-2021-46850**

The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in VestaCP and how they are exploited. There is no direct information that links the vulnerabilities discussed to the CVE number given, or a description about CVE-2021-46850. Therefore the connection between the content and the CVE is unknown.

**Summary**

Based on the available content, the VestaCP software suffers from multiple vulnerabilities, including CSRF, local privilege escalations, XSS, and command injection. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by both local and remote attackers to gain elevated access, execute arbitrary commands, and compromise the system. The Necro bot leverages at least one of these vulnerabilities (command injection) to spread and achieve its goals.
