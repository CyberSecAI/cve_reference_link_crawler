Here is the extracted information for CVE-2024-28584 based on the provided content:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Vulnerability Type:** Buffer overflow
*   **Impact:** Command execution
*   **Affected Component:** `PluginTARGA.cpp, _assignPixel<>()`
*   **Description:** When reading images in TARGA format, the `_assignPixel<>()` function has a heap overflow read and write vulnerability, which may lead to command execution.
*   **Root Cause:** Heap overflow in the `_assignPixel<>()` function while processing TARGA images
*   **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs when reading maliciously crafted TARGA image files, triggering the vulnerable function.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a crafted TARGA image file that, when processed by FreeImage, triggers the vulnerability
*   **Traces:**
    *   `case10024: [WRITE,heap-buffer-overflow]@main->FreeImage_Load->FreeImage_LoadFromHandle->Load->void loadRLE<8>->void _assignPixel<8>`
    *   `case10412: [WRITE,heap-buffer-overflow]@main->FreeImage_Load->FreeImage_LoadFromHandle->Load->void loadRLE<24>->void _assignPixel<24>`
    *   `case10470: [WRITE,heap-buffer-overflow]@main->FreeImage_Load->FreeImage_LoadFromHandle->Load->void loadRLE<16>->void _assignPixel<16>`
    *   `case10421: [READ,heap-buffer-overflow]@main->FreeImage_Load->FreeImage_LoadFromHandle->Load->void loadRLE<32>->void _assignPixel<32>`
    *   `case10955: [READ,heap-buffer-overflow]@main->FreeImage_Load->FreeImage_LoadFromHandle->Load->void loadRLE<24>->void _assignPixel<24>`
    *   `case10800: [READ,heap-buffer-overflow]@main->FreeImage_Load->FreeImage_LoadFromHandle->Load->void loadRLE<16>->void _assignPixel<16>`
