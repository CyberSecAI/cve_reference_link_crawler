Package        : symfony
Version        : 3.4.22+dfsg-2+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-21424 CVE-2022-24894 CVE-2022-24895

Multiple security vulnerabilities were found in symfony, a PHP framework
for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components,
which could lead to information disclosure or impersonation.

CVE-2021-21424

    James Isaac, Mathias Brodala and Laurent Minguet discovered that it
    was possible to enumerate users without relevant permissions due to
    different exception messages depending on whether the user existed
    or not.  It was also possible to enumerate users by using a timing
    attack, by comparing time elapsed when authenticating an existing
    user and authenticating a non-existing user.

    403s are now returned whether the user exists or not if a user
    cannot switch to a user or if the user does not exist.

CVE-2022-24894

    Soner Sayakci discovered that when the Symfony HTTP cache system is
    enabled, the response header might be stored with a `Set-Cookie`
    header and returned to some other clients, thereby allowing an
    attacker to retrieve the victim's session.

    The `HttpStore` constructor now takes a parameter containing a list
    of private headers that are removed from the HTTP response headers.
    The default value for this parameter is `Set-Cookie`, but it can be
    overridden or extended by the application.

CVE-2022-24895

    Marco Squarcina discovered that CSRF tokens aren't cleared upon
    login, which could enable same-site attackers to bypass the CSRF
    protection mechanism by performing an attack similar to a
    session-fixation.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
3.4.22+dfsg-2+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your symfony packages.
