# [Description]

clash for windows is a popular around the world with a huge number of downloads of the proxy software, when we connect to the public network of other users of the proxy, the need for accounts and passwords, but due to the defects of the clash for windows, will not change the udp port, so we can use some of the software to bypass the restrictions on accounts and passwords, and directly use the proxy of the other people!

# [Vulnerability details]

[![](https://github.com/GTA12138/vul/raw/main/1.png)](https://github.com/GTA12138/vul/blob/main/1.png)

When we use the default browser to find us ip, if we want to use the proxy, we will find that you need an account and password, but when we configure the config file and start mihomo, our traffic will be forwarded to the target machine, and then this time to open the browser's proxy, found that we are using the target traffic, this is because clash for This is because clash for windows does not randomly assign udp ports, so when our traffic is forwarded, the socks traffic can always use the forwarded traffic.
We can utilize other people's vpn traffic without any authentication!

Because the default open port of the clash for windows software is 7890, and then we can use port detection software to prove the use of port 7890, proving that you are also using the clash for windows software.

the start of my ip

then,if we want to direct to add proxy with this ip and port ,it will be refused
