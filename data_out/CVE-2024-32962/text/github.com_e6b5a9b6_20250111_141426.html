# XML signature verification bypass due improper verification of signature / signature spoofing

Critical

[cjbarth](/cjbarth)
published
GHSA-2xp3-57p7-qf4v
May 1, 2024

## Package

npm

xml-crypto
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>=4.0.0, <6.0.0

## Patched versions

6.0.0

## Description

### Summary

Default configuration does not check authorization of the signer, it only checks the validity of the signature per section 3.2.2 of <https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xmldsig-core-20080610/#sec-CoreValidation>. As such, without additional validation steps, the default configuration allows a malicious actor to re-sign an XML document, place the certificate in a `<KeyInfo />` element, and pass `xml-crypto` default validation checks.

### Details

Affected `xml-crypto` versions between versions `>= 4.0.0` and `< 6.0.0`.

`xml-crypto` trusts by default any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document's `<KeyInfo />`.

`xml-crypto` prefers to use any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document's `<KeyInfo />` even if library was configured to use specific certificate (`publicCert`) for signature verification purposes.

Attacker can spoof signature verification by modifying XML document and replacing existing signature with signature generated with malicious private key (created by attacker) and by attaching that private key's certificate to `<KeyInfo />` element.

Vulnerability is combination of changes introduced to `4.0.0` at

* [#301](https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/pull/301)
* [c2b83f9](https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/commit/c2b83f984049edb68ad1d7c6ad0739ec92af11ca)

Changes at PR provided default method to extract certificate from signed XML document.

* [xml-crypto/lib/signed-xml.js](https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/blob/c2b83f984049edb68ad1d7c6ad0739ec92af11ca/lib/signed-xml.js#L405-L414)

and changes at PR prefer output of that method to be used as certificate for signature verification even in the case when library is configured to use specific/pre-configured `signingCert`

  |  | this.getCertFromKeyInfo(this.keyInfo) || this.signingCert || this.signingKey, |

Name of the `signingCert` was changed later (but prior to `4.0.0` release) to `publicCert`:

* [78329fb](https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/commit/78329fbae34c9b25ba25882604e960f506d7c0e7)

  |  | this.getCertFromKeyInfo(this.keyInfo) || this.publicCert || this.privateKey, |
  | --- | --- |

Issue was fixed to `6.0.0` by disabling implicit usage of default `getCertFromKeyInfo` implementation:

* [#445](https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/pull/445)
* [2120172](https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/commit/21201723d2ca9bc11288f62cf72552b7d659b000)

Possible workarounds for versions 4.x and 5.x:

* Check the certificate extracted via `getCertFromKeyInfo` against trusted certificates before accepting the results of the validation.
* Set `xml-crypto`'s `getCertFromKeyInfo` to `() => undefined` forcing `xml-crypto` to use an explicitly configured `publicCert` or `privateKey` for signature verification.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
