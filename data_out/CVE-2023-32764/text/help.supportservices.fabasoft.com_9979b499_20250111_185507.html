First published: 18 July 2023 (restricted disclosure)

Last update: 29 August 2023 (gs)

ID: CVE-2023-36664

Affected Components:

* Fabasoft Folio and eGov-Suite installations that use Artifex Ghostscript as a conversion tool

Severity: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H Base Score: 7.8

Status: Open

CVEs: CVE-2023-36664

### Summary[Permanent link for this heading](doc/Vulnerabilities-Fabasoft-Folio/vulnerabilities-2023.htm#summary5)

A security vulnerability has been identified and classified as CVE-2023-36664 that allows the exploitation of Artifex Ghostscript with a specifically crafted PDF document.

### Impact[Permanent link for this heading](doc/Vulnerabilities-Fabasoft-Folio/vulnerabilities-2023.htm#impact5)

On installations of Fabasoft Folio/eGov-Suite that use Artifex Ghostscript as a conversion tool, it is possible that an attacker could exploit this vulnerability in Ghostscript, it is therefore recommended to perform steps to mitigate this scenario.

### Remediation[Permanent link for this heading](doc/Vulnerabilities-Fabasoft-Folio/vulnerabilities-2023.htm#remediation5)

Based on internal testing, installations of Fabasoft Folio/eGov-Suite 2022 Update Rollup 1 (22.0.1) and newer can successfully perform conversion operations using a version of Artifex Ghostscript that includes a fix for CVE-2023-36664.

Older versions of Fabasoft Folio/eGov-Suite using newer versions of Artifex Ghostscript abort conversion operations with an error.

If an affected system does not support a version of Ghostscript that includes a fix for CVE-2023-36664, it is possible to remove or disable Artifex Ghostscript on the conversion servers, but this operation will also affect or disable some features including the following:

* Import of files with the Fabasoft Folio Printer Ports.
* Redaction of documents in Fabasoft eGov-Suite. (Schwärzung)
* Indirect PDF conversion of documents via printing to Postscript.

### Hotfix information[Permanent link for this heading](doc/Vulnerabilities-Fabasoft-Folio/vulnerabilities-2023.htm#hotfix-information5)

### Summary[Permanent link for this heading](doc/Vulnerabilities-Fabasoft-Folio/vulnerabilities-2023.htm#summary6)

In a Fabasoft eGov-Suite import feature, a normal user is able to configure any import path without restrictions, leading to a possible security issue when restricted operating system files get imported.

Only Fabasoft eGov-Suite systems are affected as this import feature is only available in Fabasoft eGov-Suite.

Fabasoft Folio is not affected by the vulnerability.

### Impact[Permanent link for this heading](doc/Vulnerabilities-Fabasoft-Folio/vulnerabilities-2023.htm#impact6)

After the import, the user will have full access to the imported files. That files usually would be restricted in the original file system folder of the web server.

Due to this import the imported files may be deleted at the original location. This could lead to configuration failures or data loss on the affected webserver.

### Remediation[Permanent link for this heading](doc/Vulnerabilities-Fabasoft-Folio/vulnerabilities-2023.htm#remediation6)

The vulnerability can be remediated by installing a hotfix provided by Fabasoft.

If the Fabasoft Cloud Client is already installed, the update to the hotfixed version is triggered automatically.

#### Hotfix information Fabasoft Folio / Fabasoft eGov-Suite [Permanent link for this heading](doc/Vulnerabilities-Fabasoft-Folio/vulnerabilities-2023.htm#hotfix-information-fabasoft-folio--fabasoft-egov-suite-)

Fabasoft provides the hotfixed Fabasoft Folio Client for the affected versions in the following teamroom:

<https://at.cloud.fabasoft.com/folio/public/3rz6bra2xcba40s6gt5fishghl>

Only the Fabasoft Folio Client on Windows PCs needs to be updated. There is no need to update the Fabasoft Folio / eGov-Suite domain.

The following Fabasoft Folio Client build numbers include the correction:

* 23.4.0.66 and above
* 23.0.1.23 and above
* 22.9.0.75 and above
