Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `index` parameter of the `/view/teacher_salary_details.php` file within the Complete Web-Based School Management System.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input (`index` parameter) before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Leakage:** Successful exploitation could lead to the leakage of sensitive information including user data and system data.
*   **System Compromise:** The vulnerability may also compromise the security of the overall system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through HTTP requests to `/view/teacher_salary_details.php` by manipulating the `index` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific authentication or access level is mentioned in this description, suggesting the vulnerability might be exploitable by any user able to reach the application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the Complete Web-Based School Management System version 1.0 or earlier.
*   The source code for the vulnerable system can be downloaded from `https://www.campcodes.com/projects/php/web-based-school-management-system/`
