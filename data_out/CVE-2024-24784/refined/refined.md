```
{
  "Root cause": "The ParseAddressList function in the net/mail package incorrectly handles comments (text within parentheses) within display names.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Improper handling of comments within display names in email addresses.",
     "Divergence from RFC 5322 standards in parsing email addresses.",
     "Allowing special characters (parentheses) in the 'atom' syntax where they are disallowed by the RFC specification."
  ],
  "Impact": "The vulnerability can lead to different trust decisions by programs using different parsers due to the misalignment with conforming address parsers. This could result in address spoofing where a malicious email address can be parsed in a way that alters the intended display name.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted email address with malicious comments in the display name could be used to exploit the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft an email address string with a display name containing parentheses to trigger the vulnerability during parsing."
