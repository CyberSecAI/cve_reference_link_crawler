# Vulnerability Report: GO-2024-2609

standard library

* CVE-2024-24784
* Affects:
  net/mail
* Published: Mar 05, 2024
* Modified: May 20, 2024

The ParseAddressList function incorrectly handles comments (text within parentheses) within display names. Since this is a misalignment with conforming address parsers, it can result in different trust decisions being made by programs using different parsers.

## Affected Packages

* Path

Subject: 5 CVEs fixed in Go 1.22.1 and Go 1.21.8, 1 CVE fixed in
 google.golang.org/protobuf

<https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/5pwGVUPoMbg> announces the
releases of Go 1.22.1 and Go 1.21.8 containing fixes for 5 CVEs:

 >- crypto/x509: Verify panics on certificates with an unknown public key
 >  algorithm
 >
 >  Verifying a certificate chain which contains a certificate with an
 >  unknown public key algorithm will cause Certificate.Verify to panic.
 >
 >  This affects all crypto/tls clients, and servers that set Config.ClientAuth
 >  to VerifyClientCertIfGiven or RequireAndVerifyClientCert. The default
 >  behavior is for TLS servers to not verify client certificates.
 >
 >  Thanks to John Howard (Google) for reporting this issue.
 >
 >  This is CVE-2024-24783 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65390>.
 >
 >- net/http: memory exhaustion in Request.ParseMultipartForm
 >
 >  When parsing a multipart form (either explicitly with
 >  Request.ParseMultipartForm or implicitly with Request.FormValue,
 >  Request.PostFormValue, or Request.FormFile), limits on the total size of
 >  the parsed form were not applied to the memory consumed while reading a
 >  single form line. This permitted a maliciously crafted input containing
 >  very long lines to cause allocation of arbitrarily large amounts of memory,
 >  potentially leading to memory exhaustion.
 >
 >  ParseMultipartForm now correctly limits the maximum size of form lines.
 >
 >  Thanks to Bartek Nowotarski for reporting this issue.
 >
 >  This is CVE-2023-45290 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65383>.
 >
 >- net/http, net/http/cookiejar: incorrect forwarding of sensitive headers
 >  and cookies on HTTP redirect
 >
 >  When following an HTTP redirect to a domain which is not a subdomain match
 >  or exact match of the initial domain, an http.Client does not forward
 >  sensitive headers such as "Authorization" or "Cookie". For example, a
 >  redirect from foo.com to www.foo.com will forward the Authorization header,
 >  but a redirect to bar.com will not.
 >
 >  A maliciously crafted HTTP redirect could cause sensitive headers to be
 >  unexpectedly forwarded.
 >
 >  Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost for reporting this issue.
 >
 >  This is CVE-2023-45289 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65065>.
 >
 >- html/template: errors returned from MarshalJSON methods may break template
 >  escaping
 >
 >  If errors returned from MarshalJSON methods contain user controlled data,
 >  they may be used to break the contextual auto-escaping behavior of the
 >  html/template package, allowing for subsequent actions to inject unexpected
 >  content into templates.
 >
 >  Thanks to RyotaK (<https://ryotak.net>) for reporting this issue.
 >
 >  This is CVE-2024-24785 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65697>.
 >
 >- net/mail: comments in display names are incorrectly handled
 >
 >  The ParseAddressList function incorrectly handles comments (text within
 >  parentheses) within display names. Since this is a misalignment with
 >  conforming address parsers, it can result in different trust decisions
 >  being made by programs using different parsers.
 >
 >  Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost and Slonser
 >  (<https://github.com/Slonser>) for reporting this issue.
 >
 >  This is CVE-2024-24784 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65083>.

Separately, one more CVE fix was reported in
<https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/ArQ6CDgtEjY/m/oLMrdq_GBQAJ> :

 > Version v1.33.0  of the google.golang.org/protobuf module fixes a bug in
 > the google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson package which could cause
 > the Unmarshal function to enter an infinite loop when handling some invalid
 > inputs. This condition could only occur when unmarshaling into a message

Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.22.1 and 1.21.8, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 5 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* crypto/x509: Verify panics on certificates with an unknown public key algorithm

  Verifying a certificate chain which contains a certificate with an unknown public

  key algorithm will cause Certificate.Verify to panic.

  This affects all crypto/tls clients, and servers that set Config.ClientAuth to

  VerifyClientCertIfGiven or RequireAndVerifyClientCert. The default behavior is

  for TLS servers to not verify client certificates.

  Thanks to John Howard (Google) for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2024-24783 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65390>.
* net/http: memory exhaustion in Request.ParseMultipartForm

  When parsing a multipart form (either explicitly with Request.ParseMultipartForm or implicitly with Request.FormValue, Request.PostFormValue, or Request.FormFile), limits on the total size of the parsed form were not applied to the memory consumed while reading a single form line. This permitted a maliciously crafted input containing very long lines to cause allocation of arbitrarily large amounts of memory, potentially leading to memory exhaustion.

  ParseMultipartForm now correctly limits the maximum size of form lines.

  Thanks to Bartek Nowotarski for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2023-45290 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65383>.
* net/http, net/http/cookiejar: incorrect forwarding of sensitive headers and cookies on HTTP redirect

  When following an HTTP redirect to a domain which is not a subdomain match or exact match of the initial domain, an http.Client does not forward sensitive headers such as "Authorization" or "Cookie". For example, a redirect from [foo.com](http://foo.com) to [www.foo.com](http://www.foo.com) will forward the Authorization header, but a redirect to [bar.com](http://bar.com) will not.

  A maliciously crafted HTTP redirect could cause sensitive headers to be unexpectedly forwarded.

  Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2023-45289 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65065>.
* html/template: errors returned from MarshalJSON methods may break template escaping

  If errors returned from MarshalJSON methods contain user controlled data, they

  may be used to break the contextual auto-escaping behavior of the html/template

  package, allowing for subsequent actions to inject unexpected content into

  templates.

  Thanks to RyotaK (<https://ryotak.net>) for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2024-24785 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65697>.
* net/mail: comments in display names are incorrectly handled

  The ParseAddressList function incorrectly handles comments (text within parentheses) within display names. Since this is a misalignment with conforming address parsers, it can result in different trust decisions being made by programs using different parsers.

  Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost and Slonser (<https://github.com/Slonser>) for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2024-24784 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65083>.

View the release notes for more information:

<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.22.1>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go website:

<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.22.1` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Michael and Carlos for the Go team

| In [#21018](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/21018), it was noted that parentheses in display names were rejected, which resulted in a confusing error.  The solution was to introduce a behavior which diverged relatively significantly from RFC 5322 in [CL50911](https://go.dev/cl/50911), allowing special reserved characters to appear in the "atom" syntax, where they are disallowed by the specification.  One of the consequences of this change was that we introduced non-compliant handling of comments (text within parentheses) within display names. Parsing `Hello (comment) there <hello@example.com>` should result in a display name of `Hello there`, but because we (a) allow special characters (in this case parentheses) in the "atom" syntax and (b) don't properly handle comments in display names, we parse a name of `Hello (comment) there` which is clearly non-conformant.  I believe we should revert [CL50911](https://go.dev/cl/50911), rather than just removing parentheses from the allowed set of specials, since it's unclear why this was done to begin with, and there is no evidence this is useful or needed.  We should additionally support the obs-phrase syntax in dispaly names, which permit comments, and properly handle them.  Becuase this introduces a parser misalignment, which could plausibly result in different trust decisions being made by programs using different parsers, we're considering this a PUBLIC track security issue (per the [Go Security Policy](https://go.dev/security/policy)).  Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost for reporting this issue, and [@Slonser](https://github.com/Slonser) for also independently reporting this issue. |

This change reverts the changes made in CL50911, which allowed certain
special RFC 5322 characters to appear unquoted in the \"phrase\" syntax.
It is unclear why this change was made in the first place, and created
a divergence from comformant parsers. In particular this resulted in
treating comments in display names incorrectly.

Additionally properly handle trailing malformed comments in the group
syntax.

For #65083
Fixed #65849
