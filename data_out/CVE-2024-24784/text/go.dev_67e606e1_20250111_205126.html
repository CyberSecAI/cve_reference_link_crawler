| In [#21018](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/21018), it was noted that parentheses in display names were rejected, which resulted in a confusing error.  The solution was to introduce a behavior which diverged relatively significantly from RFC 5322 in [CL50911](https://go.dev/cl/50911), allowing special reserved characters to appear in the "atom" syntax, where they are disallowed by the specification.  One of the consequences of this change was that we introduced non-compliant handling of comments (text within parentheses) within display names. Parsing `Hello (comment) there <hello@example.com>` should result in a display name of `Hello there`, but because we (a) allow special characters (in this case parentheses) in the "atom" syntax and (b) don't properly handle comments in display names, we parse a name of `Hello (comment) there` which is clearly non-conformant.  I believe we should revert [CL50911](https://go.dev/cl/50911), rather than just removing parentheses from the allowed set of specials, since it's unclear why this was done to begin with, and there is no evidence this is useful or needed.  We should additionally support the obs-phrase syntax in dispaly names, which permit comments, and properly handle them.  Becuase this introduces a parser misalignment, which could plausibly result in different trust decisions being made by programs using different parsers, we're considering this a PUBLIC track security issue (per the [Go Security Policy](https://go.dev/security/policy)).  Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost for reporting this issue, and [@Slonser](https://github.com/Slonser) for also independently reporting this issue. |

Fixes a couple of misalignments with RFC 5322 which introduce

`[[release-branch.go1.22] net/mail: properly handle special characters …](/tailscale/go/commit/5c01bab61dff0740f8900751a7c11b9e60be3cf4 "[release-branch.go1.22] net/mail: properly handle special characters in phrase and obs-phrase

Fixes a couple of misalignments with RFC 5322 which introduce
significant diffs between (mostly) conformant parsers.

This change reverts the changes made in CL50911, which allowed certain
special RFC 5322 characters to appear unquoted in the \"phrase\" syntax.
It is unclear why this change was made in the first place, and created
a divergence from comformant parsers. In particular this resulted in
treating comments in display names incorrectly.

Additionally properly handle trailing malformed comments in the group
syntax.

For #65083
Fixed #65849
