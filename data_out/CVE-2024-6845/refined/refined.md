- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin has a REST endpoint that lacks proper authorization, allowing unauthenticated users to access it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect authorization leading to an unauthenticated API key disclosure. The OpenAI API key is encoded using ROT13, but this encoding is insufficient to protect the key if it can be retrieved through an unauthenticated endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to retrieve the OpenAI API key used by the plugin. This could allow attackers to use the victim's OpenAI account and possibly incur charges or cause harm.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a POST request to the `/wp-json/wdgpt/v1/api-key` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is required; an attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
