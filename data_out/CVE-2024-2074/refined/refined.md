The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in a Mini-Tmall e-commerce platform.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application directly uses user-controlled input (`orderBy` parameter) in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `orderBy` parameter in the URL is vulnerable to SQL injection. This parameter is directly used in the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Database Exposure:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to extract sensitive database information. The content mentions that the attacker was able to "explode" the database name.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify data or execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.
- **Authentication Bypass:** Depending on the database structure and permissions, it may be possible to bypass authentication mechanisms.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable URL:  `r=tmall/admin/user/1/1?orderBy=X`, where X is the malicious SQL payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of SQL to craft a malicious query.
- No specific authentication is mentioned, suggesting the vulnerable functionality may be accessible to unauthenticated users.
