{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of enforcement of certain checks during repository imports via the `git://` protocol that are in place for normal push operations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `git://` import mechanism bypasses checks that prevent the creation of branch names resembling commit hashes (40 hex characters) or the inclusion of files like `.git/config` within the repository.",
      "The system does not perform a `git fsck` during `git://` imports, which would normally catch issues like the presence of `.git` directories within the imported repository.",
       "The `prohibited_branch_checks` located in `lib/gitlab/checks/branch_check.rb` are not applied during `git://` imports."
    ],
    "impact": "By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can create repositories with unusual structures, such as branches with names that look like commit hashes, or by including sensitive git data that would normally be prohibited. This could potentially disrupt the normal operation of the system or lead to other vulnerabilities.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the `git://` protocol import mechanism. An attacker can import a specially crafted repository containing prohibited content.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to initiate a repository import via the `git://` protocol. No other special capabilities or position is mentioned."
