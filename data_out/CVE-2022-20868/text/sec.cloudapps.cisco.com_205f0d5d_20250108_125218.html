For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esasmawsa-vulns-YRuSW5mD>  **Attention**: Simplifying the Cisco portfolio includes the renaming of security products under one brand: Cisco Secure. For more information, see [Meet Cisco Secure](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/secure-names.html).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products CVE-2022-20868 affects Cisco ESA and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager.  CVE-2022-20867 affects Cisco ESA, Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager, and Cisco Secure Web Appliance.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2022-20867: Cisco ESA and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager Next Generation Management SQL Injection Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the next-generation UI management interface of Cisco ESA and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks as *root* on an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have the credentials of a high-privileged user account.  This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-submitted parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application and sending malicious requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain data or modify data that is stored in the underlying database of the affected system.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwc12185](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/%20CSCwc12185) and [CSCwc12186](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc12186)CVE ID: CVE-2022-20867Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 4.7CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L  **CVE-2022-20868: Cisco ESA, Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager, and Cisco Secure Web Appliance Next Generation Management Privilege Escalation Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the next-generation UI management interface of Cisco ESA, Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager, and Cisco Secure Web Appliance could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges on an affected system.  This vulnerability is due to the use of a hard-coded value to encrypt a token that is used for certain API calls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and sending a crafted HTTP request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to impersonate another valid user and execute commands with the privileges of that user account.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwc12181](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc12181), [CSCwc12183](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc12183) and [CSCwc12184](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc12184)CVE ID: CVE-2022-20868Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 5.4CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

The right column indicates whether a release is affected by one of the vulnerabilities that is described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for that vulnerability. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate [fixed software release](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes) as indicated in this section.  **ESA: [CSCwc12181](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc12181) and [CSCwc12185](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc12185)**       | Cisco AsyncOS Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 12.5.0 and earlier | Not vulnerable. |   | 13.0 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 13.5 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 14.0 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 14.2 | 14.2.1-015 |   | 14.3 | 14.3.0-0201 |      1.
