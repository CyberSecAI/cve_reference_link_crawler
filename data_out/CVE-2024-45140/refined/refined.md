- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software writes data outside the intended memory buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access and user interaction is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to trigger a specific operation that results in writing data outside of the buffer's boundaries, requiring user interaction.
