{
  "CVE-2024-45851": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the use of an unprotected `eval` function within the `create_an_item` function in the `mindsdb/integrations/handlers/sharepoint_handler/sharepoint_api.py` file.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary Python code on the machine the MindsDB instance is running on.",
    "Attack vector": "The attacker must be authenticated to a MindsDB instance with the SharePoint integration installed. The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a malicious value for the `fields` column in an 'INSERT' statement for the `listItems` table, which is then passed to the vulnerable `eval` function.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to a MindsDB instance that has the SharePoint integration installed."
  }
