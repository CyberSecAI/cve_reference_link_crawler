- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CLUEVO LMS, E-Learning Platform plugin for WordPress versions <= 1.10.0 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability allowing attackers to execute unwanted actions by forcing higher privileged users to do so.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions under their current authentication, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or actions within the plugin.
- **Attack vectors**: This is a CSRF vulnerability which means that an attacker can use social engineering or malicious websites to trigger unintended requests on a vulnerable application from an authenticated userâ€™s browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to visit a malicious page or click a malicious link. The attacker does not need to be authenticated against the vulnerable application.
