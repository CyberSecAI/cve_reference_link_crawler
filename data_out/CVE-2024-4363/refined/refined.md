Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-4363:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `title_tag` parameter within the Visual Portfolio, Photo Gallery & Post Grid plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input for the `title_tag` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately validate or sanitize the `title_tag` parameter before storing it in the database.
- **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape the `title_tag` parameter when rendering it on a webpage, allowing the injected JavaScript to execute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page. This code will then execute whenever a user accesses that page.
- **Potential for Malicious Actions:** The attacker could perform various actions, including:
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker modifies the `title_tag` parameter by injecting malicious javascript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least author-level privileges to modify the plugin settings and inject the malicious script.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `templates/items-list/item-parts/title.php` file of the plugin, specifically at line 22.
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including version 3.3.2.
- The issue was resolved in version 3.3.3. The fix involved ensuring proper escaping of the custom tag and preventing the use of non-predefined values.
