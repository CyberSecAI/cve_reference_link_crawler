I thought it was a great portfolio suite. It did everything that I wanted. And looked great.
But man, while it has been working flawlessly for several years, recently all the my portfolio post pages are just‚Ä¶.gone. The landing page is intact, but all of of my content just turned into nothing.

I‚Äôve been trying to find a plugin for awhile that I can use with certain styles to display my projects from university and personal artworks. The biggest thing was it needed to be somewhat modular and I could filter groups. This has been absolutely amazing for that use. Though I wish there were more layouts and dynamics to how layouts look .

### Description

The Visual Portfolio, Photo Gallery & Post Grid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‚Äòtitle\_tag‚Äô parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
