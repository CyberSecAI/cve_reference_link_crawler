# Forwarding of confidentials headers to third parties in fluture-node

High

[Avaq](/Avaq)
published
GHSA-32x6-qvw6-mxj4
Mar 1, 2022

## Package

npm

fluture-node
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

4.0.0, 4.0.1

## Patched versions

4.0.2

## Description

### Impact

Using `followRedirects` or `followRedirectsWith` with any of the redirection strategies built into fluture-node 4.0.0 or 4.0.1, paired with a request that includes confidential headers such as Authorization or Cookie, exposes you to a vulnerability where, if the destination server were to redirect the request to a server on a third-party domain, or the same domain over unencrypted HTTP, the headers would be included in the follow-up request and be exposed to the third party, or potential http traffic sniffing.

### Patches

The redirection strategies made available in version 4.0.2 automatically redact confidential headers when a redirect is followed across to another origin.

### Workarounds

Use a custom redirection strategy via the `followRedirectsWith` function. The custom strategy can be based on the new strategies available in fluture-node@4.0.2.

### References
