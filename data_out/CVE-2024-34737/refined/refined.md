    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of proper rate limiting on PiP aspect ratio change requests.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An app can flood the system with PiP resizing requests, which can cause the PiP window to freeze.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious app can repeatedly request aspect ratio changes.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a malicious app running on the device."
