## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v4 5.1**
* **ATTENTION**: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity/public exploits available
* **Vendor**: Uniview
* **Equipment**: NVR301-04S2-P4
* **Vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

An attacker could send a user a URL that if clicked on could execute malicious JavaScript in their browser.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following version of Uniview NVR, a network video recorder, is affected:

### 3.2 Vulnerability Overview

#### **3.2.1** [**IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

The affected product is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting attack (XSS). An attacker could send a user a URL that if clicked on could execute malicious JavaScript in their browser. This vulnerability affects both authenticated and unauthenticated pages under the /LAPI/ directory. As session data is unavailable, the scope is limited.

[CVE-2024-3850](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-3850) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)).

A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for [CVE-2024-3850](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-3850). A base score of 5.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N)).

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

CISA discovered a public Proof of Concept (PoC) as authored by Bleron Rrustemi and reported it to Uniview.

Chapman Schleiss of Test Defense reported an update to this vulnerability to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Uniview encourages users to obtain the fixed version, Uniview NVR-B3801.20.17.240507, and update. You may contact your local dealer, [Uniview Service Hotline](https://www.uniview.com/Support/Service_Hotline/), or regional technical support for assistance.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.
  CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.

## 5. UPDATE HISTORY

* June 4, 2024: Initial Publication
* September 24, 2024: Update A - Adjusted vulnerability description and CVSS scores based on new information. Updated researcher section to include reporter for new information.
