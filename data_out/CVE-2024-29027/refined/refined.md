Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-29027:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization when handling Cloud Function or Cloud Job names within the Parse Server. Specifically, the server does not validate these names for potentially malicious characters or patterns.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Code Injection:** The primary weakness is the possibility of code injection through crafted Cloud Function or Cloud Job names. The unsanitized names are used in a way that allows for the injection of arbitrary code, which can then be executed on the server.
- **Server Crash:**  Invalid function or job names can cause the server to crash due to the way these names were handled internally, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Denial of Service:** Sending requests with specially crafted invalid names can lead to server crashes, resulting in denial of service.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability Impact:** The vulnerability has the potential for high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely. This implies that an attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending requests to the server with crafted function or job names over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** An attacker does not need any prior privileges or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction:**  No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **High attack complexity:** The attack complexity is rated as high.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 of the Parse Server.
- The fix involves adding string sanitation for Cloud Function names and Cloud Job names.
- A workaround would be to sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server.
- The vulnerability was discovered by mtrezza and the remediation was developed by EhsanParsania.
- CVSS v3 base score: 9.1
- CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
