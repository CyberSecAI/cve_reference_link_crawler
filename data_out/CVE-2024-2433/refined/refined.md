- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authorization in Palo Alto Networks Panorama software. A read-only administrator can upload files via the web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269). Authenticated read-only administrators have the ability to upload files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can fill a disk partition by uploading files via the web interface. This action leads to loss of availability, preventing login to the web interface and the ability to download PAN-OS, WildFire, and content images.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack via the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have a read-only administrator account with access to the PAN-OS web interface.
