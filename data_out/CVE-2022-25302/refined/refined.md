- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing handler for failed casting when unvalidated data is forwarded to `boost::get` function in `OpcUaNodeIdBase.h`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to improper handling of specially crafted OPC UA messages with a particular encoded NodeId leading to a crash when casting fails.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can cause a denial of service by sending a specially crafted OPC UA message, which crashes the system, making the service unavailable to legitimate users.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted OPC UA message over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote and does not require any special privileges or user interaction. They only need to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable system.
