- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The MoveTo plugin for WordPress, in versions 6.2 and below, allows arbitrary file uploads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file upload vulnerability. This allows an attacker to upload files without proper validation or restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to upload malicious files, including backdoors, and execute them to gain further access to the website. This can lead to full website compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by uploading files through the plugin's interface, due to a lack of proper file validation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated.
