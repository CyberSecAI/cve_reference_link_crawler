- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Brute-force serial port cracking allows attackers to gain common user permissions, which can then be leveraged to escalate privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthorized access and privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers with common user permission can obtain elevated permissions on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: Brute-force serial port cracking followed by specific operations to escalate privileges
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need to be able to perform brute-force serial port cracking to gain common user permission.
