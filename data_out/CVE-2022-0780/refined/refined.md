{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin disables CSRF nonce verification for the siq_ajax AJAX action, and it lacks sanitization and escaping of the customCss parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to validate the CSRF nonce and does not sanitize or escape the 'customCss' parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the administrator's browser when they open the plugin's options page. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted AJAX request to the 'siq_ajax' action using the customCss parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They can send a crafted request to the WordPress site with a malicious payload."
