Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2925:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the Beaver Builder plugin's Button Widget. Specifically, the `id` attribute of a button is not properly sanitized before being used in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This occurs because user-supplied input for the button's `id` attribute is directly output into the HTML, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not properly sanitize the `id` attribute before using it to construct the HTML button element. The original code used `~~$settings->id~~` which does not sanitize, and was replaced with `esc_attr( $settings->id )` which escapes the attribute.
*   **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin fails to properly escape the output of the `id` attribute when generating the button element in the HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into a page.
*   **Malicious Actions:** The injected scripts can perform a variety of malicious actions, including:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Stealing user session cookies.
    *   Modifying the content of the page.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user.
*   **Compromise of User Accounts:**  If an admin views the page containing the XSS, an attacker could potentially compromise their administrative session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Button Widget `id` attribute:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `id` field of the Button Widget settings.
*   **Stored XSS:** The injected script is stored within the database and executed every time an affected page is loaded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have an authenticated account with at least "Contributor" level access within the WordPress instance. This is because the vulnerability is located within the backend page builder functionality.
*   **Plugin Access:** The attacker needs the ability to create or edit pages using the vulnerable Beaver Builder plugin's Button Widget.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable versions are up to and including 2.8.0.5 of the Beaver Builder plugin.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 2.8.0.7 by using `esc_attr()` to sanitize the button's id.

This vulnerability allows for persistent XSS attacks.
