- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Zephyr OS IP packet handling does not properly drop IP packets arriving on an external interface with a source address equal to 127.0.0.1 or the destination address.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The system lacks proper validation of source IP addresses of incoming packets on external interfaces, allowing packets with loopback addresses (127.0.0.1) or the same address as the destination to be processed. Additionally, a separate bug causes a kernel crash when these invalid packets are processed using TCP.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Bypassing host-side IP address-based access controls.
    - Denial of Service (DoS) attacks due to the handling of responses on loopback interfaces.
    - Kernel crashes when processing such packets over TCP.
- **Attack vectors:** Network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send IP packets to the target device, with the source IP set to 127.0.0.1 or the destination address. The attacker doesn't need any privileges or user interaction on the target device. The attack can be done remotely.
