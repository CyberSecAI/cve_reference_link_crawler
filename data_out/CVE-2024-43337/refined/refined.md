- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Brave Popup Builder Plugin (versions <= 0.7.0) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability, which allows an attacker to force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could craft a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, would perform an unwanted action on their behalf.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into triggering a malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
