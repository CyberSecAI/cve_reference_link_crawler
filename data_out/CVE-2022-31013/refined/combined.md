# Authentication bypass

Critical

[ramank775](/ramank775)
published
GHSA-xx4j-qqpp-v277
May 28, 2022

## Package

chat-server
(Vartalap)

## Affected versions

>2.3.2

## Patched versions

2.6.0

## Description

### Impact

Due to a bug in validating access token, authentication is getting bypassed.

```
      try {
           this.authProvider.verifyAccessKey(username, accesskey);
      } catch {
        return res.response({}).code(401);
      }
      return res.response({}).code(200);
```

The function `this.authProvider.verifyAccessKey` is an async function. As the code is not using `await` to wait for the verification result.

Every time the function response back with success, along with an unhandled exception if the token is invalid.

### Patches

```
      try {
          await  this.authProvider.verifyAccessKey(username, accesskey);
      } catch {
        return res.response({}).code(401);
      }
      return res.response({}).code(200);
```

The patch is updated with new version [v2.6.0](https://github.com/ramank775/chat-server/releases/tag/v2.6.0)
