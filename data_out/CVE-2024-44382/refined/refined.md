Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerabilities is improper handling of user-supplied input within the `jhttpd` service of the D-Link DI-8004W router. Specifically, the `msp_info_htm` and `upgrade_filter_asp` functions are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** Both `msp_info_htm` and `upgrade_filter_asp` functions are susceptible to command injection. The application constructs commands using user-provided input without proper sanitization or validation, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system with root privileges. This can lead to:
    *   Full control of the device
    *   Data exfiltration
    *   Malware installation
    *   Botnet participation
    *   Denial of service
*   The provided proof of concept (POC) shows how an attacker could use `wget` to download a file from a remote server, indicating the capability to further compromise the device after initial exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerabilities are triggered through specifically crafted HTTP GET requests to the `/msp_info.htm` and `/upgrade_filter.asp` pages.
*   **Malicious parameters:** The `flag` and `cmd` parameters for `msp_info.htm` and the `path` parameter for `upgrade_filter.asp` are used to inject the malicious shell commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable router.
*   **Authentication:** The exploit requires a valid session with the router. The provided examples use the default admin:admin credentials for authentication to gain access to the vulnerable pages.

**Additional Details:**
*   The specific firmware version affected is `DI_8004W-16.07.26A1.trx`.
*   The vulnerability exists within the `jhttpd` service.
