TuiTse-TsuSin is a package for organizing the comparative corpus of Taiwanese Chinese characters and Roman characters, and extracting sentences of the Taiwanese Chinese characters and the Roman characters. Prior to version 1.3.2, when using `tuitse_html` without quoting the input, there is a html injection vulnerability. Version 1.3.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, sanitize Taigi input with HTML quotation.
