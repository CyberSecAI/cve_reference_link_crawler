Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8922:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the insecure deserialization of untrusted data in the `enquiry_detail.php` file of the "Product Enquiry for WooCommerce" plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **PHP Object Injection:** The plugin deserializes data from the `pi_products_info` meta field without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP objects.
- **Unsafe Deserialization:** The use of `unserialize()` without specifying allowed classes makes the application vulnerable to object injection attacks when combined with a suitable gadget chain.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If a suitable Property-Oriented Programming (POP) chain exists within the WordPress installation (either in the vulnerable plugin itself or other installed plugins or themes), this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Data Manipulation/Deletion:** An attacker might be able to delete arbitrary files or gain access to sensitive data, depending on the available POP chain.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Although the direct exploit requires author-level access, further exploitation through RCE could lead to privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `enquiry_detail.php` file, which is accessible via the WordPress admin panel.
- The injected serialized data is stored in the `pi_products_info` meta field, which is retrieved by the vulnerable code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have an account with at least "Author" level privileges on the WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of POP Chain:** Successful exploitation for RCE requires a working POP chain which might be present in the plugin itself, or another plugin/theme.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in "Product Enquiry for WooCommerce" versions up to and including 2.2.33.33.
- The fix was introduced in version 2.2.33.34, which adds the `allowed_classes` parameter to the `unserialize` function, preventing arbitrary object instantiation, and uses the `$wpdb` class directly to retrieve the meta value.

- The provided content includes a changeset that shows the code modification that fixed the vulnerability, specifically in `trunk/admin/partials/enquiry_detail.php` and `trunk/includes/conflict-fixer.php`.
- The `conflict-fixer.php` code was modified to add a filter to the `get_post_metadata` function that will attempt to unserialize the data with `allowed_classes` set to `false`.
- The `enquiry_detail.php` code was modified to include `['allowed_classes' => false]` in the `unserialize()` call.
