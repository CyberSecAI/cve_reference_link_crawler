Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `print_quiz_records.php` script. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is a SQL Injection vulnerability. An attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privileges:** The exploit can lead to an escalation of privileges by gaining access to sensitive data within the database.
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially extract, modify, or delete data from the database.
- **Full Database Compromise:**  In a worst-case scenario, the attacker could gain complete control over the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP GET request to the `/print_quiz_records.php` endpoint.
- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The `id` parameter in the URL is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:**  The attacker must be able to send HTTP GET requests.
- **SQL Injection Knowledge:**  The attacker must have knowledge of SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Details:**
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `id` parameter in `/print_quiz_records.php` is the specific vulnerable parameter.
- **Proof of Concept (POC):** The provided `sqlmap` command and the `a.txt` file demonstrate how to exploit the vulnerability using `sqlmap` which is a tool designed to automate SQL injection discovery and exploitation.
