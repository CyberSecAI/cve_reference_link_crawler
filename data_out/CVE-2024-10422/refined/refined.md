Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper handling of the `id` parameter within the `\admin\overtime\_add.php` file. This allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious code through this parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is the injection of malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter, before using it in database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated, SQL injection vulnerabilities can potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities to gain remote code execution on the server.
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially extracting, modifying, or deleting sensitive data.
*   **Application Compromise:**  The attacker can potentially compromise the application's functionality and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, suggesting that no local access to the server is required.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack is likely carried out through crafted HTTP requests targeting the vulnerable file `\admin\overtime\_add.php` with malicious SQL code injected into the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to reach the server where the vulnerable application is hosted.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests and manipulate parameters.
*  **SQL Injection knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in SourceCodester Attendance and Payroll System v1.0.
*   The vulnerable file is `\admin\overtime\_add.php`.
*   The specific parameter that is vulnerable is `id`.
