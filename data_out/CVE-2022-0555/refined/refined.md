The provided content relates to CVE-2022-0555.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The subiquity installer was logging the LUKS encryption password in plaintext within its log files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Sensitive information (LUKS encryption password) was being logged in plaintext.
- Log files containing the plaintext password had insecure permissions (0644), making them world-readable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with local access to the system could read the log files and obtain the LUKS encryption password, potentially gaining access to encrypted data.

**Attack Vectors:**
Local access to the system and the ability to read the log files (`/var/logs/installer/*`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to have local user access to the target system.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was reproducible on Ubuntu 20.04.3.
- The vulnerability was present in subiquity log files: `subiquity-server-debug.log` and `subiquity-server-info.log`.
- The fix involved changing the file mode to 0640 and the owner to `root:adm` for sensitive log and configuration files.
- Additionally, logging of the body of API calls was changed to prevent logging sensitive data like client tokens.
- The fix was implemented in pull requests #1181 and #1182 of the canonical/subiquity repository.
