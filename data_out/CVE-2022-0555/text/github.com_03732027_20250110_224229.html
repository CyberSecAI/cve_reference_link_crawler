### @dbungert **[dbungert](/dbungert)** commented [Feb 10, 2022](#issue-1130833576)

* Implement file mode 0640, owner root:adm for log files and config files that will be copied to the target system and may contain sensitive information.
* Centralize on subiquity-specific write\_file & helper funtions rather than a mix of curtin / cloud-init / subiquity versions

Sorry, something went wrong.
