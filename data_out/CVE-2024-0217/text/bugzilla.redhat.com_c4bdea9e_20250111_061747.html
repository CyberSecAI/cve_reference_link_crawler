| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2256624#c0)  Avinash Hanwate    2024-01-03 13:18:35 UTC  ``` PackageKit relies on “transactions” as a work unit to wrap package manager actions, these transactions are created by the user and freed when no longer in use or when a terminal error is emitted. It was observed that under some conditions, the order of cleanup mechanics for a transaction could be impacted. As a result, some memory accesses could occur on memory regions that were previously freed. Once freed, a memory region can be reused for other allocations and any previously stored data in this memory region is considered lost. Usage of memory after it is cleaned is named Use-After-Free (UAF). The most reliable way a transaction can be made to be cleaned whilst still running is by having a task for a package backend (dnf in our case) and simultaneously causing an error or successful termination of another task for that same transaction.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2256624#c2)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2024-01-04 19:27:12 UTC  ``` Can you reference the upstream change from v1.2.7 which addresses this issue?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2256624#c3)  Pedro Sampaio    2024-01-05 17:34:45 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=2256624#c2): > Can you reference the upstream change from v1.2.7 which addresses this issue?

It's a bug for sure, but I don't see the connection to this issue.   ``` |  |
