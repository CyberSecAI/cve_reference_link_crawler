Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the 'easyappointments' shortcode of the Easy!Appointments plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided attributes used in the shortcode. This allows the injection of arbitrary web scripts into pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary script execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of a user's browser when they access a page containing the vulnerable shortcode.
- **Account takeover, data theft, etc:** The impact of successful XSS exploitation can lead to various malicious actions, including account hijacking, data theft, or further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode injection:** An attacker can inject malicious code by crafting a shortcode with the vulnerable attributes containing XSS payloads. This shortcode needs to be placed in a WordPress page or post.
- **User Supplied Attributes:** The `width`, `height`, and `style` attributes of the `easyappointments` shortcode are not properly sanitized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Contributor+ Access:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to WordPress, allowing them to create or edit posts/pages. This means that the vulnerability cannot be exploited by unauthenticated users.
- Ability to inject shortcodes in pages.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability exists in all versions of the plugin up to and including version 1.3.1.
- The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.3.2.
- The code snippet provided shows the vulnerable code in `class-easyappointments-public.php`, specifically the shortcode handling at line 140-153, where the `width`, `height` and `style` attributes are escaped with `esc_attr` while this is insufficient to prevent XSS attacks.
