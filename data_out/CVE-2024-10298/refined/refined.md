Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `editid` parameter within the PHPGurukul Medical Card Generation System. Specifically, the application does not adequately sanitize or validate the `editid` parameter before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can insert malicious SQL code into the `editid` parameter, leading to the execution of arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The report identifies both boolean-based and time-based blind SQL injection vulnerabilities, which suggests the application may not directly output the results of the injected queries.
*   **Stacked Queries:** The system is also vulnerable to stacked queries which allows the attacker to execute multiple SQL queries in sequence.
*   **Union-based SQL Injection:** The system is vulnerable to UNION-based SQL injection, which can be used to retrieve data from the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database, including medical card details and user information.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful SQL injection could grant attackers access to the application's database, potentially allowing them to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not directly stated, SQL injection can sometimes be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the server. However, this is not the primary risk described here.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves sending crafted HTTP GET requests to specific application endpoints (`/mcgs/admin/changeimage.php` and `/mcgs/admin/edit-card-detail.php`) while manipulating the `editid` parameter.
*   **Web Browser/Proxy:**  Attackers could use a web browser, proxy tools like Burp Suite, or other HTTP client tools to modify the requests to inject malicious SQL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Admin Access:** The attacker needs to be able to log in as an admin to reach the vulnerable endpoints.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** A working knowledge of SQL injection techniques is required to craft the malicious payloads and exploit the vulnerability successfully.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where the vulnerable application is hosted.
