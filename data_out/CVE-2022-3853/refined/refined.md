{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `scsv_defaultdesc` parameter in the Supra CSV plugin settings page is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings, which will be executed in the browsers of users who access the plugin's settings page.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker crafts a malicious payload within the `scsv_defaultdesc` parameter and uses a CSRF attack to force an administrator to submit the payload, causing it to be stored in the plugin settings. The stored XSS is then triggered when a user accesses the settings page.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft an XSS payload and a CSRF exploit. They must induce a logged in administrator to submit the form with the malicious payload."
