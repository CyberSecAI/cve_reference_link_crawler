Feb 28, 2024

## Package

bundler

rack
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

All

## Patched versions

2.0.9.4, 2.1.4.4, 2.2.8.1, 3.0.9.1

## Description

# Possible Denial of Service Vulnerability in Rack Header Parsing

There is a possible denial of service vulnerability in the header parsing

routines in Rack. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier

CVE-YYYY-XXXX.

Versions Affected: All.

Not affected: None

Fixed Versions: 2.0.9.4, 2.1.4.4, 2.2.8.1, 3.0.9.1

## Impact

Carefully crafted headers can cause header parsing in Rack to take longer than

expected resulting in a possible denial of service issue. Accept and Forwarded

headers are impacted.

Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rack applications using Ruby 3.2

or newer are unaffected.

## Releases

The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

## Workarounds

There are no feasible workarounds for this issue.

## Patches

To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for

the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a

single changeset.

* 2-0-header-redos.patch - Patch for 2.0 series
* 2-1-header-redos.patch - Patch for 2.1 series
* 2-2-header-redos.patch - Patch for 2.2 series
* 3-0-header-redos.patch - Patch for 3.0 series
