Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5255

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `ultimate_dual_color` shortcode in the "Ultimate Addons for WPBakery Page Builder" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input when using the `ultimate_dual_color` shortcode. This allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into website content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of the website.
- **Compromise of User Accounts:** Malicious scripts can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, perform actions on behalf of the user, or manipulate website content.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers could potentially alter the appearance of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious code through the vulnerable `ultimate_dual_color` shortcode.
- **Stored XSS:** The injected script is stored within the website's database and executed when a user views the affected page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** Attackers need to be authenticated users with at least "Contributor" level access to the WordPress website.
- **Ability to add shortcodes:** The attacker must be able to add the vulnerable shortcode (`ultimate_dual_color`) to website content (posts/pages).

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:** All versions of the "Ultimate Addons for WPBakery Page Builder" plugin up to and including version 3.19.20 are vulnerable.
- **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is addressed in version 3.19.20.1 and later.
- **Reporting:** The vulnerability was reported by haidv35 - VCS.
- **CVSS Score:** 6.4 (Medium)

In summary, this is a medium-severity vulnerability that could allow authenticated attackers to inject malicious scripts into a WordPress site by leveraging a flaw in the `ultimate_dual_color` shortcode. It is important to update the plugin to the patched version to prevent exploitation.
