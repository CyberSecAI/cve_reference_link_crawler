The provided content is related to CVE-2023-48571.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **CWE:** CWE-79
*  **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution
*   **Severity:** Important
*   **CVSS Score:** 5.4
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
*   **Affected Product:** Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)
*   **Affected Versions:** AEM Cloud Service (CS), 6.5.18.0 and earlier versions

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability. This means that malicious script can be stored within the application, and then executed when other users interact with the stored data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The main vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data before storing and displaying it. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Access to sensitive information
    *   Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network.
*   **Access Complexity:** Low, indicating it is not difficult to exploit.
*   **Privileges Required:** Low level privileges are required to inject the malicious script.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim must interact with the malicious stored script for the attack to succeed.
*   **Scope:** The scope of the vulnerability is changed, meaning that the injected script runs within the security context of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the capability to store data within the application that will be rendered to other users. This typically means having some level of access to the system
*   The attacker does not need to be in a privileged position to cause the exploit
* The attacker must inject a malicious script, which would then execute when the victim interacts with the stored malicious code.
