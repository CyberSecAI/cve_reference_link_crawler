Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36889:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the fact that in the MPTCP (Multipath TCP) implementation in the Linux kernel, the `snd_nxt` (send next sequence number) field is not properly initialized when a client socket falls back to TCP early in the connection process. When such a fallback happens and an incoming ACK is received, it could lead to `snd_una` being updated with an uninitialized value of `snd_nxt`. Subsequently, if the MPTCP worker attempts a re-injection of packets, a send buffer cleanup is triggered using corrupted values from `snd_una`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Uninitialized Data:** The core weakness is the use of uninitialized `snd_nxt` when a connection falls back to TCP.
- **Incorrect State Management:** The MPTCP worker attempts re-injection based on potentially corrupted `snd_una` values.
- **Data Corruption:** The incorrect `snd_una` leads to incorrect send buffer cleanup

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The primary impact is a kernel panic due to the invalid memory access, potentially leading to a denial-of-service. The analysis also mentions a "splat", which indicates a kernel error or panic.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Triggering TCP fallback:** The vulnerability is triggered during an MPTCP connection when the connection falls back to using TCP early in the connection process
- **Receiving an ACK:** Receiving an ACK before `snd_nxt` is initialized is necessary to update the `snd_una` with the uninitialized value.
- **MPTCP worker re-injection:** The MPTCP worker attempting to re-inject packets after a fallback to TCP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to initiate an MPTCP connection where a fallback to TCP can occur early in the process. This scenario is typically related to connection negotiation or failure to establish an MPTCP connection.
- No specific positioning within the network seems to be required beyond being a party to an MPTCP connection.
- No specific user privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided patches address the issue by ensuring `snd_nxt` and `write_seq` are initialized at connection time, preventing the use of uninitialized values.
- The initial commits related to this fix only initialize `write_seq`, and later commits initialize both `write_seq` and `snd_nxt` in the connect function. This reflects the evolution of the fix.
