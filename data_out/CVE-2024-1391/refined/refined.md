### Summary
The provided content confirms the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-1391. It is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the Elementor Addon Elements plugin for WordPress, specifically within the 'Thumbnail Slider' widget.

### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `eae_custom_overlay_switcher` attribute within the Thumbnail Slider widget.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling the custom overlay for the thumbnail slider. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code, which is then stored in the database.

### Impact of exploitation
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. This malicious script will execute in the context of a user's browser when they access the affected page.
- **Account compromise:** This can potentially lead to account compromise, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.

### Attack vectors
- **Through the 'Thumbnail Slider' widget:** The attacker injects malicious code into the `eae_custom_overlay_switcher` attribute.
- **Requires authenticated access:**  The attacker needs to have at least 'contributor' level access to the WordPress site to modify page content using the affected widget.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with 'contributor' or higher level permissions.
- **Page editing access:**  The attacker needs to have the ability to edit pages using the Elementor page builder.

### Additional notes
The provided code snippets from `module.php` show the code that handles the `eae_custom_overlay_switcher` attribute. The vulnerability is located in how the attribute is processed in javascript.
The vulnerability was patched in version 1.13 of the plugin.
