Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-35084:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the `findPage` function located in `SysMsgPushMapper.xml`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, which occurs when untrusted data is included in a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could lead to:
    - Unauthorized data access: Retrieving sensitive information from the database.
    - Data modification: Altering or deleting data within the database.
    - Denial of Service: By crafting queries that cause performance issues or database downtime.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `findPage` function in `SysMsgPushMapper.xml`, which is susceptible to receiving malicious input that is not properly sanitized.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted input to the vulnerable `findPage` function. This could be through a user interface, API endpoint, or any other entry point that passes data to this function. Specific access details, such as authentication requirements to reach the vulnerable function, are not detailed in the provided content.

**Additional details:**
- The affected product is J2EEFAST version 2.7.0. The issue was identified within the SysMsgPushMapper component. The content also mentions a fixed version but does not provide it, as it's the same as the vulnerable one `J2EEFAST - v2.7.0`. This is likely a typo and should be updated to a later version.
