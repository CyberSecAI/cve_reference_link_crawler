Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-22916

**Affected Product:** D-LINK Go-RT-AC750

**Affected Version:** v101b03

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a stack-based buffer overflow within the `sprintf` function in the `sub_40E700` function of the `cgibin` executable. This occurs due to improper handling of string concatenation, specifically within the SUBSCRIBE section of the `genacgi_main` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stack Overflow:** The core issue is a stack buffer overflow vulnerability caused by the use of `sprintf` to concatenate strings without proper bounds checking.
*   **Unsafe String Concatenation:** The `sprintf` function is used to copy and combine multiple strings without ensuring that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the final string. This results in the overflowing of the stack buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device.
*   **Potential Device Compromise:** The ability to execute commands can be used to fully compromise the router, enabling the attacker to control the device, steal data, or use the device for further attacks.
*   **Specifically, the provided content highlights the execution of `telnetd -l /bin/sh` as a means to gain remote shell access.**

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves crafting a malicious input string that triggers the stack overflow when processed by the vulnerable `sprintf` function.
*  Specifically, the content mentions that the `SUBSCRIBE` section within the `genacgi_main` function is where the vulnerable code exists.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted string to the vulnerable function of the device to trigger the overflow.
*   Given the nature of the vulnerability, it's likely exploitable remotely, however, the precise method of accessing the vulnerable function (e.g., through the web interface, via a specific API endpoint, etc.) isn't detailed in this content.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The PoC is not publicly disclosed in the content provided, but the intended effect is explained (i.e., using telnet to gain a shell).
*   The content provides screenshots showing login credentials which might be relevant during exploitation, or for understanding the default configuration.
*   The blog post provides a download link for the firmware, useful for vulnerability testing and analysis.
