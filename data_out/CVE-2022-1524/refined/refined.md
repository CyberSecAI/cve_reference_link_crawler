The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1524.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of TLS encryption in Local Run Manager (LRM) versions 2.4 and lower, resulting in cleartext transmission of sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319): LRM versions 2.4 and lower do not implement TLS encryption, causing sensitive data, including credentials, to be transmitted in cleartext.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A malicious actor can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to intercept sensitive data in transit, including credentials. This could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access and control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
Network-based, specifically through a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the LRM system and other systems with which it communicates. The attacker does not need prior authentication.
The attack complexity is high, due to the need for a MITM position.
