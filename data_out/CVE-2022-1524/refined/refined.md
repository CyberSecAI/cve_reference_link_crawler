The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1524.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of TLS encryption in Illumina Local Run Manager (LRM) versions 2.4 and lower. This means that sensitive data transmitted by the software is not encrypted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319): Sensitive data, including credentials, is transmitted without encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious actor can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack and intercept sensitive data, including credentials, transmitted by LRM.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: An attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the client and server to intercept the communication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to perform a MITM attack.
- The attack has a high degree of complexity (AC:H), implying that it would require some effort to accomplish.
- No privileges are required (PR:N), and no user interaction is necessary (UI:N).

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability affects versions 2.4 and lower of Illumina's Local Run Manager (LRM) software.
- The advisory mentions that a patch has been released to address the vulnerabilities, including this one.
- The provided CVSS vector string (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N) indicates that the vulnerability is network-based (AV:N), has a high attack complexity (AC:H), requires no privileges (PR:N) and no user interaction (UI:N), has no scope change(S:U), with high confidentiality and integrity impact (C:H/I:H), but no availability impact (A:N).
