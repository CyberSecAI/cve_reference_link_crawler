{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'Copyright' and 'Author' fields within the 'Meta & Custom Tags Menu'.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection.",
     "attack_vectors": "A local attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'Copyright' and 'Author' fields of the 'Meta & Custom Tags Menu'. When a user accesses a page where these meta tags are rendered, the injected script will execute.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have access to the e107 CMS admin panel to modify the 'Meta & Custom Tags' settings and inject the XSS payload. No special privileges are explicitly mentioned, implying that even a low-privileged admin account could exploit this vulnerability."
