  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor can craft a request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, will cause the unwanted action to be executed by the vulnerable plugin.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into triggering the crafted malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated."
