## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Sassy Social Share <= 3.3.3 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Description

AJAX endpoints which returns JSON data has no Content-Type header set, and uses default text/html. Any JSON that has HTML will be rendered as such.

### Proof of Concept

PoC URL (uses unauthenticated action "heateor\_sss\_sharing\_count"):
http://WORDPRESS\_DOMAIN\_HERE/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=heateor\_sss\_sharing\_count&urls[<img%20src%3dx%20onerror%3dalert(document.domain)>]=
Other authenticated AJAX actions may also lead to reflected XSS, but not tested.

### Affects Plugins

### Description

The Sassy Social Share plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'urls' parameter called via the 'heateor\_sss\_sharing\_count' AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 3.3.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

Wordfence blocked **1,138 attacks** targeting this vulnerability in the past 24 hours.
