Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-36387

**Description:**

The vulnerability is a Null Pointer Dereference that can occur when serving WebSocket protocol upgrades over an HTTP/2 connection in Apache HTTP Server. This can lead to a crash of the server process, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a null pointer dereference during the processing of WebSocket upgrades over HTTP/2 connections. The specific conditions or code path leading to the dereference are not detailed, but it occurs within the handling of WebSocket upgrades in an HTTP/2 context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a null pointer dereference. This occurs when the code attempts to access a memory location pointed to by a null pointer, which leads to a crash.
*   **Inadequate Error Handling:** The vulnerability suggests that the code lacks proper checks for null pointers or does not handle specific error conditions correctly when processing WebSocket upgrades in HTTP/2.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of this vulnerability will cause the Apache HTTP Server process to crash. This can disrupt service availability and degrade performance for end users of the affected service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack vector is network-based, where a malicious client can initiate a WebSocket upgrade request over an HTTP/2 connection to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Apache HTTP Server.
*   **HTTP/2 and WebSocket Knowledge:** The attacker needs to craft or send a specific HTTP/2 request with a WebSocket upgrade to trigger the null pointer dereference

**Affected Versions:**

*   Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.55 through 2.4.59 are vulnerable.
*   NetApp products using the vulnerable Apache HTTP Server versions are also affected
    *   Specifically, ONTAP 9 is listed as affected by CVE-2024-36387.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.60. It is recommended to upgrade to this version, or later, to mitigate the vulnerability.
*   NetApp has released patches for affected ONTAP versions.

**Additional Notes:**
    * The severity is rated as "low" by Apache, but NetApp rates the CVE as "HIGH" with a CVSS score of 7.5
    * The vulnerability was reported by Marc Stern.
