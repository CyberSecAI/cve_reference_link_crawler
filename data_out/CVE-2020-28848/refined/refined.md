The provided content describes a CSV injection vulnerability (CVE-2020-28848) in ChurchCRM version 4.2.0.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not sanitize or escape special characters in user-supplied data (specifically in the "Name" field of event types) before exporting to CSV, allowing injection of malicious formulas.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSV Injection, also known as Formula Injection, is present in the "List Event Types" feature. The application fails to sanitize the input data, allowing the injection of malicious formulas in the CSV file.

- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can inject arbitrary formulas into a CSV file. When the CSV is opened with spreadsheet software (like Excel), the injected formulas are executed. This can lead to remote code execution on the client's machine, data leakage through malicious hyperlinks, and other malicious actions like downloading a backdoor or opening a malicious website.

- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with access to the ChurchCRM application can inject the malicious payload into the 'Name' field when creating or editing Event Types. When a user downloads the exported CSV file and opens it, the injected payload can execute if the user has not disabled the external content and macros settings in Excel.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the ChurchCRM application, with the ability to create or modify Event Types. The attacker would need to have the ability to inject the payload into the vulnerable field and the targeted user would need to download and open the exported CSV file on a vulnerable application.
