# CVE-2024-48139 : Prompt Injection in Blackbox AI v1.3.95

A prompt injection vulnerability in Blackbox AI v1.3.95 allows attackers to access and exfiltrate all previous and subsequent chat data between the user and the AI assistant via a crafted message. This will result in a persistent data leak.

PoC:

* On typing a maliciously crafted prompt in the extension's chat window, all previous and future conversations in the chat box are sent to the attacker controlled site.
