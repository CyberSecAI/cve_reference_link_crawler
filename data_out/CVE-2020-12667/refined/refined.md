Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12667:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability, dubbed "NXNSAttack", stems from the way DNS resolvers handle DNS delegation. Specifically, it exploits the "glueless delegation" mechanism where a DNS server provides names of authoritative servers for a domain without including their IP addresses. An attacker can send a crafted DNS response containing a delegation to a large number of fake (random) server names which all point to the victim's DNS domain. This forces the resolver to generate many DNS queries to the victim's authoritative servers in a futile attempt to resolve the fake server names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Abuse of DNS Delegation Mechanism:** The core weakness is the ability to abuse the standard DNS delegation process to force a recursive resolver to generate a large number of queries.
-   **Lack of Rate Limiting:**  The vulnerability highlights the lack of sufficient controls on the number of names a resolver attempts to resolve when processing a single delegation. Some resolvers, like BIND, attempt to resolve IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for all NS records in parallel which results in an amplification of traffic.
-   **Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume:** The vulnerability exists because the resolver does not properly limit the number of DNS queries generated when handling a malicious delegation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service attack. The amplified DNS traffic directed towards the victim's authoritative DNS servers can overwhelm them, rendering the domain unreachable.
-   **Amplification:** The attack achieves a high amplification factor, where a single malicious DNS response triggers a large number of queries from the resolver to the victim's server. The amplification factor can vary depending on the resolver's implementation.
    -   BIND 9.12.3 resolver had a PAF of 1000x.
    -   Knot Resolver 5.1.0 had a PAF of 48x.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Crafted DNS Response:** The attacker needs to control an authoritative DNS server for a domain and craft a malicious DNS response to a query.
-   **DNS Query to Vulnerable Resolver:** The attacker sends a normal DNS query which reaches the vulnerable resolver.
-   **Amplification through Resolver:** The vulnerable resolver acts as an amplifier, generating multiple queries to the victim's authoritative server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Control over Authoritative DNS Server:** The attacker needs to control an authoritative DNS server for a domain.
-   **Ability to Craft DNS Responses:** The attacker must be able to craft specific DNS responses that include the malicious delegation to fake servers pointing to a victim's DNS domain.
-   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Resolvers:** The attacker needs to target DNS resolvers vulnerable to this issue.

**Mitigation:**
The primary mitigation is to upgrade DNS resolvers to versions that include fixes for NXNSAttack. Mitigations include:
- **Limiting Names Resolved:**  Limiting the number of names resolved when processing a single delegation.
- **Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache:** Using DNSSEC NSEC(3) records to generate negative answers without contacting authoritative servers.

**Additional Details:**
