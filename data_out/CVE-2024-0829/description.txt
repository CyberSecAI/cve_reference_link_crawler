The Comments Extra Fields For Post,Pages and CPT plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 5.0. This is due to missing or incorrect capability checks on several ajax actions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access or higher, to invoke those actions. As a result, they may modify comment form fields and update plugin settings.
