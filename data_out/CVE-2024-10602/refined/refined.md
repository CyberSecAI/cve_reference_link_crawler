Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `data_picker_link.php` file within the Tongda OA system. The `$dataSrc` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized or processed, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input validation or sanitization of the `dataSrc` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Database Manipulation:** With more advanced SQL injection techniques, an attacker could modify or delete data in the database.
- **Potential for Complete System Compromise:** Depending on the database permissions, the attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `data_picker_link.php` file.
- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `dataSrc` parameter within the URL to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Tongda OA instance.
- **Understanding of SQL Syntax:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft effective SQL injection payloads.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to identify the `dataSrc` parameter as the injection point.

**Technical Details from the provided Github issue:**
- The vulnerable file is `general/approve_center/list/input_form/data_picker_link.php`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `$dataSrc`.
- The provided SQL injection examples include extracting database name using `DATABASE()` and using `information_schema.columns` to confirm the injection.
- The example payloads demonstrate how to extract character by character from the database name by using `substr()` and `char()` functions.
