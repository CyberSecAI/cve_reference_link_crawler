- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of user input sanitization when converting an HTML table to a PDF document via the FortiView feature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Open redirect vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can social engineer a user into generating a PDF file containing malicious URLs, potentially leading to unauthorized code or command execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Social engineering to trick a user into generating a malicious PDF.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to persuade a user of FortiAnalyzer/FortiManager to generate a PDF with the malicious content. The attacker does not need prior access to the system.
