What's New

Advanced Cross vCenter vMotion: With vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1c, in the vSphere Client, you can use the Advanced Cross vCenter vMotion feature to

manage the bulk migration of workloads across vCenter Server systems in different vCenter Single Sign-On domains. Advanced Cross vCenter vMotion does not

depend on vCenter Enhanced Linked Mode or Hybrid Linked Mode and works for both on-premise and cloud environments. Advanced Cross vCenter vMotion

facilitates your migration from VMware Cloud Foundation 3 to VMware Cloud Foundation 4, which includes vSphere with Tanzu Kubernetes Grid, and delivers a

unified platform for both VMs and containers, allowing operators to provision Kubernetes clusters from vCenter Server. The feature also allows smooth transition

to the latest version of vCenter Server by simplifying workload migration from any vCenter Server instance of 6.x or later

Parallel remediation on hosts in clusters that you manage with vSphere Lifecycle Manager baselines: With vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1c, you can run parallel

remediation on ESXi hosts in maintenance mode in clusters that you manage with vSphere Lifecycle Manager baselines.

Third-party plug-ins to manage services on the vSAN Data Persistence platform: With vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1c, you can enable third-party plug-ins to

manage services on the vSAN Data Persistence platform from the vSphere Client, the same way you manage your vCenter Server system. For more information,

see the vSphere with Tanzu Configuration and Management documentation.

For VMware vSphere with Tanzu updates, see VMware vSphere with Tanzu Release Notes.

Product Support Notices

Deprecation of SSPI, CAC and RSA

In a future vSphere release, VMware plans to discontinue support for Windows Session Authentication (SSPI), Common Access Card (CAC), and RSA SecurID for

vCenter Server. In place of SSPI, CAC, or RSA SecurID, users and administrators can configure and use Identity Federation with a supported Identity Provider to

sign in to their vCenter Server system.

Resolved Issues

The resolved issues are grouped as follows.

Auto Deploy Issues

CIM and API Issues

Guest OS Issues

Miscellaneous Issues

Networking Issues

Security Issues

Server Configuration Issues

Upgrade Issues

vCenter Server and vSphere Client Issues

vSAN Issues

vSphere HA and Fault Tolerance Issues

vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues

Auto Deploy Issues

You cannot PXE boot an ESXi host by using vSphere Auto Deploy due to a network error

For ESXi hosts with Emulex and Qlogic host bus adapters (HBA), attempts to PXE boot the host by using vSphere Auto Deploy might fail due to a network error.

For some Emulex adapters, in the PXE boot console you see a message such as:

Could not open net0: Input/output error http://ipxe.org/1d6a4a98'

Network error encountered while PXE booting.

Scanning the local disk for cached image.

If no image is found, the system will reboot in 20 seconds ……

Could not boot. No such device (http://ipxe.org/2c048087)

Emulex HBA adapters that persistently face the issue are:

HPE StoreFabric CN1200E-T 10Gb Converged Network Adapter

HPE StoreFabric CN1200E 10Gb Converged Network Adapter

HP FlexFabric 20Gb 2-port 650FLB Adapter

HP FlexFabric 20Gb 2-port 650M Adapter

For ESXi hosts with QLogic HBAs, attempts to PXE boot the host by using vSphere Auto Deploy do not always fail.

If the ESX host encounters the issue, in the PXE boot console you see a message such as:

Configuring (net0 f4:03:43:b4:88:d0)......

No configuration methods succeeded (http://ipxe.org/040ee186)

Network error encountered while PXE booting.

The affected Qlogic HBA adapter is HP Ethernet 10Gb 2-port 530T.

This issue is resolved in this release.

CIM and API Issues

Remote queries to the SNMP agent on the vCenter Server Appliance fail

If the SNMP agent on the vCenter Server Appliance runs out of memory, the agent might stop answering queries from remote clients.

In the backtrace, you can see error messages such as:

2019-11-13T07:16:12.282841+00:00 dk-vcdmng11 snmpd[47594]: 27:load_pci: mmap(-1) failed, Cannot allocate memory

This issue is resolved in this release.

Guest OS Issues

Windows OS customization fails when the original hostname of the Windows OS is longer than 15 bytes

If you deploy a virtual machine template with a Windows OS that has a hostname longer than 15 bytes, the guest OS customization fails. In the customization log

file %WINDIR%\Temp\vmware-imc\guestcustutil.log, you see an error message such as More data is available.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Miscellaneous Issues

The VMware Platform Services Controller Health Monitor service, pschealth, intermittently fails and restarts

The pschealth service might intermittently fail due to an invalid memory free operation, and restart. You see core.pschealthd.* files in the /storage/core partition.

This issue is resolved in this release.

The SNMP monitoring tool reports hrMemorySize OID as zero

The SNMP monitoring tool might not correctly report the hrMemorySize OID as zero in the HOST-RESOURCES-MIB.

This issue is resolved in this release.

File-based backup by using the Virtual Appliance Management Interface and the NFS protocol fails with an error

In the Virtual Appliance Management Interface, you might see an error such as Access Denied while scheduling a file-based backup of the vCenter Server

Appliance by using the NFS protocol. The error appears at the NFS mount point.

This issue is resolved in this release.

If an OVF URL is not accessible by the proxy server in your vCenter Server system, OVF deployment might fail

If an OVF URL is not accessible by the proxy server in your vCenter Server system, such as an internal HTTP/S URL in both vCenter Server or ESXi inventory, you

might not be able to deploy or export OVF templates.

This issue is resolved in this release. You can exclude both the OVF Deploy URL domain and the ESX hosts from the proxy server. To exclude ESXi hosts from the

proxy settings, in the /etc/sysconfig/proxy file you can use CIDR notations, such as 1.2.3.4/24, in the content library or netmask notations, such as

1.2.3.4/255.255.255.0. Alternatively, you can use a regex for the domain names, for example: .*.vmware.com. Use a regex, .*.vmware.com, not wild cards,

*.vmware.com.

In the vSphere Client, you cannot change the log level configuration of the vpxa service after an upgrade of your vCenter Server system

In the vSphere Client or by using API, you might not be able to change the log level configuration of the vpxa service on an ESX host due to a missing or invalid

Vpx.Vpxa.config.log.level option after an upgrade of your vCenter Server system.

This issue is resolved in this release. The vpxa service automatically sets a valid value for the Vpx.Vpxa.config.log.level option and exposes it to the vSphere

Client or an API call.

Networking Issues

Deployment of a vCenter Server Appliance by using port 5480 at stage 2 fails with unable to save IP settings error

If you use https://appliance-IP-address-or-FQDN:5480 in a Web browser, go to the vCenter Server Appliance Management Interface for stage 2 of a newly

deployed vCenter Server Appliance, and you configure a static IP or try to change the IP configuration, you see an error such as

Unable to save IP settings.

This issue is resolved in this release.

The vpxd service fails after replacing the machine SSL certificate with a custom certificate

While you replace the machine SSL certificate of you vCenter Server system with a custom certificate, the vpxd service might fail with an error by the Envoy

reverse proxy service such as:

Envoy rejected update - Error adding/updating listener edge_https_v6: Failed to load certificate chain

This issue occurs because Envoy removes new lines from the body of the custom certificate.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Security Issues

You can reset a vCenter Server system root password with an expired password

You can reset a vCenter Server system root password with an expired password, although you must not be able to use any of the last 5 passwords.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix adds complexity to the password and prevents the use of expired passwords.

Update to the Apache Tomcat server

The Apache Tomcat server is updated to version 8.5.58.

Update of the SQLite database

The SQLite database is updated to version 3.33.0.

Update of Eclipse Jetty in the vSphere Lifecycle Manager

Eclipse Jetty in the vSphere Lifecycle Manager is updated to version jetty-9.4.31.v20200723.

Update of the Jackson package

The Jackson package is updated to versions 2.10.5, 2.11.2.

Update to the Spring Framework

The Spring Framework is updated to version 4.3.29.

Server Configuration Issues

If vSphere Cluster Service agent virtual machines are placed in datastores protected by the Site Recovery Manager, migration of such datastores fails

If you deploy vSphere Cluster Service agent virtual machines on a datastore that is part of an array-based replication protection group, planned migrations of

such datastores fail, because the agent VMs do not power off.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Upgrade Issues

If you run parallel remediation of many clusters in an NSX-T Data Center-enabled environment, some services might fail

If you run parallel remediation of many clusters in an NSX-T Data Center-enabled environment by using the vSphere Lifecycle Manager, some health checks

might be skipped. During cluster remediation, health checks run at discrete points in the remediation workflow to ensure service health does not degrade. With

many remediation jobs running in parallel, some of the health check reports might fail and the health of certain services might not be considered. As a result,

such services might fail during or after the remediation.

This issue is resolved in this release. To prevent the issue, reduce the number of remediation jobs running in parallel.

If you use the latest versions of Chrome and Mozilla browsers and your vCenter Server system is of version earlier than 7.0 Update 1, you cannot export

interoperability or pre-update check reports

In the vSphere Client, after you generate either of the interoperability or pre-update check reports, the Export button in the Product Interoperability and Pre-

Update Checks panes does not work.

This issue is resolved in this release.

If your vCenter Server system HTTPS proxy settings require credentials, you cannot upload a software depot by using an HTTP URL

If your vCenter Server system HTTPS proxy settings require credentials, updates by using the vSphere Lifecycle Manager might fail, because you cannot upload

a software depot by using an HTTP URL.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Updates from vCenter Server 7.0 to 7.0 Update 1 fail with an error for VMware Directory service schema update failure

If the domain functional level (DFL) of the VMware Directory schema is 4 and it contains a legacy schema, updates to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1 from 7.0 fail

during the pre-check stage.

In the PatchRunner.log file, you see similar logs:

2020-08-07T13:49:37.058092+00:00 info vmdird t@139837142824768: Domain Functional Level (4)

This issue occurs mostly in environments where a vCenter Server with an external Platform Services Controller is upgraded from vCenter Server 6.5.x to 6.7.x to

7.0, and then updated to 7.0 Update 1.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vCenter Server and vSphere Client Issues

In the vSphere Client, you see wrong labels for Privileges of Site Recovery Manager users

In the vSphere Client, you see wrong labels for Privileges when setting up Roles for Site Recovery Manager users.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vSAN Issues

You can provision any entity with a vSAN Host Affinity policy

The vSAN Host Affinity storage policy option requires VMware validation to ensure proper deployment. However, no restrictions exist to limit the provisioning of

entities with the vSAN Host Affinity policy to only such that meet certain criteria. For example, vSAN File Services agent VMs and first-class disks (FCDs) created

for Path Selection Plug-in (PSP) applications. This fix makes sure you can use a vSAN Host Affinity policy only in the following scenarios:

1. A vSAN File Services agent virtual machine is provisioned with FileService Host Affinity policy

2. An FCD is provisioned with a non FileService Host Affinity policy

3. Only when config.vpxd.vsan.hostaffinity.enable=true and config.vpxd.vsan.persistenceservice.enable=false

This issue is resolved in this release.

vSphere HA and Fault Tolerance Issues

Changes to local user accounts and the root account password are not synced between vCenter Server High Availability nodes

In a vCenter Server High Availability environment, creating or modifying local user accounts, or updating the root account password, is not replicated to the

passive node.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues

A vCenter Server system unexpectedly powers off without a backtrace

A vCenter Server system might unexpectedly power off when a thread of the VMware Service Lifecycle Manager service becomes unresponsive due to a system

failure or when a process failure, such as a disk I/O error, occurs. However, the VMware Service Lifecycle Manager does not log a specific message for the failure.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix enables a reboot instead of a shutdown of the vCenter Server system in case of a system or process failure to make

sure you can review logs for the root cause after the reboot.

Known Issues

The known issues are grouped as follows.

Upgrade Issues

Known Issues from Prior Releases

Upgrade Issues

vCenter Server system upgrades fail in the pre-check stage

Upgrades of your vCenter Server system might fail in the pre-check stage due to a limit in the authorization (Authz) connections. In the /var/log/vmware/vpxd-

svcs/vpxd-svcs*.log file you see entries such as:

Session count for user [after add]: <DOMAIN-NAME>\machine-xxxx is 200

Session limit reached for user: <DOMAIN-NAME>\machine-xxxx with 200 sessions.

You might also see delayed response from the vSphere Client to load the inventory.

Workaround: Restart vmware-vpxd-svcs in your vCenter Server system by using the command service-control --restart vmware-vpxd-svcs. Use the command

only when no other activity runs in the vCenter Server system to avoid any interruptions to the workflow. For more information, see VMware knowledge base

article 81953.

You can reset a vCenter Server system root password with an expired password

You can reset a vCenter Server system root password with an expired password, although you must not be able to use any of the last 5 passwords.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix adds complexity to the password and prevents the use of expired passwords.

Networking Issues

You cannot detect uncorrected networking errors and take necessary corrective action

vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3l adds five physical NIC statistics, droppedRx, droppedTx, errorsRx, RxCRCErrors and errorsTx, to the hostd.log file at /var/run/log/hostd.log

to enable you detect uncorrected networking errors and take necessary corrective action.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vSphere HA and Fault Tolerance Issues

Changes to local user accounts and the root account password are not synced between vCenter Server High Availability nodes

In a vCenter Server High Availability environment, creating or modifying local user accounts, or updating the root account password, might not be replicated to

the passive node.

This issue is resolved in this release.

A vCenter Server system unexpectedly powers off without a backtrace

A vCenter Server system might unexpectedly power off when a thread of the VMware Service Lifecycle Manager service becomes unresponsive due to a system

failure or when a process failure, such as a disk I/O error, occurs. However, the VMware Service Lifecycle Manager does not log a specific message for the failure.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix enables a reboot instead of a shutdown of the vCenter Server system in case of a system or process failure to make

sure you can review logs for the root cause after the reboot.

Miscellaneous Issues

The SNMP agent might intermittently stop responding and you lose system monitoring

A rare memory leak condition might cause the SNMP agent to stop responding and fail to restart. As a result, you lose system monitoring.

This issue is resolved in this release.

ESXi host loses connectivity to a vCenter Server system and cannot reconnect

An ESXi host might intermittently lose connectivity to a vCenter Server system and fail to reconnect. In the/var/log/vmkwarning.log file you can see a message

similar to:

2020-08-01T09:05:00.648Z cpu44:2715061)WARNING: Heap: 3855: Could not allocate 2621440 bytes for dynamic heap userRes-1. Request returned Admission check failed

for memory resource.

This issue occurs when vSphere DRS reserves all memory of the virtual machines on the host. As a result, the ESXi host cannot create new threads and

processes, which in turn causes the hostd or vpxa services to fail and make the host unresponsive to the vCenter Sever system, or completely disconnecting it.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure that DRS always leaves sufficient memory on the ESXi host to support the hostd or vpxa services.

Install and Upgrade Issues

In the Virtual Appliance Management Infrastructure user interface, you do not see the updated version after patching your vCenter Server system

If you use the option Stage and Install to patch your vCenter Server system without unstaging the previous version first, you still see the previous version in the

Virtual Appliance Management Infrastructure. The patch completes successfully and in the vCenter Client, and the vpxd logs, the version is correct.

This issue is resolved in this release.

In the Virtual Appliance Management Interface, you see vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1 as an option for update along with 6.7.x release builds

In the Virtual Appliance Management Interface on a vCenter Sever 6.7.x system, along with 6.7.x releases, you can also see vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1 (7.0.1),

as an available update. However, vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1 is a major upgrade path and should not list among 6.7.x release builds as a minor update path.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Virtual Machine Management Issues

If you have .vswp swap files in a virtual machine directory, you see Device or resource busy error messages when scanning all files in the directory

If you have .vswp swap files in a virtual machine directory, you see Device or resource busy error messages when scanning all files in the directory. You also see

extra I/O flow on vSAN namespace objects and a slow down in the hostd service.

The issue occurs if you attempt to open a file with .vswp extension as an object descriptor. The swap files of the VMX process and the virtual machine main

memory have the same extension .vswp, but the swap files of the VMX process must not be opened as object descriptors.

This issue is resolved in this release.

The vpxd service might fail while load balancing virtual machines on a vSphere DRS enabled cluster

If you set the TryBalanceVmsPerHost advanced option in vSphere DRS to 1, the vpxd service might fail and you need to restart it. The issue occurs when virtual

machines are unevenly distributed across ESXi hosts in a cluster and 2 hosts within that cluster have identical entitlements.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Server Configuration Issues

The vmware-statsmonitor service fails to start after a system reboot

If the Stats DB in your environment is large, the time for consistency checks might exceed the start timeout limit of the vmware-statsmonitor service. As a result,

the vmware-statsmonitor service fails to start after a system reboot.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vMotion Issues

When you migrate virtual machines to a vCenter Server that does not support the source EVC mode, the operation fails, and the target vCenter Server

machine fails

When you migrate a virtual machine from an EVC cluster by using vSphere vMotion, the operation might fail under the following conditions:

the virtual machine is compatible with ESX 5.0 or earlier (hardware version 8 or earlier)

the source vCenter Server is of newer version than the target vCenter Server, and the target vCenter Server does not support the source EVC cluster

mode.

The target vCenter Server machine fails as well.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Known Issues

The known issues are grouped as follows.

Install and Upgrade Issues

Auto Deploy and Image Builder Issues

Virtual Machine Management Issues

Known Issues from Prior Releases

Install and Upgrade Issues

NEW: After an upgrade to vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3l and later, you might see existing or new HPE VASA providers in disconnected state

If the inventory of your vCenter Server system has vSphere Virtual Volumes supported by either of HPE 3PAR StoreServ or HPE Primera VASA providers, you

might see the providers get into a disconnected state after an upgrade to vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3l or later. The issue affects 3PAR 3.3.1 MU5 storage, but

not 3PAR 3.3.1 MU3 storage.

Workaround: Upgrade to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1c and later. For upgrade compatibility, see VMware knowledge base article 67077. Alternatively, you

can restore your system to a backup prior to vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3l.

If you are not already using HPE 3PAR 3.3.1 MU5 VASA provider, postpone the VASA provider upgrade to HPE 3PAR 3.3.1 MU5 until HPE resolves the issue. For

more information, see VMware knowledge base article 83038.

Auto Deploy and Image Builder Issues

If an ESXi host machine uses UEFI firmware, you cannot use VMware vSphere Auto Deploy in a VLAN network

You might not be able to use vSphere Auto Deploy to deploy an ESXi image over a VLAN network environment when the ESXi host machine uses UEFI firmware.

UEFI Secure boot fails at the ipxe binary loading stage because the implementation of VLAN support of some UEFI firmware vendors might not fully support

iPXE.

Workaround: None

Virtual Machine Management Issues

NEW: You cannot deploy virtual machines by using a VM template after an upgrade to vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3l

After an upgrade to vCenter Server Update 6.7 3l, you cannot deploy virtual machines by using the Guest OS customization option and a VM template with

computer name longer than 15 characters. The issue only occurs if the computer name of the VM template exceeds 15 characters.

Workaround: Make sure that the computer name of the VM template has less than 15 characters. For more information, see VMware knowledge base

article 81832.
