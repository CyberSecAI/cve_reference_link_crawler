- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') due to missing sanitization or mitigation flags in the `process` variable of the `gitShallowClone` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Argument Injection (CWE-88). The `gitShallowClone` function does not properly sanitize or mitigate user-supplied input, which allows for the injection of malicious arguments into the git command.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system by injecting malicious arguments into the `git clone` command via the vulnerable function. The CVSS score indicates limited impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can pass malicious arguments to the `gitShallowClone` function. In the proof-of-concept, a malicious `--upload-pack` argument is injected to execute `touch pwn0`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs local access and the ability to call the vulnerable `gitShallowClone` function with malicious arguments.
