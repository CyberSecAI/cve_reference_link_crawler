Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2022-36534:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that Syncovery allows users to execute arbitrary commands or scripts before or after running a profile. The software does not properly sanitize or validate these commands, allowing for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Command Injection:** The software fails to prevent the injection of arbitrary commands into the pre/post-execution fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running Syncovery.
- **Full System Compromise:** Because Syncovery runs with root privileges by default, successful exploitation leads to a complete compromise of the server, granting the attacker root access.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Authenticated Remote Attack:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials for the Syncovery web GUI.
- **Malicious Payload Injection:** The attacker injects malicious commands within the "Job_ExecuteBefore" or "Job_ExecuteAfter" parameters of the profile settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have valid user credentials to access the Syncovery web interface.
- The attacker must be able to modify profile settings.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable parameters are `Job_ExecuteBefore` and `Job_ExecuteAfter` located in the `post_profilesettings.php` script.
- An example is given of using a PHP reverse shell to demonstrate the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
The provided content also includes details of other vulnerabilities found in Syncovery, specifically:
