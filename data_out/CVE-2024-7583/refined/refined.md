Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `formApPortalOneKeyAuth` function of the Tenda i22 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Overflow:** The `formApPortalOneKeyAuth` function copies data received in a POST request's `data` parameter to a stack-allocated buffer (`v19`) using `strcpy` or `sprintf`. Because there is no size check on the received data, an overly long `data` parameter will overwrite adjacent memory on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By sending a specially crafted POST request with a large `data` parameter, an attacker can overwrite the stack, potentially leading to:
  - Denial of service (DoS) through crashing the device.
  - Arbitrary code execution, if the attacker can precisely control the overwritten memory locations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/apPortalOneKeyAuth` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device. This likely means the attacker must be on the same network as the device or have the ability to route traffic to it.
- No authentication is mentioned, indicating that this vulnerability might be exploitable without valid credentials.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) Python script demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by sending a POST request with a large payload.
- The affected firmware version is `i22 V1.0.0.3(4687)`.
