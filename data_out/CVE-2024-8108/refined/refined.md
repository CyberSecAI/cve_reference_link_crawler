### CVE-2024-8108
Based on the provided information, this CVE relates to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the "Share This Image" WordPress plugin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `alignment` parameter within the plugin's Gutenberg block implementation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access (or higher) to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- When a user accesses a page with injected scripts, the scripts will execute within their browser.
- This could lead to various malicious actions, including but not limited to, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via the `alignment` parameter when creating or editing a "Sharing Buttons" block using the Gutenberg editor.
- An attacker injects malicious script code via this parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to be able to create or edit pages using the Gutenberg editor.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `includes/modules/gutenberg/sti-gutenberg-buttons.js`, specifically when the `alignment` attribute is being used in the `AlignmentToolbar` component.
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the plugin up to and including 2.01.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.02 of the plugin.
- The plugin's `class-sti-gutenberg-init.php` is referenced, but the vulnerability is in the javascript file `sti-gutenberg-buttons.js` and is related to how attributes are handled within the javascript context.
- The Wordfence article includes a CVSS score of 6.4 (Medium) with the vector string of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N`.
