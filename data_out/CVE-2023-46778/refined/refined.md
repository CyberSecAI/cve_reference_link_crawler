{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress Auto Limit Posts Reloaded plugin <= 2.5 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "CSRF attacks can be executed by tricking a user into clicking a malicious link or loading a malicious webpage, which in turn forces the user's browser to send crafted requests to the vulnerable application. This typically occurs when the attacker leverages a user's existing authenticated session.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated; they need to trick a higher-privileged user into executing a request. Unauthenticated is stated as required privilege but this refers to the attacker's lack of requirement to log into the vulnerable site."
