- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow occurs in the `security_decrypt_password` function within `libzebra.so.0.0.0` due to the `ys_aes_decrypt` function writing data into a fixed-size stack buffer (`decrypted_tmp`) without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121). The `ys_aes_decrypt` function writes decrypted data into a fixed-size stack buffer without checking the size of the decrypted output, potentially overflowing the buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can overwrite stack memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered via a specially crafted HTTP request to the `/cgi` endpoint. Specifically, the `yruo_usermanagement` "core" and "set" function can be used to send malicious input within the "old_password", "new_password", or "confirm_password" parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be authenticated to send the malicious HTTP request.
