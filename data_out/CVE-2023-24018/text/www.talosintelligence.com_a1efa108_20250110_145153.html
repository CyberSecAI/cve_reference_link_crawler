# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1715

## Milesight UR32L libzebra.so security\_decrypt\_password buffer overflow vulnerability

##### July 6, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-24018

##### SUMMARY

A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the libzebra.so.0.0.0 security\_decrypt\_password functionality of Milesight UR32L v32.3.0.5. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to a buffer overflow. An authenticated attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Milesight UR32L v32.3.0.5

##### PRODUCT URLS

UR32L - <https://www.milesight-iot.com/cellular/router/ur32l/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

8.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-121 - Stack-based Buffer Overflow

##### DETAILS

The Milesight UR32L is an industrial cellular router. The router features include support for multiple VPNs, a router console shell, firewall and many others.

The Milesight router offers several functionalities through the `/cgi` endpoint. The “core” functionality we are considering is called `yruo_usermanagement`. In this “core” there is one function called “set”. This API is used to change user related settings (for example, changing the password of a specific user). Following the `vtysh_ubus`’s `usermng_set` function, responsible for managing the “set” functionality:

```
    void usermng_set(undefined4 param_1,undefined4 param_2,undefined4 param_3,undefined4 param_4,
                    undefined4 *param_5)

    {
    [... variable declaration ...]

    [... variable initialization ...]
    [...]
    value_obj = (void *)blob_memdup(tb_outer.values);
    data = (void *)blobmsg_data(value_obj);
    values_obj_n = blobmsg_data_len(value_obj);
    blobmsg_parse(usermng_set_value_policy,7,tb_inner,data,values_obj_n);
    [...]
    if (((tb_inner[4] != (blob_attr *)0x0) && (tb_inner[5] != (blob_attr *)0x0)) &&
     (tb_inner[6] != (blob_attr *)0x0)) {
        tmp_encrypted = blobmsg_get_string((char *)tb_inner[4]);                                        [1]
        security_decrypt_password(tmp_encrypted,old_password_decrypted,0x20);
        tmp_encrypted = blobmsg_get_string((char *)tb_inner[5]);                                        [2]
        security_decrypt_password(tmp_encrypted,new_password_decrypted,0x20);
        tmp_encrypted = blobmsg_get_string((char *)tb_inner[6]);                                        [3]
        security_decrypt_password(tmp_encrypted,confirm_password_decypted,0x20);
    }
    [...]
    }

```

The function uses the `blobmsg` structures for parsing the received data. Each entry in `tb_inner` represents a specific parameter in the request’s JSON data. Following an example of a JSON input that could be used for this API. Note that this request must be sent by an authenticated user.

```
{
    "id": 60,
    "execute": 10,
    "core": "yruo_usermanagement",
    "function": "set",
    "values": [
        {
            "base": "security",
            "index": "index",
            "value": {
                "old_password": "264ISdU4Pqdnyksk0N1ssQ==",
                "new_password": "nW+tKhD05KjqWkOYjjz/xg==",
                "confirm_password": "luDNLgAE+s9LzVRK0ed8/Ujh/E+mduZm5GBcH/UVt/c="
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

The code at `[1]` parses the `old_password` parameter, the code at `[2]` parses `new_password` and the code at `[3]` parses `confirm_password`. All three parameters are AES-encrypted Base64-encoded. Indeed, the three parameters are passed to the `security_decrypt_password` function that will Base64 decode and AES decrypt them.

Following the `libzebra.so.0.0.0`’s `security_decrypt_password` function:

```
void security_decrypt_password(byte *enc_string,char *dec_string,size_t out_len)

{
    [... variable declaration ...]

    [... variable initialization ...]
    encoded_len = strlen(encoded_string);
    b64_decoded = base64_decode(encoded_string,encoded_len,&b64_decoded_len);
    decrypt_len = ys_aes_decrypt(b64_decoded,b64_decoded_len,AES_key,AES_IV,decrypted_tmp);             [4]
    decrypted_tmp[decrypt_len] = 0;
    [...]
    strncpy(dec_string,(char *)decrypted_tmp,out_len);                                                  [5]
    [...]
}

```

The function takes three parameters:
- `enc_string` the encoded input string
- `dec_string` the output buffer, where the result will be written
- `out_len` the len of the `dec_string` output buffer

This function will call the `base64_decode` function to Base64 decode the `enc_string` string. Then the `ys_aes_decrypt` function is called, at `[4]`, and will decrypt the Base64 decoded string into the `decrypted_tmp` stack buffer. Eventually the `strncpy` at `[5]` is reached and, at most, `out_len` bytes are copied from `decrypted_tmp` to the `dec_string` buffer.

A stack-based buffer overflow exists during the execution of the `ys_aes_decrypt` function. Indeed, it will decrypt the arbitrarily long `enc_string` into the `decrypted_tmp` stack buffer that is fixed in length.

##### VENDOR RESPONSE

Since the maintainer of this software did not release a patch during the 90 day window specified in our policy, we have now decided to release the information regarding this vulnerability, to make users of the software aware of this problem.
