Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**1. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) via Relational Mappings**

*   **Root Cause:** The `populate` function in the Content API does not validate if the querying user is authorized to access the data being fetched through relational mappings. It blindly uses `_id` and `_model` parameters provided in the request to retrieve data. This allows a user with write access to a collection to inject relational mappings and read data from other collections, for which they do not have access, by manipulating the `_id` and `_model` attributes. Moreover, the application does not validate the type of attributes in a user's JSON request. This allows to modify the BSON structure that is stored on the database.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Lack of authorization checks on relational data access.
    *   Insecure usage of user-provided data in database queries.
    *   Lack of input validation/sanitization
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data from other collections.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Manipulating JSON requests when creating or updating items in a collection that has relational fields.
    *   Modifying the BSON structure of an entry by injecting `_id` and `_model` attributes into fields.
    *  Sending a GET request with `?populate=1` to trigger the vulnerable populate function.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Write access to a collection that allows public read and write access.
    *   Ability to craft HTTP requests with modified JSON payloads
    *   Knowledge of target collection names and ability to predict MongoDB Object IDs.

**2. CSRF Vulnerabilities in Admin Portal**

*   **Root Cause:** The admin portal API lacks CSRF token validation, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Missing CSRF token validation on admin API endpoints.
    *   Dangerous default settings for file uploads.
    *  Lack of file type validation in the `unzip` function.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **CSRF to XSS:** By uploading a malicious SVG file through the Assets API, an attacker can exploit a race condition to inject arbitrary Javascript.
    *   **CSRF to RCE:** By uploading a malicious zip file, an attacker can exploit the `unzip` function to write a PHP payload to the filesystem.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Tricking an authenticated administrator into clicking a malicious link or visiting a website controlled by the attacker.
    *   Submitting forms using `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` Content-Type instead of `application/json` to bypass checks and exploit the `unzip` function.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Ability to trick an authenticated administrator into visiting a malicious website or clicking a malicious link.
    * Ability to craft HTTP requests with modified Content-Type headers.

**Additional Information:**

*   The blog post provides more in-depth technical details than a typical CVE description.
*   It includes proof-of-concept (POC) code and detailed steps for exploiting the vulnerabilities.
*   The post also discusses insecure default settings and lack of documentation for hardening the CMS.
*   The patch for the IDOR vulnerability is not fully effective due to an edge case where the user's role is not validated.
