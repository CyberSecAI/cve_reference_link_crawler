Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-3573:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command, specifically within an HTTP POST request related to font configuration operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary OS commands due to insufficient input sanitization when processing a font configuration related HTTP POST request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can grant a remote attacker full access to the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is carried out remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request related to font configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs low privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the affected device.

**Summary:**
In PHOENIX CONTACTs WP 6xxx series web panels in versions prior to 4.0.10 a remote attacker with low privileges may use a command injection in a HTTP POST request releated to font configuration operations to gain full access to the device.
