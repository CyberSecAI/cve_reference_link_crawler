Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-51712:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) logging subsystem handles output when the `TFM_SP_LOG_RAW_ENABLED` configuration option is enabled. This option uses an SVC call to print logging messages. The SVC handler operates with high privilege and unrestricted memory access. Because of this, a malicious Application Root of Trust (ARoT) partition can exploit this to output arbitrary memory contents by crafting its own SVC call to the logging function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient access control:** The logging subsystem lacks proper checks to verify if the data being logged belongs to the current partition.
*   **Unrestricted memory access in SVC handler:** The SVC handler, responsible for logging, has full memory access, enabling it to print data from any memory location.
*  **Bypass of MPU protection**: While a direct call to the logging function from ARoT is blocked by the Memory Protection Unit (MPU), a crafted SVC call circumvents this protection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A malicious ARoT partition can read and expose any part of the system's memory to the standard output (stdio) interface. This could reveal sensitive information, including secrets, keys, or data from Protected Root of Trust (PRoT) partitions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious ARoT Partition:** The attack is initiated by an ARoT partition that is compromised or designed to be malicious.
*   **Crafted SVC Call:** The malicious ARoT creates a custom SVC call that invokes the logging function with arbitrary memory addresses and data to be printed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have control of, or be able to execute code within, an ARoT partition.
*   The target system must be running in IPC mode with PSA isolation level 2 or higher.
*   The vulnerable `TFM_SP_LOG_RAW_ENABLED` configuration option must be enabled.

**Mitigation:**

The provided text describes the mitigation as follows:
*   Implement a memory check within the logging function of the SVC handler by calling `tfm_hal_memory_check()`. This check ensures that the data being logged belongs to the current partition, blocking any attempt to log data outside its boundary.
*   If the memory check fails, call `tfm_core_panic()` to halt the system.
