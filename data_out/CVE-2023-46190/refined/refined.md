- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Novo-Map plugin for WordPress versions 1.1.2 and below is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force a higher-privileged user to perform unwanted actions while authenticated. The specific impact may vary.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a malicious request crafted by an attacker, which is then sent to a vulnerable user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged in user to execute the crafted request. The user needs to have sufficient permissions to perform the unwanted actions that the attacker intends. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
