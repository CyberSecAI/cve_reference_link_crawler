In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFC: digital: fix possible memory leak in digital_tg_listen_mdaa()

'params' is allocated in digital_tg_listen_mdaa(), but not free when
digital_send_cmd() failed, which will cause memory leak. Fix it by
freeing 'params' if digital_send_cmd() return failed.
