The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47443.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory leak exists in the `digital_tg_listen_mdaa()` function in the Linux kernel's NFC digital core driver.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `params` variable is allocated using `kzalloc` in `digital_tg_listen_mdaa()`. If `digital_send_cmd()` fails, the allocated memory for `params` is not freed, leading to a memory leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Repeatedly triggering the vulnerable code path could lead to memory exhaustion and potentially impact system stability.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could trigger the `digital_tg_listen_mdaa()` function through an NFC interaction that leads to a failure in `digital_send_cmd()`. This can be achieved by sending crafted NFC commands to the target device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to interact with the target device via NFC. They need to be in proximity and send specific commands to trigger the vulnerability.
