Simple, clean plugin that does everything it should – flexible, styleable, ability to link directly to an accordion and have it open. Solid support.

Easy to use and does what it is supposed to do – gives you a collapsible block of content.
Hate to see it go away. 🙁

A plugin that’s both simple and powerful, with responsive and friendly support. What more could you ask for? Thank you 🙂

A recent release cause a issue when HTML is used within the plugin shortcodes. I quickly found a relevant support thread that the developer was actively replying to. Weighed in as one of the fixes partially worked for me and @twinpictures rolled out another update at lighting speed and we are good to go! That being said, I plan to see if the developer offers any other plugins I might be able to use considering how easy they are to reach.
