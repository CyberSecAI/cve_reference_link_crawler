[Kalium](https://kaliumtheme.com/#view-demos) is constantly being updated with new features, bug fixes, and adjustments. We recommend you to read this changelog for every update release. Also please consider deactivating [caching plugins](https://documentation.laborator.co/kb/kalium/how-to-clear-cache/) temporarily to avoid the caching of old markup when you [update the theme](https://documentation.laborator.co/kb/kalium/updating-the-theme/).

We are always proactive in preventing security issues, however nobody can assume they will never come up.

This is why we highly recommend to stay up to date with each new theme version and plugins.
