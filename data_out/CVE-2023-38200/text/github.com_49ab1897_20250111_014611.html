### @flozilla **[flozilla](/flozilla)** commented [Jul 11, 2023](#issue-1799659038)

This PR fixes an issue in the Keylime Registrar that allows performing a DoS by opening a single connection to its HTTPS interface. As long as the connection is open, the Register is blocked and cannot serve any further clients, which prevents the Register from working as expected.

The issue happens as Python SSL sockets block by default, unlike regular sockets. To fix this, a non-blocking SSL handshake is implemented. The fix is inspired by Python's documentation on non-blocking SSL sockets (<https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#notes-on-non-blocking-sockets>).

A cleaner solution would be using the tornado framework in the Registrar (like in the Verifier). However, this requires several changes to the Registrar code.

Sorry, something went wrong.
