**CVE-2024-29840**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from broken access control within the Evolution Controller software. Specifically, the DESKTOP\_EDIT\_USER\_GET\_PIN\_FIELDS function lacks proper authorization checks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The application fails to restrict access to sensitive user PIN data, allowing unauthorized retrieval.
    *  **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200):** The lack of access control leads to the disclosure of user PIN values.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can retrieve the PIN values of any user, potentially gaining unauthorized access to systems or areas protected by these PINs.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed through the web interface of the Evolution Controller application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need to authenticate and can exploit this vulnerability remotely via the network.
