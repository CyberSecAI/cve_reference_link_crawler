Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Local File Inclusion (LFI)

**Affected Software:** WordPress NewsCard Theme

**Vulnerable Versions:** <= 1.3

**Fixed Version:** 1.4

**Root Cause:** The theme allows inclusion of local files. The specific mechanism is not detailed, but the nature of LFI implies that user-controlled input is used, directly or indirectly, to specify a file path that is included by the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Local File Inclusion:** The application is vulnerable to LFI. This means an attacker can force the application to include and potentially execute arbitrary files from the server's local file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files, including configuration files that may contain database credentials or other secrets, as well as potentially reading parts of the source code of other PHP files.
*   **Potential Database Takeover:** If database credentials are exposed, attackers can gain complete control of the database.
*   **Full System Compromise**: Depending on the web server configuration, this might be escalated to a full system compromise if the attacker finds a way to execute arbitrary code via the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network via HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any prior authentication or specific privileges, making it easily exploitable by anyone with network access to the vulnerable website.

**Additional Details:**
*   **CVSS Score:** 7.5 (High)
*   **OWASP Top 10:** A3: Injection
*   **Patchstack vPatch:** Patchstack has a virtual patch available to mitigate the vulnerability.
