Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the described commit:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The commit addresses a potential HTML injection vulnerability in Froxlor, a server management panel. The vulnerability stemmed from how error messages, specifically related to failed email sending, were constructed. The original code used `str_replace` to insert user-supplied email addresses into error messages, but did not properly sanitize the input, allowing for possible injection of malicious HTML code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**  The core weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization before including user-provided data within output displayed to the user. Specifically the code was using `str_replace` to include an email in a string without escaping it first. This allows for a malicious email address to inject HTML.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious HTML into the error messages displayed to users. This could be used for various attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, phishing attempts, or other malicious activities within the context of the Froxlor application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the email parameter, likely the customer email parameter, used when generating the error messages. A specifically crafted malicious email address would be the vehicle for the injection.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be in a position to trigger the specific error condition in which the injected parameter would be used. Based on the commit, it specifically relates to the "errorsendingmail" error condition.

**Technical Details:**

*   The commit modifies three files: `index.php`, `lng/english.lng.php`, and `lng/german.lng.php`.
*   The vulnerability is located in `index.php`. Before the fix, the code used `str_replace` to insert the user-provided email into the `$lng['error']['errorsendingmail']` string.
*   The fix removed the dynamic injection of the user-provided email into the error message in `index.php`, instead using a generic error message `errorsendingmailpub` that does not contain user input. This avoids the HTML injection issue.
*   The changes to the language files, `english.lng.php` and `german.lng.php`, added a new generic error message `errorsendingmailpub`, and changed the old one `errorsendingmail`, that no longer includes any user input.

**Additional Notes:**

* The commit message "fix still possible html injection" clearly indicates the nature of the vulnerability.
* The provided content includes the code diff that shows the exact changes to fix the vulnerability.

The commit prevents the injection by not using user input in the error message itself. Instead a generic message is shown.
