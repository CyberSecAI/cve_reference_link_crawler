**Elasticsearch Improper Authorization in the Remote Cluster Security API key based security model (ESA-2024-07)**

It was identified by the Elastic engineering team that the API key based security model for [Remote Cluster Security](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/remote-clusters.html#remote-clusters-security-models), which is currently in Beta, is affected by an improper authorization issue. A malicious user with a valid API key for a remote cluster configured to use new Remote Cluster Security could read arbitrary documents from any index on the remote cluster, if they use the Elasticsearch custom transport protocol to issue requests with the target index ID, the shard ID and the document ID. None of Elasticsearch REST API endpoints are affected by this issue.

**Affected Versions:**

Elasticsearch versions on or after `8.10.0` and before `8.13.0`

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

The issue is resolved in version `8.13.0`

**Severity:** CVSSv3: 4.4(Medium) - [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-23451
