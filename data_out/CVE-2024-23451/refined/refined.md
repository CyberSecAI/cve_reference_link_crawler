- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authorization in the API key-based security model for Remote Cluster Security.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The API key based security model for Remote Cluster Security (Beta) does not properly authorize access, allowing a user with a valid API key to bypass intended restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user with a valid API key can read arbitrary documents from any index on the remote cluster.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited using the Elasticsearch custom transport protocol by crafting requests with the target index ID, shard ID, and document ID. It is not exploitable via REST API endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs a valid API key for a remote cluster configured to use the vulnerable Remote Cluster Security feature. The attacker must also have the ability to use the custom Elasticsearch transport protocol to issue requests.
