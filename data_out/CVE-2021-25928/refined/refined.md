The provided content relates to CVE-2021-25928.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `expand()` function in the `safe-obj` npm module does not validate the type of object before assigning a value to a property. Specifically, it doesn't check if the provided path targets a property of the object itself or its prototype.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to manipulate the `__proto__` property of JavaScript objects. By passing a crafted path to the `expand()` function, an attacker can inject or modify properties on the prototype, which affects all objects that inherit from that prototype.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `expand()` function lacks sufficient input validation, especially on the "path" argument which allows injecting `__proto__` and modifying prototype properties.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By manipulating prototype properties, an attacker can cause unexpected behavior or errors in the application, leading to a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Prototype pollution vulnerabilities can potentially be chained to achieve remote code execution. If an application uses the polluted prototype properties, it could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker provides a crafted `path` argument to the vulnerable `expand()` function in the `safe-obj` module. This path contains the `__proto__` property, allowing the attacker to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `expand()` function of the vulnerable `safe-obj` module.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or user interaction.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects `safe-obj` versions 1.0.0 through 1.0.2.
- The proof of concept (PoC) code provided demonstrates how to pollute the prototype using the `__proto__.polluted` path.
- There is no fix version available, and the suggested remediations are:
  - Freezing objects to prevent property modifications.
  - Validating JSON input using schema validation to only allow predefined attributes.
  - Changing the objects to not have prototype association by using "Object.create".
- The vulnerability has a high CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 due to its network attack vector, low complexity, lack of required privileges or user interaction, and high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-1321 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes).
