- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from how IBM Concert cookie settings are configured, making the software susceptible to session hijacking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core issue is insecure cookie settings, which allow attackers to potentially gain control of user sessions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation would result in session hijacking, where an attacker could impersonate a legitimate user and gain unauthorized access to the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting the application's insecure cookie handling. This likely involves intercepting or manipulating cookies used for session management.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be positioned where they can intercept or manipulate network traffic to exploit this. This could be through man-in-the-middle attacks or by exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow access to session cookies.
