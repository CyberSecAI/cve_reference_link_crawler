### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `cookie_notice_options[refuse_code_head]` parameter.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin allows injection of arbitrary web scripts via the vulnerable parameter.

### Impact of exploitation
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute when a user accesses the `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=cookie-notice` page within the WordPress admin panel. This could allow the attacker to perform actions within the admin panel as the user.

### Attack vectors
- The attack vector is through the `cookie_notice_options[refuse_code_head]` parameter within the WordPress admin interface.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with administrative privileges or above.
- The attacker requires access to the WordPress admin panel.
- Multi-site installations or installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled are required to be vulnerable.
