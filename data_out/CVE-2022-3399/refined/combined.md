### Description

The Cookie Notice & Compliance for GDPR / CCPA plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'cookie\_notice\_options[refuse\_code\_head]' parameter in versions up to, and including, 2.4.17.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative privileges and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the injected /wp-admin/admin.php?page=cookie-notice page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered\_html has been disabled.
