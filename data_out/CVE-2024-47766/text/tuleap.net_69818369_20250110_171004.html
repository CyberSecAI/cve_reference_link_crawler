Original Submission
### Impact

Administrators of project can access the content of trackers with permissions restrictions of project they are members of but not admin via the cross tracker search widget.

CVSSv3.1 score: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

### Exploitation

Let's take this scenario:

* You are admin of Project 1
* In Project 2 (you are member of it) the field of one tracker is readable only by project admins
* You try to retrieve fields of trackers from both projects

`TrackersPermissionsRetriever` doesn't check the project context so as you are admin of Project 1, you are member of user group ProjectAdmin and the dao consider you can view the field.

There is the same issue for view permissions on Trackers.

The impact is located only in the Cross Tracker Search widget.
