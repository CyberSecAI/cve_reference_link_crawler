  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `delete.php` script, allowing for SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can compromise the application, access or modify sensitive data, and potentially exploit further vulnerabilities in the underlying database server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is reachable through the `id` GET parameter in the `/370project//delete.php` script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. They must also be able to authenticate into the application as an admin."
