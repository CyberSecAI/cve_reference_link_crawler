- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `stripImages` and `stripIframes` methods in Joomla's `Outputfilter` class did not properly process inputs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to improper input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by processing specific inputs through the vulnerable `stripImages` and `stripIframes` methods.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide input that is processed by these vulnerable methods, often in the context of user-supplied content.
