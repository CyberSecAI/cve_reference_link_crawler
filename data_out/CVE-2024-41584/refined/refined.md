- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The user login page of the WebUI ("wlogin.cgi") accepts the "sFormAuthStr" query string parameter, which is intended for anti-CSRF protection. However, the value of this parameter is directly reflected into the corresponding webpage without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of the "sFormAuthStr" query parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can inject arbitrary, albeit limited, JavaScript code into the user's browser when they visit the login page.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL that includes JavaScript code in the "sFormAuthStr" parameter and tricking users into accessing it through the web interface
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker would need to send a crafted URL with the malicious JavaScript code in the "sFormAuthStr" query parameter to a user.
