- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the usage of an out-of-range pointer offset in the `MC_XML_To_Message` function when processing a malformed DICOM XML file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the "CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset". The deprecated `MC_XML_To_Message` function in Merative Merge DICOM Toolkit C/C++ on Windows does not properly handle malformed DICOM XML files, leading to an out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to memory access violations, potentially causing a crash or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through processing a malformed DICOM XML file using the vulnerable `MC_XML_To_Message` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed DICOM XML file to the affected software. No special privileges are required, and the attack is local (AV:L).
