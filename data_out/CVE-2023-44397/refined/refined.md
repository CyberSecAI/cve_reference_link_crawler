- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The gateway filter in CloudExplorer Lite uses a controller with `path.startsWith` matching `/api/`, which allows for potential permission bypass.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Insecure path-based access control using `startsWith` matching instead of precise matching.
  - Insufficient authorization leading to unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass access control and gain unauthorized access to resources and functionalities exposed through the `/api/` endpoint. This could lead to information disclosure, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can send HTTP requests to paths that begin with `/api/`, bypassing intended access controls and reaching unintended resources.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable CloudExplorer Lite instance, and knowledge of the `/api/` endpoint, but no specific privileges are needed.

The provided content gives more detail than a typical CVE description by specifying the vulnerable code logic (`path.startsWith` matching), the affected endpoint (`/api/`) and a concrete example of unauthorized access (`/api/menus`).
