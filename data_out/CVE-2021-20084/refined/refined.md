Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20084:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `queryStringToJSON` function in the `jquery.sparkle.js` library. This function is intended to parse a query string or a URL into a JSON object. It uses `eval()` to process both JSON strings and parameters, which is inherently dangerous. Additionally, the function does not properly sanitize keys and values extracted from the query string, allowing for manipulation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Prototype Pollution:** The function processes query string parameters and uses them to construct a JavaScript object. Due to the lack of validation or sanitization of the parameter keys, it's possible to inject parameters that modify the prototype of the Object class. Specifically, the code that splits the keys by `.` and uses `eval` to access/create nested properties allows for the creation of properties in the `__proto__` of the resulting object via a crafted query string. This is prototype pollution.

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The use of `eval(decodeURIComponent(params))` when processing JSON strings directly exposes the application to XSS attacks. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code within a crafted JSON string in the query parameters, and the `eval()` call will execute it, potentially compromising the application or the user's session. This is made worse by the fact that the query string is not validated or sanitized before being passed to `eval`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:**  By polluting the `__proto__` object, an attacker can influence the behavior of all objects in the JavaScript application. This can lead to a variety of issues, including:
    *   Denial of service by altering object properties and causing unexpected behavior/errors.
    *   Privilege escalation by manipulating properties that the application relies on for authorization or access control.
    *   Information disclosure by altering the application's behavior to leak data.
*   **XSS:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code, an attacker can:
    *   Steal user cookies and session information.
    *   Redirect the user to malicious websites.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is the query string. An attacker can craft a malicious URL with specific query parameters that exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

An attacker only needs the ability to send a user a URL that contains the malicious query parameters. The user does not need to interact with the website beyond loading it. No special capabilities are required beyond standard web browser functionality.

**Additional Information:**

The provided content includes a proof of concept (PoC) that demonstrates how to exploit the prototype pollution vulnerability using a URL with specific query parameters.
The vulnerable code snippet from the `jquery.sparkle.js` file is also provided.
