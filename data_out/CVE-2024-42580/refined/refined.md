{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly validate or include CSRF tokens, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the `/edit_group.php` endpoint.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can modify group information, such as name and level, potentially leading to privilege escalation.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed via a malicious HTML page that sends a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting the malicious HTML page. The attacker does not need to know the user's credentials but must target a user who is already authenticated."
