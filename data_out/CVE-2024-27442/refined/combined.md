# Zimbra Collaboration Kepler 9.0.0 Patch 39 GA Release

Release Date: **February 28, 2024**

Check out the **[Security Fixes](#Security_Fixes)**, **[What's New](#What's_New)**, **[Fixed Issues](#Fixed_Issues)**, and **[Known Issues](#Known_Issues)** for this version of Zimbra Collaboration.
Please refer to the **[Patch Installation](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/9.0.0/patch_installation)** page for Patch Installation instructions.
As always, you are encouraged to tell us what you think in the Forums or open a support ticket to report issues

## Deprecation of Zimbra Server on Ubuntu 16.04

Ubuntu 16.04 End of life occurred on April 29, 2021. Zimbra will deprecate Kepler 9.0.0 support for Ubuntu 16.04 as of **December 31, 2023**. At this date, there will no longer be any patch release for Zimbra Kepler 9.0.0 on Ubuntu 16.04 operating system. We encourage all our new customer's to use **Ubuntu 20.04** for all their new installations.

For questions or guidance with upgrading your operating system please open a support case and our Support team is here to assist you.

## Changes required for SSO setup before patch upgrade

Before upgrade, if the **zimbraVirtualHostName** parameter is not set for the domains that are using SAML and SSO based login, please set by following the instructions:

```
su - zimbra
zmprov md domain_name zimbraVirtualHostName virtual_hostname

```

 **Note: Additional configuration for further hardening your Zimbra setup can be found on the [Zimbra Support Portal](https://support.zimbra.com). It is recommended that all customers consider these additional steps.**

**IMPORTANT: Zimbra OpenSSL with default FIPS Configuration**

* Please be advised that, TLS 1.2 is the minimum supported version if FIPS is being used with OpenSSL 3.0. We recommend using Zimbra with strong TLS configuration for increased security. Please follow instructions in **[Cipher-suites-wiki](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Cipher_suites)** to set correct ciphers as per current versions of openssl, nginx and postfix.

* From this patch going forward Zimbra OpenSSL will be configured to work with FIPS compliance enabled by default. You do not need to take any action, unless you run into issues, you can switch to the non-FIPS provider as follows:

* Run below commands to Enable/Disable FIPS providers on all servers.

Disable FIPS provider:

```
As root user run below commands

Take backup of openssl.cnf
cd /opt/zimbra/common/etc/ssl
cp openssl.cnf <backup-path>/openssl.cnf

Copy openssl-source.cnf file
cd /opt/zimbra/common/etc/ssl
cp openssl-source.cnf openssl.cnf

Verify that, FIPS provider is disabled:
Run below command and verify fips provider is not listed
/opt/zimbra/common/bin/openssl list --providers

As zimbra user run below commands
su - zimbra
zmcontrol restart

```

Enable FIPS provider:

```
As root user run below commands

Take backup of openssl.cnf
cd /opt/zimbra/common/etc/ssl
cp openssl.cnf <backup-path>/openssl.cnf

Copy openssl-fips.cnf file
cd /opt/zimbra/common/etc/ssl
cp openssl-fips.cnf openssl.cnf

Verify that, FIPS provider is enabled:
Run below command and verify fips provider is listed
/opt/zimbra/common/bin/openssl list --providers

As zimbra user run below commands
su - zimbra
zmcontrol restart

```

# What's New

## Package Upgrade

* The Nginx package has been upgraded to 1.24.0
## Modern Web App

**General**

* "New Email" and "Find Emails" options are displayed in the context menu for a Distribution List member when multiple members are selected.
* The event invitee selection process was enhanced to allow for choosing specific members from a distribution list (DL).
* Users now have the ability to easily drag and drop their own calendar events to a different date or time slot.
* Event invitations have been enhanced to alert users of any scheduling conflicts upon receipt of the invite.

**Mail**

* Users can now select specific or all members of a distribution list (DL) while composing an email.

**Contacts**

* “Distribution Lists” has been implemented for Contacts vertical.

# Fixed Issues

## Modern Web App

**General**

* Modern UI did not load images for some specific messages [ZBUG-3829]
* Composing mail was slower when folder pane had hundreds of folders [ZBUG-3804]
* Users were unable to rename files in Briefcase when filenames contained Chinese characters [ZBUG-3795]
* The "Reply-All" functionality worked differently in Modern and Classic UI. It has now been standardized for consistency [ZBUG-3605]

## Mobile Sync

**Rolling Upgrade - MobileSync**

* In a Rolling-upgrade environment, if a zimbra-9 user shares a calendar with zimbra-10 user, the shared calendar events are not synced on the mobile for zimbra-10 user. The issue has been fixed.

# Known Issues

* While deploying zimlets, if the following error is encountered, please refer to the **[Patch Installation](#Patch_Installation)** page to install the **zimbra-common-core-jar, zimbra-common-core-libs, zimbra-mbox-store-libs** packages in a particular order and re-deploy the zimlets.

```
/opt/zimbra/bin/zmjava: line 59: /bin/java: No such file or directory
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/logging/log4j/core/appender/ConsoleAppender$Target

       ... 1 more

```

* From Kepler-Patch-25 onwards, customers using SSO will need to update `zimbraVirtualHostName` attribute for the domains. Please refer to the  **[instructions](#Changes_required_for_SSO_setup_before_patch_upgrade)** to update the attribute.

* With OpenJDK 17, weaker Kerberos encryption types like 3DES and RC4 have now been disabled by default. This can cause SPNEGO auth to fail if described encryption types are being used. We recommend using stronger encryption types like AES256.

To get SPNEGO auth working with weak encryption types, weak encryption can be enabled by setting the **allow\_weak\_crypto** property to true in the krb5.conf configuration file. Please follow below instructions:

1. In **/opt/zimbra/jetty\_base/etc/krb5.ini.in -> [libdefaults]** section, set **allow\_weak\_crypto = true**

2. Restart mailboxd service:

```
su - zimbra
zmmailboxdctl restart

```

# Fixed Issues

## Zimbra Collaboration

* When doing a migration that has large drive data to be imported, if the time taken exceeds more than 12 hours, the data import will fail. For such migrations, it is recommended to increase the value of zimbraAdminAuthTokenLifetime to 24h. For more details, please refer to the \*Importing Zimbra Drive Data\* section in the Migration guides.
* Fixed an issue with the Europe/Berlin timezone where the recurring appointments that were created during daylight savings showed one hour early after the daylight savings finished. [ZBUG-3699]
* In some cases, the Content-Type of a PDF file was incorrectly identified as Text and it was not displayed correctly. The issue has been fixed. Please note that after applying this patch, only the new PDF received in the email will be displayed correctly. [ZBUG-3601]
* When using the ActiveSync protocol on the Samsung Email app, users were not able to send emails. The issue has been fixed. Attribute zimbraMobileForceSamsungProtocol25 will have to be set to TRUE and users will need to reconfigure the account on the mobile. [ZBUG-3569]

## Modern Web App

# Things to Know Before Upgrading

**Important Upgrade Instructions for Daffodil v10 version older than build 10.0.0\_GA\_4452**

If you are currently using the Beta version build of Daffodil v10 (10.0.0\_GA\_4452), please follow these upgrade instructions:

* Upgrade to the latest GA Version build 10.0.0\_GA\_4518: It is crucial to first upgrade to the latest GA version before proceeding with any further updates. This latest GA release includes essential updates, including modifications to the database schema and various other feature improvements. Upgrade will also install latest 10.0 patch packages.

By following this upgrade path, you ensure that your system is properly updated, incorporating the necessary database schema changes and other critical updates introduced in the latest GA build.

**Please review the following information to decide if Zimbra Daffodil (v10) is suitable for you.**

* Zimbra Touch Client, Zimbra Mobile Client, and Zimbra HTML (Standard) Client are no longer a part of Zimbra starting from Version 9.0.0.
* A Zimbra Network Edition license is required to use Zimbra Daffodil (v10).
* The customizations implemented for SAML and SPNEGO will be overridden during an upgrade. It is recommended to backup these configurations before upgrading the server.
* In case of rolling upgrades, if some mailstore nodes are upgraded to zimbra-10 and some mailstore nodes are on Zimbra 9.0.x or Zimbra 8.8.15 then, `zimbraReverseProxyUpstreamLoginServers` should only contain the list of Zimbra 10.0.0 mailboxes. If this is not followed then in some cases, users on zimbra-10 mailstore nodes will not be able to see Modern Web App after login.
* Zimbra (v10) continues to support two versions of Zimbra Web Client -- Modern and Classic.
  + To know more about the highlights of the Modern Web App, please refer to [Introducing the Modern Web Application](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_9/Modern_Web_App)
  + The Classic Web App offers the same functionality as the Advanced Web Client in Zimbra version 8.8.15.
  + Existing customized themes, logo branding changes, and crontab changes are incompatible with, and hence do not reflect in the Modern Web App. Branding needs to be re-configured to work with the Modern Web App. The Modern Web App does not currently support themes. Please refer to the [Customizing Modern Web App](https://zimbra.github.io/documentation/zimbra-10/adminguide.html#_customizing_modern_web_app) section of Admin Guide for more information related to configuration.
  + Zimlets are supported on both the Web Clients.
  + Zimlets that work with the Classic Web App are incompatible with the Modern Web App. And due to technology changes, there is no way to migrate the Zimlets from the Classic Web App to the Modern Web App or vice-versa.

* For Non-NG setups, recommendations when using mailbox move (through **zmmboxmove** utility) on Rolling-Upgrade environment:
  + Always take full backup \*before\* doing zmmboxmove.
  + If using Storage Management with primary and secondary storage as Internal, then set `zimbraMailboxMoveSkipBlobs` and `zimbraMailboxMoveSkipHsmBlobs` attributes to **FALSE** before doing **zmmboxmove**.
  + Always recommended to run HSM and move blobs to current primary/secondary volumes in case of multiple primary/secondary volumes present in the system before doing `zmmboxmove`.
  + `zmmboxmove` command should be run from Zimbra (v10) mailbox server.

After you review the tasks in this section, please go to [Upgrade Instructions](https://zimbra.github.io/documentation/zimbra-10/upgrade.html#_upgrade_instructions).

# Known Issues

* When upgrading to Zimbra 10 using the rolling upgrade mechanism, if a user on Zimbra 10 shares a Briefcase file with a user on Zimbra 9, then while UI will display a 'Permission denied' error to the user on Zimbra 10, the user on Zimbra 9 still ends up receiving an email that the file has been shared. Even though the mail is received by the Zimbra 9 user, they will not be able to access the file, as the file sharing feature is not available in Zimbra 9.
* During Rolling Upgrade to Zimbra 10, a user on Zimbra 9 may share a Briefcase folder with a Zimbra 10 user. However, since files were not shared with Zimbra 10 user, the files within the shared folder are not accessible to the Zimbra 10 users.
* During Rolling Upgrade to Zimbra 10 from Zimbra 9/8.x having NG modules installed, when a Zimbra 9/8.x user creates new files from Briefcase, it results in a error "TypeError: g is null".
* During Rolling Upgrade to Zimbra 10, a user on Zimbra 10 may share a file with a Zimbra 9 user. However, Zimbra 9 user will not be able to access the file from the shared URL.
* Zimbra inheritance is followed when setting LDAP attributes. When using Backup & Restore->Message recovery settings from Admin UI, if the value of zimbraDumpsterEnabled attribute is FALSE at COS level and TRUE at Domain level, then the value at COS level will be considered. So the issue here is- adding Domains in the message recovery settings will have no impact on message recovery if the COS level attribute is set to its default value FALSE.
* Backup and Restore - When mail-store server is restored after moving some of its accounts to another mail store, then old mail data like blobs, metadata, etc. of the accounts which have been moved to another mail store, will also get restored. The workaround is to - execute the restore with --ignoreRedoErrors OR with -rf options like zmrestore -a all --ignoreRedoErrors
* When user clicks on a file in Briefcase, a preview is displayed for the supported file formats. User can also edit these files in a separate window. The changes take a long time to be reflected in the preview, and sometimes user might need to click on the file multiple times to view the changes.
* When editing documents from Briefcase, the documents are opened in a separate browser window in which users can edit the document. However, the updated contents are not reflected in the Briefcase file, unless the separate browser window is not closed by the user.
* User is not able to search files in the "Files shared with me" folder, within Briefcase.
* Re-sending a file share for a Briefcase document throws the error, "A network service error has occurred".

## Modern Web App

**Contacts**

* Clicking on Settings Icon after exporting contacts causes the user interface to freeze. To fix it, reload the page.

## Admin Web Console

* In Admin UI, if two users are assigned the Administrator privilege followed by "Assign default domain administrator views and rights", there is an error displayed for the second user, and the request is not completed. This happens due to a caching issue, and flushing the cache of the mail-store resolves this issue.

## ActiveSync

* On iOS Native App, if the Mail, Calendar, and Contacts folders are shared with the user, the shares are not displayed on the App.

Similarly, for Windows Outlook and Windows Native Contacts App, if the Contacts folder is shared with the user, the shares are not displayed on the App.
Workaround - The user will have to reconfigure his account on the device to get the shares mounted on the device.

* Exchange ActiveSync protocol currently does not support Read-Only permission sharing. It is recommended not to enable Sharing for the users having shares with Read-Only permission.
* In a Rolling-upgrade environment, if a zimbra-9 user shares a calendar with zimbra-10 user, the events are not synced.

Workaround - For the Rolling-Upgrade environment involving the NG mailbox server, due to technical differences between the NG Mobile feature and Zimbra (v10) Mobile Sync feature, it is recommended to use Sharing feature after moving all the accounts to zimbra-10 mailbox server.

* For Windows Mail App, the Sent folder emails are not displayed after blocking and unblocking the user.

Workaround - The user can remove and reconfigure the account on the app.

* When using iOS Outlook App, Out of Office settings are not synced to the user's account in Web App.
* When the organizer and attendee use the Outlook app, if the organizer cancels an instance from a recurring meeting, the same is not reflected on the attendee's calendar.

## Backup Restore

* When using backup and restore to move data from source 9.x NG server to destination 10.x server, if both the source and destination, primary volumes are 'External', and zimbraBackupSkipBlobs is set to True, then emails moved secondary volume throw 'Missing Blob for item' error.
* When an account is restored using backup data from NG external secondary volume, the account is displaying garbled data for emails on the destination server.
* When we schedule backup using zmschedulebackup command, backup is getting scheduled in crontab and LDAP attributes are updated with appropriate values.

## HSM

* On the NG server, if you are using OpenIO as an external volume to store your Primary/Secondary data and do an in-place upgrade to Patch 10.0.5, then the emails present on the OpenIO store appear garbled. Currently, no workaround is available for this issue and our engineering team is working on it.
