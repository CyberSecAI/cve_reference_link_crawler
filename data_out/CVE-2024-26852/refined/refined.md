```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the `ip6_route_mpath_notify` function. The `fib6_info_release` function was being called prematurely, before the fib6_info structure was no longer needed.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Use-after-free

Impact of exploitation:
- Kernel crash
- Potential for privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution is possible, but not directly described in this content.

Attack vectors:
- Triggering the `ip6_route_multipath_add` function with a crafted netlink message, which then leads to a call to `ip6_route_mpath_notify`.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to send netlink messages to the kernel.
- The attacker also needs to be able to trigger the codepath in `ip6_route_multipath_add` that contains the vulnerability.
