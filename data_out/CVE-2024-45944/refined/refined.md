Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-45944:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability exists in `com.j2eefast.framework.quartz.utils.JobInvokeUtil#invokeMethod` where scheduled tasks directly use the provided `beanName`, `methodName`, and `methodParams` without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unvalidated Input:** The scheduled task mechanism directly utilizes user-provided values for bean name, method name, and parameters without sanitization or validation.
- **RMI Deserialization:** The lack of validation allows an attacker to inject a specially crafted RMI lookup string that, when processed by the application, triggers a remote method invocation, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. The provided example shows a calculator popping up, indicating successful RCE.
- **Full System Compromise:**  RCE can lead to complete compromise of the vulnerable system, allowing the attacker to install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Scheduled Tasks:** Attackers manipulate the scheduled task configuration through the application's backend interface to include malicious RMI lookup strings.
- **Network:** The attack is initiated by sending malicious task configuration parameters that include a crafted RMI lookup string to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application's backend. The example uses default credentials `admin/admin`.
- **Application Access:** The attacker needs access to the application interface, specifically the section where scheduled tasks can be created or modified.
- **RMI Server:** The attacker needs a running RMI server with a malicious payload that can be triggered when the vulnerable application performs an RMI lookup.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited using tools like Yakit with the `CC7/raw_cmd` chain.
- The provided RMI address needs to be concatenated with `javax.naming.InitialContext.lookup('')` for the exploit to work.
- The vulnerable component is the `JobInvokeUtil` class in the `com.j2eefast.framework.quartz.utils` package.
- J2eeFast versions up to and including 2.6 are affected.
