- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "ticket report generate" feature in ScienceLogic SL1 takes unsanitized user-controlled input and passes it directly to a shell command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary commands to the underlying operating system.
- **Attack vectors:** The "ticket report generate" feature is vulnerable to command injection. The user input is not sanitized, allowing for the injection of shell commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the vulnerable "ticket report generate" feature and provide input to the system. Based on the CVSS vector, they require low privileges.
