How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

This blog post is about the All-in-One WP Migration Extensions vulnerability. If you’re an All-in-One WP Migration Extensions user specified below, please update the plugin to the patched version mentioned in this article.

**Patchstack Developer and Business users are protected from the vulnerability.** You can also sign up for the [Patchstack Community plan](http://patchstack.com/pricing/) to be notified about vulnerabilities as soon as they become disclosed.

For plugin developers, we have [security audit services](https://patchstack.com/auditing/) and [Threat Intelligence Feed API](https://patchstack.com/threat-intel-feed/) for hosting companies.

## About the All-in-One WP Migration Extensions Plugin

The plugin [All-in-One WP Migration](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/) (free version), which is not vulnerable to this vulnerability but only the listed extensions, is the most popular migration plugin in WordPress which is estimated to be used by over **5 million websites**. The plugin also has several premium extensions which allow users to do a migration to a third-party platform such as [Box](https://servmask.com/extensions/box-extension), [Google Drive](https://servmask.com/products/google-drive-extension), [OneDrive](https://servmask.com/extensions/onedrive-extension) and [Dropbox](https://servmask.com/products/dropbox-extension). The plugin itself is developed by [ServMask](https://servmask.com/).

![](https://patchstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-22.png)

This plugin is one of WordPress’s most trusted and utilized plugins for moving websites with absolute ease. It’s intently built with the non-technical user in mind, All-in-One WP Migration comes loaded with newbie-friendly functions that allow us to migrate our WordPress website with little to no technical knowledge or experience.

## The security vulnerability

The All-in-One WP Migration Extensions suffers from unauthenticated access token manipulation, which allow any unauthenticated users to update or delete the access token configuration of the affected extension. This access token manipulation could result to a potential sensitive information disclosure of migration to the attacker’s controlled third party account or restore a malicious backup. The vulnerability is assigned **CVE-2023-40004**. Below are the details on which version the vulnerability is patched on each of the extensions :

* All-in-One WP Migration Box Extension , version **1.54**
* All-in-One WP Migration Google Drive Extension , version **2.80**
* All-in-One WP Migration OneDrive Extension , version **1.67**
* All-in-One WP Migration Dropbox Extension, version **3.76**

### Unauthenticated Access Token Manipulation

The vulnerable code is pretty identical on all of the 4 affected extensions. The underlying vulnerable code exists in the `init` function (below is the example code from All-in-One WP Migration Box Extension) :

```
public function init() {
    if ( isset( $_GET['ai1wmbe_token'] ) ) {
        update_option( 'ai1wmbe_box_token', urldecode( $_GET['ai1wmbe_token'] ) );

        // Redirect to settings page
        wp_redirect( network_admin_url( 'admin.php?page=ai1wmbe_settings' ) );
        exit;
    }

    if ( AI1WMBE_PURCHASE_ID ) {
        update_option( 'ai1wmbe_plugin_key', AI1WMBE_PURCHASE_ID );
    }
}
```

The code difference from the other 3 extensions is only located on the naming of the `ai1wmbe` value which differ on each of the affected extensions. Notice that the function itself will update the `ai1wmbe_box_token` option from the `$_GET['ai1wmbe_token']` value. The `init` function itself is hooked to the WordPress’s `[admin_init](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/admin_init/)` hook which is declared in `activate_actions` function :

```
/**
 * Register listeners for actions
 *
 * @return void
 */
private function activate_actions() {
    add_action( 'admin_init', array( $this, 'init' ) );
    add_action( 'admin_init', array( $this, 'router' ) );
    add_action( 'admin_init', array( $this, 'load_textdomain' ) );
    add_action( 'admin_head', array( $this, 'admin_head' ) );
-------------------------- CUTTED HERE --------------------------
```

The `[admin_init](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/admin_init/)` hook itself could be triggered by unauthenticated user from the `/wp-admin/wp-ajax.php` endpoint. Since there is no permission and nonce validation on the `init` function, an unauthenticated is user able to modify or delete the access token used on each of the affected extensions.

## The patch

The patch is as simple as adding permission and nonce validation on the `init` function. Below is an example patch from the All-in-One WP Migration Box Extension:

![](https://patchstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-23-1024x182.png)
## Conclusion

For plugin and theme developer, keep in mind that the `[admin_init](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/admin_init/)` hook by default can be reached by an unauthenticated user. We recommend applying permission and nonce validation on the function hooked to `[admin_init](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/admin_init/)` if there is sensitive information exported or an action being performed.

## Timeline

18 July, 2023We found the vulnerability and reached out to the plugin vendor.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
