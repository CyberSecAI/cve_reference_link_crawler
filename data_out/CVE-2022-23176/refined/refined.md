- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An authentication bypass vulnerability existed in WatchGuard's Fireware OS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authentication bypass, allowing a remote attacker with unprivileged credentials to access the system with a privileged management session via exposed management access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could gain privileged access to the system, potentially leading to full control of the firewall device. This was exploited to create a botnet.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote exploitation via exposed management access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have unprivileged credentials and the ability to access the exposed management interface.
