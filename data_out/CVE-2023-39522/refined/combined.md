# Username enumeration attack

Moderate

[BeryJu](/BeryJu)
published
GHSA-vmf9-6pcv-xr87
Aug 29, 2023

## Package

authentik

## Affected versions

<= 2023.6.1
<= 2023.5.5

## Patched versions

2023.6.2
2023.5.6

## Description

## Summary

Using a recovery flow with an identification stage an attacker is able to determine if a username exists.

## Impact

Only setups configured with a recovery flow are impacted by this. Anyone with a user account on a system with the recovery flow described above is susceptible to having their username/email revealed as existing.

## Details

An attacker can easily enumerate and check users' existence using the recovery flow, as a clear message is shown when a user doesn't exist. Depending on configuration this can either be done by username, email, or both.

The invalid and valid usernames should both show the same message and always send an email. Article for reference here: <https://postmarkapp.com/guides/password-reset-email-best-practices#how-to-make-sure-your-password-reset-emails-are-secure>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
