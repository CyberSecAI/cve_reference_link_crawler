In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mtd: physmap: physmap-bt1-rom: Fix unintentional stack access

Cast &data to (char *) in order to avoid unintentionally accessing
the stack.

Notice that data is of type u32, so any increment to &data
will be in the order of 4-byte chunks, and this piece of code
is actually intended to be a byte offset.
