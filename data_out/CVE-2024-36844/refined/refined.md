The provided content is related to CVE-2024-36844.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the `ctx->backend` pointer in `modbus.c` being incorrectly modified after multiple calls or used after being freed. Specifically, the pointer is overwritten with an invalid address after the first call to `send_msg`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability: The `ctx->backend` pointer is modified to an invalid address, and later accessed resulting in a crash

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A segmentation fault and program termination due to an attempt to access invalid memory
- Denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specific sequence of Modbus messages to the affected server (`unit-test-server`). The provided "POC" demonstrates this by sending several modbus requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send Modbus messages to the vulnerable server
- The attacker needs to send the crafted sequence of Modbus requests to trigger the vulnerability
