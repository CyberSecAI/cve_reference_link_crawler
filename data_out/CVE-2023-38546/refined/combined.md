I was wondering if VSI plans to issue a update to the curl package to address the security vulnerabilities in curl (CVE-2023-38545 & CVE-2023-38546) which were announced this week?

I haven't seen a reply to this come through so, for anyone that is interested, you are welcome to my build of Curl 8.4.0 until VSI releases one. It is available at <https://theberrymans.com/php_kits/curl-8_4_0.zip> (I really need to rename that directory).

A couple of notes:

1. This kit includes LDAP support so the VSI LDAP kit (either 2.5 or 2.6) needs to be installed.

2. If you are not already aware, you can place a file called cert.pem containing certificates for all of the CAs that you trust in SSL3$CERTS: and any program that calls X509\_STORE\_set\_default\_paths() will automatically load them. I use the same ones that Mozilla uses, which can be downloaded from <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html>

Example: curl -O <https://vmssoftware.com/docs/VSI_X86V921_RN.pdf>

$ curl -V

curl 8.4.0 (OpenVMS x86\_64) libcurl/8.4.0 OpenSSL/3.0.10 zlib/1.2.12 libidn2/2.3.4 libssh2/1.11.0 nghttp2/1.57.0 OpenLDAP/2.6.6

Release-Date: 2023-10-11

Protocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ldap ldaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp scp sftp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp ws wss

Features: alt-svc AsynchDNS GSS-API HSTS HTTP2 HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz NTLM SPNEGO SSL threadsafe TLS-SRP UnixSockets

Hello Mark (long time, no type),

I realize this is not the correct area to be asking this question, but have you published a port of mariadb-5.5 for OpenVMS x86-64 ?

(IIRC, you previously told me why going above version 5 on OpenVMS was not possible at this time)

## CVE-2023-38546

# cookie injection with none file

Project curl Security Advisory, October 11 2023 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-38546.html)

## VULNERABILITY

This flaw allows an attacker to intentionally inject cookies into a
running program using libcurl, if the specific series of conditions are
met.

libcurl performs transfers. In its API, an application creates "easy
handles" that are the individual handles for single transfers.

libcurl provides a function call that duplicates an easy handle
called [curl\_easy\_duphandle](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_duphandle.html).

If a transfer has cookies enabled when the handle is duplicated, the
cookie-enable state is also cloned - but without cloning the actual
cookies. If the source handle did not read any cookies from a specific
file on disk, the cloned version of the handle would instead store the
filename as `none` (using the four ASCII letters, no
quotes).

Subsequent use of the cloned handle that does not explicitly set a
source to load cookies from would then inadvertently load cookies from a
file named `none` - if such a file exists and is readable in
the current directory of the program using libcurl, when using the
correct file format of course.

## INFO

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2023-38546 to this issue.

CWE-73: External Control of filename or Path

Severity: Low

We set it to low because the flaw requires a series of conditions to
be met and the likeliness that they shall allow an attacker to take
advantage of it is low. Even if the bug could be made to trigger, the
risk that a cookie injection can be done to cause harm is additionally
also low.

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: libcurl [7.9.1](vuln-7.9.1.html) to and including [8.3.0](vuln-8.3.0.html)
* Not affected versions: libcurl < [7.9.1](vuln-7.9.1.html) and >= [8.4.0](vuln-8.4.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/74d5a6fb3b9a96d9f>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

The (flawed) logic that created this bug existed even before the
`curl_easy_duphandle()` function was added, but it did not
become this problem until this API was introduced.

This flaw is not accessible using the curl command line tool.

## SOLUTION

Starting in curl [8.4.0](vuln-8.4.0.html), curl not longer stores the filename in the
cookie struct.

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/61275672b46d9abb32857404>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [8.4.0](vuln-8.4.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Call
`curl_easy_setopt(cloned_curl, [CURLOPT_COOKIELIST](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_COOKIELIST.html), "ALL");`
right after every `curl_easy_duphandle();` call.

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on September 14, 2023. We
contacted distros@openwall on October 3, 2023.

libcurl [8.4.0](vuln-8.4.0.html) was released on October 11 2023, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.
