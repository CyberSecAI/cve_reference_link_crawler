Subject: CVE-2024-38379: Apache Allura: Stored authenticated XSS

Severity: moderate

Affected versions:

- Apache Allura 1.4.0 through 1.17.0

Description:

Apache Allura's neighborhood settings are vulnerable to a stored XSS attack.  Only neighborhood admins can access these settings, so the scope of risk is limited to configurations where neighborhood admins are not fully trusted.

This issue affects Apache Allura: from 1.4.0 through 1.17.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.17.1, which fixes the issue.
