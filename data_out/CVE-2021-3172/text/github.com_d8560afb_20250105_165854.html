| **Describe the bug** A logged in user can vote multiple times as the application does not limit the user to vote only once which not only bypasses the application logic of altering poll results thereby highly affecting the integrity of the poll results, but may also cause serious DDoS when an attacker encounters this flaw affecting the availability.  **Version** PHP-Fusion version 9.03.90.  **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior:   1. Go to 'Poll feature post logging in by clicking the 3 dash button present in the left top corner' 2. Click on 'Yes/no option of the poll and press on submit' 3. Intercept this request using intercepting tool like Burp. 4. Send this to the repeater. 5. Replay the request multiple times. 6. Observe that number of votes of the same logged in user gets added successfully. 7. Upon replaying the requests using some special features like Intruder of Burp, 1000s of votes can be logged in matter of seconds, which not only manipulate the poll results but may lead to serious DDoS attack.   **Expected behavior**   1. Limit the logged in user to vote only once by tracking the cookie and IP of the logged in user. 2. Implement Rate limit feature   **Screenshots**    bandicam.2021-01-13.21-19-25-691.mp4     **Additional context** Kindly refer the following link for more details on how to handle DoS <https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Denial_of_Service>. |

| [@RobiNN1](https://github.com/RobiNN1) [@FrederickChan](https://github.com/FrederickChan)  Can you create an infusion or something for the main site to deal with these vulnerability reports so they are private and then add a github security policy to the repos so people testing know where to report these vulnerabilities ensuring they are disclosing this issue responsibly. Having these reports public and in turn unpatched is horrfic !!!  [@oosman-rak](https://github.com/oosman-rak) You really need to be reporting these issues privately and stick to responsible disclosure. If the PHP-Fusion team don't have a system in place is a poor show for them but also for you. Try everything else before making these report public on Github as it puts sites at risk of the very issues you are reporting. |

| [@base-zero](https://github.com/base-zero) But will the issues be moved to publicly accessible closed issue section after fixing it, so that it can be referenced later by security community?  It will be great if you can do that |

| [@oosman-rak](https://github.com/oosman-rak) That is going to be down to the PHP-Fusion folks to decided how they handle the reports. However nomally you keep the report private and once the fix has been commited and a new version tagged. You would then wait for a set amount of time to give the public time to install the patch and make a public announcemnt of the vulnerability and CVE's.  The PHP-Fusion folks could use the Github Security Advisories tool as the project is on Github. This tool also hooks into the dependbot system make eveyone safer ! Credit can be give in the security advisory on GitHub along with the CVE number if applicable.  <https://github.com/PHPFusion/PHPFusion/security/advisories> |

| [@base-zero](https://github.com/base-zero) But to raise a CVE request post fixing the issue I need a reference link that be can publicly accessible so that CVE gets assigned, how do I deal with this? |

| [@oosman-rak](https://github.com/oosman-rak) Your going to need to wait for PHP-Fusion to come back with some comments to see how they want to deal with this going forward, as its down to them on how they deal with security issue. As for the CVE if they use the Github Security Advisories Tool that is the report for the CVE then once assgined a CVE number the security advisory can be edited to add the CVE number. You can also do private reports for CVE's in a number of different ways but this isn't the place for that conversation, you would need to look into that yourself. |

| Sure, I totally understand your concern. I'll look into it myself, thanks [@base-zero](https://github.com/base-zero) :)  But will surely look forward to see PHP-Fusion fix these issues. Apart from this issue there are other 2 issues i have raised around 24 days ago, look forward to see them fixed too :) |

| Check again, the user\_ip value was blank. Unless you change your IP, you should not be able to vote second time. If you can send another video after this fix, we will reopen this issue.  This vulnerability is not a big issue really, because 99% people wouldn't use a repeater in their system. |

| [@FrederickChan](https://github.com/FrederickChan) agreed, 99% of normal people won't use it. But definitely an attacker would use it to bypass the application logic and cause DDoS. This was also a major vulnerability.  However, it seems to be fixed now. |
