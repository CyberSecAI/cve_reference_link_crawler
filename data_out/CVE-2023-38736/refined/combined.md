# Security Bulletin: IBM QRadar WinCollect Agent is vulnerable to a local escalation of privilege attack in some configurations (CVE-2023-38736)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM QRadar WinCollect Agent when installed to run as Admin or System, or with Admin or System privileges, is vulnerable to a local escalation of privilege attack that a non-privileged user could utilize to gain System permissions. IBM has addressed the relevant vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2023-38736](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/262542)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| QRadar WinCollect Agent | 10.0 - 10.1.6 |

## Remediation/Fixes

**IBM recommends customers upgrade their systems promptly.**

There is a new upgrade for the WinCollect standalone agent. The following WinCollect standalone agent versions can be used to upgrade the affected versions to resolve the vulnerability by applying the mitigation steps below. For information on how to upgrade your WinCollect version, see the WinCollect 10.1.7 release notes:

## Workarounds and Mitigations

For upgrades to 10.1.7 the following steps are needed for complete remediation. Fresh installs of 10.1.7 or greater are not affected

When using the default path for install location and data, rerun the installer and select the "modify" option, select the options desired and run. This will update the permissions on the default locations.

When using custom paths for install and data locations, ensure the parent directories have file permissions that prevent unwanted modifications to WinCollect data and program files.

A future release of WinCollect will negate the need for post-upgrade remediation steps.

## Disclaimer

According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.
