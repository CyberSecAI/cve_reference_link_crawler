Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-49756:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a logic flaw in how `ash_postgres` handles "empty" atomic update actions. Specifically, when an update action is designed to not modify any fields (no changing fields) and is performed atomically, the policy checks are skipped, leading to potential bypass of authorization controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Policy Bypass:** Under specific conditions, the policies associated with an update action are bypassed. This happens when the action is atomic, does not have `require_atomic? false` set, contains no changing fields, and has at least one authorizer.
- **Side-Effect Execution:**  Even if no data is directly modified, the after-action hooks (side effects) associated with the update action can still be triggered despite policy checks being skipped.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Side Effects:** An attacker can trigger side effects (like invoking other resource actions) that they should not normally be able to invoke due to the bypassed policies.
- **Potential Data Corruption/Modification:** If these side effects are designed to modify data, it could lead to data corruption or modification that was not intended.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By triggering side effects, an attacker could potentially escalate privileges or gain access to resources they shouldn't normally have. It's important to note, however, this doesn't allow reading new data that the user shouldn't already have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct `Ash.update` Calls:** The vulnerability is triggered when calling an update action directly using `Ash.update` method, with specific conditions, as stated above, and not through `Ash.bulk_update` (used by AshGraphql and AshJsonApi).
- **Zero Input Updates:** The attack vector involves calling the vulnerable update action with zero inputs, such that it doesn't produce any changes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Actions:** The attacker needs to know about the existence of vulnerable update actions within the application.
- **Ability to Invoke Actions:** The attacker needs to be able to invoke the vulnerable `Ash.update` action through the application's interface, and they need to have permission to call the action in the first place.
- **Understanding of Side Effects:** The attacker needs to understand the side effects associated with the vulnerable update actions, specifically looking for those that could be abused.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Specific Conditions:** The vulnerability is triggered only under a specific set of conditions that are detailed above.
*   **Mitigation:** The issue has been fixed in `ash_postgres` version `2.4.10`.
*   **Detection Script:** The provided gist ([https://gist.github.com/zachdaniel/e49166b765978c48dfaf998d06df436e](https://gist.github.com/zachdaniel/e49166b765978c48dfaf998d06df436e)) contains a script that can help identify potentially vulnerable actions.
*   **Workarounds:** Several workarounds are suggested, including setting `require_atomic? false` on the potentially affected actions, using `Ash.bulk_update`, or adding an update timestamp.

This is a moderate severity vulnerability because it allows a user to trigger side effects they should not have been able to trigger, but not to read data they shouldn't have access to.
