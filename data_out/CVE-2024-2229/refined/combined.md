Vulnerability Details

CVE ID: CVE-2024-2229

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 7.8 | High | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability exists that could cause remote code
execution when a malicious project file is loaded into the application by a valid user.

Note regarding vulnerability details: The severity of vulnerabilities was calculated using the
CVSS Base metrics in version 3.1 (CVSS v3.1) without incorporating the Temporal and
Environmental metrics. Schneider Electric recommends that customers score the CVSS
Environmental metrics, which are specific to end-user organizations, and consider factors such
as the presence of mitigations in that environment. Environmental metrics may refine the
relative severity posed by the vulnerabilities described in this document within a customer’s
environment.

Mitigations

Affected Product & Version

Mitigations

Schneider Electric is establishing a remediation plan for all
future versions of EcoStruxure Power Design - Ecodial that
will include a fix for this vulnerability. We will update this
document when the remediation is available. Until then,
customers should immediately apply the following
mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:

•  Compute hash of the project files and regularly
check the consistency of this hash to verify the
integrity before usage.

•  Store the hash information in a separate location

from where the project file is stored.

•  When sharing or receiving project files with another
user, the hash information should be provided over
a separate, out of band channel.

Ecodial NL All Versions

Ecodial INT All Versions

•  When exchanging files over the network, use

secure communication protocols.

•  Only open project files received from a trusted

source.

•  Harden the workstation running the application.
•  Delete the accounts of people who no longer need
access to the application and the computer running
the application following the principle of least
privilege.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.

•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for

that device.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

Practices document.
