The provided content relates to CVE-2024-41117.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application uses the `eval()` function to process user-supplied input in the `vis_params` variable without proper sanitization in the file `pages/10_üåç_Earth_Engine_Datasets.py`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to the use of `eval()` on unsanitized user input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. This may lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The application's web interface allows users to enter visualization parameters as a dictionary. This input is then processed by the `eval()` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to access the application's web interface and have the ability to input data into the "Enter visualization parameters as a dictionary" field.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the file `pages/10_üåç_Earth_Engine_Datasets.py` on line 126.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by entering malicious code as visualization parameters, which the application then executes via `eval()`.
- The fix involves replacing `eval()` with `json.loads()` after sanitizing the input
