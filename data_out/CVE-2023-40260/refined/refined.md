{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient verification of previously registered MFA during the process of delivering MFA codes.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The system fails to properly verify the email associated with a user's MFA configuration when delivering MFA codes. This allows an attacker to change the registered email address and receive MFA codes intended for the legitimate user.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could circumvent MFA safeguards and gain unauthorized access to the victim's account. This could lead to unauthorized activities, data breaches, or the exposure of confidential information within the affected EmpowerID system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the EmpowerID system's user account management. Specifically, an attacker needs to modify the email associated with an account's MFA.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to valid and breached login details, including a username and password, of a user with MFA enabled."
