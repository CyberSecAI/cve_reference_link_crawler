- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Crafted data within a DCM image can trigger a write past the end of an allocated buffer during parsing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious DCM file or visits a malicious webpage.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious DCM image file to exploit the vulnerability. The user has to open the malicious file or visit a webpage serving the malicious file.
