- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors**: By inserting crafted input into various data fields in the affected web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote. They need to be able to insert crafted input into data fields in the interface, and they need a user of the interface to interact with the crafted input.
