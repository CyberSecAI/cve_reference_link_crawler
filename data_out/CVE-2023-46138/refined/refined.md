Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46138:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the default email address "admin@mycomany.com" used for the initial admin user in Jumpserver. This email address is used in password reset functionality. The domain mycomany.com is not registered, so if an attacker registers this domain in the future they could exploit the password reset function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of a default email address with an unregistered domain for password resets.
- Potential for account takeover via password reset if the unregistered domain gets claimed by a malicious actor.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker who registers the "mycompany.com" domain could gain control of the admin account by using the password reset functionality, which would send the password reset link to this email address.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attacker must register the domain "mycompany.com" and have access to the internet.
- The attack complexity is high because it requires that the domain is registered by the attacker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to register a domain.
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the Jumpserver system.
- The attacker does not need any user interaction from the victim.

The provided information also includes a commit that modifies the default email address and a security advisory detailing the vulnerability. This commit changes the default email to 'admin@example.com' and also changes the email filtering to remove the old email address from recipients.
