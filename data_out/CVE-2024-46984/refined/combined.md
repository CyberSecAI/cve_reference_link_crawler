# Server Side Request Forgery

**Author:** Eoftedal

**Contributor(s):** ErezYalon, kingthorin

## Overview

In a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, the attacker can abuse
functionality on the server to read or update internal resources. The
attacker can supply or modify a URL which the code running on the
server will read or submit data to, and by carefully selecting the URLs,
the attacker may be able to read server configuration such as AWS
metadata, connect to internal services like http enabled databases or
perform post requests towards internal services which are not intended
to be exposed.

## Description

The target application may have functionality for importing data from a
URL, publishing data to a URL or otherwise reading data from a URL that
can be tampered with. The attacker modifies the calls to this
functionality by supplying a completely different URL or by manipulating
how URLs are built (path traversal etc.).

When the manipulated request goes to the server, the server-side code
picks up the manipulated URL and tries to read data to the manipulated
URL. By selecting target URLs the attacker may be able to read data from
services that are not directly exposed on the internet:

* Cloud server meta-data - Cloud services such as AWS provide a REST
  interface on `http://169.254.169.254/` where important configuration
  and sometimes even authentication keys can be extracted.
* Database HTTP interfaces - NoSQL database such as MongoDB provide
  REST interfaces on HTTP ports. If the database is expected to only
  be available to internally, authentication may be disabled and the
  attacker can extract data.
* Internal REST interfaces.
* Files - The attacker may be able to read files using `file://` URIs.

The attacker may also use this functionality to import untrusted data
into code that expects to only read data from trusted sources, and as
such circumvent input validation.

## Prevention

## Package

maven

de.gematik.refv.commons:commons
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.1

## Patched versions

2.5.1

## Description

### Impact

The profile location routine in the referencevalidator commons package is vulnerable to [XML External Entities](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A4_2017-XML_External_Entities_%28XXE%29) attack due to insecure defaults of the used Woodstox WstxInputFactory. A malicious XML resource can lead to network requests issued by referencevalidator and thus to a [Server Side Request Forgery](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server_Side_Request_Forgery) attack.

The vulnerability impacts applications which use referencevalidator to process XML resources from untrusted sources.

### Patches

The problem has been patched with the [2.5.1 version](https://github.com/gematik/app-referencevalidator/releases/tag/2.5.1) of the referencevalidator. Users are strongly recommended to update to this version or a more recent one.

### Workarounds

A pre-processing or manual analysis of input XML resources on existence of DTD definitions or external entities can mitigate the problem.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App. Specific | Exploitability: 2 | Prevalence: 2 | Detectability: 3 | Technical: 3 | Business ? |
| Attackers can exploit vulnerable XML processors if they can upload XML or include hostile content in an XML document, exploiting vulnerable code, dependencies or integrations. | | By default, many older XML processors allow specification of an external entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing. | | These flaws can be used to extract data, execute a remote request from the server, scan internal systems, perform a denial-of-service attack, as well as execute other attacks. The business impact depends on the protection needs of all affected application and data. | |

| Is the Application Vulnerable? Applications and in particular XML-based web services or downstream integrations might be vulnerable to attack if: \* The application accepts XML directly or XML uploads, especially from untrusted sources, or inserts untrusted data into XML documents, which is then parsed by an XML processor. \* Any of the XML processors in the application or SOAP based web services has [document type definitions (DTDs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition) enabled. As the exact mechanism for disabling DTD processing varies by processor, it is good practice to consult a reference such as the [OWASP Cheat Sheet ‘XXE Prevention’](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html). \* If the application uses SAML for identity processing within federated security or single sign on (SSO) purposes. SAML uses XML for identity assertions, and may be vulnerable. \* If the application uses SOAP prior to version 1.2, it is likely susceptible to XXE attacks if XML entities are being passed to the SOAP framework. Being vulnerable to XXE attacks likely means that the application is vulnerable to denial of service attacks including the Billion Laughs attack | How to Prevent Developer training is essential to identify and mitigate XXE. Besides that, preventing XXE requires: \* Whenever possible, use less complex data formats such as JSON, and avoiding serialization of sensitive data. \* Patch or upgrade all XML processors and libraries in use by the application or on the underlying operating system. Use dependency checkers. Update SOAP to SOAP 1.2 or higher. \* Disable XML external entity and DTD processing in all XML parsers in the application, as per the [OWASP Cheat Sheet ‘XXE Prevention’](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html). \* Implement positive (“whitelisting”) server-side input validation, filtering, or sanitization to prevent hostile data within XML documents, headers, or nodes. \* Verify that XML or XSL file upload functionality validates incoming XML using XSD validation or similar. \* [SAST](/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools) tools can help detect XXE in source code, although manual code review is the best alternative in large, complex applications with many integrations. If these controls are not possible, consider using virtual patching, API security gateways, or Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to detect, monitor, and block XXE attacks. |

| Example Attack Scenarios Numerous public XXE issues have been discovered, including attacking embedded devices. XXE occurs in a lot of unexpected places, including deeply nested dependencies. The easiest way is to upload a malicious XML file, if accepted: **Scenario #1**: The attacker attempts to extract data from the server: **`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>`** **`<!DOCTYPE foo [`** **`<!ELEMENT foo ANY >`** **`<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>`** **`<foo>&xxe</foo>`** **Scenario #2**: An attacker probes the server’s private network by changing the above ENTITY line to: **`<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "https://192.168.1.1/private" >]>`** **Scenario #3**: An attacker attempts a denial-of-service attack by including a potentially endless file: **`<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///dev/random" >]>`** | References **OWASP** \* [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard](/www-project-application-security-verification-standard) \* [OWASP Testing Guide: Testing for XML Injection](/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/07-Testing_for_XML_Injection) \* [OWASP XXE Vulnerability](/www-community/vulnerabilities/XML_External_Entity_%28XXE%29_Processing) \* [OWASP Cheat Sheet: XXE Prevention](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html) \* [OWASP Cheat Sheet: XML Security](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)  **External** \* [CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XXE](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html) \* [Billion Laughs Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack) \* [SAML Security XML External Entity Attack](https://secretsofappsecurity.blogspot.tw/2017/01/saml-security-xml-external-entity-attack.html) \* [Detecting and exploiting XXE in SAML Interfaces](https://web-in-security.blogspot.tw/2014/11/detecting-and-exploiting-xxe-in-saml.html) |

# XML External Entity Prevention Cheat Sheet[¶](#xml-external-entity-prevention-cheat-sheet "Permanent link")

## Introduction[¶](#introduction "Permanent link")

An *XML eXternal Entity injection* (XXE), which is now part of the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A4-XML_External_Entities_%28XXE%29) via the point **A4**, is attack against applications that parse XML input. This issue is referenced in the ID [611](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html) in the [Common Weakness Enumeration](https://cwe.mitre.org/index.html) referential. An XXE attack occurs when untrusted XML input with a **reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser**, and this attack could be used to stage multiple incidents, including:

* A denial of service attack on the system
* A [Server Side Request Forgery](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server_Side_Request_Forgery) (SSRF) attack
* The ability to scan ports from the machine where the parser is located
* Other system impacts.

This cheat sheet will help you prevent this vulnerability.

For more information on XXE, please visit [XML External Entity (XXE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_external_entity_attack).

## General Guidance[¶](#general-guidance "Permanent link")

**The safest way to prevent XXE is always to disable DTDs (External Entities) completely.** Depending on the parser, the method should be similar to the following:

```
factory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);

```

Disabling [DTD](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_dtd.asp)s also makes the parser secure against denial of services (DOS) attacks such as [Billion Laughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack). **If it is not possible to disable DTDs completely, then external entities and external document type declarations must be disabled in the way that's specific to each parser.**

**Detailed XXE Prevention guidance is provided below for multiple languages (C++, Cold Fusion, Java, .NET, iOS, PHP, Python, Semgrep Rules) and their commonly used XML parsers.**

## C/C++[¶](#cc "Permanent link")

### libxml2[¶](#libxml2 "Permanent link")

The Enum [xmlParserOption](http://xmlsoft.org/html/libxml-parser.html#xmlParserOption) should not have the following options defined:

* `XML_PARSE_NOENT`: Expands entities and substitutes them with replacement text
* `XML_PARSE_DTDLOAD`: Load the external DTD

Note:

Per: According to [this post](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/2012-October/msg00045.html), starting with libxml2 version 2.9, XXE has been disabled by default as committed by the following [patch](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/commit/4629ee02ac649c27f9c0cf98ba017c6b5526070f).

Search whether the following APIs are being used and make sure there is no `XML_PARSE_NOENT` and `XML_PARSE_DTDLOAD` defined in the parameters:

* `xmlCtxtReadDoc`
* `xmlCtxtReadFd`
* `xmlCtxtReadFile`
* `xmlCtxtReadIO`
* `xmlCtxtReadMemory`
* `xmlCtxtUseOptions`
* `xmlParseInNodeContext`
* `xmlReadDoc`
* `xmlReadFd`
* `xmlReadFile`
* `xmlReadIO`
* `xmlReadMemory`

### libxerces-c[¶](#libxerces-c "Permanent link")

Use of `XercesDOMParser` do this to prevent XXE:

```
XercesDOMParser *parser = new XercesDOMParser;
parser->setCreateEntityReferenceNodes(true);
parser->setDisableDefaultEntityResolution(true);

```

Use of SAXParser, do this to prevent XXE:

```
SAXParser* parser = new SAXParser;
parser->setDisableDefaultEntityResolution(true);

```

Use of SAX2XMLReader, do this to prevent XXE:

```
SAX2XMLReader* reader = XMLReaderFactory::createXMLReader();
parser->setFeature(XMLUni::fgXercesDisableDefaultEntityResolution, true);

```
## ColdFusion[¶](#coldfusion "Permanent link")

Per [this blog post](https://hoyahaxa.blogspot.com/2022/11/on-coldfusion-xxe-and-other-xml-attacks.html), both Adobe ColdFusion and Lucee have built-in mechanisms to disable support for external XML entities.

### Adobe ColdFusion[¶](#adobe-coldfusion "Permanent link")

As of ColdFusion 2018 Update 14 and ColdFusion 2021 Update 4, all native ColdFusion functions that process XML have a XML parser argument that disables support for external XML entities. Since there is no global setting that disables external entities, developers must ensure that every XML function call uses the correct security options.

From the [documentation for the XmlParse() function](https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/cfml-reference/coldfusion-functions/functions-t-z/xmlparse.html), you can disable XXE with the code below:

```
<cfset parseroptions = structnew()>
<cfset parseroptions.ALLOWEXTERNALENTITIES = false>
<cfscript>
a = XmlParse("xml.xml", false, parseroptions);
writeDump(a);
</cfscript>

```

You can use the "parseroptions" structure shown above as an argument to secure other functions that process XML as well, such as:

```
XxmlSearch(xmldoc, xpath,parseroptions);

XmlTransform(xmldoc,xslt,parseroptions);

isXML(xmldoc,parseroptions);

```
### Lucee[¶](#lucee "Permanent link")

As of Lucee 5.3.4.51 and later, you can disable support for XML external entities by adding the following to your Application.cfc:

```
this.xmlFeatures = {
     externalGeneralEntities: false,
     secure: true,
     disallowDoctypeDecl: true
};

```

Support for external XML entities is disabled by default as of Lucee 5.4.2.10 and Lucee 6.0.0.514.

## Java[¶](#java "Permanent link")

**Since most Java XML parsers have XXE enabled by default, this language is especially vulnerable to XXE attack, so you must explicitly disable XXE to use these parsers safely.** This section describes how to disable XXE in the most commonly used Java XML parsers.

### JAXP DocumentBuilderFactory, SAXParserFactory and DOM4J[¶](#jaxp-documentbuilderfactory-saxparserfactory-and-dom4j "Permanent link")

The`DocumentBuilderFactory,` `SAXParserFactory` and `DOM4J` `XML` parsers can be protected against XXE attacks with the same techniques.

**For brevity, we will only show you how to protect the `DocumentBuilderFactory` parser. Additional instructions for protecting this parser are embedded within the example code**

The JAXP `DocumentBuilderFactory` [setFeature](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/xml/parsers/DocumentBuilderFactory.html#setFeature(java.lang.String,%20boolean)) method allows a developer to control which implementation-specific XML processor features are enabled or disabled.

These features can either be set on the factory or the underlying `XMLReader` [setFeature](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/org/xml/sax/XMLReader.html#setFeature%28java.lang.String,%20boolean%29) method.

**Each XML processor implementation has its own features that govern how DTDs and external entities are processed. By disabling DTD processing entirely, most XXE attacks can be averted, although it is also necessary to disable or verify that XInclude is not enabled.**

**Since the JDK 6, the flag [FEATURE\_SECURE\_PROCESSING](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/xml/XMLConstants.html#FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING) can be used to instruct the implementation of the parser to process XML securely**. Its behavior is implementation-dependent. It may help with resource exhaustion but it may not always mitigate entity expansion. More details on this flag can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/security/java-api-xml-processing-jaxp-security-guide.html#GUID-88B04BE2-35EF-4F61-B4FA-57A0E9102342).

For a syntax highlighted example code snippet using `SAXParserFactory`, look [here](https://gist.github.com/asudhakar02/45e2e6fd8bcdfb4bc3b2).
Example code disabling DTDs (doctypes) altogether:

```
import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory;
import javax.xml.parsers.ParserConfigurationException; // catching unsupported features
import javax.xml.XMLConstants;

...

DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
String FEATURE = null;
try {
    // This is the PRIMARY defense. If DTDs (doctypes) are disallowed, almost all
    // XML entity attacks are prevented
    // Xerces 2 only - http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/features.html#disallow-doctype-decl
    FEATURE = "http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl";
    dbf.setFeature(FEATURE, true);

    // and these as well, per Timothy Morgan's 2014 paper: "XML Schema, DTD, and Entity Attacks"
    dbf.setXIncludeAware(false);

    // remaining parser logic
    ...
} catch (ParserConfigurationException e) {
    // This should catch a failed setFeature feature
    // NOTE: Each call to setFeature() should be in its own try/catch otherwise subsequent calls will be skipped.
    // This is only important if you're ignoring errors for multi-provider support.
    logger.info("ParserConfigurationException was thrown. The feature '" + FEATURE
    + "' is not supported by your XML processor.");
    ...
} catch (SAXException e) {
    // On Apache, this should be thrown when disallowing DOCTYPE
    logger.warning("A DOCTYPE was passed into the XML document");
    ...
} catch (IOException e) {
    // XXE that points to a file that doesn't exist
    logger.error("IOException occurred, XXE may still possible: " + e.getMessage());
    ...
}

// Load XML file or stream using a XXE agnostic configured parser...
DocumentBuilder safebuilder = dbf.newDocumentBuilder();

```

If you can't completely disable DTDs:

```
import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory;
import javax.xml.parsers.ParserConfigurationException; // catching unsupported features
import javax.xml.XMLConstants;

...

DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();

String[] featuresToDisable = {
    // Xerces 1 - http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-j/features.html#external-general-entities
    // Xerces 2 - http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/features.html#external-general-entities
    // JDK7+ - http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities
    //This feature has to be used together with the following one, otherwise it will not protect you from XXE for sure
    "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities",

    // Xerces 1 - http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-j/features.html#external-parameter-entities
    // Xerces 2 - http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/features.html#external-parameter-entities
    // JDK7+ - http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities
    //This feature has to be used together with the previous one, otherwise it will not protect you from XXE for sure
    "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities",

    // Disable external DTDs as well
    "http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd"
}

for (String feature : featuresToDisable) {
    try {
        dbf.setFeature(FEATURE, false);
    } catch (ParserConfigurationException e) {
        // This should catch a failed setFeature feature
        logger.info("ParserConfigurationException was thrown. The feature '" + feature
        + "' is probably not supported by your XML processor.");
        ...
    }
}

try {
    // Add these as per Timothy Morgan's 2014 paper: "XML Schema, DTD, and Entity Attacks"
    dbf.setXIncludeAware(false);
    dbf.setExpandEntityReferences(false);

    // As stated in the documentation, "Feature for Secure Processing (FSP)" is the central mechanism that will
    // help you safeguard XML processing. It instructs XML processors, such as parsers, validators,
    // and transformers, to try and process XML securely, and the FSP can be used as an alternative to
    // dbf.setExpandEntityReferences(false); to allow some safe level of Entity Expansion
    // Exists from JDK6.
    dbf.setFeature(XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING, true);

    // And, per Timothy Morgan: "If for some reason support for inline DOCTYPEs are a requirement, then
    // ensure the entity settings are disabled (as shown above) and beware that SSRF attacks
    // (http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html) and denial
    // of service attacks (such as billion laughs or decompression bombs via "jar:") are a risk."

    // remaining parser logic
    ...
} catch (ParserConfigurationException e) {
    // This should catch a failed setFeature feature
    logger.info("ParserConfigurationException was thrown. The feature 'XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING'"
    + " is probably not supported by your XML processor.");
    ...
} catch (SAXException e) {
    // On Apache, this should be thrown when disallowing DOCTYPE
    logger.warning("A DOCTYPE was passed into the XML document");
    ...
} catch (IOException e) {
    // XXE that points to a file that doesn't exist
    logger.error("IOException occurred, XXE may still possible: " + e.getMessage());
    ...
}

// Load XML file or stream using a XXE agnostic configured parser...
DocumentBuilder safebuilder = dbf.newDocumentBuilder();

```

[Xerces 1](https://xerces.apache.org/xerces-j/) [Features](https://xerces.apache.org/xerces-j/features.html):

* Do not include external entities by setting [this feature](https://xerces.apache.org/xerces-j/features.html#external-general-entities) to `false`.
* Do not include parameter entities by setting [this feature](https://xerces.apache.org/xerces-j/features.html#external-parameter-entities) to `false`.
* Do not include external DTDs by setting [this feature](https://xerces.apache.org/xerces-j/features.html#load-external-dtd) to `false`.

[Xerces 2](https://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/) [Features](https://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/features.html):

* Disallow an inline DTD by setting [this feature](https://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/features.html#disallow-doctype-decl) to `true`.
* Do not include external entities by setting [this feature](https://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/features.html#external-general-entities) to `false`.
* Do not include parameter entities by setting [this feature](https://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/features.html#external-parameter-entities) to `false`.
* Do not include external DTDs by setting [this feature](https://xerces.apache.org/xerces-j/features.html#load-external-dtd) to `false`.

**Note:** The above defenses require Java 7 update 67, Java 8 update 20, or above, because the countermeasures for `DocumentBuilderFactory` and SAXParserFactory are broken in earlier Java versions, per: [CVE-2014-6517](http://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2014-6517/).

### XMLInputFactory (a StAX parser)[¶](#xmlinputfactory-a-stax-parser "Permanent link")

[StAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StAX) parsers such as [`XMLInputFactory`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/xml/stream/XMLInputFactory.html) allow various properties and features to be set.

To protect a Java `XMLInputFactory` from XXE, disable DTDs (doctypes) altogether:

```
// This disables DTDs entirely for that factory
xmlInputFactory.setProperty(XMLInputFactory.SUPPORT_DTD, false);

```

or if you can't completely disable DTDs:

```
// This causes XMLStreamException to be thrown if external DTDs are accessed.
xmlInputFactory.setProperty(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD, "");
// disable external entities
xmlInputFactory.setProperty("javax.xml.stream.isSupportingExternalEntities", false);

```

The setting `xmlInputFactory.setProperty(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA, "");` is not required, as XMLInputFactory is dependent on Validator to perform XML validation against Schemas. Check the [Validator](#Validator) section for the specific configuration.

### Oracle DOM Parser[¶](#oracle-dom-parser "Permanent link")

Follow [Oracle recommendation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/adxdk/security-considerations-oracle-xml-developers-kit.html#GUID-45303542-41DE-4455-93B3-854A826EF8BB) e.g.:

```
    // Extend oracle.xml.parser.v2.XMLParser
    DOMParser domParser = new DOMParser();

    // Do not expand entity references
    domParser.setAttribute(DOMParser.EXPAND_ENTITYREF, false);

    // dtdObj is an instance of oracle.xml.parser.v2.DTD
    domParser.setAttribute(DOMParser.DTD_OBJECT, dtdObj);

    // Do not allow more than 11 levels of entity expansion
    domParser.setAttribute(DOMParser.ENTITY_EXPANSION_DEPTH, 12);

```
### TransformerFactory[¶](#transformerfactory "Permanent link")

To protect a `javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory` from XXE, do this:

```
TransformerFactory tf = TransformerFactory.newInstance();
tf.setAttribute(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD, "");
tf.setAttribute(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_STYLESHEET, "");

```
### Validator[¶](#validator "Permanent link")

To protect a `javax.xml.validation.Validator` from XXE, do this:

```
SchemaFactory factory = SchemaFactory.newInstance("http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema");
factory.setProperty(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD, "");
factory.setProperty(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA, "");
Schema schema = factory.newSchema();
Validator validator = schema.newValidator();
validator.setProperty(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD, "");
validator.setProperty(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA, "");

```
### SchemaFactory[¶](#schemafactory "Permanent link")

To protect a `javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory` from XXE, do this:

```
SchemaFactory factory = SchemaFactory.newInstance("http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema");
factory.setProperty(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD, "");
factory.setProperty(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA, "");
Schema schema = factory.newSchema(Source);

```
### SAXTransformerFactory[¶](#saxtransformerfactory "Permanent link")

To protect a `javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXTransformerFactory` from XXE, do this:

```
SAXTransformerFactory sf = SAXTransformerFactory.newInstance();
sf.setAttribute(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD, "");
sf.setAttribute(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_STYLESHEET, "");
sf.newXMLFilter(Source);

```

**Note: Use of the following `XMLConstants` requires JAXP 1.5, which was added to Java in 7u40 and Java 8:**

* `javax.xml.XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD`
* `javax.xml.XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA`
* `javax.xml.XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_STYLESHEET`

### XMLReader[¶](#xmlreader "Permanent link")

To protect the Java `org.xml.sax.XMLReader` from an XXE attack, do this:

```
XMLReader reader = XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader();
reader.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
// This may not be strictly required as DTDs shouldn't be allowed at all, per previous line.
reader.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false);
reader.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
reader.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);

```
### SAXReader[¶](#saxreader "Permanent link")

To protect a Java `org.dom4j.io.SAXReader` from an XXE attack, do this:

```
saxReader.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
saxReader.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
saxReader.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);

```

If your code does not have all of these lines, you could be vulnerable to an XXE attack.

### SAXBuilder[¶](#saxbuilder "Permanent link")

To protect a Java `org.jdom2.input.SAXBuilder` from an XXE attack, disallow DTDs (doctypes) entirely:

```
SAXBuilder builder = new SAXBuilder();
builder.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl",true);
Document doc = builder.build(new File(fileName));

```

Alternatively, if DTDs can't be completely disabled, disable external entities and entity expansion:

```
SAXBuilder builder = new SAXBuilder();
builder.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
builder.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
builder.setExpandEntities(false);
Document doc = builder.build(new File(fileName));

```
### No-op EntityResolver[¶](#no-op-entityresolver "Permanent link")

For APIs that take an `EntityResolver`, you can neutralize an XML parser's ability to resolve entities by [supplying a no-op implementation](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/IDS17-J.%2BPrevent%2BXML%2BExternal%2BEntity%2BAttacks):

```
public final class NoOpEntityResolver implements EntityResolver {
    public InputSource resolveEntity(String publicId, String systemId) {
        return new InputSource(new StringReader(""));
    }
}

// ...

xmlReader.setEntityResolver(new NoOpEntityResolver());
documentBuilder.setEntityResolver(new NoOpEntityResolver());

```

or more simply:

```
EntityResolver noop = (publicId, systemId) -> new InputSource(new StringReader(""));
xmlReader.setEntityResolver(noop);
documentBuilder.setEntityResolver(noop);

```
### JAXB Unmarshaller[¶](#jaxb-unmarshaller "Permanent link")

**Because `javax.xml.bind.Unmarshaller` parses XML but does not support any flags for disabling XXE, you must parse the untrusted XML through a configurable secure parser first, generate a source object as a result, and pass the source object to the Unmarshaller.** For example:

```
SAXParserFactory spf = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();

//Option 1: This is the PRIMARY defense against XXE
spf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
spf.setFeature(XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING, true);
spf.setXIncludeAware(false);

//Option 2: If disabling doctypes is not possible
spf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
spf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
spf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false);
spf.setFeature(XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING, true);
spf.setXIncludeAware(false);

//Do unmarshall operation
Source xmlSource = new SAXSource(spf.newSAXParser().getXMLReader(),
                                new InputSource(new StringReader(xml)));
JAXBContext jc = JAXBContext.newInstance(Object.class);
Unmarshaller um = jc.createUnmarshaller();
um.unmarshal(xmlSource);

```
### XPathExpression[¶](#xpathexpression "Permanent link")

**Since `javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpression` can not be configured securely by itself, the untrusted data must be parsed through another securable XML parser first.**

For example:

```
DocumentBuilderFactory df = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
df.setAttribute(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD, "");
df.setAttribute(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA, "");
DocumentBuilder builder = df.newDocumentBuilder();
String result = new XPathExpression().evaluate( builder.parse(
                            new ByteArrayInputStream(xml.getBytes())) );

```
### java.beans.XMLDecoder[¶](#javabeansxmldecoder "Permanent link")

**The [readObject()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/XMLDecoder.html#readObject--) method in this class is fundamentally unsafe.**

**Not only is the XML it parses subject to XXE, but the method can be used to construct any Java object, and [execute arbitrary code as described here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14307442/is-it-safe-to-use-xmldecoder-to-read-document-files).**

**And there is no way to make use of this class safe except to trust or properly validate the input being passed into it.**

**As such, we'd strongly recommend completely avoiding the use of this class and replacing it with a safe or properly configured XML parser as described elsewhere in this cheat sheet.**

### Other XML Parsers[¶](#other-xml-parsers "Permanent link")

**There are many third-party libraries that parse XML either directly or through their use of other libraries. Please test and verify their XML parser is secure against XXE by default.** If the parser is not secure by default, look for flags supported by the parser to disable all possible external resource inclusions like the examples given above. If there's no control exposed to the outside, make sure the untrusted content is passed through a secure parser first and then passed to insecure third-party parser similar to how the Unmarshaller is secured.

#### Spring Framework MVC/OXM XXE Vulnerabilities[¶](#spring-framework-mvcoxm-xxe-vulnerabilities "Permanent link")

\*\*Some XXE vulnerabilities were found in [Spring OXM](https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2013-4152) and [Spring MVC](https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2013-7315) . The following versions of the Spring Framework are vulnerable to XXE:

* **3.0.0** to **3.2.3** (Spring OXM & Spring MVC)
* **4.0.0.M1** (Spring OXM)
* **4.0.0.M1-4.0.0.M2** (Spring MVC)

There were other issues as well that were fixed later, so to fully address these issues, Spring recommends you upgrade to Spring Framework 3.2.8+ or 4.0.2+.

For Spring OXM, this is referring to the use of org.springframework.oxm.jaxb.Jaxb2Marshaller. **Note that the CVE for Spring OXM specifically indicates that two XML parsing situations are up to the developer to get right, and the other two are the responsibility of Spring and were fixed to address this CVE.**

Here's what they say:

Two situations developers must handle:

* For a `DOMSource`, the XML has already been parsed by user code and that code is responsible for protecting against XXE.
* For a `StAXSource`, the XMLStreamReader has already been created by user code and that code is responsible for protecting against XXE.

The issue Spring fixed:

For SAXSource and StreamSource instances, Spring processed external entities by default thereby creating this vulnerability.

Here's an example of using a StreamSource that was vulnerable, but is now safe, if you are using a fixed version of Spring OXM or Spring MVC:

```
import org.springframework.oxm.Jaxb2Marshaller;
import org.springframework.oxm.jaxb.Jaxb2Marshaller;

Jaxb2Marshaller marshaller = new Jaxb2Marshaller();
// Must cast return Object to whatever type you are unmarshalling
marshaller.unmarshal(new StreamSource(new StringReader(some_string_containing_XML));

```

So, per the [Spring OXM CVE writeup](https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2013-4152), the above is now safe. But if you were to use a DOMSource or StAXSource instead, it would be up to you to configure those sources to be safe from XXE.

#### Castor[¶](#castor "Permanent link")

**Castor is a data binding framework for Java. It allows conversion between Java objects, XML, and relational tables. The XML features in Castor prior to version 1.3.3 are vulnerable to XXE, and should be upgraded to the latest version.** For additional information, check the official [XML configuration file](https://castor-data-binding.github.io/castor/reference-guide/reference/xml/xml-properties.html)

## .NET[¶](#net "Permanent link")

**Up-to-date information for XXE injection in .NET is taken directly from the [web application of unit tests by Dean Fleming](https://github.com/deanf1/dotnet-security-unit-tests), which covers all currently supported .NET XML parsers, and has test cases that demonstrate when they are safe from XXE injection and when they are not, but these tests are only with injection from file and not direct DTD (used by DoS attacks).**

For DoS attacks using a direct DTD (such as the [Billion laughs attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack)), a [separate testing application from Josh Grossman at Bounce Security](https://github.com/BounceSecurity/BillionLaughsTester) has been created to verify that .NET >=4.5.2 is safe from these attacks.

Previously, this information was based on some older articles which may not be 100% accurate including:

* [James Jardine's excellent .NET XXE article](https://www.jardinesoftware.net/2016/05/26/xxe-and-net/).
* [Guidance from Microsoft on how to prevent XXE and XML Denial of Service in .NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee335713.aspx).

### Overview of .NET Parser Safety Levels[¶](#overview-of-net-parser-safety-levels "Permanent link")

\*\*Below is an overview of all supported .NET XML parsers and their default safety levels. More details about each parser are included after this list.

\*\*XDocument (Ling to XML)

This parser is protected from external entities at .NET Framework version 4.5.2 and protected from Billion Laughs at version 4.5.2 or greater, but it is uncertain if this parser is protected from Billion Laughs before version 4.5.2.

#### XmlDocument, XmlTextReader, XPathNavigator default safety levels[¶](#xmldocument-xmltextreader-xpathnavigator-default-safety-levels "Permanent link")

These parsers are vulnerable to external entity attacks and Billion Laughs at versions below version 4.5.2 but protected at versions equal or greater than 4.5.2.

#### XmlDictionaryReader, XmlNodeReader, XmlReader default safety levels[¶](#xmldictionaryreader-xmlnodereader-xmlreader-default-safety-levels "Permanent link")

These parsers are not vulnerable to external entity attacks or Billion Laughs before or after version 4.5.2. Also, at or greater than versions ≥4.5.2, these libraries won't even process the in-line DTD by default. Even if you change the default to allow processing a DTD, if a DoS attempt is performed an exception will still be thrown as documented above.

### ASP.NET[¶](#aspnet "Permanent link")

ASP.NET applications ≥ .NET 4.5.2 must also ensure setting the `<httpRuntime targetFramework="..." />` in their `Web.config` to ≥4.5.2 or risk being vulnerable regardless or the actual .NET version. Omitting this tag will also result in unsafe-by-default behavior.

For the purpose of understanding the above table, the `.NET Framework Version` for an ASP.NET applications is either the .NET version the application was build with or the httpRuntime's `targetFramework` (Web.config), **whichever is lower**.

This configuration tag should not be confused with a simmilar configuration tag: `<compilation targetFramework="..." />` or the assemblies / projects targetFramework, which are **not** sufficient for achieving secure-by-default behaviour as advertised in the above table.

### LINQ to XML[¶](#linq-to-xml "Permanent link")

**Both the `XElement` and `XDocument` objects in the `System.Xml.Linq` library are safe from XXE injection from external file and DoS attack by default.** `XElement` parses only the elements within the XML file, so DTDs are ignored altogether. `XDocument` has XmlResolver [disabled by default](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/linq/linq-xml-security) so it's safe from SSRF. Whilst DTDs are [enabled by default](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System.Xml.Linq/System/Xml/Linq/XLinq.cs,71f4626a3d6f9bad), from Framework versions ≥4.5.2, it is **not** vulnerable to DoS as noted but it may be vulnerable in earlier Framework versions. For more information, see [Microsoft's guidance on how to prevent XXE and XML Denial of Service in .NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee335713.aspx)

### XmlDictionaryReader[¶](#xmldictionaryreader "Permanent link")

**`System.Xml.XmlDictionaryReader` is safe by default, as when it attempts to parse the DTD, the compiler throws an exception saying that "CData elements not valid at top level of an XML document". It becomes unsafe if constructed with a different unsafe XML parser.**

### XmlDocument[¶](#xmldocument "Permanent link")

**Prior to .NET Framework version 4.5.2, `System.Xml.XmlDocument` is unsafe by default. The `XmlDocument` object has an `XmlResolver` object within it that needs to be set to null in versions prior to 4.5.2. In versions 4.5.2 and up, this `XmlResolver` is set to null by default.**

The following example shows how it is made safe:

```
 static void LoadXML()
 {
   string xxePayload = "<!DOCTYPE doc [<!ENTITY win SYSTEM 'file:///C:/Users/testdata2.txt'>]>"
                     + "<doc>&win;</doc>";
   string xml = "<?xml version='1.0' ?>" + xxePayload;

   XmlDocument xmlDoc = new XmlDocument();
   // Setting this to NULL disables DTDs - Its NOT null by default.
   xmlDoc.XmlResolver = null;
   xmlDoc.LoadXml(xml);
   Console.WriteLine(xmlDoc.InnerText);
   Console.ReadLine();
 }

```

**For .NET Framework version ≥4.5.2, this is safe by default**.

`XmlDocument` can become unsafe if you create your own nonnull `XmlResolver` with default or unsafe settings. If you need to enable DTD processing, instructions on how to do so safely are described in detail in the [referenced MSDN article](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee335713.aspx).

### XmlNodeReader[¶](#xmlnodereader "Permanent link")

`System.Xml.XmlNodeReader` objects are safe by default and will ignore DTDs even when constructed with an unsafe parser or wrapped in another unsafe parser.

### XmlReader[¶](#xmlreader_1 "Permanent link")

`System.Xml.XmlReader` objects are safe by default.

They are set by default to have their ProhibitDtd property set to false in .NET Framework versions 4.0 and earlier, or their `DtdProcessing` property set to Prohibit in .NET versions 4.0 and later.

Additionally, in .NET versions 4.5.2 and later, the `XmlReaderSettings` belonging to the `XmlReader` has its `XmlResolver` set to null by default, which provides an additional layer of safety.

Therefore, `XmlReader` objects will only become unsafe in version 4.5.2 and up if both the `DtdProcessing` property is set to Parse and the `XmlReaderSetting`'s `XmlResolver` is set to a nonnull XmlResolver with default or unsafe settings. If you need to enable DTD processing, instructions on how to do so safely are described in detail in the [referenced MSDN article](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee335713.aspx).

### XmlTextReader[¶](#xmltextreader "Permanent link")

`System.Xml.XmlTextReader` is **unsafe** by default in .NET Framework versions prior to 4.5.2. Here is how to make it safe in various .NET versions:

#### Prior to .NET 4.0[¶](#prior-to-net-40 "Permanent link")

In .NET Framework versions prior to 4.0, DTD parsing behavior for `XmlReader` objects like `XmlTextReader` are controlled by the Boolean `ProhibitDtd` property found in the `System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings` and `System.Xml.XmlTextReader` classes.

Set these values to true to disable inline DTDs completely.

```
XmlTextReader reader = new XmlTextReader(stream);
// NEEDED because the default is FALSE!!
reader.ProhibitDtd = true;

```
#### .NET 4.0 - .NET 4.5.2[¶](#net-40-net-452 "Permanent link")

**In .NET Framework version 4.0, DTD parsing behavior has been changed. The `ProhibitDtd` property has been deprecated in favor of the new `DtdProcessing` property.**

**However, they didn't change the default settings so `XmlTextReader` is still vulnerable to XXE by default.**

**Setting `DtdProcessing` to `Prohibit` causes the runtime to throw an exception if a `<!DOCTYPE>` element is present in the XML.**

To set this value yourself, it looks like this:

```
XmlTextReader reader = new XmlTextReader(stream);
// NEEDED because the default is Parse!!
reader.DtdProcessing = DtdProcessing.Prohibit;

```

Alternatively, you can set the `DtdProcessing` property to `Ignore`, which will not throw an exception on encountering a `<!DOCTYPE>` element but will simply skip over it and not process it. Finally, you can set `DtdProcessing` to `Parse` if you do want to allow and process inline DTDs.

#### .NET 4.5.2 and later[¶](#net-452-and-later "Permanent link")

In .NET Framework versions 4.5.2 and up, `XmlTextReader`'s internal `XmlResolver` is set to null by default, making the `XmlTextReader` ignore DTDs by default. The `XmlTextReader` can become unsafe if you create your own nonnull `XmlResolver` with default or unsafe settings.

### XPathNavigator[¶](#xpathnavigator "Permanent link")

`System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator` is **unsafe** by default in .NET Framework versions prior to 4.5.2.

This is due to the fact that it implements `IXPathNavigable` objects like `XmlDocument`, which are also unsafe by default in versions prior to 4.5.2.

You can make `XPathNavigator` safe by giving it a safe parser like `XmlReader` (which is safe by default) in the `XPathDocument`'s constructor.

Here is an example:

```
XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create("example.xml");
XPathDocument doc = new XPathDocument(reader);
XPathNavigator nav = doc.CreateNavigator();
string xml = nav.InnerXml.ToString();

```

For .NET Framework version ≥4.5.2, XPathNavigator is **safe by default**.

### XslCompiledTransform[¶](#xslcompiledtransform "Permanent link")

`System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform` (an XML transformer) is safe by default as long as the parser it's given is safe.

It is safe by default because the default parser of the `Transform()` methods is an `XmlReader`, which is safe by default (per above).

[The source code for this method is here.](http://www.dotnetframework.org/default.aspx/4%400/4%400/DEVDIV_TFS/Dev10/Releases/RTMRel/ndp/fx/src/Xml/System/Xml/Xslt/XslCompiledTransform%40cs/1305376/XslCompiledTransform%40cs)

Some of the `Transform()` methods accept an `XmlReader` or `IXPathNavigable` (e.g., `XmlDocument`) as an input, and if you pass in an unsafe XML Parser then the `Transform` will also be unsafe.

## iOS[¶](#ios "Permanent link")

### libxml2[¶](#libxml2_1 "Permanent link")

**iOS includes the C/C++ libxml2 library described above, so that guidance applies if you are using libxml2 directly.**

**However, the version of libxml2 provided up through iOS6 is prior to version 2.9 of libxml2 (which protects against XXE by default).**

### NSXMLDocument[¶](#nsxmldocument "Permanent link")

**iOS also provides an `NSXMLDocument` type, which is built on top of libxml2.**

**However, `NSXMLDocument` provides some additional protections against XXE that aren't available in libxml2 directly.**

Per the 'NSXMLDocument External Entity Restriction API' section of this [page](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/Foundation/RN-Foundation-iOS/Foundation_iOS5.html):

* iOS4 and earlier: All external entities are loaded by default.
* iOS5 and later: Only entities that don't require network access are loaded. (which is safer)

**However, to completely disable XXE in an `NSXMLDocument` in any version of iOS you simply specify `NSXMLNodeLoadExternalEntitiesNever` when creating the `NSXMLDocument`.**

## PHP[¶](#php "Permanent link")

**When using the default XML parser (based on libxml2), PHP 8.0 and newer [prevent XXE by default](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.libxml-disable-entity-loader.php).**

**For PHP versions prior to 8.0, per [the PHP documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.libxml-set-external-entity-loader.php), the following should be set when using the default PHP XML parser in order to prevent XXE:**

```
libxml_set_external_entity_loader(null);

```

A description of how to abuse this in PHP is presented in a good [SensePost article](https://www.sensepost.com/blog/2014/revisting-xxe-and-abusing-protocols/) describing a cool PHP based XXE vulnerability that was fixed in Facebook.

## Python[¶](#python "Permanent link")

The Python 3 official documentation contains a section on [xml vulnerabilities](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.html#xml-vulnerabilities). As of the 1st January 2020 Python 2 is no longer supported, however the Python website still contains [some legacy documentation](https://docs.Python.org/2/library/xml.html#xml-vulnerabilities).

The table below shows you which various XML parsing modules in Python 3 are vulnerable to certain XXE attacks.

| Attack Type | sax | etree | minidom | pulldom | xmlrpc |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Billion Laughs | Vulnerable | Vulnerable | Vulnerable | Vulnerable | Vulnerable |
| Quadratic Blowup | Vulnerable | Vulnerable | Vulnerable | Vulnerable | Vulnerable |
| External Entity Expansion | Safe | Safe | Safe | Safe | Safe |
| DTD Retrieval | Safe | Safe | Safe | Safe | Safe |
| Decompression Bomb | Safe | Safe | Safe | Safe | Vulnerable |

To protect your application from the applicable attacks, [two packages](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.html#the-defusedxml-and-defusedexpat-packages) exist to help you sanitize your input and protect your application against DDoS and remote attacks.

| Threat Agents / Attack Vectors | | Security Weakness | | Impacts | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App. Specific | Exploitability: 2 | Prevalence: 2 | Detectability: 3 | Technical: 3 | Business ? |
| Attackers can exploit vulnerable XML processors if they can upload XML or include hostile content in an XML document, exploiting vulnerable code, dependencies or integrations. | | By default, many older XML processors allow specification of an external entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing. | | These flaws can be used to extract data, execute a remote request from the server, scan internal systems, perform a denial-of-service attack, as well as execute other attacks. The business impact depends on the protection needs of all affected application and data. | |

| Is the Application Vulnerable? Applications and in particular XML-based web services or downstream integrations might be vulnerable to attack if: \* The application accepts XML directly or XML uploads, especially from untrusted sources, or inserts untrusted data into XML documents, which is then parsed by an XML processor. \* Any of the XML processors in the application or SOAP based web services has [document type definitions (DTDs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition) enabled. As the exact mechanism for disabling DTD processing varies by processor, it is good practice to consult a reference such as the [OWASP Cheat Sheet ‘XXE Prevention’](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html). \* If the application uses SAML for identity processing within federated security or single sign on (SSO) purposes. SAML uses XML for identity assertions, and may be vulnerable. \* If the application uses SOAP prior to version 1.2, it is likely susceptible to XXE attacks if XML entities are being passed to the SOAP framework. Being vulnerable to XXE attacks likely means that the application is vulnerable to denial of service attacks including the Billion Laughs attack | How to Prevent Developer training is essential to identify and mitigate XXE. Besides that, preventing XXE requires: \* Whenever possible, use less complex data formats such as JSON, and avoiding serialization of sensitive data. \* Patch or upgrade all XML processors and libraries in use by the application or on the underlying operating system. Use dependency checkers. Update SOAP to SOAP 1.2 or higher. \* Disable XML external entity and DTD processing in all XML parsers in the application, as per the [OWASP Cheat Sheet ‘XXE Prevention’](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html). \* Implement positive (“whitelisting”) server-side input validation, filtering, or sanitization to prevent hostile data within XML documents, headers, or nodes. \* Verify that XML or XSL file upload functionality validates incoming XML using XSD validation or similar. \* [SAST](/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools) tools can help detect XXE in source code, although manual code review is the best alternative in large, complex applications with many integrations. If these controls are not possible, consider using virtual patching, API security gateways, or Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to detect, monitor, and block XXE attacks. |

| Example Attack Scenarios Numerous public XXE issues have been discovered, including attacking embedded devices. XXE occurs in a lot of unexpected places, including deeply nested dependencies. The easiest way is to upload a malicious XML file, if accepted: **Scenario #1**: The attacker attempts to extract data from the server: **`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>`** **`<!DOCTYPE foo [`** **`<!ELEMENT foo ANY >`** **`<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>`** **`<foo>&xxe</foo>`** **Scenario #2**: An attacker probes the server’s private network by changing the above ENTITY line to: **`<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "https://192.168.1.1/private" >]>`** **Scenario #3**: An attacker attempts a denial-of-service attack by including a potentially endless file: **`<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///dev/random" >]>`** | References **OWASP** \* [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard](/www-project-application-security-verification-standard) \* [OWASP Testing Guide: Testing for XML Injection](/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/07-Testing_for_XML_Injection) \* [OWASP XXE Vulnerability](/www-community/vulnerabilities/XML_External_Entity_%28XXE%29_Processing) \* [OWASP Cheat Sheet: XXE Prevention](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html) \* [OWASP Cheat Sheet: XML Security](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)  **External** \* [CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XXE](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html) \* [Billion Laughs Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack) \* [SAML Security XML External Entity Attack](https://secretsofappsecurity.blogspot.tw/2017/01/saml-security-xml-external-entity-attack.html) \* [Detecting and exploiting XXE in SAML Interfaces](https://web-in-security.blogspot.tw/2014/11/detecting-and-exploiting-xxe-in-saml.html) |
