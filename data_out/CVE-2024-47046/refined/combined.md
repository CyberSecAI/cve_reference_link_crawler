SSA-881356: Multiple Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Simcenter Femap

| Publication Date: | 2024-12-10 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-12-10 |
| Current Version: | V1.0 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.8 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 7.3 |

SUMMARY

Simcenter Femap contains multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the application reads files in BDF file formats. If a user is tricked to open a malicious file with any of the affected products, this could lead the application to crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

Siemens has released a new version for Simcenter Femap V2406 and recommends to update to the latest version. Siemens is preparing further fix versions and recommends countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.
