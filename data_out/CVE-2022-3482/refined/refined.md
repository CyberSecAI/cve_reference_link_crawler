{
  "CVE-2022-3482": {
    "description": "Release names visible in public projects despite release set as project members only.",
    "root_cause": "The tag page in public projects discloses release names even when releases are restricted to only project members.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper permission check on the tag page when rendering release information."
    ],
    "impact": "Disclosure of release names to unauthenticated users, even when the release visibility is set to 'Only Project Members'. This could expose sensitive information about project releases.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Accessing the public tag page (`https://gitlab.com/<NameSpace>/<ProjectName>/-/tags`) of a GitLab project."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to be able to access the public tag page of a GitLab project; no authentication required."
  }
