Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-24135:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of user-provided input in the `mac` parameter within the `/goform/WriteFacMac` page of the Jensen Eagle 1200AC router firmware. This unsanitized input is directly passed to the `doSystemCmd` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. By injecting shell commands into the `mac` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the router.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router. This could lead to:
    *   Complete compromise of the device.
    *   Data exfiltration or manipulation.
    *   Installation of malware.
    *   Denial-of-service attacks.
    *   Network pivoting.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/goform/WriteFacMac` page.
*   **`mac` Parameter:** The malicious commands are injected via the `mac` parameter within this request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface. This could be from the local network or remotely, depending on the router's configuration and if remote access is enabled.
*   **Authentication (Partial):** While the provided proof of concept (PoC) script includes a login procedure to obtain a session cookie, it also bypasses the authentication by setting the cookie value directly to the value retrived from the login. This suggests that the vulnerability can be exploited with valid credentials, although it doesn't explicitly require a full authentication.
*   **Understanding of the API:** The attacker needs to know the specific URL (`/goform/WriteFacMac`) and the vulnerable parameter (`mac`).

**Additional details:**

*   The provided PoC script demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability:
    *   It first logs into the router using default credentials `admin/81dc9bdb52d04dc20036dbd8313ed055` which are MD5 encoded
    *   It then injects the command `ls -lah` via the `mac` parameter, redirecting the output to `/webroot/output.txt`.
    *   Finally, it fetches the contents of `/webroot/output.txt`, revealing the command execution result.
*   The vulnerability is present in Jensen Eagle 1200AC firmware version `V15.03.06.33_en`.
