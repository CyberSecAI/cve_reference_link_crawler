The provided content contains information about CVE-2021-44405.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `StartZoomFocus` command's JSON parameter parser assumes that the `param` JSON element is an object. If the provided JSON `param` is not an object, an assertion failure occurs, causing the `cgiserver.cgi` process to crash and the device to reboot.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Input Validation: The JSON parser does not validate that the `param` field is a JSON object before attempting to access its members using the subscription operator.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: By sending a specially crafted HTTP request with an invalid `param` value, an attacker can cause the device to reboot, rendering it temporarily unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP request: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint with a JSON payload where the "param" field is not an object.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the device: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.
- No authentication required: While most of the vulnerable commands require a logged in user, the report notes it is possible to exploit these vulnerabilities using TALOS-2021-1420 (which allows unauthenticated access).

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `cgi_param_parse` function, specifically at the line marked as `[5]` where the API-specific JSON parser is called with the non-object `param`.
- The `Json::Value::operator[]` is used to access elements within the JSON, which asserts if it is called on a non-object.
- The `cgiserver.cgi` process crashes due to this assertion failure, leading to a device reboot.
