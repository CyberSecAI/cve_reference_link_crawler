{
  "vulnerability": "Memory Leak",
  "root_cause": "The `ssam_request_sync_init()` function within the Surface Aggregator subsystem may fail, leading to a memory leak because the allocated request is not freed.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Resource Leak",
    "Missing Error Handling"
  ],
  "impact": "A memory leak can cause a denial of service by exhausting available memory over time.",
  "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability occurs within the Surface Aggregator subsystem of the Linux kernel. If `ssam_request_sync_init()` fails, the allocated `rqst` memory is leaked. A local attacker might be able to trigger this by interacting with the surface aggregator driver.",
   "required_capabilities": "A local attacker with the ability to interact with the Surface Aggregator subsystem could trigger the memory leak."
