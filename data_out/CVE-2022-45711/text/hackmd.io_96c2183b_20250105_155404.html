# ip-com-8-1
vendor:IP-COM
product:M50
version:V15.11.0.33(10768)
type:Remote Command Injection
author:Yifeng Li, Wolin Zhuang;
## Vulnerability description
We found an Command Injection vulnerability in IP-COM Technology IP-COM’s M50 routers with firmware which was released recently, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands from a crafted GET request.
## Remote Command Injection vulnerability
In formSetNetCheckTools function, the parameter “hostname”is insufficient filtered which allows the user can bypass and diliver the string.And 'host\_name\_16407'is direct strncpy from 'hostname' so we can control the "host\_name\_16407" such as “-h%0aping%20x.x.x.x%20-w%2-5%0a ” to attack the OS.
![](https://i.imgur.com/5T3aytJ.png)
As we can see, before host\_name\_16407 is put into cmd line, there was not filter at all, which can be fully controlled by attacker.

## PoC
### Remote Command Injection
We set the value of “hostname” as -h%0aping%20x.x.x.x%20-w%2-5%0a and the router will excute ping command.
GET /action/setFixTools?networkTools=2&hostname=-h%0aping%20x.x.x.x%20-w%2-5%0a
