| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1194470#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-01-10 14:47:13 UTC  ``` The somewhat peculiar systemd integration of watchman caused me to create a security issue in the watchman@.socket unit:  ``` ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/chown %i:users /run/watchman/%i-state ```  /run/watchman is a public sticky-bit directory with mode 1777.  The problem here is that watchman should continue working as normal on the command line without using systemd. This means that an unprivileged watchman instance must be able to create /run/watchman/$USER-state. This is why /run/watchman is a public sticky-bit directory.  The systemd socket unit on the other hand must be able to create the socket *and* the intermediate directory if the socket unit is started. The intermediate directory needs to have the correct permissions. The chown line above means, however, that if the unprivileged user places a symlink into /run/watchman/$USER-state, that the chown will follow that symlink and e.g. give ownership of /etc to the unprivileged user.  I am currently working on an update for Factory that fixes this. Since this is SUSE packaging specific we'll need one of our SUSE CNA CVEs for this. Watchman is also in Leap so some maintenance updates are in order there. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1194470#c1)  Johannes Segitz   2022-01-10 14:50:07 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2022-21944 ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1194470#c2)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-01-10 15:06:01 UTC  ``` The new approach is to call a ExecStartPre script as the unprivileged user. This script will create the state directory in a safe-ish way. The sticky bit directory is shaky for this purpose but I don't see a simple way around that. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1194470#c3)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2022-01-10 15:40:06 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1194470) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/945357> Factory / watchman ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1194470#c4)  Marcus Meissner   2022-01-11 12:43:23 UTC  ``` 15.2 is eol... but can you also submit to  openSUSE:Backports:SLE-15-SP3:Update/watchman   for Leap 15.3 and PackageHub 15-sp3  and optionally to openSUSE:Backports:SLE-15-SP1:Update/watchman openSUSE:Backports:SLE-15-SP2:Update/watchman ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1194470#c5)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2022-01-11 13:00:06 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1194470) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/945580> 15.2 / watchman ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1194470#c7)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2022-01-17 12:40:05 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1194470) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/946942> Backports:SLE-15-SP3 / watchman ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1194470#c8)  Matthias Gerstner   2022-01-17 13:02:49 UTC  ``` An update is now out towards Backports:SLE-15-SP3 which should also cover Leap 15.3. If further updates are required for Backports:SLE-15-SP{1,2} then please tell me. Leaving it to reactive security to close this bug if all is cared for. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1194470#c9)  Swamp Workflow Management   2022-01-17 23:19:25 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2022:0016-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has one errata is now available.
