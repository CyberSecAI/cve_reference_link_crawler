Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a negative size parameter passed to `memcpy` within the `load_input_picture` function in `libavcodec/mpegvideo_enc.c`. This happens due to a flaw in how image dimensions are handled, specifically for 1-line, 1-column images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Negative-size-param:** The core vulnerability is the use of a negative size in a `memcpy` operation. This is a memory corruption issue.
-   **Incorrect dimension handling:** The issue is triggered by specific image dimensions, indicating flawed logic in handling edge cases (1x1 images) within the encoding process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Memory Corruption:** The negative size parameter in memcpy leads to memory corruption, as the function attempts to copy data from an invalid location or write to a negative memory address range.
-   **Crash:** The AddressSanitizer (ASAN) log indicates that this memory corruption leads to a program crash, making it a denial-of-service vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Malicious Input File:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted input file (`poc21ffmpeg`) to the FFmpeg tool. This indicates that an attacker needs to provide the malicious file to the FFmpeg user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious input file that triggers the flawed size calculation, which leads to the negative size parameter being passed to `memcpy`.

**Additional details:**
- The specific location of the vulnerability is in `libavcodec/mpegvideo_enc.c:1216:21`.
- The issue was triggered in FFmpeg version 7.0
- The issue was fixed in commit `96449cfeaeb95fcfd7a2b8d9ccf7719e97471ed1` which addressed the faulty handling of 1-line and 1-column images.
