The provided content contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2023-43497.

**CVE-2023-43497**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how Jenkins handles uploaded files processed via the Stapler web framework and the `MultipartFormDataParser` API. Specifically, it creates temporary files in the system's temporary directory with default permissions, which can be overly permissive.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Insecure temporary file creation: The temporary files created by Jenkins for uploaded content are placed in the system temporary directory using the default permissions.
    *   Insufficient permission restrictions: The default permissions for newly created files can allow other users to read and potentially write to the file.

*   **Impact:** If the permissions on the temporary directory are overly permissive, attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system may be able to read and write the temporary file before it is used by Jenkins, potentially leading to information disclosure or modification.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker needs to have access to the Jenkins controller file system.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to access the shared temporary directory used by Jenkins (common in Linux environments).
    *   The attack involves race condition, where the attacker tries to access or modify the temporary file before Jenkins process it.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have access to the Jenkins controller's file system.
    *   The attacker must be able to access the system temporary directory (typically Linux).
