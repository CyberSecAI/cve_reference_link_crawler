Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization or parameterized queries when handling the `id` parameter in the `pjActionGetStocks` action of the `pjFront` controller. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection. This is evident from the provided payloads that demonstrate boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQLi techniques.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially steal all information from the database of the web application.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Depending on database permissions and the context of the application, an attacker may be able to perform unauthorized actions on the database server or even gain control of the server by injecting malicious database queries.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `id` parameter in a GET request. Specifically, the vulnerable endpoint seems to be associated with fetching stock data.
*   **Manipulated 'id' Parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter with SQL injection payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
*   **Knowledge of SQLi:** The attacker must have knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payloads.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Based on the provided information, it appears that the vulnerable endpoint is accessible without prior authentication.
