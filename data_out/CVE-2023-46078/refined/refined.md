- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. Specific impacts will vary on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could craft a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, performs actions on the vulnerable site without their consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need prior authentication, but needs to trick an authenticated user into triggering a crafted request.
