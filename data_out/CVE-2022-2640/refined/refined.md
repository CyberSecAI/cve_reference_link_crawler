The provided content is related to CVE-2022-2640.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause of CVE-2022-2640 is the use of inadequate encryption strength for config-files in Horner Automation's Remote Compact Controller (RCC) 972.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Inadequate Encryption Strength (CWE-326):** The config files are encrypted using a weak XOR encryption, which is susceptible to reverse engineering.
- **Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key (CWE-321):** The device uses a static encryption key, which can be discovered and exploited.
- **Excessive Reliance on Global Variables (CWE-1108):** The firmware uses global variables, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the inadequate encryption strength vulnerability (CVE-2022-2640) could allow an attacker to obtain credentials to access services like FTP and HTTP, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the device.
- Exploitation of hard-coded cryptographic key (CVE-2022-2641) can enable unauthorized changes, remote code execution, or denial-of-service.
- Exploitation of excessive reliance on global variables (CVE-2022-2642) can expose sensitive information

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), with low attack complexity (AC:L)
- No privileges are needed (PR:N) and no user interaction is required (UI:N)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have network access to the device.
- No specific privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerabilities.

**Additional details:**
- The advisory mentions that no public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities
- The advisory recommends updating the firmware to version 15.60 or later to mitigate the vulnerabilities
- It is recommended to minimize network exposure, isolate control system networks, and use secure remote access methods such as VPN.
- The affected device is the Remote Compact Controller (RCC) 972 with firmware version 15.40.
- The advisory is from CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) and it refers to Horner Automation as the vendor.
