This document describes multiple vulnerabilities affecting Horner Automation's Remote Compact Controller (RCC) 972, and **CVE-2022-2640** is one of them.

**CVE-2022-2640:**

*   **Root Cause:** Inadequate encryption strength.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The configuration files of the affected device are encrypted using a weak XOR encryption, making it vulnerable to reverse engineering.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to obtain credentials to run services such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable with low attack complexity.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs network access to the affected device, with no special privileges or user interaction required.

**Additional Vulnerabilities (Not CVE-2022-2640, but in the same advisory):**

*   **CVE-2022-2641:** Use of a hard-coded cryptographic key. This allows unauthorized changes to the device, remote code execution, or denial of service.
*   **CVE-2022-2642:** Excessive reliance on global variables, which could expose sensitive values and variable keys.
