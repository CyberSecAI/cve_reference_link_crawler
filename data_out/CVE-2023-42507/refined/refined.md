**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) due to improper handling of the number of lines in a project file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure.
- Arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Opening a specially crafted project file (KMDF file) in OnSinView2.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious KMDF file.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the crafted file in the vulnerable software.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in OnSinView2 versions 2.0.1 and earlier.
- The vendor has released version 2.0.2 and later with fixes for this vulnerability which also includes measures to prevent crafted project files from being opened.
- Project files saved with version 2.0.1 and earlier can be re-saved with 2.0.2 or later to enable tamper proof feature. Project files saved with 2.0.2 or later cannot be opened with version 2.0.1 or earlier
