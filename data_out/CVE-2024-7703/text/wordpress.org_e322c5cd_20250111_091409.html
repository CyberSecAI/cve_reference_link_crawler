Awesome work team! Truly love the plugin’s interface and the flexibility it provides into the free version I recently downloaded this plugin on my community website, and am truly amazed to see such feature-rich plugin. The only drawback I feel is they currently do not provide any support to the payment gateway that supports Indian currency, however I have checked that they do provide other payment gateways compatible with their premium version. I still will give them a 5 star, as the team deserves this for the work they have done!!

Ich kämpfe mit dem Plugin schon seit Monaten. Das Schlimmste ist, dass ich die Premium-Version gekauft habe. Der Code, die Ausführung, die Bezahlprozesse – alles will einfach nicht funktionieren!
Es gibt keine einfache Methode, sich an jemanden zu wenden. Mann muss tausende Schritte unternehmen, um jemanden zu erreichen.
Irgendwann ist man mit der Geduld am Ende!

The documentation and videos make it clear and easy to set up, which is great.
Also, support is fast and helpful whenever I have questions. The product works as promised, and I’m very happy with it. I feel sure that any future questions I have will be answered well. After checking different membership options, I’m glad I chose this one.

it is easy-to-use and works well, supports PayPal and Stripe, and has features like controlling content protection, signup and login forms, etc. It might take a little time to learn, but it’s reliable and does what you need. A big recommendation for it!

Very intuitive and easy to set up, and really professionally made.There are no complicated and strange ways to do things, it is simple and easy to work with.
I really love this plugin, after working with many other member plugins.
