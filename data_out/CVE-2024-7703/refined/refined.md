Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-7703:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling SVG file uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize SVG files, allowing malicious code embedded within them to be stored on the server. This code is then executed in the browsers of users who access the file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts within the context of the website, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Data theft and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SVG File Upload:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript code. The vulnerable code is located in the `arm_upload_front`, `arm_upload_cover`, and `arm_upload_profile` functions within the `class.arm_members_activity.php` file

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least "Subscriber" level access (or higher)

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Software:** ARMember â€“ Membership Plugin, Content Restriction, Member Levels, User Profile & User signup plugin for WordPress
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions up to and including 4.0.37 are vulnerable.
*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 4.0.38.
*  The vulnerability was discovered by a researcher named wesley (wcraft)

The provided information is consistent with a typical stored XSS vulnerability arising from improper handling of user-supplied data. The attack vector is through uploading a malicious SVG file, and the impact is arbitrary script execution in the browser of users accessing the file.
