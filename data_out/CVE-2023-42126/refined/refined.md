Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies within the `GDBackupSvc` service of G DATA Total Security. The service can be tricked into creating files with overly permissive Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACLs) via symbolic link manipulation.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core weakness is the service's failure to properly validate or sanitize the path used when creating files. This allows a local attacker to utilize a symbolic link to manipulate file creation and associated permissions.
* **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges, leading to full system compromise.
* **Attack vectors**: Local. The attacker needs to be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system first. They then exploit the service by creating a symbolic link that points to a location where they desire to create files. The `GDBackupSvc` service will then create a file in this location with a permissive DACL allowing the attacker to modify it.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. They need to be able to create a symbolic link in a location accessible by the vulnerable service.
