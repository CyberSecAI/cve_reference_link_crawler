### Description

This High severity Path Traversal vulnerability was introduced in version 6.13.0 of Confluence Data Center.

This Path Traversal vulnerability, with a CVSS Score of 8.3, allows an unauthenticated attacker to exploit an undefinable vulnerability which has high impact to confidentiality, high impact to integrity, high impact to availability, and requires user interaction.

**Mitigation Options**

1. This fix was included in the Confluence Cloud Migration Assistant plugin (which we sometimes refer to as CCMA), and version 3.9.5 (or later) contains the fix. So for a mitigation step, all you need to do is login to Confluence as an admin, select General Configuration >> Manage Apps and then locate and upgrade the CCMA plugin to 3.9.5 or later.
2. The other option is you can deactivate the CCMA plugin altogether if don't plan for the upgrade.
