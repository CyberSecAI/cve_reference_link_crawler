# March 2024 Security Bulletin

This bulletin addresses vulnerabilities that have been resolved in Atlassian self-managed products. Cloud products are not affected.

The vulnerabilities reported in this Security Bulletin include 24 high-severity vulnerabilities and 1 critical-severity vulnerability which have been fixed in new versions of our products, released in the last month. These vulnerabilities are discovered via our Bug Bounty program, pen-testing processes, and third-party library scans.

To fix all the vulnerabilities impacting your product(s), Atlassian recommends patching your instances to the latest version or one of the Fixed Versions for each product below. The listed Fixed Versions for each product are current as of March 19, 2024 (date of publication); visit the linked product Release Notes for the most up-to-date versions.

**NOTE**: The vulnerabilities included in monthly Security Bulletins present a lower impact than those published via Critical Security Advisories. Customers can expect to receive those high-priority patches outside of our monthly schedule as necessary.

To search for CVEs or check your product versions for disclosed vulnerabilities, check the [Vulnerability Disclosure Portal.](https://www.atlassian.com/trust/data-protection/vulnerabilities)

### Description

This High severity Path Traversal vulnerability was introduced in version 6.13.0 of Confluence Data Center.

This Path Traversal vulnerability, with a CVSS Score of 8.3, allows an unauthenticated attacker to exploit an undefinable vulnerability which has high impact to confidentiality, high impact to integrity, high impact to availability, and requires user interaction.

**Mitigation Options**

1. This fix was included in the Confluence Cloud Migration Assistant plugin (which we sometimes refer to as CCMA), and version 3.9.5 (or later) contains the fix. So for a mitigation step, all you need to do is login to Confluence as an admin, select General Configuration >> Manage Apps and then locate and upgrade the CCMA plugin to 3.9.5 or later.
2. The other option is you can deactivate the CCMA plugin altogether if don't plan for the upgrade.
