Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45393:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how `WebhookPermission.get_scopes` was implemented. Specifically, unhandled endpoints within the webhook functionality would result in an empty scope list being returned, effectively bypassing access control. This was intended for `/api/webhooks/events`, but was incorrectly applied to other endpoints as well.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization checks for webhook delivery-related endpoints. Due to the faulty `get_scopes` implementation, access control was not enforced for these endpoints.
- **Incorrect Scope Handling:** The `WebhookPermission.get_scopes` function did not correctly identify the required permissions for certain webhook endpoints, resulting in authorization bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access to Webhook Delivery Information:** An attacker with a regular CVAT user account could access webhook delivery details belonging to any webhook, including those created by other users. This information includes details about the event, the affected object (e.g., tasks), and the user who performed the action.
- **Unauthorized Redelivery of Webhooks:** An attacker could redeliver past webhook deliveries, triggering potentially unintended actions or revealing information.
- **Unauthorized Ping Events:** An attacker could trigger "ping" events for any webhook, again potentially revealing information or causing unintended consequences.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker with a valid CVAT account could make API calls to the vulnerable webhook delivery endpoints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs a valid CVAT user account.
- No special privileges are required, a regular "user" role is sufficient.
- The attacker needs to know the IDs of the webhooks they wish to access, ping, or redeliver.

**Additional Information:**

- The fix for this vulnerability is available in CVAT version 2.18.0 and later.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.4, classified as "Moderate".
- The vulnerability has been categorized under CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).
- The affected versions range from 2.3.0 to 2.17.0.
- The fix was implemented in commit `0fafb79`.
