```
Due to how `WebhookPermission.get_scopes` is written, any unhandled endpoint
will result in an empty list being returned, and thus no access control
being performed. This is the right thing for `/api/webhooks/events`, but not
so much for every other endpoint.
```

# Missing authorization for endpoints related to webhook deliveries

Moderate

[SpecLad](/SpecLad)
published
GHSA-p3c9-m7jr-jxxj
Sep 10, 2024

## Package

CVAT

## Affected versions

2.3.0-2.17.0

## Patched versions

2.18.0

## Description

### Impact

An attacker with a CVAT account can access webhook delivery information for any webhook registered on the CVAT instance, including that of other users. For each delivery, this contains information about the event that caused the delivery, typically including full details about the object on which an action was performed (such as the task for an "update:task" event), and the user who performed the action.

In addition, the attacker can redeliver any past delivery of any webhook, and trigger a ping event for any webhook.

### Patches

Upgrade to CVAT 2.18.0 or any later version.

### Workarounds

N/A

### References

Fix commit: [0fafb79](https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/commit/0fafb797fdf022fb83ce81c6405ba19b583a236f)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
