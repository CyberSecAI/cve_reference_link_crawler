## HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames can be utilized for DoS attacks

#### Vulnerability Note VU#421644

Original Release Date: 2024-04-03 | Last Revised: 2024-07-19

---

### Overview

HTTP allows messages to include named fields in both header and trailer sections. These header and trailer fields are serialised as field blocks in HTTP/2, so that they can be transmitted in multiple fragments to the target implementation. Many HTTP/2 implementations do not properly limit or sanitize the amount of CONTINUATION frames sent within a single stream. An attacker that can send packets to a target server can send a stream of CONTINUATION frames that will not be appended to the header list in memory but will still be processed and decoded by the server or will be appended to the header list, causing an out of memory (OOM) crash.

### Description

HTTP/2 utilizes header fields within HTTP request and response messages. Header fields can comprise header lists, which in turn are broken into header blocks. These header blocks are transmitted in multiple fragments to the target implementation. HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames are used to continue a sequence of field block fragments. They are utilized in order to split header blocks across multiple frames. The other two types of header block fragments are HEADERS or PUSH\_PROMISE. CONTINUATION frames can be utilized to continue a header block fragment that could not be transmitted by the HEADERS or PUSH\_PROMISE frames. A header block is considered completed when the server receives a set END\_HEADERS flag. This is intended to denote that there are no further CONTINUATION, HEADERS, or PUSH\_PROMISE frames. A vulnerability has been discovered within multiple implementations that does not limit the amount of CONTINUATION frames that can be sent within a single stream.

The implementation will continue to receive frames as long as the END\_HEADERS flag is not set during these communications. An attacker can initialize a connection to a server with typical HTTP/2 frames and then receive initial frames from the server. The attacker can then begin an HTTP request with no set END\_HEADERS flags. This can allow an attacker to send a stream of CONTINUATION frames to the target server, which can result in an out-of-memory crash, enabling an attacker to launch a denial of service (DoS) attack against a target server using a vulnerable implementation.

Additionally, an attacker can send HPACK Huffman encoded CONTINUATION frames to a target implementation. This can cause CPU resource exhaustion and result in a DoS as the the CPU must decode every encoded frame that it receives.

Below are several CVE listings to reflect the vulnerability within different implementations.

**CVE-2024-27983**

An attacker can make the Node.js HTTP/2 server unavailable by sending a small amount of HTTP/2 frames packets with a few HTTP/2 frames inside. It is possible to leave some data in nghttp2 memory after reset when headers with HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frame are sent to the server and then a TCP connection is abruptly closed by the client triggering the Http2Session destructor while header frames are still being processed (and stored in memory) causing a race condition.

**CVE-2024-27919**

Envoy's oghttp codec does not reset a request when header map limits have been exceeded. This allows an attacker to send an sequence of CONTINUATION frames without the END\_HEADERS bit set causing unlimited memory consumption.

**CVE-2024-2758**

Tempesta FW rate limits are not enabled by default. They are either set too large to capture empty CONTINUATION frames attacks or too small to handle normal HTTP requests appropriately.

**CVE-2024-2653**

amphp/http will collect HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames in an unbounded buffer and will not check the header size limit until it has received the END\_HEADERS flag, resulting in an OOM crash. amphp/http-client and amphp/http-server are indirectly affected if they're used with an unpatched version of amphp/http. Early versions of amphp/http-client with HTTP/2 support (v4.0.0-rc10 to 4.0.0) are also directly affected.

**CVE-2023-45288**

The Go packages net/http and net/http2 packages do not limit the number of CONTINUATION frames read for an HTTP/2 request, which permits an attacker to provide an arbitrarily large set of headers for a single request, that will be read, decoded, and subsequently discarded, which may result in excessive CPU consumption.

**CVE-2024-28182**

An implementation using the nghttp2 library will continue to receive CONTINUATION frames, and will not callback to the application to allow visibility into this information before it resets the stream, resulting in a DoS.

**CVE-2024-27316**

HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames without the END\_HEADERS flag set can be sent in a continuous stream by an attacker to an Apache Httpd implementation, which will not properly terminate the request early.

**CVE-2024-31309**

HTTP/2 CONTINUATION DoS attack can cause Apache Traffic Server to consume more resources on the server. Version from 8.0.0 through 8.1.9, from 9.0.0 through 9.2.3 are affected.

**CVE-2024-30255**

HTTP/2 protocol stack in Envoy versions 1.29.2 or earlier are vulnerable to CPU exhaustion due to flood of CONTINUATION frames.
Envoys HTTP/2 codec allows the client to send an unlimited number of CONTINUATION frames even after exceeding Envoys header map limits. This allows an attacker to send a sequence of CONTINUATION frames without the END\_HEADERS bit set causing CPU utilization, consuming approximately 1 core per 300Mbit/s of traffic.

### Impact

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker the capability to launch DoS attacks against servers utilizing vulnerable implementations.

### Solution

Different HTTP/2 implementations may have separate, unique vulnerabilities specific to that implementation. It is important to note that it may be difficult to analyze incoming malicious traffic exploiting this vulnerability as the HTTP request is not properly completed. Analysis of raw HTTP traffic may be necessary to determine an attack utilizing this vulnerability.

| **CVE-2024-31309** | Unknown |

#### Vendor Statement

The Go packages `net/http` and `golang.org/x/net/http2` packages set a configurable limit on the size of headers for a request. They do not, however, limit the number of `CONTINUATION` frames read for an HTTP/2 request. This permits an attacker to provide an arbitrarily large set of headers for a single request, which will be read, decoded, and subsequently discarded. This attack vector does not permit an attacker to cause memory exhaustion, since excessive headers will be discarded. It may permit an attacker to cause excessive CPU consumption.

We intend to release a fix for this vulnerability when the release embargo ends.

#### Vendor Statement

HTTP/2 attacks involving CONTINUATION headers do not impact the resource utilization of F5 products (including BIG-IP products, NGINX and F5 Distributed Cloud).

As with other DoS vectors (HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2), for NGINX F5 recommends tuning the following settings to suit your environment (worker\_rlimit\_nofile, worker\_connections, keepalive\_timeout, client\_header\_timeout). Similarly, F5 recommends configuring appropriate limits and protections for BIG-IP products (e.g., AFM DoS Profiles, ASM DoS Profiles, Virtual Server connection limits and timeouts and, for HTTP/2, the Concurrent Streams Per Connection setting).

| **CVE-2024-31309** | Not Affected |

#### Vendor Statement

The lighttpd web server is not specifically vulnerable to DoS attacks utilizing HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames. lighttpd memory allocation while collecting raw HEADERS + CONTINUATION frames is bounded to < 64k; lighttpd limits the raw HEADERS + CONTINUATION frames to 64k (not HPACK-decoded) and lighttpd does not spend any resources HPACK-decoding until after END\_HEADERS is received (which does not occur in this CONTINUATION frame attack). CPU usage by lighttpd is minimal to append CONTINUATION frames to the stream buffer for HEADERS. lighttpd will not get stuck servicing a single HTTP/2 connection, as lighttpd performs a single recv() on an HTTP/2 socket, processes complete HTTP/2 frames, and then goes on to process other sockets with pending events.

#### Vendor Statement

Memory consumption in Varnish in processing HPACK is limited to a fixed buffer size, regardless of the size of the incoming header set.
Thus Varnish is not at any risk of runaway memory consumption due to an arbitrarily large incoming header set. After this buffer is exceeded, Varnish will keep processing CONTINUATION frames and perform dynamic table updates correspondingly. Thus keeping the HPACK state consistent for future streams on the same connection.

## Disclaimer

According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.
