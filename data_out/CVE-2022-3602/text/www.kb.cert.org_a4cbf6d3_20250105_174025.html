## OpenSSL 3.0.0 to 3.0.6 decodes some punycode email addresses in X.509 certificates improperly

#### Vulnerability Note VU#794340

Original Release Date: 2022-11-01 | Last Revised: 2024-03-08

---

### Overview

Two buffer overflow vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.6. These vulnerabilities were introduced in version 3.0.0 with the inclusion of support for punycode email address parsing for X.509 certificates. OpenSSL's assessment of the severity of the vulnerabilities has [reduced from CRITICAL to HIGH](https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2022/11/01/email-address-overflows/), and OpenSSL 3.0.7 addresses the issues.

### Description

Two buffer overflows have been reported in the OpenSSL 3.0.x branch prior to version 3.0.7 that, when exploited, may lead to denial of services or, in some cases, remote code execution in the vulnerable target environment. OpenSSL client and server implementations that use the vulnerable libraries are affected. The server implementation also requires that [TLS client authentication](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4346#appendix-F.1.1) is enabled in order to attack, and potentially exploit, a vulnerable target. [OpenSSL provides details:](https://gist.github.com/FiloSottile/611fc3fa95c3aceebf2580983f76148c)

```
* Fixed two buffer overflows in punycode decoding functions.

   A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
   specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after
   certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to
   have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue
   certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted
   issuer.

   In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious
   server.  In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests
   client authentication and a malicious client connects.

   An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow
   an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.`  character (decimal 46)
   on the stack.  This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a
   denial of service).
   ([CVE-2022-3786])

   An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four
   attacker-controlled bytes on the stack.  This buffer overflow could
   result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code
   execution depending on stack layout for any given platform/compiler.
   ([CVE-2022-3602])

```

OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected.

CERT/CC is unaware of any exploitation of this vulnerability at this time.

### Impact

Successful exploitation could lead to denial of service or remote execution of arbitrary code in the target environment.

### Solution

Any services depending on versions of OpenSSL 3.0.x prior to OpenSSL 3.0.7 should be upgraded to version 3.0.7 or later. Operators may also consider temporarily disabling TLS client authentication until applying an update.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to OpenSSL for coordinating and remediating the vulnerability. Polar Bear is credited as having discovered CVE-2022-3602. Viktor Dukhovni is reported as the source of CVE-2022-3786.

### [FreeRADIUS](#FreeRADIUS) Affected

**Statement Date:   October 31, 2022**

| **CVE-2022-3602** | Affected |
| --- | --- |
| **CVE-2022-3786** | Unknown |

#### Vendor Statement

As FreeRADIUS uses OpenSSL along with TLS-based EAP methods, and RADIUS/TLS, we are likely affected by this issue.

Sites which are not using RADIUS/TLS and are not using TLS-based EAP methods (EAP-TLS, TTLS, PEAP) are not affected. We still recommend upgrading OpenSSL to a non-vulnerable version.

FreeRADIUS version 3.0.26 and later added support for OpenSSL 3. Any site which has built the server with OpenSSL 3 is likely affected. Some vendors of OS distributions may have patched earlier versions of FreeRADIUS to support OpenSSL 3. We suggest asking those vendors for updates.

Versions of FreeRADIUS which are built against OpenSSL 1.x are not affected by this issue.

We suggest sites using OpenSSL 3 upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.7 as soon as it is available. There is no need to upgrade FreeRADIUS.

| **CVE-2022-3602** | Affected |
| --- | --- |
| **CVE-2022-3786** | Unknown |

#### Vendor Statement

Triton Data Center is build on top of SmartOS, which ships a platform-use-only version of OpenSSL 3.0.x. 3.0.7 will be rolling out with this week's biweekly platform release: 20221103. We recommend ALL SmartOS users update their platform image to 20221103 to cover this. (E.g. curl crashing due to a malicious server's certificates is the most obviously affected piece of SmartOS.)

SmartOS native zones use pkgsrc, and pkgsrc does not yet distribution OpenSSL 3, so native zones that build their own software are not affected by this. SmartOS (and Triton) HVMs will need to check their guest OS for OpenSSL 3 usage and status.
