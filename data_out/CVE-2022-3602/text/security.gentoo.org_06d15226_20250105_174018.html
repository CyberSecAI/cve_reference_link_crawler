# OpenSSL: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **202211-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL, the worst of which could result in remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/openssl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.0.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.0.7** |

### Background

OpenSSL is an Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) as well as a general purpose cryptography library.

### Description

Multiple buffer overflows exist in OpenSSL's handling of TLS certificates for client authentication.

### Impact

It is believed that, while unlikely, code execution is possible in certain system configurations.

### Workaround

Users operating TLS servers may consider disabling TLS client authentication, if it is being used, until fixes are applied.

### Resolution

All OpenSSL 3 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-3.0.7"

```
