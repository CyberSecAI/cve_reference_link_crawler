This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-openssl-W9sdCc2a>  Affected Products  * Cisco investigated its product line to determine which products and cloud services may be affected by these vulnerabilities. OpenSSL 3.x is not widely used in Cisco products and cloud offers, and only products that may contain the affected software are listed in this advisory. If a product or cloud offer is not explicitly listed in this advisory, it is not vulnerable.    Vulnerable Products The following table lists Cisco products that are affected by one or more of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory. If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the Last Updated date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.       | Product | Cisco Bug ID | [Fixed Release Availability](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes) |   | --- | --- | --- |   | Endpoint Clients and Client Software | | |   | Operational Insights Collector | [CSCwd44110](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd44110) | ScienceLogic Application Software 3.0.1 (Nov 2022)HPNA Application Software 2.0.1 (Nov 2022)APIC Application Software 3.0.1 (Nov 2022)SolarWinds Application Software 3.0.1 (Nov 2022)Syslog Collector 2.0.1 (Nov 2022) |   | Network Management and Provisioning | | |   | IoT Field Network Director, formerly Connected Grid Network Management System | [CSCwd44112](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd44112) | 4.8.1 (Available)4.9.0 (Available)5.0.0 (May 2023) |         Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products that may contain the affected software are listed in this advisory.
