Hanno and I have contributed months of programmer time on openssl
research and produced a ton of CRITICAL/HIGH issues over the years, not
to mention nss, gnutls, etc. What you're looking at isn't Monday-morning

security researchers discussing their opensource security work on the
opensource security mailing list :)
