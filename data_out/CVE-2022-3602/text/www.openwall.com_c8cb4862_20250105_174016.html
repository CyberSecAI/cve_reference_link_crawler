If you are careless, then this can indeed result in a panic, but that
is not inevitable.  Here's how I'd copy a buffer in Rust:

  fn main() -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {
      let mut dest = vec![10; 0];
      let source = vec![10; 1];
      let dest_offset = 0;
      let source_offset = 0;
      let len = 11;

      dest.get_mut(source_offset..source_offset+len)
          .ok_or(anyhow::anyhow!("Index out of bounds"))?
          .copy_from_slice(
              source.get(dest_offset..dest_offset+len)
                  .ok_or(anyhow::anyhow!("Index out of bounds"))?
              );

      Ok(())
  }

  <https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=b7981319d0629bfc83cc29f23d43a3be>

This returns an error when you attempt to read past the end of the
source buffer (the first `ok_or`) or write beyond the end of the
destintation buffer (the second `ok_or`).  The caller can catch or
propagate any error in the usual Rust way (e.g., by using the `?`
operator to return the error to its caller).

Unfortunately, `copy_from_slice` will still panic if the slices are
not the same length.
