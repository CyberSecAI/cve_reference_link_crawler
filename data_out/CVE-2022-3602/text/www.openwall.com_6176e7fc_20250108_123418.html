 Overflow (CVE-2022-3602), X.509 Email Address Variable Length Buffer Overflow (CVE-2022-3786)

In Rust, assuming you wrote normal safe Rust[0], and you had code that
overran a buffer on the stack, you'd get a panic() -- which is roughly
an abort (there's even a mode where it literally is an abort. By
default it unwinds and runs destructors and such). As a general rule,
bounds check issues aren't caught at compile time (in contrast with
temporal safety, which mostly is enforced at compile time.)

[0]: Rust also has an `unsafe` keyword that lets you do unchecked
things with raw pointers. Using that for basic string manipulation
would be way outside of idiomatic Rust and I'd certainly expect it to
be flagged in code review.

All that is necessary for evil to succeed is for good people to do nothing.
