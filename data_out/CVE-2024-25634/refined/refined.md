{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) issue in the application's API. The API allows users to access email logs associated with events by specifying the event ID in the URL. However, it fails to properly validate if the user has the authorization to view the requested event's data, allowing a user to access the logs of events belonging to different organizations.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) - CWE-497",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can access sensitive email logs associated with events belonging to other organizations, leading to confidentiality breaches.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is carried out over the network by crafting HTTP GET requests. The attacker manipulates the event ID in the API URL to access email logs of events they are not authorized to view.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with high privileges, capable of accessing the admin API. They must also be aware of or able to guess the event IDs belonging to different organizations."
