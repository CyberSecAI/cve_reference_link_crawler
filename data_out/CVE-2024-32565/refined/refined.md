- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The App Builder plugin for WordPress, in versions 3.8.8 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin suffers from an XSS vulnerability, allowing injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can allow a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into your website which will be executed when guests visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through injection of malicious scripts, which are then executed in the context of a user's browser session when they visit the affected page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into the affected plugin. The required privilege level to perform the injection is "Contributor".
