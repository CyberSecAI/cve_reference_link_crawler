- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing FPJ files, leading to a write past the end of an allocated data structure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** Opening a malicious FPJ file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious FPJ file to the target user. The target user needs to open the malicious file.
