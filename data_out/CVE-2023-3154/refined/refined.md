{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Lack of input parameter validation in the `gallery_edit` function, allowing an attacker to trigger PHAR deserialization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "PHAR Deserialization, Object Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution on the server. The provided PoC shows how an attacker can cause the server to print `Arbitrary deserialization`, indicating that code execution is possible.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious POST request to `/index.php` with a specific `photocrati_ajax` parameter, the attacker can trigger the vulnerable `gallery_edit` function with a PHAR archive in the `extra_data` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a valid admin account and the ability to send POST requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance. The attacker also needs to be able to create a PHAR file and upload it on the server and know a gallery ID on the target site."
