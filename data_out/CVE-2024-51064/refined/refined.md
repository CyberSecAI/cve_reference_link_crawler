Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is insufficient input sanitization in the `admin/queries.php` file of the Phpgurukul Teachers Record Management System v2.1. Specifically, the `tid` parameter is not being properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw, which occurs when user-supplied input is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper validation or escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary SQL queries.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could extract sensitive information from the database. This may include user credentials, teacher records, or other confidential data.
- **Potential for further attacks:** SQL injection can be a stepping stone for further attacks on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the `tid` parameter in an HTTP request sent to the `admin/queries.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the web application hosting the vulnerable system.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic understanding of HTTP requests and parameters to manipulate the vulnerable parameter.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** An understanding of SQL syntax is essential to craft malicious queries that can be injected.
