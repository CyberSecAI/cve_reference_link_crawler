Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-19909:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `tool_operate.c` file of curl. Specifically, the `--retry-delay` command-line option takes a number of seconds as input and converts it to milliseconds by multiplying by 1000. If the provided number of seconds is large enough, the multiplication results in an integer overflow, leading to a much smaller delay than intended.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Integer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is the integer overflow during the conversion of seconds to milliseconds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- The impact is primarily an incorrect retry delay. Instead of waiting a very long time (potentially days or years) as specified by the user, curl might retry within a few seconds due to the overflow.
-  The blog author and other commenters argue that this is not a security vulnerability because an attacker cannot control the `--retry-delay` value. The user themselves can cause the overflow if they provide large values.
-  The NVD incorrectly assigned a score of 9.8 ("CRITICAL").

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is a user providing a crafted large value to the `--retry-delay` option.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The "attacker" would need to be a user of the `curl` command-line tool with the ability to set the command-line parameters including `--retry-delay`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Jason Lee in 2019 and was fixed in curl version 7.66.0.
- The CVE was created and assigned in 2020, but not by the curl project maintainers.
- The curl project maintains a list of their own CVEs and does not consider this to be a security issue.
- The author of the blog post is requesting that the CVE be rejected.
- The reported issue is not a vulnerability in the typical sense because a user has to deliberately input a large number in order to trigger it.
- The vulnerability is not remotely exploitable, as the user needs to have direct access to the curl command with ability to set the argument.
- The CVSS score assigned by NVD is highly inflated and does not reflect the actual risk.
