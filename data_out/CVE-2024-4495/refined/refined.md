Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a stack-based buffer overflow in the `formWifiMacFilterGet` function of the Tenda i21 firmware. The function takes an `index` parameter from a POST request, and uses this unsanitized input in a `sprintf` function to construct a string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `sprintf` function writes to a buffer (`mib_prefix`) on the stack without proper bounds checking.
- **Unsanitized Input:** The `index` parameter from the POST request is directly used in `sprintf`, allowing an attacker to control its size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The buffer overflow can overwrite adjacent memory on the stack.
- This can lead to a variety of consequences, including:
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The device may crash, rendering it unusable.
    - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By carefully crafting the overflow, an attacker might be able to overwrite the return address and redirect execution to arbitrary code of their choice.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `formWifiMacFilterGet` function, where the `index` parameter is set to a string longer than the buffer's capacity.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected device. This suggests that the attacker might need to be on the same network as the device or be able to reach it through the internet if the device is exposed.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `index` parameter in the POST request.

**Summary of Technical Details**
The `sprintf(mib_prefix, "wl2g.ssid%s.", index);` line within the `formWifiMacFilterGet` function is vulnerable. The `index` parameter, coming directly from user input, is inserted into `mib_prefix` string. Since `index`'s length is not validated or sanitized, a string provided by an attacker can cause a buffer overflow of `mib_prefix` which is located on the stack.
