- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the `m_id` parameter from the POST request is directly inserted into a database query in `submit_payments.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database. This may result in unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. In this specific exploit, the attacker could retrieve the database user using a crafted SQL injection payload.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exposed through the `submit_payments.php` script, specifically via the `m_id` POST parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `submit_payments.php` script and have knowledge of the parameter name and vulnerable endpoint.
