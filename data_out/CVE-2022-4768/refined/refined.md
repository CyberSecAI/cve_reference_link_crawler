Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the acceptance of newline characters (`\r` and `\n`) within SSH public keys. These characters can be maliciously injected to manipulate how the key is consumed, particularly when used in contexts like an `authorized_keys` file with a `command` restriction. The code was previously not validating the public keys and therefore vulnerable to injection attacks when new lines are included in the key itself.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Injection Vulnerability:** Allowing newlines in public keys opens up the possibility of injecting arbitrary commands or parameters, leading to unauthorized actions.
- **Lack of Input Validation:**  The original code did not properly validate the public key string to reject newlines.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Command Injection:** A malicious actor could inject commands into the `authorized_keys` file. This would allow them to execute arbitrary commands on the target system when an SSH connection is made with the manipulated key.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By injecting commands, the attacker could potentially gain higher privileges on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious user provides a public key containing newline characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a public key to the system/application.
- The attacker may need to have some knowledge of how the public key is consumed on the system.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix implemented prevents injection by explicitly raising a `PublicKeyParseError` if newlines are found in the provided public key strings.
- The code change also include tests which include multiline keys to ensure the fix is effective.
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `d93087973afa26bc0a2d0a5eb5c0fde748bdd107` as part of pull request `#673`.
