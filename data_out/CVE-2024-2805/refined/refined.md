{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `formSetSpeedWan` function in the Tenda AC15V1.0 V15.03.20_multi firmware has a stack overflow vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A stack buffer overflow exists because the `speed_dir` parameter from a POST request is directly used in a `sprintf` function without proper bounds checking. This allows writing past the buffer allocated on the stack.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The stack overflow can overwrite the return address of the function, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a POST request to `/goform/SetSpeedWan` with a large value for the `speed_dir` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected device."
