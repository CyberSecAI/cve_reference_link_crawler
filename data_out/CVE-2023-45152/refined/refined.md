Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45152:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the "Import schedule" functionality in the engelsystem software, which allows a user-supplied URL to be fetched by the server. The server-side component processes this URL without sufficient validation which leads to a Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SSRF:** The application fetches a URL provided by the user without proper validation, allowing an attacker to make requests to internal resources from the server. The "blind" aspect indicates the attacker may not directly see the response, but can infer information based on the application's behavior.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the provided URL, allowing arbitrary URLs to be fetched.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Internal Port Scanning:** An attacker can use the SSRF vulnerability to probe the internal network for open ports, potentially identifying other services running on the local machine or other machines on the same network.
- **Information Disclosure (indirect):** While a direct response is not returned, the attacker can infer information about the target systems by observing the application's behavior (e.g., error messages or timeouts when a port is closed vs. an internal server error when a port is open).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Import schedule" feature, where a user can specify a URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have high privileges to access the admin panel of engelsystem and create/edit schedules.
- **Knowledge of the Feature:** The attacker must be aware of the "Import schedule" feature and how to manipulate it to specify a malicious URL.
- **Ability to craft requests:** The attacker has to be able to craft HTTP requests, specifically POST requests to the `/admin/schedule/edit/` endpoint, and GET request to `/admin/schedule/load/` endpoint.

**Additional Details:**

- **Patch:** The vulnerability is patched in commit `ee7d30b33935ea001705f438fec8ffd05734f295` by adding `LIBXML_NOWARNING | LIBXML_NOERROR` to `simplexml_load_string`.
- **PoC:** The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how the vulnerability can be used to probe for open ports.
- **Severity:** The severity of the vulnerability is rated as low.
- **CVSS v3 Base Metrics:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N` (Attack Vector: Local, Attack Complexity: Low, Privileges Required: High, User Interaction: Required, Scope: Unchanged, Confidentiality: Low, Integrity: None, Availability: None)
- **CWE:** The vulnerability is associated with CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery).
