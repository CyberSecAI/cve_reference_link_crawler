{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses `sprintf` to format command parameters into a stack buffer without checking the size of the input parameters.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to unchecked input lengths when using `sprintf` to format command parameters.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted network packets to trigger the vulnerable commands.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device."
