### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 3.2.1    [OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)

A crafted HTTP packet with a large content-length header can create a denial-of-service condition in Softing Secure Integration Server.

[CVE-2022-1069](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-1069) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

#### 3.2.2    [UNCONTROLLED SEARCH PATH ELEMENT CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)

The application searches for a library dll that is not found. If an attacker can place a dll with this name, then the attacker can leverage it to execute arbitrary code on the targeted Softing Secure Integration Server.

[CVE-2022-2334](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2334) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.3    [IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html)

Softing Secure Integration Server, edgeConnector, and edgeAggregator software ships with the default administrator credentials as `admin` and password as `admin`. This allows Softing to log in to the server directly to perform administrative functions. Upon installation or upon first login, the application does not ask the user to change the `admin` password. There is no warning or prompt to ask the user to change the default password, and to change the password, many steps are required.

[CVE-2022-2336](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2336) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.4    [RELATIVE PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-23](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html)

The “restore configuration” feature of Softing Secure Integration Server is vulnerable to a directory traversal vulnerability when processing zip files. An attacker can craft a zip file to load an arbitrary dll and execute code. Using the "restore configuration" feature to upload a zip file containing a path traversal file may cause a file to be created and executed upon touching the disk.

[CVE-2022-1373](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-1373) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.5    [CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)

Softing Secure Integration Server is vulnerable to authentication bypass via a machine-in-the-middle attack. The default the administration interface is accessible via plaintext HTTP protocol, facilitating the attack. The HTTP request may contain the session cookie in the request, which may be captured for use in authenticating to the server.

[CVE-2022-2338](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2338) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

#### 3.2.6    [NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html)

Softing OPC UA C++ Server SDK, Secure Integration Server, edgeConnector, edgeAggregator, OPC Suite, and uaGate are affected by a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability.

[CVE-2022-1748](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-1748) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

#### 3.2.7    [NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html)

A crafted HTTP packet with a missing HTTP URI can create a denial-of-service condition in Softing Secure Integration Server.

[CVE-2022-2337](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-2337) has been assigned to this vulnerability.
