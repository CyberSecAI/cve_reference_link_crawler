## Vulnerabilities

### (CVE-2022-2334)

The application searches for a library 'Windows\System32\wbem\wbemcomn.dll' and it is not found.
An attacker can drop a dll with this name and leverage it to execute arbitrary code on the target system.

| Softing Secure Integration Server <= V1.22 | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H | 7.2 |

##### Fixed

* Softing Secure Integration Server V1.30

#### Remediations

##### Mitigation

Administrative access to Windows machine is needed for the attack.

### (CVE-2022-1373)

The restore configuration feature is vulnerable to a directory
traversal vulnerablity when processing zip files. An attacker can craft a zip file to load an arbitrary dll
and execute code.
When using the "restore configuration" feature to upload a zip file containing a path traversal file which
is a dll called ..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Windows\System32\wbem\wbemcomn.dll.
This causes the file
c:\Windows\System32\wbem\wbemcomn.dll to be created and executed upon touching the disk.

### (CVE-2022-2338)

The server is vulnerable to authentication bypass via man in the middle attack (mitm).
The mitm attack is possible because by default the administration interface is accessible via plaintext
HTTP protocol over port 8099. The scenario being presented is as follows. Administrator Bob
(192.168.1.10) is logged in to a server (192.168.1.20) and there is a network adjacent hacker Alice
(192.168.1.30). After Bob has logged in to the server he will not click or take any actions. Alice launches
a standard ARP spoofing attack against Bob and the server. The traffic between Bob and Triangle then
begins flowing through Alice's device.
The browser receives a heartbeat from the server every few seconds with some status information
including the server's health. Since Alice is intercepting this traffic in the clear she accesses it and steals
the session during the heartbeat. This HTTP request will contain the session cookie in the request which
Alice captures and can use to authenticate to the server herself, concluding the auth bypass portion of
the attack chain.

| Softing Secure Integration Server <= V1.22 | CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N | 5.7 |

##### Fixed

* Softing Secure Integration Server V1.30

#### Remediations

##### Workaround

Disable the HTTP Server in NGINX configuration of the SIS and only use the HTTPS server.
