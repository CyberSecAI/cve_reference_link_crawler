# GitLab Critical Patch Release: 17.3.2, 17.2.5, 17.1.7

Learn more about GitLab Critical Patch Release: 17.3.2, 17.2.5, 17.1.7 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).

Today we are releasing versions 17.3.2, 17.2.5, 17.1.7 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).

These versions contain important bug and security fixes, and we strongly recommend that all self-managed GitLab installations be upgraded to
one of these versions immediately. GitLab.com is already running the patched version. GitLab Dedicated customers do not need to take action.

GitLab releases fixes for vulnerabilities in patch releases. There are two types of patch releases:
scheduled releases, and ad-hoc critical patches for high-severity vulnerabilities. Scheduled releases are released twice a month on the second and fourth Wednesdays.
For more information, you can visit our [releases handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/) and [security FAQ](https://about.gitlab.com/security/faq/).
You can see all of GitLab release blog posts [here](/releases/categories/releases/).

For security fixes, the issues detailing each vulnerability are made public on our
[issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=closed&label_name%5B%5D=bug%3A%3Avulnerability&confidential=no&first_page_size=100)
30 days after the release in which they were patched.

We are committed to ensuring all aspects of GitLab that are exposed to customers or that host customer data are held to
the highest security standards. As part of maintaining good security hygiene, it is highly recommended that all customers
upgrade to the latest patch release for their supported version. You can read more
[best practices in securing your GitLab instance](/blog/2020/05/20/gitlab-instance-security-best-practices/) in our blog post.

### Recommended Action

We **strongly recommend** that all installations running a version affected by the issues described below are **upgraded to the latest version as soon as possible**.

When no specific deployment type (omnibus, source code, helm chart, etc.) of a product is mentioned, this means all types are affected.

# Guests can disclose the full source code of projects using custom group-level templates

‚ö† **Please read [the process](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/-/blob/master/general/security/developer.md) on how to fix security issues before starting to work on the issue. Vulnerabilities must be fixed in a security mirror.**

**[HackerOne report #2480126](https://hackerone.com/reports/2480126)** by `js_noob` on 2024-04-26, assigned to `GitLab Team`:

## Report

##### Summary

Hello team, according to the [docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/custom_project_templates.html#set-up-group-level-project-templates), only group members are allowed to use its templates to create projects in other groups. On the other hand, as known, guest users can't access the source code in private projects, you can verify this by searching for "View project code" [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html#project-members-permissions). However, a guest user can abuse the custom group-level templates and disclose the full source code of private projects associated with that template group.

In the below example, we have:

* A parent group:
  + projects sub-group (no role for the attacker at the group level):
    - private project - where the attacker has a guest role
  + templates sub-group (attacker has developer role in this sub-group):

The result is, that the attacker will create a project in the `projects` subgroup, using that project template that he can't read its source code, disclosing all of its code.

##### Steps to reproduce

**As an owner:**

1. Create a group and apply the ultimate trial to it
2. Create 2 subgroups in that group let's call them, `projects` and `templates`
3. Navigate to <https://gitlab.com/groups/MAIN_GROUP/-/edit> and under "Custom project templates", select the `templates` subgroup
4. Create a project in the `templates` subgroup
5. Invite USER\_2 as a guest to that created project and as a developer to the `projects` group

**As User 2:**

6. Verify that you can't access the source code of the project created in the `templates` subgroup
7. Verify that you can't create projects from the group templates in the `projects` template

8. Navigate to the `projects` subgroup, and start creating a new project process
9. Upon submitting intercept the request, and add the following to the body of the fired request, but make sure to replace IDs

   `&project%5Btemplate_project_id%5D=PROJECT_IN_TEMPLATES_ID&project%5Buse_custom_template%5D=true&project%5Bgroup_with_project_templates_id%5D=TEMPLATES_SUBGROUP_ID`
10. Verify that a new project is created from the template, disclosing all of the source code

##### What is the current *bug* behavior?

There are 2 issues here:

* Non-group members can use templates from that group and create them in other groups.
* Guests can create projects from templates they don't have "full-read" access to.

##### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

* Non-group members shouldn't be able to use templates from that group and create them in other groups, even if they are project members.
* Guests shouldn't be able to create projects from templates they don't have "full-read" access to.

##### Output of checks

This bug happens on GitLab.com

#### Impact

Guests can disclose the full source code of private projects.
