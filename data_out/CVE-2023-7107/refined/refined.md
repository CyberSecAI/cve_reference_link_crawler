The provided content relates to CVE-2023-7107.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the user signup page of the E-Commerce Website application. Specifically, the `firstname`, `middlename`, `email`, `address`, `contact`, and `username` parameters are vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `user_signup.php` page.
- Vulnerable parameters: `firstname`, `middlename`, `email`, `address`, `contact`, and `username`.
- Lack of input validation and sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attacker can compromise the application.
- Unauthorized access to or modification of data within the database.
- Potential for exploiting further vulnerabilities present in the underlying database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/Electricks/Electricks-shop/pages/user_signup.php` page.
- Malicious SQL payloads are injected through the vulnerable parameters mentioned above.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application, which usually means having network access to the vulnerable system.
- The attacker needs to identify and exploit the vulnerable parameters (`firstname`, `middlename`, `email`, `address`, `contact` and `username`).
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques and tools (e.g., sqlmap) would be required.
