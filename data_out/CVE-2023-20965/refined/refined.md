Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-20965:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the Wi-Fi module handles TLS connections during EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) authentication, specifically when using "Trust on First Use" (TOFU). The initial connection attempt transmitted credentials before the server certificate was verified.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Sending user credentials in an unauthenticated TLS tunnel: Prior to the fix, the system would send credentials during the initial TLS handshake before the server certificate was verified, exposing user credentials to a potentially malicious server.
- Insecure TOFU implementation: The original TOFU flow was vulnerable because credentials would be sent to a server without a prior, secure validation of the server's identity.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Elevation of privilege: An attacker could potentially gain access to user credentials by setting up a rogue access point that intercepts the authentication process.
- Information disclosure: The captured credentials could be used to access the user's Wi-Fi account, personal information, or other connected resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- Proximal/adjacent network attack: An attacker needs to be within the range of the Wi-Fi signal of the targeted device.
- Rogue access point: An attacker could set up a malicious Wi-Fi access point impersonating a legitimate one, causing the victim's device to connect to it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within Wi-Fi range of the target device.
- The attacker needs to be able to set up a rogue access point to intercept the initial insecure connection.
- No user interaction is required for exploitation.

**Additional details from the provided commits:**
- The initial fix (commit `fb630e6a13189321d0e83037adc9e7b30dc6d796`) attempted to address the vulnerability by connecting without credentials to get the server certificate, and then reconnecting with full authentication after user approval, however it was reverted due to a regression (commit `a50b83a25a16749bb22552a6d473c3ca11e9d904`).
- The final fix (commit `a5227527411bc24e6e2c6276f16559c7305b6783`) implements a secure TOFU flow, where a secure connection is established first to retrieve the server certificate for user approval, and only then credentials are sent. This commit also changes the TOFU dialog to display the certificate expiration date and SHA-256 fingerprint for user verification. This commit also includes handling for cases where insecure enterprise configurations are allowed in the new and secure TOFU flow. In this mode, no disconnection happens, no certificate is loaded and no user notification is shown.
