Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) issue in Apache StreamPark.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **IDOR:** A regular, authenticated user can access other users' Flink information by manipulating the request parameters to access resources they shouldn't have access to. The application fails to properly validate the user's authorization to access the requested data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can view sensitive information pertaining to other users, including their Flink configurations and executeSQL commands. This could expose sensitive data within the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct Request Manipulation:** A logged-in, regular user can modify the request they send to the server (presumably via API calls or similar) using their own authorization token. By manipulating the parameters of the request, they can access information belonging to other users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a valid user of the application and have a valid authorization token (e.g., after login).
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs to understand the API structure to manipulate the requests.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the server hosting Apache StreamPark.
