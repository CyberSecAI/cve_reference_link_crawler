Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability is caused by insufficient user input validation of the `txtsearch` parameter in the `index.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where user-supplied input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized database access:** Attackers can gain access to the database without proper authentication.
*   **Sensitive data leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information stored in the database.
*   **Data tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
*   **System control:** In severe cases, attackers can gain comprehensive control over the system.
*   **Service disruption:** Attackers could potentially cause a denial of service by manipulating the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through the `txtsearch` parameter, which is part of a search functionality.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited via HTTP POST requests.
*   No login or authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No specific privileges or credentials are required.
*   The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.

**Technical details:**

*   Vulnerable file: `index.php`
*   Vulnerable parameter: `txtsearch`
*   The vulnerability can be exploited using boolean-based blind, time-based blind, and UNION query SQL injection techniques.
*   The provided payloads include examples for each type of SQL injection attack

**Suggested Remediation**
*   Use prepared statements with parameter binding.
*   Implement strict input validation and filtering.
*   Minimize database user permissions.
*   Conduct regular security audits.
