Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the `lastname` parameter when updating user information, specifically during the `save_user` operation. This allows an attacker to inject raw SQL commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization of the `lastname` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the application's database. This could lead to:
    - **Data Breach**: Extraction of sensitive data, such as user credentials or other confidential information stored in the database.
    - **Data Manipulation**: Modification or deletion of data within the database.
    - **Privilege Escalation**: Potential for gaining administrative access through manipulating user privileges.
    - **Denial of Service**: Injection of commands that could cause the database to become unavailable or perform poorly.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `save_user` action of the application, specifically when modifying a user account, and providing malicious SQL code in the `lastname` parameter. This is usually done through a POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the application. They must have the ability to access the "Manage Account" functionality, which allows the user to modify their own profile including the `lastname` field.
- The attacker does not need admin level access to exploit this.

**Additional details:**

- The provided content includes a specific payload that can be used to confirm the vulnerability: `'%20and%20(select*from(select(sleep(20)))a)--%20`.
- The vulnerability is confirmed on Customer Support System version 1.0.
- The specific vulnerable parameter is `lastname` during the `save_user` operation.
- The `ajax.php` file is the vulnerable component receiving and processing the malicious request.
