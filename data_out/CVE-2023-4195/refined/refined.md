Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient file extension filtering during file uploads in the Cockpit CMS. Specifically, the system initially blocked `.php`, `.phar`, and `.phtml` files, but failed to include `.phps` files in the list of blocked extensions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inadequate File Extension Blacklisting:** The primary weakness is the incomplete blacklist of dangerous file extensions during file uploads. The system failed to consider the `.phps` extension, which can also contain executable PHP code. This allowed for the potential upload of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious `.phps` file, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This could lead to a variety of impacts, including:
    - **Compromise of the web server:** The attacker could gain control of the server and potentially the entire system.
    - **Data breach:** Sensitive data stored on the server could be accessed or stolen.
    - **Website defacement:** The attacker could modify the website content.
    - **Malware distribution:** The server could be used to distribute malware to website visitors.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **File Upload:** The vulnerability is exploited via the file upload functionality of the Cockpit CMS. An attacker would need to upload a file with the `.phps` extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to File Upload Functionality:** The attacker would need access to the file upload functionality, which may require valid user credentials depending on how the CMS is configured.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker would need to be aware that the `.phps` extension is not properly blocked by the system.
