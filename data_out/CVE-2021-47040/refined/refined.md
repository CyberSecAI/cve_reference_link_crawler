The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47040.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient overflow checks in the `io_provide_buffers_prep()` function within the Linux kernel's io_uring subsystem. Specifically, the code did not properly validate the size of provided buffers, leading to potential integer overflows and sign extension issues.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Integer overflow:** The multiplication of `p->len` and `p->nbufs` could result in an integer overflow when calculating `size`, leading to an incorrect buffer size.
- **Lack of proper checks:** Prior to the fix, the code did not use overflow-safe functions (`check_mul_overflow` and `check_add_overflow`) to prevent the calculation of `size` from wrapping.
- **Signed integer type:** The `io_provide_buf::len` field was a signed 32-bit integer, which could lead to incorrect size calculations if a negative value was passed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Out-of-bounds memory access:** By providing crafted values for `p->len` and `p->nbufs`, an attacker could potentially cause `access_ok` to check for a smaller memory region than what was intended, and cause out-of-bounds memory access by providing larger than expected buffers.
- **Denial of service:** By overflowing the address calculations, the attacker could cause a kernel panic or other denial-of-service conditions.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious io_uring request that provides carefully chosen values for the `len` and `nbufs` fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to submit io_uring requests to the kernel. This typically requires having access to a process that can make io_uring system calls.
