### Description

The WP-Members Membership Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.9.3 due to the plugin uploading user supplied files to a publicly accessible directory in wp-content without any restrictions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view files uploaded by other users which may contain sensitive information.
