- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The FortiRecorder software uses hardcoded administrative credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of Hard-coded Credentials
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of the hardcoded credentials and network access to FortiCameras can take control of those cameras if they are managed by a vulnerable FortiRecorder device. This results in privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the FortiRecorder and FortiCameras is required, in addition to knowledge of the hardcoded credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable FortiRecorder and the managed FortiCameras. They must also know the hardcoded administrator credentials.
