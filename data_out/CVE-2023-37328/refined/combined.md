# Advisory Details

July 6th, 2023
## GStreamer PGS File Parsing Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-23-901ZDI-CAN-20994

| CVE ID | [CVE-2023-37328](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-37328) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 8.8, [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of GStreamer. Interaction with this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectors may vary depending on the implementation.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PGS subtitle files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | GStreamer has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

Impact It is possible for a malicious third party to trigger a crash in the application, and possibly also effect code execution through heap manipulation. Solution The gst-plugins-bad 1.22.4 / 1.20.7 releases address the issue. People using older branches of GStreamer should apply the patch and recompile.
