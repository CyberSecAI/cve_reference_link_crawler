Impact It is possible for a malicious third party to trigger a crash in the application, and possibly also effect code execution through heap manipulation. Solution The gst-plugins-bad 1.22.4 / 1.20.7 releases address the issue. People using older branches of GStreamer should apply the patch and recompile.
