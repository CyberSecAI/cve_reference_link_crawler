The provided content relates to CVE-2024-35194.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Minder engine's use of templating to generate strings for various purposes. In certain cases, users can control both the template and its parameters. When the engine reads the generated template entirely into memory, an attacker can exploit this to generate a large template causing memory exhaustion and a denial-of-service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted template size generation, leading to excessive memory usage.
- Lack of limits on generated templates.
- Use of `endpoint.String()` to convert templates into strings, reading the complete output to memory.
- Vulnerable template locations in the REST ingester and pull request remediation actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion.
- Crash of the Minder server, making the system unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- By controlling template parameters and content, an attacker can generate excessively large templates.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Low privileges are required, indicating an attacker doesn't need high-level access to exploit.
- The attacker must have control over both the template and the parameters.
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the Minder server, e.g. through the REST API.
