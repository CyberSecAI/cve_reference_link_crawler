The provided content is related to CVE-2024-35511.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from inadequate validation and sanitization of the 'username' parameter in the `admin/index.php` file. This lack of proper input handling allows for the injection of malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability via the `username` parameter.
- Inadequate input sanitization and validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to the database.
- Potential extraction of confidential information from the database.
- Circumvention of authentication measures.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `username` parameter in a POST request to `admin/index.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious SQL injection query.

**Technical details:**
- The PoC uses SQLMap to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- SQLMap is used to inject a boolean-based blind SQL injection and a time-based blind SQL injection.
- The PoC demonstrates the ability to extract the database name.
- The vulnerable parameter is `username` via a POST request
- The vulnerable page is `admin/index.php`.
