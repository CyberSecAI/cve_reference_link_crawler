Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's improper handling of user-supplied input within the `get_ajax_auto_recount_data` function. Specifically, the plugin uses `do_shortcode` on a `shortcode_txt` parameter received via `$_REQUEST` without sufficient validation. Although `sanitize_text_field` is used, it is insufficient to prevent the injection of malicious shortcodes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unauthenticated Arbitrary Shortcode Execution:** The core weakness is the ability for an unauthenticated attacker to inject and execute arbitrary shortcodes.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin relies on `sanitize_text_field` which does not prevent all types of malicious shortcode injection.
- **Direct Use of User Input:**  The plugin directly uses the sanitized user input in `do_shortcode`, which is a high-risk practice when not combined with other input validation checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious shortcodes, attackers can potentially execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This could lead to a full compromise of the WordPress site.
- **Data Manipulation/Theft:** Attackers could potentially modify data, create backdoors, or steal sensitive information.
- **Defacement:** Attackers could deface the website or redirect users to malicious sites.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker could use a resource-intensive shortcode to cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is via HTTP requests to the `wp_ajax_nopriv_mdf_get_ajax_auto_recount_data` or `wp_ajax_mdf_get_ajax_auto_recount_data` AJAX endpoints. Specifically by manipulating the `shortcode_txt` parameter, allowing for the injection of arbitrary shortcodes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** No user authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the target WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
- The patch introduces a `check_shortcode` function that uses a regular expression to validate that only specific shortcodes are present. This helps to prevent arbitrary shortcode execution.
- The vulnerable code was located in the `classes/page.php` file and has been patched in version 1.3.3.4.
