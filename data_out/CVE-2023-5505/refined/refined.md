    "CVE-2023-5505": {
        "Description": "The BackWPup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in versions up to, and including, 4.0.1 via the job-specific backup folder. This allows authenticated attackers to store backups in arbitrary folders on the server provided they can be written to by the server. Additionally, default settings will place an index.php and a .htaccess file into the chosen directory (unless already present) when the first backup job is run that are intended to prevent directory listing and file access. This means that an attacker could set the backup directory to the root of another site in a shared environment and thus disable that site.",
        "Root cause": "The plugin does not properly sanitize or validate the backup folder path specified by an authenticated user with administrator or higher privileges. This allows the user to specify an arbitrary path that could exist outside the intended backup directory.",
        "Vulnerabilities": [
            "Directory Traversal",
            "Path Traversal"
        ],
        "Impact": "An attacker can write backups to arbitrary locations on the server where the web server has write permissions. This could lead to denial of service by overwriting or corrupting other site files or, in the case of a shared hosting environment, the attacker could potentially disable a different site by placing a .htaccess and index.php files at the root of their website.",
        "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the plugin's settings for a backup job, where a user with administrator-level privileges or higher can specify a custom backup folder. By manipulating the input, the attacker can write files to any directory where the webserver has write access.",
        "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator-level privileges or higher on the WordPress site."
