The provided content relates to a memory leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's zram driver, specifically when handling multi-stream compression. The vulnerability is addressed by commit `684826f8271ad97580b138b9ffd462005e470b99` and backported to stable kernels via commits `6272936fd242ca1f784c3e21596dfb3859dff276` and `ef35cc0d15b89dd013e1bb829fe97db7b1ab79eb`.

- **Root cause:** The zram driver was not freeing the memory allocated for secondary compression algorithm names when a zram device with multi-streams was reset.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leak. Specifically, the `comp_algs[prio]` strings allocated to store secondary compression algorithm names are not freed when a zram device is reset.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Repeated creation and reset of zram devices with multi-stream compression enabled would lead to a memory leak. This could eventually lead to system instability or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by creating a zram device with multi-stream compression enabled, then resetting the device. This can be done through the sysfs interface or other mechanisms that manage zram devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to create and reset zram devices, which typically requires root privileges or other elevated capabilities.

The patch addresses the issue by adding a loop to `zram_destroy_comps()` function that iterates through the secondary compression algorithms, frees the allocated memory for the `comp_algs[prio]` strings, and sets them to NULL. This ensures that memory associated with secondary compression algorithms is properly released when a zram device is destroyed.
