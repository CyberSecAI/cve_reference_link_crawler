Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-32664:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `DecodeBase64` function within the `util-base64.c` file of the Suricata project. This occurs when the provided output buffer is not large enough to accommodate the decoded base64 data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability allows writing past the allocated buffer on the heap when decoding base64 data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A specially crafted traffic or datasets can cause a limited buffer overflow.
- The overflow could potentially lead to denial of service due to crashing the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: Specifically crafted network traffic can trigger the vulnerability if processed by Suricata.
- Data sets: Specially crafted data sets containing malicious base64 data can trigger the vulnerability when loaded.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send malicious network traffic that is processed by Suricata.
- An attacker could also provide a specially crafted dataset to Suricata.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Suricata versions >=6.0.0, <=6.0.18 and >=7.0.0, <=7.0.4
- The vulnerability is fixed in versions 6.0.19 and 7.0.5
- The vulnerability is located in `src/util-base64.c` file
- The vulnerability is triggered when the caller of `DecodeBase64` does not supply a big enough output buffer
- The `base64_decode` keyword with `bytes` option with values 1, 2, or 5 are a trigger.
- For 7.0.x, setting `app-layer.protocols.smtp.mime.body-md5` to `false` can serve as a workaround.
