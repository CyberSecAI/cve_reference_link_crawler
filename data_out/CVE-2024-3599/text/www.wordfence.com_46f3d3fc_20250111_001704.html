### Description

The WP Cookie Consent ( for GDPR, CCPA & ePrivacy ) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the gdpr\_policy\_process\_delete() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts.
