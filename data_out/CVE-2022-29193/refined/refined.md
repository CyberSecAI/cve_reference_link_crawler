Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-29193:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing validation in the `tf.raw_ops.TensorSummaryV2` implementation. Specifically, the code assumes that the `serialized_summary_metadata` input is a scalar value, but it doesn't explicitly check if it is.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Input Validation:** The code lacks proper validation of the `serialized_summary_metadata` tensor's shape, which is expected to be a scalar.
- **Incorrect Type Handling:** The code directly accesses the input as a scalar without ensuring its shape matches the expectation, leading to potential errors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a non-scalar tensor as `serialized_summary_metadata`, an attacker can trigger a `CHECK`-failure, leading to a crash and effectively causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** An attacker can craft specific input data to the `tf.raw_ops.TensorSummaryV2` operation, providing a non-scalar tensor for `serialized_summary_metadata`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide inputs to the `tf.raw_ops.TensorSummaryV2` operation. This could be through a machine learning model, a script utilizing tensorflow or an interface that is connected to the tensorflow code.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `tensorflow/core/kernels/summary_tensor_op.cc` file.
- The fix is implemented in commit `290bb05c80c327ed74fae1d089f1001b1e2a4ef7`, which adds a check to ensure that the `serialized_summary_metadata` tensor is indeed a scalar.
- The vulnerability is fixed in TensorFlow versions 2.6.4, 2.7.2, 2.8.1, and 2.9.0.
- The severity is rated as low.

The provided code snippet from `summary_tensor_op.cc` highlights the problematic area:
```c++
    const Tensor& serialized_summary_metadata_tensor = c->input(2);
    // ...
    ParseFromTString(serialized_summary_metadata_tensor.scalar<tstring>()(),
                     v->mutable_metadata());
```
This code directly uses `.scalar<tstring>()` without validating if `serialized_summary_metadata_tensor` is indeed a scalar.

The fix added the following check:
```c++
OP_REQUIRES(
  c,
  TensorShapeUtils::IsScalar(serialized_summary_metadata_tensor.shape()),
  errors::InvalidArgument("serialized_summary_metadata must be scalar"));
```
This ensures the shape is a scalar before proceeding.
