**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `zt_dcfcf_change_status()` function within the "Admin side data storage for Contact Form 7" plugin. This function is responsible for updating the read status of messages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing authorization check: The `zt_dcfcf_change_status()` function lacks a capability check, allowing unauthenticated users to call it via AJAX.
- Insecure direct object reference: The function directly uses the message ID passed in the POST request to update the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthenticated attackers can alter the read status of messages stored by the plugin. This could lead to manipulation of the admin interface, potentially causing missed messages or other issues.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted AJAX request to the `wp_ajax_change_status` or `wp_ajax_nopriv_change_status` actions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to know or guess the ID of the message to modify.
