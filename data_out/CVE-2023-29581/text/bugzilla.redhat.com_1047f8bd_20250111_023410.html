References: <https://github.com/yasm/yasm/issues/216> <https://github.com/z1r00/fuzz_vuln/blob/main/yasm/segv/delete_Token/readme.md>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2186333#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2023-04-12 21:24:03 UTC  ``` Created yasm tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 2186335](show_bug.cgi?id=2186335 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2023-29581 yasm: Segmentation violation via the function delete_Token at /nasm/nasm-pp.c [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2186334](show_bug.cgi?id=2186334 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2023-29581 yasm: Segmentation violation via the function delete_Token at /nasm/nasm-pp.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2186333#c4)  Siddhesh Poyarekar    2023-04-14 17:50:19 UTC  ``` Why is this a security issue? Assemblers are not a service and shouldn't be required to accept untrusted input.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2186333#c5)  Pedro Sampaio    2023-04-14 21:09:27 UTC  ``` As far as I can see, this CVE was not assigned by us, but by Mitre and since it was published, we have to file the bug nonetheless. Any requests to reject this CVE ID have to be directed to Mitre via cveform:  <https://cveform.mitre.org/>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2186333#c8)  Dominik 'Rathann' Mierzejewski    2024-03-22 12:00:46 UTC  ``` Thanks for the link, rejection request sent.   ``` |  |
