Good attachment management solution for WordPress. CDN support would make it perfect.

Hello,
the plugin produces these warnings, when used shortcode for the list.
Warning: Illegal string offset 'echo' in wp-content/plugins/download-attachments/includes/shortcodes.php on line 66
Warning: Illegal string offset 'title' in wp-content/plugins/download-attachments/includes/shortcodes.php on line 69
Warning: Cannot assign an empty string to a string offset in wp-content/plugins/download-attachments/includes/shortcodes.php on line 69
Warning: Illegal string offset 'title' in wp-content/plugins/download-attachments/includes/shortcodes.php on line 72
And I have front page made of one most recent post. The list doesn’t show there and I couldn’t find any option that would enable it. Please fix.
Great idea and plugin. I will change the review, when improved. Thanks

### Description

The Download Attachments plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'download-attachments' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
