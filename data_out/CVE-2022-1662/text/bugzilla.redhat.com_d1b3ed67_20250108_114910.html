| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2083851#c0)  Todd Cullum    2022-05-10 19:33:05 UTC  ``` In convert2rhel 0.24 and 0.25, there's an ansible playbook named ansible/run-convert2rhel.yml which passes the Red Hat Subscription Manager user password via the CLI to convert2rhel. This could allow unauthorized local users to view the password via the process list while convert2rhel is running. However, this ansible playbook is only an example in the upstream repository and it is not shipped in officially supported versions of convert2rhel.  Commit that introduced the flaw: <https://github.com/oamg/convert2rhel/commit/01a6d5596c88118b871f849077f4ffd44ba9e5aa> Upstream patch: <https://github.com/oamg/convert2rhel/pull/493/commits/15cace456d06f31e7ddb7cdb443bd2cc8a1614e1>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2083851#c1)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-05-12 06:15:15 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2022-1662>   ``` |  |
