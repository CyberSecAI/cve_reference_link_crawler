Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An Ansible playbook (`ansible/run-convert2rhel.yml`) within the `convert2rhel` tool was passing the Red Hat Subscription Manager user password via the command-line interface (CLI) to the `convert2rhel` tool.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Exposure of Credentials in Process List:** Passing the password as a command-line argument makes it visible in the system's process list. This list can be accessed by local users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access to Credentials:** Local users could potentially view the Red Hat Subscription Manager user password by inspecting the process list while the `convert2rhel` tool is running.
- **Potential for Further Unauthorized Actions:**  The compromised password could be used to perform unauthorized actions using the Red Hat Subscription Manager.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any user with local access to the system where the `convert2rhel` tool is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable `convert2rhel` tool is executed. They also need the ability to view the process list.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable Ansible playbook was only an example provided in the upstream repository and was not included in officially supported versions of `convert2rhel`.
- A fix was made upstream by not passing the password via the command line.
