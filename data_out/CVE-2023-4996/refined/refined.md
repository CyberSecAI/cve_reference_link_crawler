- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Netskope NSClient had a vulnerability where a user control code, when called by a Windows ServiceController, did not validate the permissions of the calling user before executing. This user control code had the ability to terminate the NSClient service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authorization/permission check. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the lack of permission validation when a user control code is executed by the Windows ServiceController, which allows unprivileged users to call code that terminates the NSClient service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious non-admin user could disable the Netskope client by using a specially crafted package, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** A non-admin local user executes a specially crafted package to trigger the vulnerable user control code via the Windows ServiceController.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local non-admin user on a Windows system with the vulnerable version of the Netskope client installed.
