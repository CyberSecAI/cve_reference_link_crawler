The provided content details a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in RPi-Jukebox-RFID version 2.7, as reported in GitHub issue #2398.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `htdocs/manageFilesFolders.php` script. Specifically, the script takes user-controlled data from `$_POST['folder']` and `$_POST['folderNew']`, concatenates them, and uses the result in a call to `exec()` to create a directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the injection of arbitrary commands via the `$_POST['folderNew']` parameter. Specifically, the code concatenates the user-supplied input with folder paths before passing to an `exec` function. Because the concatenation occurs before sanitization, the attacker can inject shell commands into the `$moveFolder` variable.
  - **Insufficient Input Validation:** The script fails to adequately sanitize or validate the `$_POST['folder']` and `$_POST['folderNew']` parameters, allowing the injection of shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands, leading to complete control over the server. The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the creation of a web shell which the attacker can subsequently connect to and execute commands.
  - **Arbitrary File Creation:** By leveraging the `mkdir` command the attacker can create arbitrary files and directories.
  - **Privilege Escalation:** While the code already runs as user `pi`, it uses `sudo` in the command, which implies that `pi` has passwordless sudo privileges. 

**Attack Vectors:**
  - **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is executed by sending a crafted POST request to `htdocs/manageFilesFolders.php`.
  - **`$_POST['folder']` and `$_POST['folderNew']` parameters:** The vulnerable parameters in the POST request are `folder` and `folderNew`. The `folder` parameter is used to bypass the check at line 90. The `folderNew` is injected with malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable RPi-Jukebox-RFID server to send the malicious POST request.
  - **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without any authentication (No permissions required).
  - **Target Software:** The attacker must be targeting the specific vulnerable version (v2.7) of RPi-Jukebox-RFID.

**PoC details**
The provided PoC demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability:
   - The attacker sends a POST request to `/htdocs/manageFilesFolders.php`.
   - The `ACTION` parameter is set to `fileUpload`.
   - The `folder` parameter is set to `2` to bypass the initial check.
   - The `folderNew` parameter is injected with a payload to create a webshell.
The PoC includes the URL-encoded and non-URL-encoded payloads for clarity. The corrected PoC includes escaping the `@` symbol to create a working webshell.

The vulnerability is present in the `legacy_v2` version of the software.
