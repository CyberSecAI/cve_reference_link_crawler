Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2022-48945.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing boundary check in the `vivid` video driver when adjusting the compose height within the `V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP` case. Specifically, the code forgets to verify that the adjusted compose size remains within the allowed boundaries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient boundary check: The code doesn't properly check if the adjusted compose height exceeds the allowed bounds after a `V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP` selection.
- Memory corruption: Due to the missing check, a memcpy operation can write to an invalid memory address, causing a page fault.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: The vulnerability leads to a kernel page fault, resulting in a crash, denial of service.
- Memory corruption:  Out-of-bounds memory access could potentially lead to further memory corruption

**Attack vectors:**
- V4L2 API calls: An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by making specific V4L2 API calls that manipulate the compose settings, specifically targeting the `V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP` case.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to interact with the video device API: The attacker needs to be able to make V4L2 API calls, suggesting local access to the video device or a process with sufficient privilege.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix adds `v4l2_rect_map_inside()` to ensure the composed rectangle is mapped inside the format rectangle.
- The issue was found by syzkaller, a kernel fuzzer, which identified the crash when an invalid memory address was being accessed.
- The vulnerability is located in the vivid video capture driver.
- The fix is associated with the commit id `94a7ad9283464b75b12516c5512541d467cefcf8`.
