## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# SULly < 4.3.1 - Plugin Reset via CSRF

### Description

The plugin does not have CSRF checks in some places, which could allow attackers to make logged in users perform unwanted actions via CSRF attacks

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open the URL:
https://example.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=sully.php&SULlyRemoveAction=TRUE
Note: It clears the logs but not the settings.

### Affects Plugins
