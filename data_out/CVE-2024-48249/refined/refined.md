Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2024-48249, CVE-2024-48251, CVE-2024-48257, and CVE-2024-48261:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The primary root cause of these vulnerabilities is the use of raw SQL queries with string concatenation within the Wavelog application. User-supplied input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This makes the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**  The application fails to properly sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries. Specifically, the variables `$band`, `$sat`, `$propagation`, `$mode` in `Gridmap_model.php` and `Activated_gridmap_model.php` and the `station_id` in `Oqrs_model.php` are vulnerable.
    *   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerable code paths in `Gridmap.php`, `Activated_gridmap.php`, and `Oqrs.php` lack proper user authentication and authorization. This enables an attacker to exploit the vulnerabilities without any credentials.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can manipulate SQL queries to gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to:
        *   **Data Breach:** Reading sensitive data from the database.
        *   **Data Modification:** Modifying or deleting data in the database.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:**  Potentially gaining control over the database server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerabilities are exploited through HTTP POST requests to the application. Malicious SQL code can be injected through the parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server where Wavelog is hosted.
    *   **No Authentication Required:**  Since the SQL injection is unauthenticated, no user credentials are required for exploitation.

**Specific CVE details:**

*   **CVE-2024-48249**: SQL Injection in `application/models/Gridmap_model.php` via parameters `band`, `sat`, `propagation`, and `mode` of the `get_band_confirmed` function.
*   **CVE-2024-48251**: SQL Injection in `application/models/Activated_gridmap_model.php` via parameters `band`, `sat`, `propagation`, and `mode` of the `get_band_confirmed` function.
*    **CVE-2024-48257**: SQL Injection in `application/models/Oqrs_model.php` via parameter `station_id` of the `get_worked_modes` function.
*   **CVE-2024-48261**: SQL Injection in `application/models/Activated_gridmap_model.php` via parameters `band`, `sat`, `propagation`, and `mode` of the `get_band_confirmed` function.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content shows that the developers were aware of the issue and have attempted to fix it by using parameterized queries in some places, as shown in the diff of `Stations.php` (e.g., "Replace evil SQLs with bindings" commit message). However, the vulnerabilities detailed above remained unfixed at the time the analysis was written.
*   The blog post describing the vulnerabilities includes proof-of-concept exploits using `sqlmap`.
