Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details related to CVE-2013-1278:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the Windows kernel's improper handling of objects in memory. This leads to a race condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Race Condition:** The core issue is a race condition within the Windows kernel. This occurs when multiple threads or processes access shared memory concurrently and the outcome of the execution depends on the specific timing of the events. In this case, the improper handling of memory objects during this race creates a vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode. This grants the attacker the highest level of privileges on the system.
- **Full System Control:** With kernel-level access, an attacker can:
  - Install programs
  - View, change, or delete data
  - Create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access Required:** The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Malicious Application:** The attacker would need to run a specially crafted application that exploits the race condition in the kernel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid User Credentials:** An attacker needs to have a valid user account on the targeted system.
- **Local Logon:** The attacker must be able to log on to the system directly or through a remote session that provides local access.
- **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker needs to be able to run a malicious application on the system.
