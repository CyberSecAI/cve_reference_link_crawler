Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36460:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The VeryFitPro mobile application (both Android and iOS versions) uses a flawed authentication mechanism. Instead of transmitting the user's password to the backend server for hashing, the application performs SHA-1 hashing of the password locally on the device. It then sends this hash to the server for authentication. The server compares the received hash with the stored hash to verify the user's identity.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Use of Password Hash for Authentication (CWE-836):** The primary vulnerability is that the application uses the password hash as the actual authentication token, rather than the original password.
* **Pass the Hash Vulnerability:** An attacker in possession of a user's password hash can bypass the password authentication and gain access to the account.
* **Insecure Hashing Algorithm:** The application uses SHA-1 for hashing, which is considered weak and vulnerable to collision attacks. This can potentially enable an attacker to forge a valid hash.
* **Plaintext Transmission of Password Hash**: Although not a vulnerability on its own, the password hash is sent in clear text via HTTP, which means if an attacker is on the same network they could capture the hash and use it to login.
* **Lack of Backend Hashing:** The server directly compares the received hash with the stored hash instead of rehashing it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Account Takeover:** An attacker can gain complete control of a user's account without knowing the user's actual password.
* **Impersonation:** The attacker can perform any action the legitimate user can, including changing passwords and accessing personal data.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Hash Acquisition:** Attackers can obtain password hashes through various methods, including:
    * **SQL Injection:** Exploiting database vulnerabilities to directly access stored password hashes.
    * **Information Exposure:** Unintentional leakage of password hashes due to insecure server configurations or other vulnerabilities.
    * **Network Sniffing:** Capturing the password hash during transmission over HTTP (or a compromised HTTPS connection).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to obtain a valid password hash.
* The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP/HTTPS requests. This is easily accomplished with a proxy like Burp.
* The attacker needs access to a device capable of running the VeryFitPro application.

**Additional Details:**
* The issue affects VeryFitPro app versions 3.3.7 and below for both Android and iOS.
* The Android app has over 10 million downloads.
* The iOS app is a top app in the "Health & Fitness" category with 3.4K ratings.
* The vendor was contacted multiple times but did not provide any reply.
* The vulnerability is also referred to as a "Pass the Hash" attack.
* Mitigation includes sending the plain text password to the backend over HTTPS and rehashing the password with a strong algorithm like Argon2 on the backend.
