The provided content is related to CVE-2023-43661.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input passed to the Twig templating engine, which allows for Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). Specifically, the `template` input provided when creating or updating incidents is directly used to create a Twig template.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided template data before rendering it with the Twig template engine. This allows an attacker to inject malicious template code.
- **Direct use of user input:** The `template` parameter is directly used within the `createTemplate()` method without sufficient sanitization.
- **Insufficient Twig configuration:**  The initial configuration lacked proper sandboxing, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code through Twig.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. This can lead to full system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **API endpoint:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/api/v1/incidents` endpoint.
- **Template parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `template` parameter within the API request to inject malicious Twig code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated user:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, though not necessarily an admin user.
- **API access:** The attacker must be able to interact with the API.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists due to the usage of the `Twig` templating engine without proper sandboxing.
- The fix includes:
  -  Upgrading `twig/twig` to version 3.0
  - Implementing a sandboxed Twig environment using `Twig\Sandbox\SecurityPolicy` and `Twig\Extension\SandboxExtension`.
  -  Adding a configurable `twig` setting array to define allowed `tags`, `filters`, `methods`, `props`, and `functions`.
  - Applying the sandboxing to both `CreateIncidentCommandHandler` and `UpdateIncidentCommandHandler`.
