- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A URL redirection vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input, specifically within the `/portal/disclaimer` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Open Redirect (CWE-601). The application redirects users to an arbitrary URL based on attacker controlled input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can redirect users to a malicious website. This could be used for phishing attacks or to deliver malware.
- **Attack vectors**: A crafted URL is used to redirect users to an arbitrary website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can be unauthenticated to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL, typically by manipulating parameters in the query string of the request.
