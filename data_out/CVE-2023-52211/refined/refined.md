- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken access control. Specifically, a lack of proper authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute privileged actions. The specific impact varies based on the affected function.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable by any unauthenticated user by exploiting the function with missing authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any special privileges and no authentication is required. They only need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable function.
