- **Root cause of vulnerability**: User summaries were accessible to anonymous users even when the `hide_user_profiles_from_public` setting was enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control, allowing unauthorized access to user summaries.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exposure of user summary information to unauthorized (anonymous) users, which should have been hidden based on the `hide_user_profiles_from_public` setting. This represents a low impact on confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors**: Network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special privileges or user interaction is required; an attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable Discourse instance.
