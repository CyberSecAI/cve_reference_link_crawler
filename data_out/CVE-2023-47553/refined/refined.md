- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress UserHeat Plugin versions prior to 1.1.11 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the application, leveraging the user's authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a CSRF attack, where a malicious actor can craft a request that is unknowingly executed by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a higher-privileged, authenticated user into executing a crafted request. The attacker is not required to have any prior authentication or access to the application.
