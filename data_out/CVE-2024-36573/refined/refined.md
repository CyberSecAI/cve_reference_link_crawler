- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from improper handling of property assignments within the `add`, `reduce`, and `Object.set` functions of the `@almela/obx` library. These functions directly assign properties from a source object to a destination object without proper validation or sanitization, which makes it vulnerable to prototype pollution. Specifically, it does not prevent the usage of the `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` properties.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Prototype pollution: The library allows an attacker to modify the prototype of built-in JavaScript objects (like `Object`) by injecting properties using `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype`. This occurs because the code copies properties directly from the source to the destination without checking if they are the special prototype manipulation properties.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Denial of Service (DoS): By polluting the prototype, an attacker can modify core object behaviors, potentially causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE): In certain scenarios, prototype pollution can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the server or client side.
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): By manipulating the prototype chain, an attacker might be able to inject malicious scripts into web pages.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - Malicious JSON or object: An attacker can supply a malicious JSON object or a javascript object containing `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` keys. The vulnerable function will take this object and directly assign it to the target object without protection which will result in the prototype pollution.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs the ability to control the input to the vulnerable functions. Specifically, the attacker needs to be able to inject a maliciously crafted JSON/Javascript object.
