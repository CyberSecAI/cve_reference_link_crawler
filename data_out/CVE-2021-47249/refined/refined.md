The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47249.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A memory leak occurs in the `rds_recvmsg` function of the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) module in the Linux kernel. The issue stems from an un-decremented reference count on an incoming message (`inc`) when `rds_cmsg_recv` fails.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Memory leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak. Specifically, the reference count of an `inc` structure is incremented via `rds_inc_addref()`, but is not decremented (via `rds_inc_put()`) when `rds_cmsg_recv()` fails. This leads to memory being allocated but not released.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Repeatedly triggering this condition can lead to memory exhaustion, potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `rds_recvmsg` function when the `rds_cmsg_recv` call fails.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to send messages that cause the `rds_cmsg_recv` function to fail, triggering the leak.
- The attacker needs to be in a position where they can interact with the RDS socket interface.
