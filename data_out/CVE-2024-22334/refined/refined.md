- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incomplete revocation of permissions when deleting a custom security resource type.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Failure to fully revoke associated permissions of objects using a custom security type when the type is deleted.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Incorrect reporting of permission configuration and unexpected privileges being retained, potentially leading to unauthorized access or actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with the ability to create and delete custom security resource types can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires the ability to create and delete custom security resource types within the IBM DevOps Deploy / IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD) system.
