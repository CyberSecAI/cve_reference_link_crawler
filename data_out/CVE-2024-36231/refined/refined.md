The provided content is a security bulletin from Adobe that details multiple vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). The bulletin lists CVE-2024-36231, among many others, as a stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information for CVE-2024-36231:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which typically arises when user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or encoded before being displayed on a web page.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is saved on the server and executed when other users access the affected content. This falls under CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker can potentially run malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser, leading to a wide range of attacks, including session hijacking, data theft, and other malicious activities.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning it can be exploited remotely. The attack complexity is low (AC:L) and requires a low privileged user (PR:L) to initiate the attack, meaning a normal user account is likely sufficient. User interaction (UI:R) is required, meaning the victim must interact with the injected content. The scope is changed (S:C), meaning that the injected script is executed in the context of the AEM application.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have low privileged access to the AEM application. They would need the ability to store malicious script content that will later be displayed to other users. They do not need any special privileges or positions to achieve this.

In summary, CVE-2024-36231 is a stored XSS vulnerability that allows a low-privileged attacker to execute arbitrary code in the browser of a victim user by storing malicious script content. This is a network-based attack with low complexity.
