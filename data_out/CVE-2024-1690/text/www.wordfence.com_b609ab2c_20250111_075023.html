### Description

The TeraWallet – Best WooCommerce Wallet System With Cashback Rewards, Partial Payment, Wallet Refunds plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the terawallet\_export\_user\_search() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.10. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to export a list of registered users and their emails.
