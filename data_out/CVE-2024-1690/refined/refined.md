Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1690

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `terawallet_export_user_search()` function of the TeraWallet plugin. This function was intended to be used for exporting user data, but lacked proper access control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the absence of a capability check before executing the `terawallet_export_user_search()` function. This allows unauthorized access to the functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain a list of registered users and their email addresses. This information can be used for malicious purposes like targeted phishing attacks or spam campaigns.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is accessed over the network.
*   **Authentication Required:** Attackers must have an account on the affected WordPress website, even a subscriber-level account.
*   **Direct Request:** The attacker directly calls the vulnerable AJAX function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site, with a minimum role of subscriber.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Information:**
*   **Affected Versions:** TeraWallet plugin versions up to and including 1.4.10 are vulnerable.
*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.4.11.
*   **CVSS Score:** 4.3 (Medium)
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Lucio SÃ¡.
*   The provided code diff shows the addition of a capability check (`get_wallet_user_capability()`) before the code that fetches users to prevent unauthorized access.
