## 4. MITIGATIONS

CyberPower has released a new version of PowerPanel business that fixes these vulnerabilities:

PowerPanel business: Update to [v4.10.1 or later version](https://www.cyberpower.com/global/en/product/sku/powerpanel_business_for_windows#downloads)

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

**CyberPower** **PowerPanel Business for Windows**
is an advanced power management software designed to monitor and manage CyberPower UPS systems and network-connected ATS/PDUs. The software features an intuitive and color-coded interface for instant confirmation of power status and system alerts. PowerPanel Business offers a variety of options and customizable settings, such as unattended shutdown of computers and virtual machines connected to a battery backup during a power event, automatic event notification via email, SMS, and instant messaging, scheduling of shutdowns and restarts, history event logging for tracking and analyzing trends, user-programmable command scripts for customizing event actions, and much more. In addition, the software allows remote access and management via a web browser, ensuring a smooth operation of your system.
The software is divided into PowerPanel Business LOCAL, REMOTE and MANAGEMENT, to fulfill different levels of power management.
LOCAL allows you to manage the UPS systems locally and perform graceful shutdown for computers connected via USB or serial cable.
REMOTE provides remote management and automatic shutdown for network-connected equipment through RMCARD installed in the UPS systems.
MANAGEMENT provides monitoring and management for multiple UPS systems and PDUs via network.
Furthermore, PowerPanel Business LOCAL supports cloud solution, which allows users to add the UPS to PowerPanel Cloud, thus enabling system monitoring on the go through a secure web portal or mobile app. To access the UPS details through the PowerPanel Cloud service, plan purchase is required. All CyberPower single-phased UPS models are bundled with a free trial. Standard free trial is 30 days. For selected UPS models (all model names starting with OL, PR, OR, or including PFC characters), the trial is extended to 90 days. CyberPower reserves the right to adjust the content of free trial at any time without prior notice.
