The provided content describes a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in HelpDeskZ v2.0.2.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization of the `Title` parameter when creating custom fields. Specifically, the application fails to properly neutralize or encode user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious scripts can be permanently stored in the database and executed when other users view the affected content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **User data compromise:** An attacker could potentially steal user cookies or session tokens, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Session hijacking:** Attackers could hijack user sessions, leading to unauthorized access and actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Malicious actions:** An attacker could perform arbitrary actions on the user's behalf, such as modifying data or redirecting to phishing sites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the "title" field when creating a custom field.
- This injected code is stored in the database and executed when a user views the custom field settings in the user panel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with the ability to create custom fields.
- The attacker must be able to manipulate the HTTP request, for example using Burp Suite.
- No special privileges are required.
