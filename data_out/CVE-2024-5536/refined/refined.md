Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5536

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `gamipress_link` shortcode of the GamiPress – Link plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided attributes within the `gamipress_link` shortcode before rendering them on a web page. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation enables an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages.
- When a user accesses a page containing the injected script, the script will execute in the user's browser.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, or defacement of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the `gamipress_link` shortcode.
- An attacker can inject malicious code through shortcode attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated users with contributor-level access or higher can inject malicious scripts.
- The attacker needs to be able to create or edit content that can utilize the vulnerable shortcode.
- No user interaction is required beyond normal page access for the XSS payload to execute.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the GamiPress – Link plugin up to and including 1.1.4.
- The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.1.5 by using `esc_url` and `esc_attr` to sanitize the `href` attribute.
- The vulnerable code was located in `includes/shortcodes/gamipress_link.php`, specifically around line 92. The fix included changing the sanitization method of the href attribute from `esc_attr()` to `esc_url(esc_attr())`
