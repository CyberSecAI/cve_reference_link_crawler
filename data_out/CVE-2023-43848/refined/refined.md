{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Incorrect Access Control",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The firewall management function checks only if the SID provided is valid and if the UID provided is *8* (administrator account), but it does not verify if the session belongs to a privileged user.",
      "The device allows modification of firewall rules even with an unprivileged user session id."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with a valid unprivileged session ID can control the device local firewall rules, potentially blocking legitimate access or allowing unauthorized network traffic.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker must obtain a valid session ID via a legitimate login.",
      "The attacker crafts and sends a POST request to the `/device_management/security.cgi` endpoint, modifying firewall rules using specific parameters such as 'devsecuipXX' or 'devsecumacXX'."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs a valid session ID obtained through normal login, which can be obtained by a low privilege user. No other special privileges or access are required."
