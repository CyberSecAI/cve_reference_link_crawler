- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The TemplatesNext OnePager WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website. These scripts can be used for various malicious purposes, such as redirects, displaying unwanted advertisements, or other HTML payloads. When a user visits a page with injected scripts, the scripts will be executed in their browser, potentially compromising their session, stealing their cookies, or redirecting them to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to have the ability to inject malicious scripts into the plugin's input fields or parameters. The privilege level needed is "Contributor."
