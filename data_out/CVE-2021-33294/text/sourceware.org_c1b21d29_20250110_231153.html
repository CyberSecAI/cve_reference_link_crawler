We should sanity check the offsets to make sure we don't loop "forever"  <https://sourceware.org/pipermail/elfutils-devel/2021q1/003607.html>  commit 480b6fa3662ba8ffeee274bf0d37423413c01e55 Author: Mark Wielaard <mark@klomp.org> Date:   Wed Mar 3 21:40:53 2021 +0100      readelf: Sanity check verneed and verdef offsets in handle_symtab.          We are going through vna_next, vn_next and vd_next in a while loop.     Make sure that all offsets are sane. We don't want things to wrap     around so we go in cycles.
