- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient parameter filtering in the Apache Linkis DatasourceManager module, specifically when configuring a new MySQL data source. This allows an attacker to inject malicious parameters.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Deserialization vulnerability. The vulnerability arises due to the lack of proper sanitization of input parameters when setting up a new data source, specifically a MySQL data source. An attacker can exploit this by crafting malicious serialized objects within the parameters that will be deserialized by the application.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution (RCE). Successfully exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable Apache Linkis instance.

- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can configure a new data source using malicious parameters, specifically targeting a MySQL data source.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to configure a new data source, which would generally require some level of access to the Linkis application.
