In Apache Linkis <=1.3.1, because the parameters are not
effectively filtered, the attacker uses the MySQL data source and malicious parameters to
configure a new data source to trigger a deserialization vulnerability, eventually leading to
remote code execution.
 Versions of Apache Linkis <= 1.3.0 will be affected.
We recommend users upgrade the version of Linkis to version 1.3.2.
