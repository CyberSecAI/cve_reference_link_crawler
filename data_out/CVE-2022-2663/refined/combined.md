## [NAT-Again: IRC NAT helper flaws](#_)

***tl;dr:*** A Linux kernel bug allows unencrypted NAT'd IRC sessions to be abused to
access resources behind NAT, or drop connections. Switch to TLS right now. Or read on.

[NAT slipstreaming](https://samy.pl/slipstream/) was an attack where a NAT device is
tricked into forwarding requests into a network that is behind a NAT router. The original attack is
largely mitigated and primarily targets web browsers.

This attack works against a standard IRC client. It is possible due to a bug in
the Linux netfilter implementation, in particular nf\_conntrack\_irc. I have not checked other NAT
implementations but similar attacks may be possible.

Interestingly the discoverer of NAT slipstreaming has an attack from 2010 called ["NAT Pinning"](https://samy.pl/natpin/) that leveraged IRC, but the novel
addition here is the fact the matching done on the message is not complete.

### Background on IRC

IRC is a simple and very old text based protocol, each line sent or received
from the server represents a message in the IRC protocol. In order to extend
the protocol IRC clients support a protocol called Client to Client Protocol
(CTCP). CTCP simply uses the ^A character ("\001") to mark the special messages
that are not messages between users, but some form of control message.

On top of this protocol some clients support a protocol called DCC ("Direct
Client-to-Client") that allows for connections between clients, by sending the
other client the details of the IP and port to connect to. This protocol is
what nf\_conntrack\_irc targets in order to change the IP sent to the other
client and therefore continue to allow DCC connections in the presence of NAT.

### The bugs

This attack leverages two bugs in nf\_conntrack\_irc.

First bug: nf\_conntrack\_irc does not completely match on the IRC protocol.

As mentioned above DCC messages are contained within a CTCP message, therefore
to find a DCC message the string "\1DCC " should be matched. This string should
be at the start of a message -- this is the bug, nf\_conntrack\_irc allows this
string anywhere within the outbound TCP stream.

This code snippet from
[nf\_conntrack\_irc.c](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v5.19/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_irc.c#L154-L160)
shows the main matching code, in particular it looks through the string (while loop) finding the
first instance
of "\1DCC " (with memcmp).

```
  /* strlen("\1DCC SENT t AAAAAAAA P\1\n")=24
   * 5+MINMATCHLEN+strlen("t AAAAAAAA P\1\n")=14 */
  while (data < data_limit - (19 + MINMATCHLEN)) {
      if (memcmp(data, "\1DCC ", 5)) {
          data++;
          continue;
      }

```

Second bug: The external IP address is not checked correctly.

Again, in nf\_conntrack\_irc.c the comment says it is checking for "the internal
OR external IP". In fact this code is buggy and instead checks for the IP
address of the IRC server.

```
    /* dcc_ip can be the internal OR external (NAT'ed) IP */
    tuple = &ct->tuplehash[dir].tuple;
    if (tuple->src.u3.ip != dcc_ip &&
        tuple->dst.u3.ip != dcc_ip) {
          net_warn_ratelimited("Forged DCC command from %pI4: %pI4:%u\n",
```

There is also a related third bug that allows for a DoS, if the port specified
is 0, then the packet is dropped, eventually resulting the user being
disconnected from IRC (because they cannot send any further packets on the
connection).

### The attack on IRC

Because of the first bug, we can trick a connected IRC client into opening a
port forward of our liking by sending it a specially crafted CTCP PING message.

We can also take advantage of the second bug and only need to provide the
address of the server the user is connected to (often available from /whois on
IRC networks).

If 198.51.100.1 is the address of the IRC server the victim user is connected
to, we can craft a message by encoding the IP as a number:

```
$ perl -MSocket -E'say unpack "N", inet_aton("198.51.100.1")'
3325256705

```

This then leads to constructing a raw IRC message like:

`PRIVMSG ExampleUser :^APING ^ADCC CHAT x 3325256705 22^A`

(where ^A is Ctrl-A, to type this on some clients needs Ctrl-V Ctrl-A,
prefixing the raw command with /quote to send it from most clients.)

Once this command is run you should see a reply from the user's client, with
the 3325256705 number replaced with their numeric IP address. Example:

`CTCP PING reply from ExampleUser: ADCC CHAT x 3221225985 22`

Connecting to this IP and port should lead to port 22 on their internal
machine.

The above has been tested and works on Irssi and mIRC, other clients may not
respond to the PING in quite the same way. Here is a demo video of the attack
against Irssi:

Note because the response packet is rewritten it would be possible to use
something like this to scan for vulnerable users (in particular, it's possible
to send a CTCP PING message to a whole channel); as well as reveal an IP
address of a user, that would otherwise be "cloaked" by the IRC server.

The third bug mentioned (sending port 0), combined with the reflection attack
means it is possible to disconnect a user.

### Mitigations

* **Use TLS for IRC**, this means nf\_conntrack\_irc cannot intercept DCC requests
  and DCC NAT traversal will not work without manual port forwarding. (Using TLS hopefully goes
  without saying these days anyway.)
* Since upstream kernel version 4.6 (commit [3bb398d925ec](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/3bb398d925ec "netfilter: nf_ct_helper: disable automatic helper assignment")) NAT helpers have not
  been loaded by default and need a
  [rule to enable them](https://home.regit.org/netfilter-en/secure-use-of-helpers/).
  However some consumer routers use an older kernel version, or change the default back and load
  helpers. (As a result of this vulnerability [a change is being made](https://lore.kernel.org/netfilter-devel/20220826070600.8404-1-pablo%40netfilter.org/T/#u "[PATCH nf] netfilter: remove nf_conntrack_helper sysctl
    toggle") to make the helpers require explicit configuration.)
* In the short term remove any iptables rules referencing `-m helper --helper
  irc` and unload nf\_conntrack\_irc.
  On MikroTik devices remove IRC from the service ports list (`/ip firewall/service-port/disable irc`)
* Apply the [patch](https://lore.kernel.org/netfilter-devel/20220826045658.100360-1-dgl%40dgl.cx/T/).

### Recommendations

* Potentially entirely deprecate and remove nf\_conntrack\_irc, it's unclear it
  has much use anymore.
* Fix nf\_conntrack\_irc to match on "PRIVMSG" and " :" (case insensitively) before the DCC
  string. It is unlikely IP fragmentation is a concern as in the original NAT slipstreaming attacks
  because IRC is limited to 512 bytes per message, so a PING request cannot generate a fragmented
  response, however this could be investigated further.

  + Matching on "PRIVMSG" provides defence-in-depth, as a reply to a CTCP
    message is sent as a "NOTICE".
* Fix nf\_conntrack\_irc to match on the external NAT'd IP (or even drop it as it
  is unclear it has worked correctly and matching only the internal IP somewhat
  increases the difficulty of attacking this).
  [Patches have been sent for these](https://lore.kernel.org/netfilter-devel/20220826045658.100360-1-dgl%40dgl.cx/T/ "[PATCH 1/2] netfilter: nf_conntrack_irc: Tighten matching on DCC message").
* IRC clients [should implement](https://github.com/ircv3/ircv3-specifications/issues/504) a defence-in-depth of dropping "^A" inside CTCP
  PING responses. It is also possible for an IRC network to filter this, this vulnerability was pre-disclosed to [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/) and they have implemented filtering.

This issue is tracked as CVE-2022-2663.

Debian Bug     : 1017425 1019248

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2021-4037

    Christian Brauner reported that the inode_init_owner function for
    the XFS filesystem in the Linux kernel allows local users to
    create files with an unintended group ownership allowing attackers
    to escalate privileges by making a plain file executable and SGID.

CVE-2022-0171

    Mingwei Zhang reported that a cache incoherence issue in the SEV
    API in the KVM subsystem may result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-1184

    A flaw was discovered in the ext4 filesystem driver which can lead
    to a use-after-free. A local user permitted to mount arbitrary
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash
    or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-1679

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the ath9k_htc driver
    which can lead to a use-after-free.  This might be exploitable to
    cause a denial service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-2153

    "kangel" reported a flaw in the KVM implementation for x86
    processors which could lead to a null pointer dereference. A local
    user permitted to access /dev/kvm could exploit this to cause a
    denial of service (crash).

CVE-2022-2602

    A race between handling an io_uring request and the Unix socket
    garbage collector was discovered. An attacker can take advantage
    of this flaw for local privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-2663

    David Leadbeater reported flaws in the nf_conntrack_irc
    connection-tracking protocol module. When this module is enabled
    on a firewall, an external user on the same IRC network as an
    internal user could exploit its lax parsing to open arbitrary TCP
    ports in the firewall, to reveal their public IP address, or to
    block their IRC connection at the firewall.

CVE-2022-2905

    Hsin-Wei Hung reported a flaw in the eBPF verifier which can lead
    to an out-of-bounds read.  If unprivileged use of eBPF is enabled,
    this could leak sensitive information.  This was already disabled
    by default, which would fully mitigate the vulnerability.

CVE-2022-3028

    Abhishek Shah reported a race condition in the AF_KEY subsystem,
    which could lead to an out-of-bounds write or read.  A local user
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption), to obtain sensitive information, or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-3061

    A flaw was discovered in the i740 driver which may result in
    denial of service.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-3176

    A use-after-free flaw was discovered in the io_uring subsystem
    which may result in local privilege escalation to root.

CVE-2022-3303

    A race condition in the snd_pcm_oss_sync function in the sound
    subsystem in the Linux kernel due to improper locking may result
    in denial of service.

CVE-2022-3586 (ZDI-22-1452)

    The Zero Day Initiative reported a flaw in the sch_sfb network
    scheduler, which may lead to a use-after-free and leak of
    sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2022-3621, CVE-2022-3646

    The syzbot tool found flaws in the nilfs2 filesystem driver which
    can lead to a null pointer dereference or memory leak.  A user
    permitted to mount arbitrary filesystem images could use these to
    cause a denial of service (crash or resource exhaustion).

CVE-2022-3625

    A flaw was discovered in the devlink subsystem which can lead to
    a use-after-free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2022-3629

    The syzbot tool found a memory leak in the Virtual Socket Protocol
    implementation.  A local user could exploit this to cause a denial
    of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2022-3633

    The Linux Verification Center found a memory leak in the SAE J1939
    protocol implementation.  A local user could exploit this to cause
    a denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2022-3635

    Several race conditions were discovered in the idt77252 ATM
    driver, which can lead to a use-after-free if the module is
    removed.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2022-3649

    The syzbot tool found flaws in the nilfs2 filesystem driver which
    can lead to a use-after-free.  A user permitted to mount arbitrary
    filesystem images could use these to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-20421

    A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in the
    binder_inc_ref_for_node function in the Android binder driver. On
    systems where the binder driver is loaded, a local user could
    exploit this for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-20422

    A race condition was discovered in the instruction emulator for
    64-bit Arm systems.  Concurrent changes to the sysctls that
    control the emulator could result in a null pointer dereference.
    The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2022-39188

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the kernel's handling of
    unmapping of certain memory ranges. When a driver created a memory
    mapping with the VM_PFNMAP flag, which many GPU drivers do, the
    memory mapping could be removed and freed before it was flushed
    from the CPU TLBs. This could result in a page use-after-free. A
    local user with access to such a device could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-39190

    Gwangun Jung reported a flaw in the nf_tables subsystem.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2022-39842

    An integer overflow was discovered in the pxa3xx-gcu video driver
    which could lead to a heap out-of-bounds write.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-40307

    A race condition was discovered in the EFI capsule-loader driver,
    which could lead to use-after-free. A local user permitted to
    access this device (/dev/efi_capsule_loader) could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
    for privilege escalation. However, this device is normally only
    accessible by the root user.

CVE-2022-41222

    A race condition was discovered in the memory management subsystem
    that can lead to stale TLB entries.  A local user could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash),
    information leak, or privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-41674, CVE-2022-42719, CVE-2022-42720, CVE-2022-42721,
CVE-2022-42722

    Soenke Huster discovered several vulnerabilities in the mac80211
    subsystem triggered by WLAN frames which may result in denial of
    service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2022-43750

    The syzbot tool found that the USB monitor (usbmon) driver allowed
    user-space programs to overwrite the driver's data structures.  A
    local user permitted to access a USB monitor device could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.  However, by default only the
    root user can access such devices.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
5.10.149-2~deb10u1.  This update also fixes a regression for some
older 32-bit PCs (bug #1017425), and enables the i10nm_edac driver
(bug #1019248).  It additionally includes many more bug fixes from
stable updates 5.10.137-5.10.149 inclusive.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-5.10 packages.

Debian Bug     : 1018752

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2021-4159

    A flaw was found in the eBPF verifier which could lead to an
    out-of-bounds read.  If unprivileged use of eBPF is enabled, this
    could leak sensitive information.  This was already disabled by
    default, which would fully mitigate the vulnerability.

CVE-2021-33655

    A user with access to a framebuffer console device could cause a
    memory out-of-bounds write via the FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO ioctl.

CVE-2021-33656

    A user with access to a framebuffer console device could cause a
    memory out-of-bounds write via some font setting ioctls.  These
    obsolete ioctls have been removed.

CVE-2022-1462

    ä¸åªç reported a race condition in the pty (pseudo-terminal)
    subsystem that can lead to a slab out-of-bounds write.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-1679

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the ath9k_htc driver
    which can lead to a use-after-free.  This might be exploitable to
    cause a denial service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-2153

    "kangel" reported a flaw in the KVM implementation for x86
    processors which could lead to a null pointer dereference. A local
    user permitted to access /dev/kvm could exploit this to cause a
    denial of service (crash).

CVE-2022-2318

    A use-after-free in the Amateur Radio X.25 PLP (Rose) support may
    result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-2586

    A use-after-free in the Netfilter subsystem may result in local
    privilege escalation for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability
    in any user or network namespace.

CVE-2022-2588

    filter implementation which may result in local privilege
    escalation for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any
    user or network namespace.

CVE-2022-2663

    David Leadbeater reported flaws in the nf_conntrack_irc
    connection-tracking protocol module.  When this module is enabled
    on a firewall, an external user on the same IRC network as an
    internal user could exploit its lax parsing to open arbitrary TCP
    ports in the firewall, to reveal their public IP address, or to
    block their IRC connection at the firewall.

CVE-2022-3028

    Abhishek Shah reported a race condition in the AF_KEY subsystem,
    which could lead to an out-of-bounds write or read.  A local user
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption), to obtain sensitive information, or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-26365, CVE-2022-33740, CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742

    Roger Pau Monne discovered that Xen block and network PV device
    frontends don't zero out memory regions before sharing them with
    the backend, which may result in information disclosure.
    Additionally it was discovered that the granularity of the grant
    table doesn't permit sharing less than a 4k page, which may also
    result in information disclosure.

CVE-2022-26373

    It was discovered that on certain processors with Intel's Enhanced
    Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (eIBRS) capabilities there
    are exceptions to the documented properties in some situations,
    which may result in information disclosure.

    Intel's explanation of the issue can be found at
    <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/post-barrier-return-stack-buffer-predictions.html>

CVE-2022-33744

    Oleksandr Tyshchenko discovered that ARM Xen guests can cause a
    denial of service to the Dom0 via paravirtual devices.

CVE-2022-36879

    A flaw was discovered in xfrm_expand_policies in the xfrm
    subsystem which can cause a reference count to be dropped twice.

CVE-2022-36946

    Domingo Dirutigliano and Nicola Guerrera reported a memory
    corruption flaw in the Netfilter subsystem which may result in
    denial of service.

CVE-2022-39188

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the kernel's handling of
    unmapping of certain memory ranges.  When a driver created a
    memory mapping with the VM_PFNMAP flag, which many GPU drivers do,
    the memory mapping could be removed and freed before it was
    flushed from the CPU TLBs.  This could result in a page use-after-
    free.  A local user with access to such a device could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-39842

    An integer overflow was discovered in the pxa3xx-gcu video driver
    which could lead to a heap out-of-bounds write.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-40307

    A race condition was discovered in the EFI capsule-loader driver,
    which could lead to use-after-free.  A local user permitted to
    access this device (/dev/efi_capsule_loader) could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.  However, this device is normally only
    accessible by the root user.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.260-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Subject: CVE-2022-2663: Linux netfilter: nf_conntrack_irc message handling

Description:

I've found an issue in nf_conntrack_irc where the message handling can
be confused and it incorrectly matches on the message.

Impact:

A firewall may be able to be bypassed when users are using unencrypted
IRC with nf_conntrack_irc configured.

Mitigations:

Linux: Disable nf_conntrack_irc (remove any --helper irc rules, and/or
unload the kernel module)
MikroTik: Remove IRC from the service ports list (/ip
firewall/service-port/disable irc)

Fix is posted here:
[https://lore.kernel.org/netfilter-devel/20220826045658.100360-1-dgl@dgl.cx/T/](https://lore.kernel.org/netfilter-devel/20220826045658.100360-1-dgl%40dgl.cx/T/)
It will be making its way into upstream Linux soon.

I'll update in a couple of days with complete details.

David

CTCP messages should only be at the start of an IRC message, not
anywhere within it.

Ensure the match happens in the right direction, previously the
destination used was the server, not the NAT host, as the comment
shows the code intended.

Additionally nf_nat_irc uses port 0 as a signal and there's no valid way
it can appear in a DCC message, so consider port 0 also forged.

                 CVE-2022-42722

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2021-4037

    Christian Brauner reported that the inode_init_owner function for
    the XFS filesystem in the Linux kernel allows local users to create
    files with an unintended group ownership allowing attackers to
    escalate privileges by making a plain file executable and SGID.

CVE-2022-0171

    Mingwei Zhang reported that a cache incoherence issue in the SEV API
    in the KVM subsystem may result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-1184

    A flaw was discovered in the ext4 filesystem driver which can lead
    to a use-after-free. A local user permitted to mount arbitrary
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash
    or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-2602

    A race between handling an io_uring request and the Unix socket
    garbage collector was discovered. An attacker can take advantage of
    this flaw for local privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-2663

    David Leadbeater reported flaws in the nf_conntrack_irc
    connection-tracking protocol module.  When this module is enabled
    on a firewall, an external user on the same IRC network as an
    internal user could exploit its lax parsing to open arbitrary TCP
    ports in the firewall, to reveal their public IP address, or to
    block their IRC connection at the firewall.

CVE-2022-3061

    A flaw was discovered in the i740 driver which may result in denial
    of service.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-3176

    A use-after-free flaw was discovered in the io_uring subsystem which
    may result in local privilege escalation to root.

CVE-2022-3303

    A race condition in the snd_pcm_oss_sync function in the sound
    subsystem in the Linux kernel due to improper locking may result in
    denial of service.

CVE-2022-20421

    A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in the
    binder_inc_ref_for_node function in the Android binder driver. On
    systems where the binder driver is loaded, a local user could
    exploit this for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-39188

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the kernel's handling of
    unmapping of certain memory ranges.  When a driver created a
    memory mapping with the VM_PFNMAP flag, which many GPU drivers do,
    the memory mapping could be removed and freed before it was
    flushed from the CPU TLBs.  This could result in a page use-after-
    free.  A local user with access to such a device could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-39842

    An integer overflow was discovered in the pxa3xx-gcu video driver
    which could lead to a heap out-of-bounds write.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-40307

    A race condition was discovered in the EFI capsule-loader driver,
    which could lead to use-after-free.  A local user permitted to
    access this device (/dev/efi_capsule_loader) could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.  However, this device is normally only
    accessible by the root user.

CVE-2022-41674, CVE-2022-42719, CVE-2022-42720, CVE-2022-42721, CVE-2022-42722

    Soenke Huster discovered several vulnerabilities in the mac80211
    subsystem triggered by WLAN frames which may result in denial of
    service or the execution or arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.10.149-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
