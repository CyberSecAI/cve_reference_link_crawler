- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Path traversal vulnerability in the `manageoverlayimage.cgi` VAPIX API.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal, leading to file/folder deletion.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can delete files and folders on the device. The impact is lower with operator accounts (limited to non-system files) than with administrator accounts.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through the `manageoverlayimage.cgi` VAPIX API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires authentication with an operator- or administrator-privileged service account.
