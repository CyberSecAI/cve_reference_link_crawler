- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'tab' parameter in the Gravity Forms Toolbar plugin for WordPress.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. If a user clicks a crafted link, the injected script will execute. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript within the `tab` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on a specially crafted link. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
