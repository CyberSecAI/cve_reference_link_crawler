Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of widget URL parameters within the "Elementor Addons by Livemesh" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied URL inputs when rendering content from the service and team member widgets. This allows malicious JavaScript code to be injected into the affected page and be executed in the browsers of users visiting the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts (JavaScript) into pages. When users access these pages, the injected scripts will execute within their browsers.
*   **Compromised User Accounts:** This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, defacement, or other client-side attacks which could lead to account compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Plugin's Widget URL Parameters:** The vulnerability is triggered through the plugin's widget URL parameters which are not properly sanitized when the widget is rendered on the page.
*   **Stored XSS:** The injected malicious script is stored in the database and executed when the page is loaded by a user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "contributor" access or higher to modify page content and insert malicious parameters.
*   **Access to page creation or editing:** The attacker must have the ability to create or edit pages where the vulnerable plugin's widgets are placed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the "Elementor Addons by Livemesh" plugin up to and including version 8.3.1.
*   The vulnerable code is located in the templates `templates/addons/team-members/style1.php` and `templates/addons/services/content.php`.
*   The fix involves escaping the URL parameter values using `esc_url()` before using them in the `href` attributes of the rendered output.
*   The patched version is 8.3.2.
