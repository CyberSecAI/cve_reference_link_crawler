[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2023%3A4283)

## Topic

An update for openstack-neutron is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 16.2 (Train).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a virtual network service for OpenStack. Just as OpenStack Compute (nova) provides an API to dynamically request and
configure virtual servers, OpenStack Networking provides an API to dynamically request and configure virtual networks. These networks connect 'interfaces' from other OpenStack services (e.g. virtual NICs from Compute VMs). The OpenStack Networking API supports extensions to provide advanced network capabilities (e.g. QoS, ACLs, network monitoring, etc.)

Security Fix(es):

* openstack-neutron: unrestricted creation of security groups (fix for CVE-2022-3277) (CVE-2023-3637)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
