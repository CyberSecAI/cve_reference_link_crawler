- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP Armour Extended plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, performs unintended actions on the WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into interacting with the malicious request. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this by social engineering a logged-in user.
