Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a stack buffer overflow in the `fromsetsystime` function within the `/bin/tdhttpd` binary of the Tenda AX1803 router's firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `strcpy` function is used to copy the `ntpserver` parameter from a POST request into a fixed-size buffer (`v32`) on the stack, without any bounds checking. This allows an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory on the stack if the input exceeds the buffer's capacity.
- **Uncontrolled Input:** The `ntpserver` parameter is directly taken from a POST request, making it vulnerable to manipulation by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By overflowing the stack buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address of the `fromsetsystime` function. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code. In the context of this router, the crash typically leads to a router restart, effectively causing a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetSysTimeCfg` endpoint.
- **`ntpserver` Parameter:** The attacker must provide a malicious value to the `ntpserver` parameter in the POST request that is large enough to overflow the stack buffer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the router's web interface. This can either be local or remote depending on the network configuration.
- **Knowledge of Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/goform/SetSysTimeCfg`) and the vulnerable parameter (`ntpserver`).
- **No Authentication Mentioned:** The provided information implies no authentication is needed to exploit this issue. However, the provided POC has a `Cookie: password=...`, so this may require more investigation.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code is located within the `fromsetsystime` function of the `/bin/tdhttpd` binary.
- The `strcpy(&V32[16], B4)` statement is the location of the buffer overflow. `V32` is a stack variable, and `B4` is a pointer to the attacker-controlled `ntpserver` parameter.
- The provided pseudo code includes another vulnerable function `fromSetIpMacBind` that contains a separate stack buffer overflow via the `list` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided POC shows that sending an `ntpServer` parameter with a value of 'a' repeated more than `0x134` times triggers the crash.
- The provided content includes a detailed analysis of the vulnerable code section in assembly/pseudo-C form.
- The affected firmware version is Tenda AX1803 v1.0.0.1_2890.
