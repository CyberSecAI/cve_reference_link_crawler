  "CVE-2024-28866": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A reflected XSS vulnerability exists in GoCD versions 19.4.0 to 23.5.0 when the server is restarting. An attacker can inject malicious code via a `redirect_to` query parameter on the loading page.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "Inadequate validation of the `redirect_to` query parameter on the loading page displayed while GoCD is starting.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "Theoretically, an attacker could steal session tokens or other values from the user's browser. However, practical exploitation is limited because session tokens are invalidated on server restart.",
      "attack_vectors": "Abuse of a `redirect_to` query parameter in a crafted URL.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to craft a specific link and trigger a user to open it while the GoCD server is restarting.",
      "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is considered low severity due to the practical limitations of exploitation, including the need for a separate denial-of-service vulnerability to chain with and the session invalidation on server restart."
