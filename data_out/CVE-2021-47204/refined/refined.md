The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47204.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the `dpaa2_eth_remove` function of the Freescale DPAA2 Ethernet driver. The debug log message, `dev_dbg`, was being called after `free_netdev()`, which frees the network device structure, leading to a use-after-free condition when accessing the freed netdev structure for logging.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability. The `net_dev` is accessed after it has been freed by `free_netdev()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit of this vulnerability could lead to a crash or other unexpected behavior due to accessing freed memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a network interface using the `dpaa2_eth` driver is removed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to have the ability to trigger the removal of a network interface using the affected driver. This could be achieved through system configuration changes or other means that cause network interfaces to be removed.
