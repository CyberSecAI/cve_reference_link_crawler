Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35951:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an unbounded format string being passed to `fscanf` when parsing comments in the `readOFF` function of the libigl library. Specifically, during the reading of vertices, the code uses `fscanf(off_file,"%[#]",&tic_tac_toe)` to identify comment lines. The `%[#]` format string reads any number of '#' characters into the `tic_tac_toe` buffer, leading to a stack buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `tic_tac_toe` variable is a single-byte character on the stack. The unbounded format string `%[#]` combined with `fscanf` overflows this buffer when encountering multiple '#' symbols in the input file, or even when a single '#' character is present, due to the null terminator that is added to the buffer by `fscanf`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By overflowing the stack, an attacker can overwrite return addresses, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The provided ASAN crash report confirms the stack buffer overflow which could lead to remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Specially crafted .off file:** The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a malicious `.off` file containing a sequence of `#` characters in the vertices section.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted `.off` file to a program using the vulnerable `libigl` library.
- User interaction is required to open the malicious file through the vulnerable application.
- No specific network position is required, as this is a local file parsing vulnerability.
