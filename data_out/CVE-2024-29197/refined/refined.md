Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-29197:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a change in how Pimcore handles document previews. In previous versions, session information was required to access previews, meaning only logged-in users could view them. However, this mechanism was removed, allowing anyone to access previews by simply adding the `?pimcore_preview=true` query parameter to a URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Preview Access:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of access control on document previews. The system no longer enforces user authentication for preview access.
- **Information Disclosure:**  Unpublished documents, including potentially sensitive internal content like intranet pages, become accessible to unauthorized users through the preview feature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can gain access to unpublished or restricted content, potentially exposing sensitive information such as intranet documents, internal communications, or unreleased product details.
- **Potential for Severe Impact:** The vulnerability is particularly impactful for intranet sites or other restricted areas that utilize the preview feature. The exposure of internal documents could have serious consequences.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The attack is conducted over the network by crafting URLs with the `?pimcore_preview=true` parameter.
- **Direct URL Manipulation:** Attackers directly manipulate URLs, adding the preview parameter to gain access to restricted content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:**  The attacker does not need any prior authentication or user account.
- **Knowledge of URL Structure:** The attacker needs to know or discover URLs with the `?pimcore_preview=true` parameter. This could be done through guessing, leaked links, or other discovery techniques.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker must have network access to the affected Pimcore instance.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by rliebi and coordinated by pryserv.
*   The issue was patched in versions 11.2.2 and 11.1.6.1 of Pimcore.
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 6.5, indicating a moderate severity.
*   The attack complexity is low, and no privileges are required, but user interaction is required to access the vulnerable link, and the scope is unchanged.
*   The impact is a high level of confidentiality loss, but there's no loss of integrity or availability.
*   The fix involved ensuring that unpublished documents can only be accessed when logged in with a valid user session. This is reflected in the provided commit which now throws an AccessDeniedHttpException if a user tries to view an unpublished document preview without being logged in. The commit also includes logging to record unauthorized access attempts.
