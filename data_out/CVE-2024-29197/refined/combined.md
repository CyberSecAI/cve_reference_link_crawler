# Pimcore Preview Documents are not restricted to logged in users anymore

Moderate

[wisconaut](/wisconaut)
published
GHSA-5737-rqv4-v445
Mar 26, 2024

## Package

composer

pimcore/pimcore
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

> 11

## Patched versions

11.2.2 11.1.6.1

## Description

### Summary

Any call with the query argument `?pimcore_preview=true` allows to view unpublished sites. Event if in incognito window. Due to the behaviour of how previews should work, this also applies to internal documents, say an intranet which could be really severe.

### Details

In previous versions of Pimcore, session information would propagate to previews, so only a logged in user could open a preview. This no longer applies. Previews are broad open to any user and with just the hint of a restricted link one could gain access to possible confident / unreleased information.

### PoC

* go to demo.pimcore.com
* unpublish a document
* open preview link in incognito tab
* see how the page loads normally

### Impact

Any intranet or other restricted sites which are able to show a preview are affected. This could possibly be huge.

### Severity

Moderate

6.5

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-29197
