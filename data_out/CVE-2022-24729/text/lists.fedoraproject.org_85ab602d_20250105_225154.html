Added [Autocomplete](<https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/autocomplete>) [`followingSp
ace`](<https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_autocomple>
te\_configDefinition.html#property-followingSpace) option that finishes an
accepted match with a space. ## CKEditor 4.19.1 Fixed Issues: \*
[#5125](<https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5125>): Fixed: Deleting a
widget with disabled [autoParagraph](<https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/>
api/CKEDITOR\_config.html#cfg-autoParagraph) by the keyboard `backspace` key
removes the editor editable area and crashes the editor. \*
[#5135](<https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5135>): Fixed: The [`checkbo
x.setValue`](<https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_ui_dialog_c>
heckbox.html#method-setValue) and [`radio.setValue`](<https://ckeditor.com/docs/c>
keditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR\_ui\_dialog\_radio.html#method-setValue) methods are
not chainable as stated in the documentation. Thanks to [Jordan
Bradford]([https://github.com/LordPachelbel)!](https://github.com/LordPachelbel%29%21) \*
[#5085](<https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5085>): Fixed: The
[Language](<https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/language>) plugin removes the element
marking the text in foreign language if said element does not have an
information about the text direction. \*
[#4284](<https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4284>): Fixed:
[Tableselection](<https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/tableselection>) Merging cells

Fixed: [`CKEDITOR.tools#convertToPx()`](<https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/late>
st/api/CKEDITOR\_tools.html#method-convertToPx) gives invalid results if the
helper calculator element was deleted from the DOM. \*
[#5234](<https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5234>): Fixed: [Easy

date#functions`](<https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dialog_>

optional error message, like e.g. [`dialog.validate.number`](<https://ckeditor.co>
m/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR\_dialog\_validate.html#method-number) due to
unnecessary return type coercion. \*
[#4473](<https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4473>): Fixed: The [dialog.v
alidate](<https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dialog_validate>
.html) method does not accept parameter value. The issue originated in [dialog.v
alidate.functions](<https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dialo>
g\_validate.html#method-functions) method that did not properly propagate
parameter value to validator. Affected validators: \* [`functions`](https
://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR\_dialog\_validate.html#method-
functions) \* [`equals`](<https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/C>
KEDITOR\_dialog\_validate.html#method-equals) \* [`notEqual`](<https://ckedi>
tor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR\_dialog\_validate.html#method-notEqual)

\_validate.html#method-inlineStyle) \*
[#5147](<https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5147>): Fixed: The
[Accessibility Help](<https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/a11yhelp>) dialog does not
contain info about focus being moved back to the editing area upon leaving
dialogs. \* [#5144](<https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5144>): Fixed:
[Menu buttons](<https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/menubutton>) and [panel
buttons](<https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/panelbutton>) incorrectly indicate the
open status of their associated pop-up menus in the browser's accessibility
tree. \* [#5022](<https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5022>): Fixed: [Find
and Replace](<https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/find>) does not respond to the
`Enter` key. API changes: \*
[#5184](<https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5184>): Added the [`config.e
ditorplaceholder\_delay`](<https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR>
\_config.html#cfg-editorplaceholder\_delay) configuration option allowing to delay

[#5184](<https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5184>): Added the [`CKEDITOR
.tools#debounce()`](<https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_tool>

invoked. ## CKEditor 4.19.0 New features: \*

buttons are now exposed as toggle buttons in the browser's accessibility tree. \*

tor4/latest/features/delayed\_creation.html) feature as a function handle for
editor creators ([`CKEDITOR.replace`](<https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest>
/api/CKEDITOR.html#method-replace), [`CKEDITOR.inline`](<https://ckeditor.com/doc>
s/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.html#method-inline), [`CKEDITOR.appendTo`](https
://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.html#method-appendTo)). \*

[#2445](<https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/2445>): Added [`config.appli
cationTitle`](<https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.htm>
l#cfg-applicationTitle) configuration option allowing to customize or disable
the editor's application region label. This option, combined with [`config.title
`](<https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg->
title), gives much better control over the editor's labels read by screen
readers. Fixed Issues: \*
[#4543](<https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4543>): Fixed: Toolbar
buttons toggle state is not correctly announced by screen readers lacking the
information whether the feature is on or off. \*
[#4052](<https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4052>): Fixed: Editor labels
are read incorrectly by screen readers due to invalid editor control type for
the [Iframe Editing Area](<https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/wysiwygarea>) editors.
\* [#1904](<https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/1904>): Fixed: Screen

ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR\_fileTools\_uploadWidgetDefinition.html#property-
supportedTypes) by the [Upload
Widget](<https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/uploadwidget>) plugin. \*
[#4855](<https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4855>): [iOS] Fixed:
Focusing toolbar buttons with an enabled VoiceOver screen reader moves the
browser focus into an editable area and interrupts button functionality. API
changes: \* [#4641](<https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4641>): The [`CK
EDITOR.replace`](<https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.html#me>
thod-replace), [`CKEDITOR.inline`](<https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/ap>
i/CKEDITOR.html#method-inline), [`CKEDITOR.appendTo`](<https://ckeditor.com/docs/>
ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.html#method-appendTo) functions are now returning
a handle function allowing to cancel the [Delayed Editor Creation](<https://ckedi>
tor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/features/delayed\_creation.html) feature. \*
[#5095](<https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5095>): Added the [CKEDITOR.
plugins.clipboard.addFileMatcher](<https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api>
/CKEDITOR\_plugins\_clipboard.html#method-addFileMatcher) function allowing to
define file formats supported by the
[clipboard](<https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/clipboard>) plugin. Trying to paste
unsupported files will result in a notification that a file cannot be dropped or
pasted into the editor. \*
[#2445](<https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/2445>): Added [`config.appli
cationTitle`](<https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.htm>
l#cfg-applicationTitle) alongside [`CKEDITOR.editor#applicationTitle`](https://c
keditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR\_editor.html#property-
applicationTitle) to allow customizing editor's application region label. ##
CKEditor 4.18.0 \*\*Security Updates:\*\* \* Fixed an XSS vulnerability in the core
module reported by GitHub Security Lab team member [Kevin
Backhouse](<https://github.com/kevinbackhouse>). Issue summary: The
vulnerability allowed to inject malformed HTML bypassing content sanitization,
which could result in executing a JavaScript code. See [CVE-2022-

6w89) for more details. \* Fixed a Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
vulnerability in dialog plugin discovered by the CKEditor 4 team during our
regular security audit. Issue summary: The vulnerability allowed to

24729](<https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/security/advisories/GHSA-f6rf-9m92->

from CKEditor 4 presets. We strongly encourage everyone to choose one of the
other available spellchecking solutions - [Spell Check As You Type

\_dom\_document.html#method-appendStyleSheet) and [`CKEDITOR.tools.buildStyleHtml(
)`](<https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_tools.html#method->

Due to a regression in CKEeditor 4.17.0 version that was only revealed after the
release and affected a limited area of operation, CSS assets loaded via relative
links started to point into invalid location when loaded from external
resources. We have therefore decided to immediately release CKEditor 4.17.1
that fixed this problem. If you have already upgraded to v4.17.0, make sure to
upgrade to v4.17.1 to avoid this regression. Fixed issues: \*
[#4979](<https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/3757>): Fixed: Added cache
