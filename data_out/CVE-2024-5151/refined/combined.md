## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# SULly < 4.3.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Navigate to Dashboard >> SULly, and set the payload below as the Item:
`<img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie) />`
3. Click on "add"
4. You will observe that the payload was stored in the database, the JavaScript payload was executed successfully

### Affects Plugins
