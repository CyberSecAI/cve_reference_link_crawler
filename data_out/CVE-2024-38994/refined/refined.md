- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `extend` and `setValue` functions in the `@amoy/common` library do not properly sanitize or validate input, allowing an attacker to inject a `__proto__` property into the object being modified. This allows the attacker to modify the prototype of all objects inheriting from the affected prototype, leading to prototype pollution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Prototype pollution due to insecure handling of the `__proto__` property within the `extend` and `setValue` functions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation can lead to:
    - Denial of service (DoS)
    - Remote code execution (RCE)
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS), depending on the gadgets affected by the prototype modification.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can call the vulnerable `extend` or `setValue` functions with crafted arguments containing the `__proto__` property.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to call the vulnerable `extend` or `setValue` functions within the application with controlled input.
