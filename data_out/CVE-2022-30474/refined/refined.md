- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap overflow vulnerability exists in the `saveParentControlInfo` function due to the usage of `strcpy` without any length check when copying the user-provided `deviceId` parameter into a heap-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap overflow, specifically a buffer overflow due to the lack of length validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) or achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by sending a crafted `deviceId` parameter that overflows the buffer.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a GET request to the `/goform/saveParentControlInfo` page with a specially crafted `deviceId` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Tenda router and specify an overly long `deviceId` parameter.
