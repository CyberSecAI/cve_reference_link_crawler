- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands against the back-end database, potentially leading to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - For ArcGIS Insights Desktop (Windows and Mac): A local, authorized attacker.
    - For ArcGIS Enterprise: A remote, authorized attacker
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - For ArcGIS Insights Desktop: The attacker needs to be local and have some level of authorization.
    - For ArcGIS Enterprise: The attacker needs to be remote and have some level of authorization.
- **Additional Details**: The exploit requires a complex effort to craft the input necessary to trigger the SQL injection, making it a high-complexity attack.
