The provided content relates to CVE-2022-20651.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the storage of unencrypted credentials in certain logs of Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Storage of sensitive data (credentials) in clear text in logs.
- Lack of encryption for sensitive information in logs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with local access to a system where Cisco ASDM is deployed in a shared workstation environment could access the logs, view unencrypted credentials of other users of the shared device. This can lead to unauthorized access and privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to the system.
- Accessing the log files where credentials are stored.
- Shared workstation environment is a requirement for successful exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated local user on a system where Cisco ASDM is deployed in a shared workstation environment.
- Ability to access the log files generated by ASDM.
