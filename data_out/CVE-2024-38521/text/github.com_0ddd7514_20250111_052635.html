# [Dev Beta] Persistent XSS in Inbox

## Description

### Summary

There is a persistent XSS in the Inbox.

### Details

There is a stored XSS in the Inbox. The input is displayed using the `safe` Jinja2 attribute, and thus not sanitized upon display. If GPG encryption is enabled, it is trivial to bypass server side encryption by setting `client_side_encrypted=true` and send the payload in plaintext in the POST request and have the XSS execute in the recipient's inbox anyway.

[hushline/hushline/templates/inbox.html](https://github.com/scidsg/hushline/blob/f17285064e51c5f498ddf87f19d7dcf18361f607/hushline/templates/inbox.html#L8)

|  | if not client\_side\_encrypted and user.pgp\_key: |
| --- | --- |

### PoC

Send to the target user:

```
"><img src=https://lsd.cat/icon.png>

```

To see that image inclusion works. Se `client_side_encrypted=true` and send the payload plaintext to demo the attack against someone a user who has GPG encryption enabled.

### Impact

This attack allows to inject HTML. Chained with a CSP bypass, reported in a separate issue, it allows for full account takeover and inbox exfiltration. Via JavaScript, it would be possible to dump the entire Inbox page. Furthermore, an attacker might change or remove the GPG key and disable 2FA since no additional authentication is required for those actions.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
