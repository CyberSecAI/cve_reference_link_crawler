The provided content is related to CVE-2024-38521.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the Inbox feature. The `message.content` is displayed using the `safe` Jinja2 attribute, which bypasses sanitization on display.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Inbox feature.
- Inadequate sanitization of user input when rendering the inbox messages, specifically by using the `safe` attribute in the Jinja2 template.
- Server-side encryption bypass: By setting `client_side_encrypted=true`, attackers can send plaintext payloads that execute as XSS, even if GPG encryption is enabled on the server side.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Injection of arbitrary HTML into the inbox.
- Full account takeover and inbox exfiltration when combined with a separate CSP bypass.
- Ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially allowing for the dumping of the entire inbox page.
- Ability for an attacker to change or remove GPG keys and disable 2FA without further authentication.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Sending a malicious message to a target user via the inbox feature.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the target user's inbox.
- No privileges are required, and user interaction is needed for the attack to trigger (i.e., the victim must view the message).
