Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35900:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from a flaw in the netfilter nf_tables subsystem. Specifically, when the dormant flag of an nf_tables table is toggled, the system disables hooks by iterating over current chains within that table. The issue occurs because the system doesn't prevent the addition of new base chains after the table's flags have been updated to dormant. This allows for an inconsistent state where a new chain is added while the table is being disabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Race Condition:** A race condition exists where a new base chain can be added to a table after the table flags have been updated to `dormant` but before the hooks are fully disabled.
- **Inconsistent State:** The described scenario leads to an inconsistent state because the new chain's hook is not unregistered during table disabling, resulting in an attempt to unregister an already unregistered hook. This manifests as a warning message and could lead to other unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  While the provided text does not explicitly mention a denial of service,  the warning message could indicate a broader instability that might crash the system and cause denial of service, although more information would be needed to assess full impact
- **Unexpected Behavior/Instability:** The inconsistent state and warning messages indicate a potential for instability and unpredictable behavior within the netfilter subsystem.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Netfilter Configuration:** The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating netfilter (nftables) configuration via the command line interface or other interfaces that modify nftables configurations. The attack vector involves adding a table, adding a chain, then updating the table flags to dormant, and then adding a new chain to the dormant table.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Privileged Access:** The attacker needs to have the capability to configure netfilter rules, suggesting the attacker would need root or equivalent privileges on the system.

**More detail than CVE description:**

The provided content provides much more technical detail than a typical CVE description including:
  - specific steps to trigger the issue
  - a code snippet illustrating the fix
  - the kernel warning generated by the inconsistent state
  - a reference to the specific commit that introduced the fix.

The fix provided in the patches is to reject adding a new basechain when the table's flag has been updated to NFT_TABLE_F_UPDATE.

The CVE description is still a placeholder, so comparing to it is impossible at the moment, but the provided content is more technical and detailed.
