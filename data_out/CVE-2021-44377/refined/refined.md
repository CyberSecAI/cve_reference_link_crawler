The provided content is related to CVE-2021-44377.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `SetImage`'s JSON `param` parser in `cgiserver.cgi` assumes that the `param` JSON element is always an object, but this isn't validated. When a non-object (e.g. a string) is provided, it causes an assertion failure leading to a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation in the JSON command parser, specifically within the `SetImage` API parameter handling. The code doesn't verify the type of the JSON element received as `param`, leading to type errors when parsing.

**Impact of exploitation:** The primary impact is a denial of service (DoS). A successful exploit results in the `cgiserver.cgi` process crashing, ultimately rebooting the device. This can cause temporary unavailability of the camera and its functionalities.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the camera's `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint. The request body contains a JSON array with a command to "SetImage" with the param value as a non-object.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable camera.
- While the report mentions that exploiting most of the vulnerabilities requires a logged-in user, they also state that CVE-2021-44377 can be exploited without authentication, in combination with TALOS-2021-1420.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the camera, but some vulnerabilities require an authenticated session.
- The attacker must know the device's IP address.
