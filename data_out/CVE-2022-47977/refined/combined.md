SSA-836777: JT File Parsing Vulnerabilities in JT Open, JT Utilities
and Parasolid

SUMMARY

JT Open Toolkit, JT Utilities and Parasolid are affected by memory corruption vulnerabilities that could be
triggered while parsing JT ﬁles. If a user is tricked to open a malicious JT ﬁle with any of the affected
products, this could cause the application to crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Do not open untrusted ﬁles using Parasolid, JT Open Toolkit or JT Utilities

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

JT Open Toolkit is an application programming interface (API) for developers of JT-enabled software. The
JT Open Toolkit is a read/write toolkit that enables consistent access to JT ﬁle content.

JT is an openly published data format developed by Siemens Digital Industries Software, widely used for
communication, visualization, digital mockup and a variety of other purposes. JT has been accepted by
ISO as International Standard 14306:2017. The JT Utilities provide a series of command line utilities that
can be used to support application development and JT reuse.

Parasolid is a 3D geometric modeling tool that supports various techniques, including solid modeling,
direct editing, and free-form surface/sheet modeling.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-47936

The affected application contains a stack overﬂow vulnerability while parsing specially crafted JT ﬁles.
This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.
