- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A memory corruption vulnerability exists while parsing specially crafted JT files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119). This indicates that the software does not properly validate or restrict memory access operations, potentially leading to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. This could lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by parsing specially crafted JT files. An attacker would need to trick a user into opening a malicious JT file with an affected product.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the victim with the malicious JT file. The user interaction is required to open the file which implies a local attack vector with user interaction.
