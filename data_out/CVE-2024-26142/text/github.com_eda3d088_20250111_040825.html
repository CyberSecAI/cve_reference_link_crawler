This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-26142.
 Versions Affected: >= 7.1.0, < 7.1.3.1 Not affected: < 7.1.0 Fixed Versions: 7.1.3.1
 # Impact
 Carefully crafted Accept headers can cause Accept header parsing in Action Dispatch to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.
 Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected.
