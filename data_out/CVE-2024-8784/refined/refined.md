Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8784 (Based on the submission on vuldb.com, though the CVE itself is a placeholder)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection present in the chat system of QDocs Smart School Management System version 7.0.0.
- The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `users[]` parameter within the `/user/chat/mynewuser` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input, specifically the `users[]` parameter, before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The injection is "blind" because the application doesn't directly return the results of the injected query. Instead, the attacker uses time delays (via `SLEEP()`) to confirm the injection and potentially infer information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Execute Arbitrary SQL Commands:** An attacker can inject SQL commands to perform unauthorized actions within the database.
- **Infer Sensitive Information:** The attacker can extract sensitive data from the database by using carefully crafted SQL queries in conjunction with time-based techniques.
- **Compromise Data Integrity:** Exploitation can lead to modification or deletion of data, compromising the overall data integrity of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted POST request to the `/user/chat/mynewuser` endpoint.
- **`users[]` Parameter:** The malicious SQL injection payload is inserted into the `users[]` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the system (in this case, the provided PoC indicates a user with "student privileges").
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application in order to send the crafted HTTP request.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jobyer Ahmed.
- The proof of concept (PoC) provided in the VulDB submission shows how to inject SQL using the SLEEP() function to create time-based delays and confirm the injection.
- The vulnerable parameter is `users[]`.
- The vulnerable endpoint is `/user/chat/mynewuser`.
- The vulnerable software is QDocs Smart School Management System version 7.0.0.
- The SQL injection is time-based and blind.
- The exploit uses the `SLEEP()` function to infer successful injection, which allows attackers to extract information or cause other impacts.
