  "CVE-2023-39514": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Date": "2023-09-05",
      "CVSS": "6.1",
      "CWE": "CWE-79"
    },
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `graphs.php` script, where the `$name` variable, containing device and data-source information, is rendered into the HTML without proper escaping, allowing for arbitrary JavaScript execution.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the Cacti database via data source or device names, which is then executed in the browsers of users with 'General Administration>Graphs' privileges when viewing affected graphs. This can lead to account takeover, arbitrary actions on the platform, redirection to malicious sites, phishing, browser-based exploits, and botnet participation.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Configuration of a data-source template with malicious code appended in the data-source name via `data_templates.php`.",
      "Configuration of a device with a malicious payload injected in the device name via `host.php`."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Template Editor>Data Templates permissions to manipulate data source names.",
       "General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data permissions to alter device names."
    ],
    "Required attacker position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the permissions mentioned above.",
    "Affected Component": "graphs.php"
  }
