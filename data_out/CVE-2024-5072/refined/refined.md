- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the PAM JIT (Privileged Access Management Just-in-Time) elevation feature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** LDAP injection vulnerability due to the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing manipulation of LDAP filter queries.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated user with access to the PAM JIT elevation feature can manipulate the LDAP query. The CVSS score indicates low confidentiality impact and high integrity impact, meaning attackers could potentially modify data through the LDAP injection.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack through a specially crafted request to the PAM JIT elevation feature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with access to the PAM JIT elevation feature.
