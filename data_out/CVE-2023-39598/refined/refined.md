- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IceWarp WebClient version 10.2.1 fails to sanitize user input provided through the "mid" parameter in the URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application reflects the unsanitized user-supplied input back to the user's browser.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker can redirect the application user to a malicious website.
    - An attacker can steal credentials on the login page using keylogging via XSS payloads.
    - An attacker can steal application cookies if the victim is authenticated.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the "mid" parameter, an attacker can cause the victim's browser to execute arbitrary JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload and trick a user into clicking it. This can be distributed via email, chat or other web pages.
