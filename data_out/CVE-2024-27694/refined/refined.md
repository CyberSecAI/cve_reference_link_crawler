The content is related to CVE-2024-27694.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of CSRF protection in the `/system/share/ztree_category_edit` component of FlyCms v1.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user, such as modifying category names. In the provided example, the attacker changes the category name to "移动开发1".

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted HTML page containing a form that makes a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into accessing the malicious HTML page, which will then execute the form submission.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious HTML page and trick a logged-in user of the FlyCms application into accessing it. The attacker does not need direct access to the FlyCms server or user credentials; they only need a logged-in user to trigger the crafted request.
