- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not expire the user session upon reboot without a prior logout.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient session expiration (CWE-613).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) by taking advantage of the unexpired session after a reboot. This could lead to unauthorized access to the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have obtained valid credentials and be on the network. They need to wait for the system to be rebooted without a proper logout and then attempt to access the system.
