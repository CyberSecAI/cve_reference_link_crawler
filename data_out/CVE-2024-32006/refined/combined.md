GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINEMA Remote Connect is a management platform for remote networks that enables the simple management of tunnel connections (VPN) between headquarters, service technicians, and installed machines or plants. It provides both the Remote Connect Server, which is the server application, and the Remote Connect Client, which is an OpenVPN client for optimal connection to SINEMA Remote Connect Server.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-46850

Use after free in OpenVPN version 2.6.0 to 2.6.6 may lead to undefined behavoir, leaking memory buffers or remote execution when sending network buffers to a remote peer.

| CWE | CWE-416: Use After Free |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-2004

When a protocol selection parameter option disables all protocols without adding any then the default set of protocols would remain in the allowed set due to an error in the logic for removing protocols. The below command would perform a request to curl.se with a plaintext protocol which has been explicitly disabled. curl --proto -all,-http http://curl.se The flaw is only present if the set of selected protocols disables the entire set of available protocols, in itself a command with no practical use and therefore unlikely to be encountered in real situations. The curl security team has thus assessed this to be low severity bug.

| CWE | CWE-20: Improper Input Validation |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-2379

libcurl skips the certificate verification for a QUIC connection under certain conditions, when built to use wolfSSL. If told to use an unknown/bad cipher or curve, the error path accidentally skips the verification and returns OK, thus ignoring any certificate problems.

| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |
| CWE | CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-2398

When an application tells libcurl it wants to allow HTTP/2 server push, and the amount of received headers for the push surpasses the maximum allowed limit (1000), libcurl aborts the server push. When aborting, libcurl inadvertently does not free all the previously allocated headers and instead leaks the memory. Further, this error condition fails silently and is therefore not easily detected by an application.

| CWE | CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-2466

libcurl did not check the server certificate of TLS connections done to a host specified as an IP address, when built to use mbedTLS. libcurl would wrongly avoid using the set hostname function when the specified hostname was given as an IP address, therefore completely skipping the certificate check. This affects all uses of TLS protocols (HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, POPS3, SMTPS, etc).

Vulnerability CVE-2024-32006

The affected application does not expire the user session on reboot without logout. This could allow an attacker to bypass Multi-Factor Authentication.

| CWE | CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-42344

The affected application inserts sensitive information into a log file which is readable by all legitimate users of the underlying system. This could allow an authenticated attacker to compromise the confidentiality of other users' configuration data.
