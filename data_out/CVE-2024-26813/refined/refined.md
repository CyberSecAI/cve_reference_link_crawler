{
  "cveId": "CVE-2024-26813",
  "description": "The vfio-platform SET_IRQS ioctl currently allows loopback triggering of an interrupt before a signaling eventfd has been configured by the user, which thereby allows a NULL pointer dereference.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The vfio-platform SET_IRQS ioctl allows triggering an interrupt before an eventfd is configured, leading to a null pointer dereference when the interrupt handler attempts to signal the eventfd.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL Pointer Dereference",
       "Race Condition"
    ],
    "impact": "A NULL pointer dereference, which can lead to a denial of service.",
    "attackVectors": [
        "The vulnerability can be triggered by using the vfio-platform SET_IRQS ioctl to trigger an interrupt before an eventfd has been configured.",
         "Loopback triggering of an interrupt via the SET_IRQS ioctl."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to access the vfio-platform device and use the SET_IRQS ioctl."
  },
  "patch": [
    "The fix involves registering all IRQs in a disabled state during device open, decoupling the masked status from the trigger. This ensures the interrupt handler is disabled before modifying the trigger, preventing race conditions and allowing safe loopback triggering via ioctl.",
    "request_irq() is called with NO_AUTOEN to initially disable IRQ",
      "Error from request_irq() is made local to the SET_IRQS ioctl path.",
       "The IRQ handler uses a helper function vfio_send_eventfd that first checks for a valid trigger."
  ],
  "add_info": "This fix ensures that the interrupt handler can not be invoked before the eventfd is configured, preventing the NULL pointer dereference. It also handles potential race conditions between the interrupt handler and the eventfd configuration process."
