- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists because eBGP traffic is mapped to a shared hardware rate-limiter queue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper resource management/allocation (CWE-400).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit can cause eBGP neighbor sessions to be dropped, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition in the network.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can send large amounts of network traffic with certain characteristics through an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected device. No authentication or special privileges are needed.
