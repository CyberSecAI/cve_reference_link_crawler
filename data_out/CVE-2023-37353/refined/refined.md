{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of JPG files, which can lead to a read past the end of an allocated object.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read during JPG file parsing.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Information disclosure. The attacker can potentially leverage this vulnerability, in conjunction with other vulnerabilities, to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
   "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to have the target visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted JPG file or host a malicious page that triggers the vulnerable code. The user must interact with the malicious file or page."
