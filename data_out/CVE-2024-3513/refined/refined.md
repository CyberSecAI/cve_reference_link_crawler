Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3513

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `title` tag attribute (specifically the `postTitleTag` parameter) within the Ultimate Blocks WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is Stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the `title` tag attribute of a block, which is then stored in the database. When a user accesses a page containing this compromised block, the injected script will execute in their browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users visiting pages containing the injected malicious script. This can lead to various impacts, such as:
  - **Session hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
  - **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive information from the user's browser.
  - **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the website.
  - **Administrative takeover:** If an administrator views the page, the attacker could potentially gain administrative access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `title` tag attribute, specifically the `postTitleTag` parameter of a block within the Ultimate Blocks plugin.
- An authenticated attacker, with Contributor access or higher, can inject the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least "Contributor" level access. This allows them to create and edit content using the vulnerable plugin.
- **Plugin Installation:** The Ultimate Blocks plugin must be installed and active on the target WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:**  The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable parameter (`postTitleTag`) within the Ultimate Blocks plugin that is not being properly sanitized.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Ultimate Blocks plugin up to and including 3.1.9.
- The vulnerability has been patched in version 3.2.0.
- CVE-2024-6362 appears to be a duplicate of this vulnerability.
