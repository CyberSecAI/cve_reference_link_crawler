The provided content relates to CVE-2024-2310.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The vulnerability occurs because user-controlled input is not properly sanitized before being stored and displayed in the plugin's settings. Specifically, the `wprevpro_template_misc_bgcolor1` parameter is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. When a user views the affected settings page, the malicious script will execute in their browser. This could lead to various attacks, including:
   - Session hijacking
   - Defacement of the website
   - Redirection to malicious websites
   - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  An attacker with administrative access navigates to the "WP Google Reviews> Templates" section of the plugin.
2.  They create a new template.
3.  They intercept the request when saving the settings.
4.  The attacker modifies the `wprevpro_template_misc_bgcolor1` parameter within the intercepted request, injecting malicious JavaScript code such as `#asd"onmouseover=alert(112312)//`.
5.  The modified settings are saved.
6.  When a user views the template and hovers over the BG color selector, the injected JavaScript will be executed, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have high privileges, such as administrative access, to modify the plugin settings. The unfiltered\_html capability is not required to exploit this vulnerability in some configurations.
