This commit improve the use of temporary directories:

* The temporary directory will have a random name: `/var/tmp/insights-client-<random characters>`.

* Remove unused temporary directory and the function that used it: `archive_tmp_directory`.
* Change the cleanup mechanisms to be align with this change.
* Change the tests to be align with this change.
* Refactor the constants used.

Generally LGTM (will need [@xiangce](https://github.com/xiangce) review as well); I left one note about potential conflicts between instances.

As I understand, there may be more than one `insights-client` run at the same time; in that case, because of this code there may be this situation:

* `insights-client` 1 starts: it creates its own `/var/tmp/insights-client-FOO` temporary directory
* `insights-client` 2 starts as well: `cleanup_previous_archive()` cleanups all the existing `/var/tmp/insights-client*` stuff including `/var/tmp/insights-client-FOO`
* `insights-client` 1 dies in sadness

What I'd do is removing only the bits older than 24h: this way even slow `insights-client` run will not suddenly get their own temporary directories removed under their feet, yet still cleaning old leftovers

How about adding a restriction that only one instance of "insights-client" is allowed to run at a time?

I am not sure if that is a good idea. If we added so, it will limit the following situations:

1. `insights-client` is running the scheduled collection and the administrator wants to check `insights-client` status.
2. The administrator want to run `collection` and also `malware`.

I think that a better option is to allow this kind of situation, that was the first idea (before change the things in the temporary files)

There is at least one change needed (the variable used for `getmtime()`), and it should be OK.

Another possibility to make it a bit more Pythonic (IMHO) could be to use the list comprehension approach more, like the following untested code:

```
# list our temporary directories
directories = [
    os.path.join(constants.insights_tmp_path, directory)
    for directory in os.listdir(constants.insights_tmp_path)
    if directory.startswith(constants.insights_tmp_prefix)
]
# filter only directories modified last more than 24 hours ago
directories = [
    directory
    for directory in directories
    if os.path.isdir(directory) and os.path.getmtime(directory) <= one_day_ago
]
for directory in directories:
    logger.debug("Deleting previous archive %s", directory)
    shutil.rmtree(directory, True)
```

Sorry, something went wrong.

if `directory` here is replaced by `os.path.join(constants.insights_tmp_path, directory)`, this avoids the need to do the `join()` in the loop

This security issue occurs because of insecure file operations or unsafe handling of temporary files and directories that lead to local privilege escalation. Before the insights-client has been registered on the system by root, an unprivileged local user or attacker could create the /var/tmp/insights-client directory (owning the directory with read, write, and execute permissions) on the system. After the insights-client is registered by root, an attacker could then control the directory content that insights are using by putting malicious scripts into it and executing arbitrary code as root (trivially bypassing SELinux protections because insights processes are allowed to disable SELinux system-wide). | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: |  | | | Embargoed: | Yes | | |
