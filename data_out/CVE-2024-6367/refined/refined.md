{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the sdcid, keyid1, keyid2, and keyid3 parameters before including it in the response.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they access a crafted URL. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the web page.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted URL with malicious JavaScript in the sdcid, keyid1, keyid2, or keyid3 parameters of a POST request to the /labvantage/rc?command=file&file=WEB-CORE/elements/files/filesembedded.jsp endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with JavaScript payloads and lure a victim user to access the crafted URL, or deliver it through other means (e.g. phishing)."
