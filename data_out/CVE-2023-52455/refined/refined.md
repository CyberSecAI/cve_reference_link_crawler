Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the kernel's IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) driver attempting to reserve a zero-length IOVA (Input-Output Virtual Address) region. This happens when the bootloader or firmware does not correctly set up framebuffers, resulting in an address and size of 0 in the "iommu-addresses" property.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The core issue is that the `of_iommu_get_resv_regions()` function in `drivers/iommu/of_iommu.c` does not properly validate the size of the IOVA region before attempting to reserve it.
- Reserving a 0-length region corrupts the IOVA rbtree (red-black tree) with an invalid entry where `pfn_hi < pfn_lo`, which can cause IOMMU mappings to fail.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- If a zero-length IOVA region is reserved, it can corrupt the IOVA rbtree, leading to display IOMMU mappings failures.
- This failure occurs when the display driver is used without a framebuffer and the firmware provides a zero-length IOVA region.
- The entire valid IOVA space is incorrectly reserved due to the zero-length reservation, preventing the display driver from mapping memory correctly.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malformed device tree provided by the bootloader or firmware that specifies an iommu-addresses property with a length of 0.
- This can occur when the framebuffer is not initialized by the firmware, leading to the display IOMMU mappings failing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to control the bootloader/firmware to provide a device tree with an "iommu-addresses" property that has an address and size set to 0.
- This position would typically require control of the platform's boot process or the ability to modify the firmware.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The fix involves adding a check in `of_iommu_get_resv_regions()` to skip the IOVA reservation if the length is 0 and also includes a warning message.
- The vulnerability affects systems that utilize the IOMMU and rely on firmware/bootloader to set up memory regions.
- The fix addresses the issue of corrupted IOVA rbtree and prevents IOMMU mappings from failing when the firmware provides a zero-length IOVA region.

This vulnerability is fixed by commit `bb57f6705960bebeb832142ce9abf43220c3eab1`. This commit adds a check to prevent the reservation of 0-length IOVA regions.
