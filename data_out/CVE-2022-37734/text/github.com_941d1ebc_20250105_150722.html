| Some people might start getting notified of a CVE for graphql-java which was released today.  <https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-37734>  <https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMGRAPHQLJAVA-3021519>  The Snynk document says  How to fix? Upgrade com.graphql-java:graphql-java to version 19.0 or higher.  This is incomplete. We backported the changes to older versions  The full list of fixed versions is   * v19.0 * v18.3 * v17.4   You don't have to upgrade to the latest graphql-java version to get this fix.  [#2549](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/2549) |

| We are trying to update the CVE text and we have informed Snyk, so that automated vulnerability detectors correctly register the patched versions. Note this may take a while.  In the meantime please do patch. |
