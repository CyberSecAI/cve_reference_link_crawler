[22.0](/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v22.0)

We are pleased to announce the release of graphql-java v22.0.

Thanks to everyone in the community who contributed to the release, whether that was code, helping to report issues, or participating in discussions.

This is a **breaking change** release.

The graphql-java team takes breaking changes very seriously but in the name of performance we have made some significant breaking changes in this release.

# Major Performance Changes

Past releases have been very much performance focused and this one is no different. However, this release is aiming to reduce memory pressure more than reduce pure CPU usage. When the graphql-java engine is running, if it produces less objects it will ultimately run faster because of reduced memory pressure and less garbage to collect.

The engine has been changed in two major ways that reduce memory pressure.

## ExecutionResult wrapping

The first was that all values that come back got wrapped internally into a `ExecutionResult` object where the `data` attribute was the value. This was a carry over from some very early GraphQL code but was unnecessary and hence has been removed. The follow on effect of this is that some `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` protected methods and `graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` methods used to receive and return `ExecutionResult` values and no longer do, which is an API breaking change. We have made this breaking changes in the name of memory pressure performance.

## CompletableFuture wrapping

The second major change is that the engine no longer exclusively uses `java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture`s when composing together results. Let us explain the past code first so we can discuss the new code.

`CompletableFuture` is a fantastic construct because it represents a promise to a value and it can also hold an exceptional state inside itself. Async programming with `CompletableFuture` is viral. If stage 1 of some compute process returns a `CompletableFuture` then stage 2 and 3 and 4 are likely to as well to ensure everything is asynchronous.

We use to take values that were not asynchronous (such as DataFetcher that returned a simple in memory object) and wrap them in a `CompletableFuture` so that all of the other code composed together using `CompletableFuture` methods like `.thenApply()` and `.thenCompose` and so on. The code is cleaner if you use all `CompletableFuture` code patterns.

However many objects in a GraphQL request are not asynchronous but rather materialised objects in memory. Scalars, enums and list are often just values immediately available to be used and allocating a `CompletableFuture` makes the code easier to write but it has a memory pressure cost.

So we have sacrificed cleaner code for more memory performant code.

graphql-java engine `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` methods now just return `Object` where that object might be either a `CompletableFuture` or a materialised value.

```
    private Object /*CompletableFuture<FetchedValue> | FetchedValue>*/
       fetchField(GraphQLFieldDefinition fieldDef, ExecutionContext executionContext, ExecutionStrategyParameters parameters) {
```

Notice we have lost type safety here. In the past this would have only been `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` and hence been both type safe and async composable.

Now the caller of that method has to handle the async case where it might be a `CompletableFuture<FetchedValue>` AND the materialised value case where it might be a `FetchedValue` but as most simple fields in GraphQL are in fact materialised values, this is worth the less clean code.

`DataFetchers` can of course continue to return `CompletableFuture` values and they will be handled in a polymorphic manner.

The upshot of all this work is that the graphql-java engine allocated way less `CompletableFuture` values and hence reduces the amount of memory used.

## Instrumentation Changes

The above changes now mean means that before `graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationContext` used to be given a `CompletableFuture` but now no longer does

```
    void onDispatched(CompletableFuture<T> result);
```

is now

```
    void onDispatched();
```

if you previously used the `CompletableFuture` to know when something was completed, well `InstrumentationContext` has the same semantics because it's completed method is similar in that it presents a value or an exception

```
    void onCompleted(T result, Throwable t);
```

`graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` also had a lot of deprecated methods in place and these have been removed since the more performant shape of passing in `graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationState` has been in place for quite a few releases.

Some of the methods that received `ExecutionResult` wrapped values have also changed as mentioned above.

`Instrumentation` is probably the area that needs the most attention in terms of breaking changes. If you have not moved off the deprecated methods, your custom `Instrumentation`s will no longer compile or run.

## Interning key strings

Our friends at Netflix provided a PR that interns certain key strings like "field names" so that we create less String instances when processing field names in queries that we know must be previously interned in the schema.

[#3504](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3504)

## The full list of performance related changes

# Major Changes

## [@defer](https://github.com/defer) Experimental Support

Support for the `@defer` directive has been added in an experimental fashion. While `@defer` is still not in the released GraphQL specification, we have judged it mature enough to support at this stage and the `graphql-js` reference implementation has support for it.

<https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md>

At this stage we have not yet supported `@stream` but this is likely to be included in a future release.

# Breaking Changes

There are quite a few API breaking changes in this release. In fact there are 22 PRs containing breaking API changes.

## Stricter parseValue coercion: Aligning with JS reference implementation

We have made changes to String, Boolean, Float, and Int `parseValue` coercion, to be consistent with the reference JS implementation. The key change is `parseValue` is now stricter on accepted inputs.

* String `parseValue` now requires input of type `String`. For example, a `Number` input `123` or a `Boolean` input `true` will no longer be accepted.
* Boolean `parseValue` now requires input of type `Boolean`. For example, a `String` input `"true"` will no longer be accepted.
* Float `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a `String` input `"3.14"` will no longer be accepted.
* Int `parseValue` now requires input of type `Number`. For example, a `String` input `"42"` will no longer be accepted.

This is a breaking change. To help you migrate, in [version 21.0](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v21.0), we introduced the InputInterceptor [#3188](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3188) (and an implementation LegacyCoercingInputInterceptor [#3218](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3218)) to provide a migration pathway. You can use this interceptor to monitor and modify values.

For more, see [#3553](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3553)

JS reference implementation: <https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/main/src/type/scalars.ts>

## Removing deprecated methods

Many methods that have been deprecated for a long time, sometimes even up to 6 years, have finally been removed.

The `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work mentioned above changed many methods in the `graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy` classes but we don't expect this affect many people since very few people write their own engines.

That `CompletableFuture` unwrapping work also had knock on effects as mentioned above on `graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation` and hence this is the **most likely** place for there to be compatibility challenges in existing code.

## DataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation has been removed and is now built into the engine

The code to dispatch `org.dataloader.DataLoader`s used to be an instrumentation called `DataLoadersDataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation` and it was automatically added at runtime. This approach has been removed.

The equivalent code is now built into the graphql-java engine itself. `DataLoader`s can now always be used without any special setup. This also allows the code to be more performant in how `DataLoader`s are dispatched.

## SL4J logging has been removed

Previously, the graphql-java engine would log at DEBUG level certain errors or when fields get fetched. This has not proven used for from a support point to the graphql-java team and also has a compliance cost in that user generated content (UGC) and personally identifying information (PII) could end up being logged, which may not be allowed under regimes like European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

If you want to log now we suggest you invest in a `Instrumentation` that logs key events and you can there for log what you want and in a compliant manner of your choosing.

[20.8](/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v20.8)

This is a special release to help control introspection queries.

This release adds a default check for introspection queries, to check that they are sensible. This feature is a backport of [#3526](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3526) and [#3527](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3527).

This release also adds an optional maximum result nodes limit, which is a backport of [#3525](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3525).

## What's Changed

* 20.x Backport of PR 3526 and PR 3527 by [@dondonz](https://github.com/dondonz) in [#3530](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3530)
* 20.x Backport max result nodes PR 3525 by [@dondonz](https://github.com/dondonz) in [#3536](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3536)
