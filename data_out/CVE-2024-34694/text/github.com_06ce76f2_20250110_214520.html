# Improper handling of potential network and payment failures when using Eclair backend

High

Jun 14, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<0.12.6

## Patched versions

>=0.12.6

## Description

### Summary

Paying invoices in Eclair that do not get settled within the internal timeout (about 30s) lead to a payment being considered failed, even though it may still be in flight.

### Details

Using `blocking: true` on the API call will lead to a timeout error if a payment does not get settled in the 30s timeout with the error: `Ask timed out on [Actor[akka://eclair-node/user/$l#134241942]] after [30000 ms]. Message of type [fr.acinq.eclair.payment.send.PaymentInitiator$SendPaymentToNode]. A typical reason for AskTimeoutException is that the recipient actor didn't send a reply.`

|  | data={"invoice": bolt11, "blocking": True}, |
| --- | --- |

This is considered a payment failure by parts of the code, and assumes the payment is not going to be settled after:

[c04c13b](/lnbits/lnbits/commit/c04c13b2f8cfbb625571a07dfddeb65ea6df8dac)

|  | r.raise\_for\_status() |
| --- | --- |

[lnbits/lnbits/wallets/eclair.py](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits/blob/c04c13b2f8cfbb625571a07dfddeb65ea6df8dac/lnbits/wallets/eclair.py#L146)

|  | if r.is\_error: |
| --- | --- |

The best way to fix this is to check the payment status after an error, and when not sure, always consider a payment still in flight.

### PoC

A very simple way to exploit this is:

* Create a hold invoice
* Pay the invoice with the LNbits server backed by an Eclair node, until it times out
* Settle the hold invoice

### Impact

This vulnerability can lead to a total loss of funds for the node backend.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
