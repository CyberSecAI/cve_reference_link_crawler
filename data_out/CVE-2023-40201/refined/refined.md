- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Futurio Extra WordPress plugin, in versions 1.9.0 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force authenticated users to perform unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could enable a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or access. The specific impact may vary depending on the affected actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a cross-site request forgery, where an attacker tricks a logged-in user into performing actions on the vulnerable website without their knowledge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into visiting a malicious page or clicking a malicious link that executes the CSRF attack. No authentication is needed for the attacker, only the victim needs to be authenticated.
