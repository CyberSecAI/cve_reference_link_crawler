#### Workarounds

If a product requires JRE but does not include it, please update JRE to a fixed version that aligns with the product requirements.

* Updating the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) used by SANtricity Storage Manager 11.10 or later
  <https://kb.netapp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1029741>

Beginning with OnCommand Workflow Automation for Linux & Windows 4.2, OnCommand Unified Manager for Linux & Windows 7.2, NetApp Service Level Manager 1.0, and OnCommand API Services 1.2 the Java software libraries can be upgraded as specified in the product documentation. For assistance with the upgrade, please consult technical support.

OnCommand Insight 7.3.2 and higher on Linux and 7.3.9 and higher on Windows support upgrading Java. For assistance with the upgrade and access to the updated OnCommand Insight binaries, please consult technical support.
