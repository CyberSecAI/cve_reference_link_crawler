The provided content is related to CVE-2019-17652.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A specially crafted client request via the IPC socket of the FortiClient process, specifically through the `argv` parameter, can cause a denial-of-service condition. The vulnerability is triggered by malformed `nanomsg`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of input data received through the IPC socket. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to malformed messages utilizing the `nanomsg` library, specifically when processing the `argv` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service. Attackers can crash the FortiClient process by injecting malformed messages into its IPC socket.

**Attack vectors:** Local attack via injection of malicious messages into the FortiClient's IPC socket.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the capability to send data to the local IPC socket used by the FortiClient for Linux. This implies a local user or a compromised process running on the same system.
