# Admin privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution via malicious \*.etherpad imports

Critical

[rhansen](/rhansen)
published
GHSA-w3g3-qf3g-2mqc
Dec 9, 2021

## Package

npm

ep\_etherpad-lite
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 1.8.16

## Patched versions

1.8.16

etherpad
(n/a)

< 1.8.16

1.8.16

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can craft an `*.etherpad` file that, when imported, might allow the attacker to gain admin privileges for the Etherpad instance. This, in turn, can be used to install a malicious Etherpad plugin that can execute arbitrary code on the Etherpad server (including system commands) and in the browsers of users connected to the Etherpad server.

To gain privileges, the attacker must be able to trigger deletion of [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) state or wait for old express-session state to be cleaned up. Core Etherpad does not delete any express-session state (issue [#5010](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/issues/5010)), so the only known attacks require either a plugin that can delete session state or a custom cleanup process (such as a cron job that deletes old `sessionstorage:*` records).

Even if a reverse proxy is configured to reject access to `/admin/*` pages, it is still possible to crash Etherpad or bypass authorization checks to access restricted pads.

### Patches

The problem has been fixed in [v1.8.16](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/releases/tag/1.8.16). If you cannot upgrade for some reason, you can try cherry-picking [the fix commits](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/compare/b7065eb9a0ec7c3c265f8cfeb2534efe6f036456...77bcb507b30e762e9375b0511b3763e0162aae53):

```
git cherry-pick b7065eb9a0ec..77bcb507b30e
```
### Workarounds

If you cannot upgrade to v1.8.16 or patch, any of the following will prevent exploit:

* Install the [`ep_disable_imports` plugin](https://github.com/ether/ep_disable_imports#readme) and configure it to block `*.etherpad` imports. For example, you can add the following to your `settings.json`:
  ```
    "ep_disable_imports": {
      "deny": ["etherpad"]
    },
  ```
* Configure your reverse proxy to reject requests to `/p/*/import`. This will block all imports, not just `*.etherpad` imports.
* Limit all users to read-only access.
* Prevent the reuse of `express_sid` cookie values that refer to deleted express-session state:
  + Uninstall any plugins that enable users to delete express-session state (e.g., by calling [`req.session.destroy()`](https://github.com/expressjs/session#sessiondestroycallback)). Known plugins:
    - [ep\_openid-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ep_openid-client)
    - [ep\_openid\_connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ep_openid_connect)
    - [ep\_readonly\_guest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ep_readonly_guest)
  + If any `sessionstorage:*` records are deleted, delete `SESSIONKEY.txt` and restart Etherpad. Etherpad will generate a new `SESSIONKEY.txt` file with a different key, which will invalidate the signatures in old `express_sid` cookies.

### General Mitigations

In addition to upgrading or patching, we recommend you do the following to reduce risk if another vulnerability is discovered:

* Run Etherpad behind a reverse proxy.
* Configure your reverse proxy to reject requests to `/admin/*` and `/tests/*`.
* Configure SELiniux or AppArmor to limit command execution or file access outside of the `etherpad-lite` directory.
* Run Etherpad as a non-root user.
* Run Etherpad in a minimal container (see [Docker instructions](https://etherpad.org/doc/latest/#index_docker)).

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Security fixes

This release includes fixes for [GHSA-w3g3-qf3g-2mqc](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/security/advisories/GHSA-w3g3-qf3g-2mqc) ([CVE-2021-43802](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43802)).

If you cannot upgrade to v1.8.16 for some reason, you are encouraged to try cherry-picking the fixes to the version you are running:

```
git cherry-pick b7065eb9a0ec..77bcb507b30e
```

* Maliciously crafted `.etherpad` files can no longer overwrite arbitrary non-pad database records when imported.
* Imported `.etherpad` files are now subject to numerous consistency checks before any records are written to the database. This should help avoid denial-of-service attacks via imports of malformed `.etherpad` files.

### Notable enhancements and fixes

* Fixed several `.etherpad` import bugs.
* Improved support for large `.etherpad` imports.

| **The session storage seems to be constantly growing** When running etherpad we see a constantly growing number of session storage values in the database.  Is there a way to clean them up? We already looked into the script, which didn't help. <https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/blob/develop/src/bin/deleteAllGroupSessions.js> . So it seems that this sessions are no group sessions.  A standard session storage entry looks like:  ``` | sessionstorage:----KdezcUojWiGfuzBgo1L-OnF4SbbZ | {"cookie":{"path":"/","_expires":null,"originalMaxAge":null,"httpOnly":true,"sameSite":"Lax","secure":false}} | | sessionstorage:---0sPTO0IIvtWBpbYpccywxSImVqSf_ | {"cookie":{"path":"/","_expires":null,"originalMaxAge":null,"httpOnly":true,"sameSite":"Lax","secure":false}} | | sessionstorage:---2pUJfjIE00yXpIkrzvHvUEOCLKI2X | {"cookie":{"path":"/","_expires":null,"originalMaxAge":null,"httpOnly":true,"sameSite":"Lax","secure":false}} |  ```  **Server (please complete the following information):**   * Etherpad version: 1.8.13 * OS: Debian Buster * Node.js version (node --version): v14.16.1 * npm version (npm --version): 6.14.12   **Additional context**  All session storage keys values from mariadb:  ``` MariaDB [etherpad]> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM store WHERE `key` LIKE 'sessionstorage%'; +----------+ | COUNT(*) | +----------+ | 16306299 | +----------+ 1 row in set (14.974 sec)  ```  None session storage keys values from mariadb:  ``` MariaDB [etherpad]> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM store WHERE `key` NOT LIKE 'sessionstorage%'; +----------+ | COUNT(*) | +----------+ | 54156416 | +----------+ 1 row in set (36.645 sec)  ``` |

| My first guess is that you can delete them after stopping Etherpad in case you run the default configuration (no special auth plugins and settings.json with requireAuthentication:false, requireAuthorization:false), but I'll take a deeper look when I have more time. Afaik sessions would just be re-generated as soon as users reconnect - but I need to be sure about this. They are different from group sessions (which you'd use, if you run an instance that can't be used without a valid session and generate the sessions via API), and thus as you noticed the script won't work.  They are also not used for author information (user names/author attribution across pads).  What they are used for is accessing /admin endpoints and other auth stuff depending on your configuration/plugins used.  [#4898](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/issues/4898) has more discussion on the underlying issue. |

| Thanks for etherpad as software and the fast reply. Thanks for pointing me to this issue.  If I calculated this correct, those 16 million session won't require more space than 300MB, so this is fine. But I think it would be great if they could expire automatically or by or a session garbage collector job :) |

| Closing this, as [#4898](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/issues/4898) has more info and in the course of fixing [#4898](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/issues/4898) we will need a way to purge old sessions anyway (manually or even automatically). |

| Design idea:   * express-session config changes:   + set `maxAge`, value TBD (maybe 7 days so the user doesn't have to keep logging in?)   + set `rolling=true` so that a session stays alive as long as the user stays connected   + set `saveUninitialized=false` to lower the load on the db (though it might not help in our case because I think we always modify the session object)   + set `resave=false` to lower the load on the db (though it might not help due to `rolling=true`) * `SessionStore` changes:   + implement the `touch()` method   + when creating/updating/touching a session, (re)set a timer that auto-deletes the session's db record when it expires * call `req.session.touch()` each time the server receives a socket.io ping or message from the client   A problem with the above scheme: The constant `.touch()` calls might increase the load on the db considerably. We could reduce db load by skipping a db write unless it would extend the saved lifetime by more than some threshold. (In other words: Trade accuracy for reduced load.) For example, we could set `maxAge` to 14 days and only update the db record if it would extend the lifetime by 7 days or more. That should reduce db load to one write per week per session, which is trivial.  Another problem: We would need to clean up old session records after a dirty shutdown, or after upgrading from a version of Etherpad that doesn't expire sessions. ueberdb doesn't have cursor support so we can't just iterate over all records that match `sessionstorage:*`. We could add cursor support to ueberdb, but that would take a lot of effort. Alternatively, with some clever key prefixing we can iterate over old sessions in small batches. Here's one approach:   * Add two new numeric db records:   + `instanceId`: A counter that is incremented each time Etherpad starts up.   + `caughtUpToInstanceId`: Used to clean up session state from previous Etherpad runs. Always less than or equal to `instanceId`. * When saving a session, use key ``sessionstore:${instanceId}:${sid}`` (instead of the current ``sessionstorage:${sid}``) and delete records ``sessionstore:${caughtUpToInstanceId}:${sid}`` through ``sessionstore:${instanceId - 1}:${sid}``. * When looking up a session ID, fetch all keys ``sessionstore:${caughtUpToInstanceId}:${sid}`` through ``sessionstore:${instanceId}:${sid}`` (inclusive) in parallel. Of the non-null results, use the one with the highest instance ID. * On startup, launch a worker thread to clean up or migrate session state from previous runs:   ```   for (; caughtUpToInstanceId < instanceId; ++caughtUpToInstanceId) {     // The following query should return a small number of keys (the number of     // sessions that were active when instance caughtUpToInstanceId exited).     for (const key of getAllDbKeysWithPrefix(`sessionstore:${caughtUpToInstanceId}:`)) {       const sess = getDbValue(key);       deleteDbRecord(key);       // If the session is still valid, save under the current instanceId and start a cleanup timer.       if (!isSessionExpired(sess)) saveSession(sess);     }   }   ```   To clean up legacy ``sessionstorage:${sid}`` records, we could do something like this:  ``` const alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; const sidCharset = `_-0123456789${alphabet}${alphabet.toUpperCase()}`; for (const chars of cartesianProductGenerator(Array(4).fill(sidCharset))) {   for (const key of getAllDbKeysWithPrefix(`sessionstorage:${chars.join('')}`) {     deleteDbRecord(key);   } }       ```  But it would probably be better to just have the user issue a native DB query to delete all of the legacy records. |
