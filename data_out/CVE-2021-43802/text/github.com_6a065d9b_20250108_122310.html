| **The session storage seems to be constantly growing** When running etherpad we see a constantly growing number of session storage values in the database.  Is there a way to clean them up? We already looked into the script, which didn't help. <https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/blob/develop/src/bin/deleteAllGroupSessions.js> . So it seems that this sessions are no group sessions.  A standard session storage entry looks like:  ``` | sessionstorage:----KdezcUojWiGfuzBgo1L-OnF4SbbZ | {"cookie":{"path":"/","_expires":null,"originalMaxAge":null,"httpOnly":true,"sameSite":"Lax","secure":false}} | | sessionstorage:---0sPTO0IIvtWBpbYpccywxSImVqSf_ | {"cookie":{"path":"/","_expires":null,"originalMaxAge":null,"httpOnly":true,"sameSite":"Lax","secure":false}} | | sessionstorage:---2pUJfjIE00yXpIkrzvHvUEOCLKI2X | {"cookie":{"path":"/","_expires":null,"originalMaxAge":null,"httpOnly":true,"sameSite":"Lax","secure":false}} |  ```  **Server (please complete the following information):**   * Etherpad version: 1.8.13 * OS: Debian Buster * Node.js version (node --version): v14.16.1 * npm version (npm --version): 6.14.12   **Additional context**  All session storage keys values from mariadb:  ``` MariaDB [etherpad]> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM store WHERE `key` LIKE 'sessionstorage%'; +----------+ | COUNT(*) | +----------+ | 16306299 | +----------+ 1 row in set (14.974 sec)  ```  None session storage keys values from mariadb:  ``` MariaDB [etherpad]> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM store WHERE `key` NOT LIKE 'sessionstorage%'; +----------+ | COUNT(*) | +----------+ | 54156416 | +----------+ 1 row in set (36.645 sec)  ``` |

| My first guess is that you can delete them after stopping Etherpad in case you run the default configuration (no special auth plugins and settings.json with requireAuthentication:false, requireAuthorization:false), but I'll take a deeper look when I have more time. Afaik sessions would just be re-generated as soon as users reconnect - but I need to be sure about this. They are different from group sessions (which you'd use, if you run an instance that can't be used without a valid session and generate the sessions via API), and thus as you noticed the script won't work.  They are also not used for author information (user names/author attribution across pads).  What they are used for is accessing /admin endpoints and other auth stuff depending on your configuration/plugins used.  [#4898](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/issues/4898) has more discussion on the underlying issue. |

| Thanks for etherpad as software and the fast reply. Thanks for pointing me to this issue.  If I calculated this correct, those 16 million session won't require more space than 300MB, so this is fine. But I think it would be great if they could expire automatically or by or a session garbage collector job :) |

| Closing this, as [#4898](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/issues/4898) has more info and in the course of fixing [#4898](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/issues/4898) we will need a way to purge old sessions anyway (manually or even automatically). |

| Design idea:   * express-session config changes:   + set `maxAge`, value TBD (maybe 7 days so the user doesn't have to keep logging in?)   + set `rolling=true` so that a session stays alive as long as the user stays connected   + set `saveUninitialized=false` to lower the load on the db (though it might not help in our case because I think we always modify the session object)   + set `resave=false` to lower the load on the db (though it might not help due to `rolling=true`) * `SessionStore` changes:   + implement the `touch()` method   + when creating/updating/touching a session, (re)set a timer that auto-deletes the session's db record when it expires * call `req.session.touch()` each time the server receives a socket.io ping or message from the client   A problem with the above scheme: The constant `.touch()` calls might increase the load on the db considerably. We could reduce db load by skipping a db write unless it would extend the saved lifetime by more than some threshold. (In other words: Trade accuracy for reduced load.) For example, we could set `maxAge` to 14 days and only update the db record if it would extend the lifetime by 7 days or more. That should reduce db load to one write per week per session, which is trivial.  Another problem: We would need to clean up old session records after a dirty shutdown, or after upgrading from a version of Etherpad that doesn't expire sessions. ueberdb doesn't have cursor support so we can't just iterate over all records that match `sessionstorage:*`. We could add cursor support to ueberdb, but that would take a lot of effort. Alternatively, with some clever key prefixing we can iterate over old sessions in small batches. Here's one approach:   * Add two new numeric db records:   + `instanceId`: A counter that is incremented each time Etherpad starts up.   + `caughtUpToInstanceId`: Used to clean up session state from previous Etherpad runs. Always less than or equal to `instanceId`. * When saving a session, use key ``sessionstore:${instanceId}:${sid}`` (instead of the current ``sessionstorage:${sid}``) and delete records ``sessionstore:${caughtUpToInstanceId}:${sid}`` through ``sessionstore:${instanceId - 1}:${sid}``. * When looking up a session ID, fetch all keys ``sessionstore:${caughtUpToInstanceId}:${sid}`` through ``sessionstore:${instanceId}:${sid}`` (inclusive) in parallel. Of the non-null results, use the one with the highest instance ID. * On startup, launch a worker thread to clean up or migrate session state from previous runs:   ```   for (; caughtUpToInstanceId < instanceId; ++caughtUpToInstanceId) {     // The following query should return a small number of keys (the number of     // sessions that were active when instance caughtUpToInstanceId exited).     for (const key of getAllDbKeysWithPrefix(`sessionstore:${caughtUpToInstanceId}:`)) {       const sess = getDbValue(key);       deleteDbRecord(key);       // If the session is still valid, save under the current instanceId and start a cleanup timer.       if (!isSessionExpired(sess)) saveSession(sess);     }   }   ```   To clean up legacy ``sessionstorage:${sid}`` records, we could do something like this:  ``` const alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; const sidCharset = `_-0123456789${alphabet}${alphabet.toUpperCase()}`; for (const chars of cartesianProductGenerator(Array(4).fill(sidCharset))) {   for (const key of getAllDbKeysWithPrefix(`sessionstorage:${chars.join('')}`) {     deleteDbRecord(key);   } }       ```  But it would probably be better to just have the user issue a native DB query to delete all of the legacy records. |
