# Admin privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution via malicious \*.etherpad imports

Critical

[rhansen](/rhansen)
published
GHSA-w3g3-qf3g-2mqc
Dec 9, 2021

## Package

npm

ep\_etherpad-lite
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 1.8.16

## Patched versions

1.8.16

etherpad
(n/a)

< 1.8.16

1.8.16

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can craft an `*.etherpad` file that, when imported, might allow the attacker to gain admin privileges for the Etherpad instance. This, in turn, can be used to install a malicious Etherpad plugin that can execute arbitrary code on the Etherpad server (including system commands) and in the browsers of users connected to the Etherpad server.

To gain privileges, the attacker must be able to trigger deletion of [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) state or wait for old express-session state to be cleaned up. Core Etherpad does not delete any express-session state (issue [#5010](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/issues/5010)), so the only known attacks require either a plugin that can delete session state or a custom cleanup process (such as a cron job that deletes old `sessionstorage:*` records).

Even if a reverse proxy is configured to reject access to `/admin/*` pages, it is still possible to crash Etherpad or bypass authorization checks to access restricted pads.

### Patches

The problem has been fixed in [v1.8.16](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/releases/tag/1.8.16). If you cannot upgrade for some reason, you can try cherry-picking [the fix commits](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/compare/b7065eb9a0ec7c3c265f8cfeb2534efe6f036456...77bcb507b30e762e9375b0511b3763e0162aae53):

```
git cherry-pick b7065eb9a0ec..77bcb507b30e
```
### Workarounds

If you cannot upgrade to v1.8.16 or patch, any of the following will prevent exploit:

* Install the [`ep_disable_imports` plugin](https://github.com/ether/ep_disable_imports#readme) and configure it to block `*.etherpad` imports. For example, you can add the following to your `settings.json`:
  ```
    "ep_disable_imports": {
      "deny": ["etherpad"]
    },
  ```
* Configure your reverse proxy to reject requests to `/p/*/import`. This will block all imports, not just `*.etherpad` imports.
* Limit all users to read-only access.
* Prevent the reuse of `express_sid` cookie values that refer to deleted express-session state:
  + Uninstall any plugins that enable users to delete express-session state (e.g., by calling [`req.session.destroy()`](https://github.com/expressjs/session#sessiondestroycallback)). Known plugins:
    - [ep\_openid-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ep_openid-client)
    - [ep\_openid\_connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ep_openid_connect)
    - [ep\_readonly\_guest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ep_readonly_guest)
  + If any `sessionstorage:*` records are deleted, delete `SESSIONKEY.txt` and restart Etherpad. Etherpad will generate a new `SESSIONKEY.txt` file with a different key, which will invalidate the signatures in old `express_sid` cookies.

### General Mitigations

In addition to upgrading or patching, we recommend you do the following to reduce risk if another vulnerability is discovered:

* Run Etherpad behind a reverse proxy.
* Configure your reverse proxy to reject requests to `/admin/*` and `/tests/*`.
* Configure SELiniux or AppArmor to limit command execution or file access outside of the `etherpad-lite` directory.
* Run Etherpad as a non-root user.
* Run Etherpad in a minimal container (see [Docker instructions](https://etherpad.org/doc/latest/#index_docker)).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
