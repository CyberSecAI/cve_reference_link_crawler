### Security fixes

This release includes fixes for [GHSA-w3g3-qf3g-2mqc](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/security/advisories/GHSA-w3g3-qf3g-2mqc) ([CVE-2021-43802](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43802)).

If you cannot upgrade to v1.8.16 for some reason, you are encouraged to try cherry-picking the fixes to the version you are running:

```
git cherry-pick b7065eb9a0ec..77bcb507b30e
```

* Maliciously crafted `.etherpad` files can no longer overwrite arbitrary non-pad database records when imported.
* Imported `.etherpad` files are now subject to numerous consistency checks before any records are written to the database. This should help avoid denial-of-service attacks via imports of malformed `.etherpad` files.

### Notable enhancements and fixes

* Fixed several `.etherpad` import bugs.
* Improved support for large `.etherpad` imports.
