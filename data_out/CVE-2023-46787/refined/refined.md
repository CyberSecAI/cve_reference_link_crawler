Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46787:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The 'username' parameter in the `auth/auth.php` resource is not validated. It's directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because user-supplied input (the `username` parameter) is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. The code uses `stripslashes()` which is insufficient to prevent SQL Injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Accessing sensitive user data stored in the `users` table.
    *   **Data Modification:** Modifying or deleting data within the database.
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** Bypassing authentication mechanisms by manipulating the SQL query to always return a valid user.
    *   **Potential server compromise:**  In some cases, advanced SQL injection could potentially allow the attacker to execute system commands on the database server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious `username` value within the HTTP POST request to `auth/auth.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `auth/auth.php` resource. No prior authentication or special privileges are needed, as the vulnerability is unauthenticated.
*   The attacker needs to understand how SQL injection attacks work.

**Technical Details**
The vulnerable code is located in the `auth/auth.php` file:
```php
$myusername=$_POST['username'];
$mypassword=$_POST['password'];

// To protect MySQL injection (more detail about MySQL injection)
$myusername = stripslashes($myusername);
$mypassword = stripslashes($mypassword);

$sql="SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$myusername' AND password='$mypassword'";
$result=mysqli_query($conn,$sql);
```
The code retrieves the `username` and `password` parameters from the POST request and uses `stripslashes()` to remove backslashes. However, this is not enough to prevent SQL injection. An attacker could provide a crafted username like `' OR '1'='1` which results in the query `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' OR '1'='1' AND password='<password>'`. This query would return all users bypassing authentication.
