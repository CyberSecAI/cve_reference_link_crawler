Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect type comparison when checking for errors in the `processPCCCMessage` function. The function returns a length value that is then cast to `uint16_t`. When an error occurs a signed `-1` is returned.  This value should be compared to a `uint16_t` value but is instead compared to the signed `-1` directly without casting to `uint16_t`. This comparison fails because the signed value `-1` is equivalent to the maximum value for a `uint16_t` (`0xFFFF`). This bypasses the error check.
- This leads to using a large, attacker-controlled value (0xFFFF) as the size parameter in a `memmove` operation. This large value, when increased by 7, causes an out-of-bounds read due to `memmove` attempting to read memory outside the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125):** The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read caused by using an improperly calculated size value in `memmove`.
- **Incorrect type comparison:** The comparison of a `uint16_t` value with a signed integer without proper casting is the root cause of the size calculation error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability leads to a crash of the OpenPLC runtime due to a segmentation fault, resulting in denial of service. The out-of-bounds read causes the application to attempt to access memory it doesn't have permissions for which terminates the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Request:** An attacker can send a specially crafted network request to the OpenPLC runtime that triggers the vulnerable code path. Specifically, the attacker crafts PCCC requests with unsupported command/function pairs, which causes the error case and leads to the incorrect size calculation, which is then used in the memmove call.
- **EtherNet/IP Protocol:** The vulnerability exists within the EtherNet/IP PCCC parser functionality of the OpenPLC runtime, allowing an attacker to exploit the vulnerability by sending a specific series of requests via this protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the OpenPLC instance to send malicious requests.
- **Knowledge of the Protocol:** The attacker needs to understand the EtherNet/IP and PCCC protocols to craft the specific requests required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple locations in the code (`sendRRData` and `sendUnitData`).
- The provided content includes a suggested fix: casting the signed `-1` to `uint16_t` before comparison, ensuring that the error case is correctly detected.
- The vulnerability affects OpenPLC v3 commit b4702061dc14d1024856f71b4543298d77007b88.
- The content provides more detail than a standard CVE description, including the specific code locations and a detailed breakdown of the crash.
- The report provides both CVE-2024-36980 and CVE-2024-36981 but both stem from the same root cause with slightly different code paths.
