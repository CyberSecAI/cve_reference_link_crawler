**Recommendation for End-of-Support/End-of-Life Products**

From time to time, D-Link will decide that some of its products have reached the End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life (“EOL”). D-Link may choose to EOS/EOL a product due to technological evolution, market demands,   innovations, product efficiencies based on new technologies, or the product maturing over time and should be replaced by functionally superior technology.

**For US Consumer**

If a product has reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life ("EOL"), there is usually no further extended support or development for it.

Typically, for these products, D-Link will be unable to resolve device or firmware issues since all development and customer support has ceased.

D-Link strongly recommends that this product be retired and cautions that further use may be risky to connected devices. If US consumers continue to use these devices against D-Link's recommendation, please ensure the device has the most recent firmware, frequently updates its unique password to access its web configuration, and always has WIFI encryption enabled with a unique password.
