**Recommendation for End-of-Support/End-of-Life Products**

From time to time, D-Link will decide that some of its products have reached the End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life (“EOL”). D-Link may choose to EOS/EOL a product due to technological evolution, market demands,   innovations, product efficiencies based on new technologies, or the product maturing over time and should be replaced by functionally superior technology.

**For US Consumer**

If a product has reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life ("EOL"), there is usually no further extended support or development for it.

Typically, for these products, D-Link will be unable to resolve device or firmware issues since all development and customer support has ceased.

D-Link strongly recommends that this product be retired and cautions that further use may be risky to connected devices. If US consumers continue to use these devices against D-Link's recommendation, please ensure the device has the most recent firmware, frequently updates its unique password to access its web configuration, and always has WIFI encryption enabled with a unique password.

DAP-2230/2310/2360 :: All Models :: All Revisions :: Zero-Day (Day-0) Reflected XSS Vulnerability

**Overview**

As a general policy, when products reach EOS/EOL, they can no longer be supported, and all firmware development ceases for them.  Please read the information and recommendations **below**.

The DAP-2230, DAP-2310, and DAP-2360, all hardware revisions were reported by 3rd Party to have a Reflected XSS Exploit Vulnerability.  Once we became aware, we have been investigating the issue. Since this exploit was discovered on the internet the 3rd party reports it as a zero-day.

The primary service these products are to bridge from WiFi to Ethernet, known as an WiFi Access Point. Based on the information available, these devices should not be exposed directly to internet traffic or public WiFi. These should be connected to networks that are protected by other security measure that does not allow direct access to the devices ethernet LAN web-management interface.

**Please check this announcement frequently for updated information.**

These products have reached their final service life-cycle and all have last day of support dates set in the table below.

Additionally another set of D-Link DAP Access Point models which are EOL/EOS are reported on another announcement [here](https://supportannouncement.us.dlink.com/announcement/publication.aspx?name=SAP10380).

D-Link US recommends retiring and replacing D-Link devices that have reached EOL/EOS. Please get in touch with your regional office for recommendations ([LINK](https://us.dlink.com/en/change-region)).

# Introduction

Hello every one , My name is Djallal Fekirine , known as (Djallalakira) , I am from Algeria and today i will share my CVE on D-Link products

In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, vigilance is our strongest weapon. Recently, a critical vulnerability was discovered across multiple D-Link DAP products, posing a significant threat to the integrity and security of networks worldwide. This article delves into the details of the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, its implications, and recommended mitigation strategies.

# Background

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This type of security flaw can lead to a range of exploits, from stealing session cookies to redirecting victims to phishing sites. The affected D-Link DAP products, including models DAP-2230, DAP-2310, DAP-2330, DAP-2360, DAP-2553, DAP-2590, DAP-2690, DAP-2695, DAP-3520, and DAP-3662, are widely used in various networking environments, making this vulnerability particularly concerning.

# Discovery and Technical Details

The vulnerability was identified in the “reload” parameter of the “/session\_login.php” page, a critical component used for user authentication and session management across the affected DAP products. By manipulating this parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user’s browser session.

A specific Shodan dork, `http.html:"/session_login.php"`, has been instrumental in uncovering this vulnerability, allowing researchers to locate vulnerable devices exposed on the internet.

# Impact Assessment

The exploitation of this XSS vulnerability could have severe consequences, including but not limited to:

* Unauthorized access to sensitive information
* Hijacking of user sessions
* Distribution of malware
* Phishing attacks aimed at unsuspecting users

Given the widespread deployment of the affected DAP products, the potential for large-scale impact is significant.

# Mitigation Strategies

To address this vulnerability, it is essential for administrators and users of the affected DAP products to take immediate action. Recommended mitigation strategies include:

1. **Applying Patches**: Check for and apply any available updates from D-Link that address this vulnerability.
2. **Input Sanitization**: Ensure that input fields, particularly those related to the “reload” parameter, are properly sanitized to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
3. **Network Segmentation**: Limit the exposure of vulnerable devices to the internet by implementing network segmentation and firewall rules.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Monitor network traffic and logs for any unusual activity that could indicate an attempted or successful exploitation of this vulnerability.

# Conclusion

The discovery of the XSS vulnerability in D-Link DAP products serves as a stark reminder of the importance of continuous vigilance in the digital age. By understanding the nature of this vulnerability, its potential impacts, and the steps necessary for mitigation, organizations and individuals can better protect themselves against emerging threats. Let this discovery be a call to action for the cybersecurity community to unite in safeguarding our digital world.
