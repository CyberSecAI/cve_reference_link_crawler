Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The `/me` endpoint in YourSpotify's backend directly returns the full `User` object from the MongoDB database without sanitizing or filtering sensitive fields. This object includes Spotify API access and refresh tokens.
- Guest users can access the `/me` endpoint using a public token, which is intended for read-only access but does not restrict access to sensitive data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive Spotify API access and refresh tokens to unauthorized guest users.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The `/me` endpoint directly exposes the full User object, rather than a subset of sanitized data.
- **Lack of proper access control:** The application does not properly restrict access to sensitive fields within the User object when using a public token.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access to Spotify Account:** Attackers can use the stolen access and refresh tokens to make API calls on behalf of the victim's Spotify account.
- **Information Theft:** Attackers can retrieve personal data, listening habits, playlists, and other information from the victim's Spotify profile.
- **Control of Playback:** Attackers can pause or resume playback on the victim's Spotify account, demonstrating control over the account's functions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **Public Tokens:** Attackers need access to a valid public token created by a YourSpotify user.
- **API Endpoint:** The `/me` endpoint is the specific point of exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to a Public Token:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid public token for a YourSpotify user. These tokens are meant to be publicly shared so this is not a high barrier to access.
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to send requests to the YourSpotify backend API.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in YourSpotify versions prior to 1.8.0
- The patch for the vulnerability is in version 1.8.0
