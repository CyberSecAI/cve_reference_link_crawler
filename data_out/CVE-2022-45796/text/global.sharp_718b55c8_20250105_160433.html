# About Command Injection Security Vulnerability in SHARP Multifunctional Products (MFP)

Command injection security vulnerability was identified and may impact some MFPs that are not properly protected with a strong admin password and firewall. The following is a summary of the vulnerability, affected models, and countermeasures:

| Vulnerability identification number | JVNVU#96195138 / CVE-2022-45796 |
| --- | --- |
| Affected models and firmware version | See the separate table below. |
| Condition to enable attacks using this vulnerability | To enable attackers to successfully attack the MFP using this vulnerability, they require access to:   * â Target MFP via network within firewall * â MFP administrator password |
| Possible impacts | If the above conditions are fulfilled, attackers may execute arbitrary command codes on the MFP. |
| Mitigation measures | To mitigate security risks and the command injection vulnerability, ensure to protect your MFPs and apply the following countermeasures.  * â Change admin password from factory default and securely store and manage the password. * â Do not expose MFPs directly to the Internet. Connect them via a firewall or similar network appliance.  If the above countermeasures are not practiced, devices may be accessed by attackers and cause data leakage. |
| Countermeasure | Sharp released updated firmware to mitigate the command injection vulnerability. For details, consult your authorized Sharp service providers. |
| Acknowledgment | This vulnerability was reported by ZUSO Advanced Research Team in Taiwan. We truly appreciate their report. |
