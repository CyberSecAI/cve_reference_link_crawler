Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `branch_viewmore.php` script within the Online-Payroll-Management-System. Specifically, the `id` parameter is directly used in a SQL query without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection.  An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter, leading to unintended database operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privileges:** The vulnerability can lead to privilege escalation, as an attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information, modify data, or even take control of the database server.
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request targeting the `branch_viewmore.php` endpoint.
- **`id` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `id`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques is required.
- Network access to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in `branch_viewmore.php`, as stated in the description.
- The provided `sqlmap` command and example HTTP request demonstrate how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability using SQL injection techniques.
- The provided proof of concept (POC) images show that the attacker can query arbitrary data using SQL injection.
- The vulnerability affects product versions up to commit `a8902bf64575e325f6d6bf93a55f7bd273ec58cd`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided github link points to a collection of CVEs and the vulnerability information.
- The vulnerability is confirmed to be present and exploitable by the submitter on vuldb.com.
- A `sqlmap` command and example request are provided as POC.
