Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a stack-based buffer overflow in the `formSetQosBand` function of the Tenda AC7 V1.0 firmware. This occurs when the `list` parameter from a POST request, which is user-controlled, is copied into a fixed-size buffer (`qos_str`) without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The `strcpy` function is used to copy the user-supplied `list` parameter into the `qos_str` buffer, which has a fixed size of 256 bytes. If the length of the user-supplied `list` exceeds 256 bytes, a buffer overflow occurs, overwriting data on the stack.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not validate the length of the `list` parameter before copying it into the `qos_str` buffer, allowing the overflow to occur.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Code Execution:** A successful buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution by overwriting the return address or other critical data on the stack.
*   **Denial of Service:** Overflowing the buffer could cause the device to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/SetNetControlList` endpoint, with an oversized `list` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Tenda AC7 device. This could be via the local network or, potentially, through the WAN interface if the router's management interface is exposed.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests with a specific payload size to trigger the overflow.
