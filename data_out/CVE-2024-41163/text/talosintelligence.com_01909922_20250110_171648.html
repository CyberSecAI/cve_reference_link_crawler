# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2024-2059

## Veertu Anka Build registry archive files directory traversal vulnerability

##### October 3, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2024-41163

##### SUMMARY

A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the archive functionality of Veertu Anka Build 1.42.0. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information. An attacker can make an unauthenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Veertu Anka Build 1.42.0

##### PRODUCT URLS

Anka Build - <https://veertu.com/download-anka-build/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.5 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

##### CWE

CWE-22 - Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (‘Path Traversal’)

##### DETAILS

Anka Build is a suite of software tools designed for macOS virtualization, specifically for testing macOS or iOS applications in CI/CD environments. The suite comprises three main components: Controller, Registry, and Nodes. Anka Build Controller is centralized dashboard for managing nodes, VM instances, templates, tags, and logs. Anka Build Registry serves as the central repository for macOS VM templates and tags, facilitating easy access and version control. Anka Build Nodes are macOS hosts that run on-demand VM instances.

The default installation of the Controller LaunchDaemon runs on the port 80 and the Registry LaunchDaemon runs on the port 8089.

A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the Anka Build Controller and Registry LaunchDaemons. This vulnerability is triggered when an HTTP GET request is sent to the controller URI `/api/v1/registry/log/archive` or to the Registry URI `/log/archive`. Both requests ultimately invoke the `veertu.com/veertu/registry/log_server.(*LogServer).handleGetArchive` method within the `anka-registry` binary. The decompiled code for the `veertu.com/veertu/registry/log_server.(*LogServer).handleGetArchive` method is as follows:

```
v53 = (__int64 (__golang **)(void *))a2.tab;
  v5 = net_url__ptr_URL_Query(a3->URL);
  v58.ptr = (char *)&service;
  v58.len = 7LL;
  service_value = net_url_Values_Get(v5, v58); //  <------- (1)
  if ( service_value.len )
 if ( service_value.len )
  {
    v48 = v53[3](v55);
    concat_str = runtime_concatstring3(
                   0LL,
                   &aBinaryLittleen[0x1DA0],
                   21LL,
                   service_value.ptr,
                   service_value.len,
                   &tar_gz_str,
                   7LL);
    v40 = v8;
    concat_str_1 = concat_str;

    [...]
       }
LABEL_15:
    v20 = (*((__int64 (__golang **)(void *, char *, size_t, __int64, void *))v51->server.tab + 3))( //<----(2)
            v51->server.data,
            service_value.ptr,
            service_value.len,
            v17,
            v55);
    if ( v20 )

```

At `(1)`, the `service` parameter value is extracted from the URL. At `(2)`, the `veertu.com/veertu/registry/backend/disklogserver.(*Backend).Compress` method is invoked. The first parameter of this method is the full path to the `Centrol-logs` directory. For the macOS installer, the default location of the `Centrol-logs` directory is `/Library/Application Support/Veertu/Anka/registry/files/centrol-logs`. The second parameter is the value of the `service` parameter. The `Compress` method appends the `service` parameter value to the `Centrol-logs` directory path without validating for directory traversal characters such as dot-dot-slash (../). Subsequently, the newly appended path is compressed, and the resulting compressed file is sent in the response.

Here, the `service` HTTP Parameter is vulnerable to path traversal. By utilizing `dot-dot-slash (../)` sequences or their variations, it may be possible to download arbitrary directories form the system where the `Registry` LaunchDaemon is installed.

##### VENDOR RESPONSE

Fixed in 1.43.0 of the Anka Build Cloud.

##### TIMELINE

2024-08-12 - Vendor Disclosure

2024-08-12 - Initial Vendor Contact

2024-09-30 - Vendor Patch Release

2024-10-03 - Public Release
