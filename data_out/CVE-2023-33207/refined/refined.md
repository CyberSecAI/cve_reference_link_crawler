{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress Stop Referrer Spam plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor could craft a request that targets a logged-in user of the WordPress plugin and force them to perform actions without their knowledge or consent.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to click on a crafted link or to visit a malicious website, which would then submit the forged request to the vulnerable plugin."
