- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unfiltered parameter and unchecked decompression of zip files within the IPAM API of ManageEngine DDI Central.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary file writing, directory traversal.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Creation of arbitrary files within the application folder, potentially compromising system integrity and security. Although existing files could not be replaced, it still poses a risk.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation of the IPAM API by sending a crafted request with a malicious zip file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make API requests to the vulnerable DDI Central instance, presumably as an authenticated user of the IPAM module.
