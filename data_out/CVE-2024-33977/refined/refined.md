The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Janobe products. Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2024-33977:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Product:** E-Negosyo System version 1.0

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when rendering the 'view' parameter in `/admin/orders/index.php`. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Attack Vector:** An attacker can create a specially crafted URL containing a malicious JavaScript payload in the `view` parameter and send it to a victim.

**Impact of Exploitation:** If the victim clicks on the malicious link, the injected JavaScript will execute in the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
* Session cookie theft: The attacker can steal the victim's session cookie.
* Account takeover: With the stolen session cookie, the attacker can potentially impersonate the victim and take over their account.
* Other malicious actions: The attacker could potentially perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user, like changing settings, transferring money, etc.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with an XSS payload.
* The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking the crafted URL. The victim must have an active session.
