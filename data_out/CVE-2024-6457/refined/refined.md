Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6457

**Vulnerable Software:** HUSKY - Products Filter Professional for WooCommerce WordPress plugin, versions 1.3.6 and below.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization and preparation of the `woof_author` parameter within an SQL query. The plugin uses user-supplied data from this parameter directly in a SQL query, without proper escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Time-Based SQL Injection:** The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code, including time-based delays, into the query, which can be used to extract sensitive data.
- **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements:** User input is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to extract sensitive information from the WordPress database.
- **Full Compromise:** Depending on the database user privileges, the attacker could potentially gain full access to the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via the `woof_author` parameter in an HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `woof_post_author_filter` function within the `ext/by_author/index.php` file of the plugin.
- Specifically, the code at line 99 of `ext/by_author/index.php` before the patch was vulnerable:
    ```php
    $where .= "post_author={$request['woof_author'][$i]}";
    ```
- The fix implemented in changeset 3116888, as seen on line 99, uses `$wpdb->prepare` to safely add the author to the query:
    ```php
    $where .= $wpdb->prepare("post_author=%d", $request['woof_author'][$i]);
    ```

**Additional Notes:**

- The Wordfence article provides a good description of the vulnerability.
- The Trac links provide context to the vulnerable code and the commit where the fix was implemented.
- The vulnerability is considered critical with a CVSS score of 9.8.

**Remediation:**
- Update the HUSKY - Products Filter Professional for WooCommerce plugin to version 1.3.6.1 or higher.
