# Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability

Moderate

[fuzegit](/fuzegit)
published
GHSA-f6cf-jg84-fw29
Oct 29, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

InstantCMS < 2.16.3

## Patched versions

2.16.4/2.17.0

## Description

### Summary

While testing InstantCMS {<https://demo.instantcms.io> - As this help us to test the dashboard online without installing it locally}, I was able to find that in photo upload function in the photo album page there is no input validation taking place, Due to this we were able to inject the XSS (Cross Site Scripting) payload and execute. Cross site scripting refers to client-side code injection attack wherein an attacker can execute malicious scripts (also commonly referred to as a malicious payload) into a legitimate website or web application. XSS is among the most rampant of web application vulnerabilities and occurs when a web application makes use of unvalidated or unencoded user input within the output it generates.

### Details

> Affected Component : [https://demo.instantcms.io/photos/camera-{payload}](https://demo.instantcms.io/photos/camera-%7Bpayload%7D)

> Steps to Reproduce:

1.Log in to <https://demo.instantcms.io> as an demo user

2. Visit <https://demo.instantcms.io/photos/upload> .

3.Upload the image with the embedded payload test `<img src="asd" onerror="alert(1)">` in the Camera Model Name meta data filed.

5.Visit the [https://demo.instantcms.io/photos/camera-{payload}](https://demo.instantcms.io/photos/camera-%7Bpayload%7D)

6.Example: [https://demo.instantcms.io/photos/camera-Amal\_Test%3Cimg+src=%22asd%22+onerror=%22alert(1)%22%3E](https://demo.instantcms.io/photos/camera-Amal_Test%3Cimg%2Bsrc%3D%22asd%22%2Bonerror%3D%22alert%281%29%22%3E)

8.you will observe the immediate execution of the XSS payload.

### Patch

[e02de2f](https://github.com/instantsoft/icms2/commit/e02de2fa1850bb40c9b2050b9256c838a0ea7aa3)

### Impact

An attacker can use this high severity vulnerability to execute malicious JavaScript aimed to steal cookies, redirect users, perform arbitrary actions on the victim's behalf, logging their keystroke and more. The attacker does not need to find an external way of inducing other users to make a particular request containing their exploit. Rather, the attacker places their exploit into the application itself and simply waits for users to encounter it. XSS can be used to deface the website.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
