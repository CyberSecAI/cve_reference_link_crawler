Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization of the `key` parameter in the URL of TileServer GL v2.3.1.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`key` parameter) before rendering it on the webpage, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser when they access the crafted URL.
- **Session hijacking:** Attackers can potentially steal session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Phishing:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites or display fake login forms to steal credentials.
- **Client-side attacks:** The attacker can perform various malicious actions on the victim's browser by executing JavaScript code.

**Attack vectors:**
- **URL parameter manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious code via the `key` parameter of the URL.
- **User interaction:** The victim needs to access a crafted malicious URL provided by the attacker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL with the malicious JavaScript payload injected into the `key` parameter.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking or accessing the malicious URL.
- No specific privileged access is needed on the server-side to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is found in Klokantech tileserver-gl version 2.3.1.
- The provided example payload `https://site.com/?key=wwwwwwwwwwwwww%22%3E%3Csvg%2Fonload%3Dconfirm%281%29%3E` demonstrates how to inject the malicious javascript.
