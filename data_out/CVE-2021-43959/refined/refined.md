- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the CSV import feature of JSM Insight.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly validate URLs during CSV import, allowing an attacker to supply arbitrary URLs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can access internal network resources, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information such as access credentials (e.g., metadata from cloud environments like Amazon EC2).
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via the CSV import feature of JSM Insight by providing a malicious URL within a CSV file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user and must be able to upload a CSV file to the JSM Insight feature.
