Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3625

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Redis password for Quay's database is stored in plain text within the `config.yaml` file of the `mirror-registry` component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of the Redis password in plain text, making it easily accessible to anyone who can access the file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access to Quay's Redis Instance:** A malicious actor who gains access to the `config.yaml` file can obtain the plain-text Redis password, enabling them to connect to and potentially control Quay's Redis instance. This could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** The attack vector is access to the file system where the `config.yaml` file is located. This could be through various means, including compromised systems, insider threats, or other security breaches that allow access to the server or container where the `mirror-registry` component is deployed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the Server or Container:** The attacker needs to have access to the file system where the `config.yaml` file resides within the `mirror-registry` deployment. This access would usually require a compromised system, application vulnerabilities, or internal access privileges.
- **Knowledge of Configuration Location:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable `config.yaml` file within the `mirror-registry` deployment.
