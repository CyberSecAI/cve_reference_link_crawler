- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient entropy in the Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG), also known as a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), when generating cryptographic keys on specific Cisco ASA and FTD hardware platforms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Use of a DRBG with low entropy for generating cryptographic keys (CWE-332). This results in the generation of predictable or non-unique keys.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a cryptographic collision by generating a large number of keys and finding collisions with target devices. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:
    - Discover the private key of an affected device.
    - Impersonate an affected device.
    - Decrypt traffic secured by an affected key.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to generate a large number of cryptographic keys and look for collisions with the keys of the targeted device. This can be done remotely.

The advisory also provides a workaround by importing keys generated outside of the vulnerable devices using the `crypto ca import pkcs12` command. It also lists vulnerable features such as AnyConnect SSL VPN, Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN), IKEv1/IKEv2 VPN, Local Certificate Authority (CA), Mobile Device Manager (MDM) Proxy, Mobile User Security (MUS), Proxy Bypass, REST API, and SSH Access. SSH access has no workaround.
