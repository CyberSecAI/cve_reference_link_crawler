The provided content is related to CVE-2022-2657.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks authorization and CSRF protection in multiple AJAX actions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Missing authorization checks: Authenticated users, even subscribers, can call AJAX actions that should be restricted to administrators or specific roles.
*   Missing CSRF protection: Unauthenticated attackers can potentially trigger AJAX actions via CSRF attacks if a logged-in user visits a malicious page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Suspension of vendors by any authenticated user.
*   Updating arbitrary order status by any authenticated user.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Direct AJAX calls: Attackers can directly call the vulnerable AJAX actions if they are authenticated users.
*   CSRF attacks: Attackers can craft malicious HTML forms or links that, when visited by a logged-in user, will trigger the vulnerable AJAX actions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   For direct AJAX call attacks, the attacker needs to have an account on the target website (even with low privileges like subscriber)
*   For CSRF attacks, the attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious page.
