OMRON  Corporation

■Overview

Use  of  Hard-coded  Credentials  (CWE-798)  and  Authentication  Bypass  by  Capture-replay

(CWE-294) vulnerabilities exist in the communications functions between the NJ/NX-series

Machine  Automation  Controllers,  Automation  software  Sysmac  Studio,  and  NA-series

Programmable Terminals. An attacker may use these vulnerabilities to bypass authentication

in the communications connection process and perform unauthorized access to the controller

products.

The  products  and  versions  affected  by  these  vulnerabilities,  mitigation  and  protection

measures are shown below. Make sure to implement these recommended mitigations and

protections to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Moreover, to ensure

that  customers  use  our  products  with  confidence,  the  security  enhanced  countermeasure

version of each product has been prepared. Please check countermeasures shown below in

■Mitigations and Protections

OMRON recommends that customers take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk

of exploitation of these vulnerabilities.

1. Anti-virus protection

Protect any PC with access to the control system against malware and ensure installation and

maintenance of up-to-date commercial grade anti-virus software protection.

    2. Security measures to prevent unauthorized access

- Minimize connection of control systems and equipment to open networks, so that untrusted

devices will be unable to access them.

-  Implement

firewalls  (by  shutting  down  unused  communications  ports,

limiting

communications hosts) and isolate them from the IT network.

- Use a virtual private network (VPN) for remote access to control systems and equipment.

- Use strong passwords and change them frequently.

- Install physical controls so that only authorized personnel can access control systems and

equipment.

- Scan virus to ensure safety of any USB drives or similar devices before connecting them to

systems and devices.

- Enforce multifactor authentication to all devices with remote access to control systems and

equipment whenever possible.

3. Data input and output protection

Validation processing such as backup and range check to cope with unintentional modification

of input/output data to control systems and devices.

4. Data recovery

        Periodical data backup and maintenance to prepare for data loss.

■Countermeasures

        The  countermeasures  against  the  vulnerabilities  can  be  implemented  by  updating  each

product  to  the  countermeasure  version.  The  countermeasure  version  and  respective

release date for each product is shown in the table below.

For information on how to obtain and update the firmware for the countermeasure version

of the product, please contact our sales office or distributors. You can update the Sysmac

Studio to the latest versions using the installed Omron Automation Software AutoUpdate

tool.

It is recommended to take countermeasures using the following security functions of the

Controller. For details on the function and how to set it, refer to 8-5 Security in the NJ/NX-

series CPU Unit Software User’s Manual (Cat. No. W501).

  Use the secure communication function to encrypt communication data between the

Sysmac Studio or NA-series Programmable Terminal and the Controller. By doing so,

it is possible to prevent data interception or alteration by a third party.

  Use the Packet Filter function to filter IP packets in the reception process of the built-

in EtherNet/IP port. By doing so, it is possible to restrict unauthorized access from

the outside.

  Use the user authentication function to authenticate individual users when the tool is

connected  online  and  prevent  unauthorized  access  by  allowing  only  operations

according to authority.
