Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2660:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key within the Delta Industrial Automation DIALink software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key:** The software employs a cryptographic key that is embedded directly within the code, making it easily accessible to an attacker. This defeats the purpose of encryption and allows for unauthorized access to protected data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to the decryption of sensitive data.
- The compromise of the machine and sensitive data would lead to a loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remotely exploitable:** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
- **Low attack complexity:** Exploiting the vulnerability requires minimal effort.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need prior access or elevated privileges on the system to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability is accessible remotely.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected versions of the DIALink Industrial Automation server are version 1.4.0.0 and prior.
- A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned, with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
- The vulnerability was reported by Y4er working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative to CISA.
- Mitigation measures are provided in DIALink v1.5.0.0. Users are advised to contact Delta Electronics for this release.
