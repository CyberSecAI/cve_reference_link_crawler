The content is related to CVE-2024-38443.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the stack overflow vulnerability is insufficient stack space allocation during the recursive calls of the binary insertion sort algorithm. When the input array is large, the recursion depth becomes significant, leading to stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow due to excessive recursion in the binary insertion sort algorithm.
- Infinite loop when compiled with O2/O3 optimization flags.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash due to segmentation fault.
- Denial of service by repeatedly crashing the program.

**Attack vectors:**
- Providing a large input array size to the vulnerable `binary_insertion_sort.c` program.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the compiled program and provide input to it.
