- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper HTML attribute escaping during server-side rendering. Svelte only escapes `"` to `&quot;` and `&` to `&amp;` in attribute values, and `<` to `&lt;` and `&` to `&amp;` outside of attribute values. This leads to XSS when malicious content is injected into attributes within a `<noscript>` tag, as the browser's DOM tree construction can differ from Svelte's expectation during server-side rendering.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient escaping of HTML special characters, specifically within attribute values in `<noscript>` tags, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** Network, by crafting a URL with malicious content in a query parameter that will be used as attribute value in a `<noscript>` tag.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with a payload in a query parameter that is then used within an attribute of a `<noscript>` tag. The user needs to visit the crafted URL.
