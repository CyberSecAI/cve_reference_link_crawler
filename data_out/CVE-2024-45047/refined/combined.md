# Potential XSS vulnerability due to improper HTML attribute escaping

Moderate

[Conduitry](/Conduitry)
published
GHSA-8266-84wp-wv5c
Aug 30, 2024

## Package

npm

svelte
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 4.2.19

## Patched versions

4.2.19, 5

## Description

### Summary

A potential XSS vulnerability exists in Svelte for versions prior to 4.2.19.

### Details

Svelte improperly escapes HTML on server-side rendering. It converts strings according to the following rules:

* If the string is an attribute value:
  + `"` -> `&quot;`
  + `&` -> `&amp;`
  + Other characters -> No conversion
* Otherwise:
  + `<` -> `&lt;`
  + `&` -> `&amp;`
  + Other characters -> No conversion

The assumption is that attributes will always stay as such, but in some situation the final DOM tree rendered on browsers is different from what Svelte expects on server-side rendering. This may be leveraged to perform XSS attacks. More specifically, this can occur when injecting malicious content into an attribute within a `<noscript>` tag.

### PoC

A vulnerable page (`+page.svelte`):

```
<script>
import { page } from "$app/stores"

// user input
let href = $page.url.searchParams.get("href") ?? "https://example.com";
</script>

<noscript>
  <a href={href}>test</a>
</noscript>
```

If a user accesses the following URL,

```
http://localhost:4173/?href=</noscript><script>alert(123)</script>

```

then, `alert(123)` will be executed.

### Impact

XSS, when using an attribute within a noscript tag

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
