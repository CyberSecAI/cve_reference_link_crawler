### Features

#### Added support for migrating Linux applications offline

The Migrate to Containers CLI now supports working with no connection to the internet
using the new offline mode. The offline mode lets you migrate Linux
applications in an offline environment.

This is beneficial if your local environment, which includes the local and
source machines and the deployment cluster, is located in a secured network
that requires pre-approval and security scanning for downloading external files
and binaries. With the offline mode, we've simplified the process of receiving
software updates from external sources into a secured network by adding files
bundling and unbundling options. In addition, you can specify a local and
secured registry as source for artifacts required for the migrated application.

To set up for offline migrations, after you've
[downloaded Migrate to Containers CLI](/migrate/containers/docs/m2c-cli/prepare-for-migration#download-cli-linux),
perform the following steps:

1. Download the offline Migrate to Containers CLI plugins bundle:

   ```
   curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/modernize-plugins-prod/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/modernize-plugins-prod/latest)/m2c-offline-bundle-linux.tar

   ```
2. If required, copy the Migrate to Containers CLI and offline Migrate to Containers CLI
   plugins bundle to the offline environment.
3. Unpack the offline Migrate to Containers CLI plugins bundle:

   ```
   ./m2c plugins unpack -i m2c-offline-bundle-linux.tar

   ```

   To add support for offline data migration, specify a container registry
   that is available in your local network:

   ```
   ./m2c plugins unpack -i m2c-offline-bundle-linux.tar --registry HOSTNAME

   ```

   Replace HOSTNAME with the container registry hostname.

For more information, see [Set up for offline migration](/migrate/containers/docs/m2c-cli/prepare-for-migration#offline-migration-linux).

## August 22, 2023

On August 22, 2023, we released Migrate to Containers CLI version 1.1.0.

### Features

#### Added support for Windows IIS services migration

The Migrate to Containers CLI now supports Windows IIS services migration. Migrating
Windows IIS services requires running the Migrate to Containers CLI on a Windows
machine.

To modernize Windows IIS services, follow these steps:

1. [Export the source VM disk images to VHD files](/migrate/containers/docs/m2c-cli/copy-file-system#create_a_local_copy_of_the_windows_source_machine_file_system).

   For example, to export an image from Compute Engine, first export the image to
   Cloud Storage, and then download the image on your local machine:

   ```

   gcloud compute images export \
       --export-format vhdx \
       --destination-uri DESTINATION_URI \
       --image IMAGE_NAME
   gcloud storage cp DESTINATION_URI LOCAL_PATH

   ```
2. [Analyze the disk images](/migrate/containers/docs/m2c-cli/create-a-migration-plan#create_a_migration_plan_for_windows_iis_services)
   to create a migration plan:

   ```

   ./m2c analyze \
      -s PATH_TO_IMAGE \
      -p windows-iis-container \
      -o ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH

   ```
3. [Edit the migration plan](/migrate/containers/docs/m2c-cli/windows/windows-customizing-a-migration-plan).
4. [Generate migration artifacts](/migrate/containers/docs/m2c-cli/execute-the-migration-plan)
   from the disk images and migration plan:

   ```

   ./m2c generate \
      -i ANALYSIS_PATH \
      -o OUTPUT_ARTIFACTS_PATH

   ```

#### Enhanced support for IBM WebSphere applications migration

IBM WebSphere support has been modified and expanded. The existing plugin
supports WebSphere Application Server traditional as a migration source. A new
plugin has been added to support WebSphere Application Server Liberty as a
migration source.

##### Changes in IBM WebSphere Application Server traditional migration

The following changes have been made to the IBM WebSphere Application Server traditional migration:

* The `websphere-traditional-container` plugin is now used for migrating IBM
  WebSphere Application Server traditional workloads.
* Added support for WebSphere Application Server Liberty as a target.
* The `was-home` parameter is now mandatory, even if you scan the source VM
  using mFit.

To migrate a IBM WebSphere Application Server traditional workload, run the
following command:

```

./m2c analyze \
    -s PATH_TO_COPIED_FILESYSTEM \
    -p websphere-traditional-container -o ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH \
    -r was-home=PATH_TO_WAS_HOME \
    --volume PATH_TO_BINARYAPPSCANNER:/binaryAppScanner.jar

```

For more information, see
[Create a migration plan for WebSphere traditional workloads](/migrate/containers/docs/m2c-cli/create-a-migration-plan#create_a_migration_plan_for_websphere_traditional_workloads).

##### Added support for IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty migration

Modernization of WebSphere Application Server Liberty is now
**generally available** with the `websphere-container` plugin.

To migrate IBM WebSphere Liberty workload, run the following command:

```

./m2c analyze \
    -s PATH_TO_COPIED_FILESYSTEM \
    -p websphere-container \
    -o ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH \
    -r websphere-home=WEBSPHERE_HOME \
    -r websphere-java-home=WEBSPHERE_JAVA_HOME
    -r target-base-image=TARGET_BASE_IMAGE

```

For more information, see
[Create a migration plan for WebSphere Application Server Liberty workloads](/migrate/containers/docs/m2c-cli/create-a-migration-plan#create_a_migration_plan_for_websphere_liberty_workloads).

#### Updated the Tomcat plugin

The discovery parameters for the Tomcat plugin have been updated.

* The `java-version` parameter is now added as input to Tomcat migrations.
* The `catalina-base` parameter can now include multiple directories delimited
  with colons (`:`).
* The `java-version`, `catalina-base` and `catalina-home` parameters are now
  required, even if you scan the source VM using mFit.

For more information, see [Create a migration plan for Tomcat workloads](/migrate/containers/docs/m2c-cli/create-a-migration-plan#create_a_migration_plan_for_tomcat_workloads).

#### Updated the Linux system container plugin

Linux system service endpoints are no longer automatically discovered and must
be manually specified while [customizing the Linux migration plan](/migrate/containers/docs/m2c-cli/linux/customizing-a-migration-plan#service-endpoints), even if you scan the source VM
using mFit.

### Fixed

In the earlier versions of Migrate to Containers CLI, the `copy` command could fail
when trying to use a socket in the `/tmp` directory, which is automatically
deleted in some systems. In this version, the defaults have changed, and to
customize the socket location, you can set the `SOCKDIR` environment variable.

### Issues

* Skaffold build for Windows images might fail on a Windows machine because
  Skaffold tries to pull the base image for the wrong target.

  As a workaround for this issue, pull the image manually with the `docker pull`
  command, and run the Skaffold build again.
* The deployment of Windows IIS workloads might be marked as not ready due
  to short timeouts. If you're deploying your workloads using Skaffold, then
  the deployment might show as failed.

  As a workaround for this issue, increase the readiness probe timeout and
  period using PowerShell:

  ```

  foreach ($file in (Get-ChildItem . -Recurse -Include "deployment_spec.yaml")) { (Get-Content $file).replace("periodSeconds: 10", "periodSe
  conds: 30").replace("timeoutSeconds: 1", "timeoutSeconds: 10") | Set-Content $file }

  ```

## June 27, 2023

On June 27, 2023, we released Migrate to Containers CLI version 1.0.0.

### Features

#### Upgraded Skaffold API version

Migrate to Containers CLI now generates the Skaffold configuration with the
Skaffold API version `v4beta4` instead of version `v2beta25`.

#### Added support for Linux VM containerization

Migrate to Containers CLI now lets you migrate Linux VMs to system containers.
It discovers the source application files and processes them to generate
migration artifacts, which include a Dockerfile, Kubernetes manifest, and
automated deployment scripts based on Skaffold.

Migrate to Containers CLI uses a prebuilt Linux system container which functions as a
boot loader for the services required by the modernized application. With
Migrate to Containers CLI, you can modernize a wide range of stateless Linux-based
applications to run on GKE, Cloud Run, or
GKE Enterprise clusters.

For more information, see [Create a migration plan for a Linux VM container](/migrate/containers/docs/m2c-cli/create-a-migration-plan#create_a_migration_plan_for_a_linux_vm_container).

#### Enhanced the `copy` operation

The following improvements to the `copy` operation are now available:

* The Migrate to Containers CLI `copy` operation now uses a local container to copy the
  source VM file system into a local directory instead of using a local tar file.
  This enhancement eliminates the need to install `rsync` on your local machine
  and reduces the disk space required for copying the source machine's file
  system.
* In case of failures, Migrate to Containers CLI now continues the copy process from
  the point of failure.

For more information, see [Copy the source machine's file system](/migrate/containers/docs/m2c-cli/copy-file-system).

#### Added the ability to clean up the copied file system

After your migration is complete, you can use the new `cleanup` command to
remove the copy of the source machine's file system that you created with the
`copy` command on your local machine without facing any permission issues.

For more information, see [Clean up your local machine](/migrate/containers/docs/m2c-cli/clean-up).

#### Added support for data migration

After executing a migration, you can now copy data directories into a new or an
existing persistent volume claim (PVC) on the target cluster with the new
`migrate-data` command.

This step is required in cases where you might need to migrate persistent data
directories from the source VM to persistent volumes mounted on the target
container.

For more information, see [Migrate data](/migrate/containers/docs/m2c-cli/migrate-data).

## June 13, 2023

On June 13, 2023, we announced that Migrate to Containers CLI is now **generally
available**.

The Migrate to Containers CLI lets you modernize application components running on
VMs to containers running on GKE, GKE Autopilot,
Cloud Run, or GKE Enterprise clusters.

For more information , see [Shift your applications to container-based workloads on the command-line | Google Cloud Blog](/blog/products/application-modernization/shift-your-apps-to-container-based-workloads-on-the-command-line).

## May 2, 2023

On May 2, 2023 we released Migrate to Containers CLI version 0.2.0 in
[preview](/products#product-launch-stages). The Migrate to Containers CLI lets you modernize
application components running on VMs to containers running on
GKE, GKE Autopilot, Cloud Run, or
GKE Enterprise clusters. The tool offers a simplified flow which is comprised
of 4 main steps:

1. Copy application files from a source VM using SSH or gcloud CLI.
2. Analyze the local copy of the application files to generate a migration plan.
3. Edit the migration plan files to customize the migration plan.
4. Generate artifacts required as container image, deployment YAML, and Skaffold
   configuration file.

For more information, see [About Migrate to Containers | Google Cloud](/migrate/containers/docs/getting-started).

### Features

#### Copy source application files

Copy your application files from a remote VM on-premises using SSH, or from a VM
running on Google Cloud using [gcloud CLI](/sdk/gcloud).

#### Analyze application files for modernization changes

Analyze application binaries and configuration files, and generate migration
plan file report and migration plan using parameters extracted from the copied
files.

#### Generate application artifacts to run as a container

Generate artifacts that you require to run the application as a container with a
Skaffold configuration file which lets you automate the deployment of the
generated artifacts on your target cluster.

#### Supported modernization flows

With the new Migrate to Containers CLI, you can work on your application modernization at
your local environment and deploy the generated artifacts directly on a local
or remote cluster.

The Migrate to Containers CLI supports the following modernization flows:

* Tomcat application to container that uses a community base image
* Apache application to container that uses a community base image
* IBM JBoss application to container that uses a community WildFly base image
* IBM Websphere Application Server traditional to container that uses an IBM
  WebSphere Application Server traditional image
* IBM Websphere Application Server traditional to container that uses a Open Liberty container image
