### iRODS 4.3.2 is released

The iRODS Consortium and RENCI are pleased to announce iRODS 4.3.2.

This release represents preparation for work on 5.0.0 and important bug fixes for the 4.3 series.

Most significantly, this release includes the new GenQuery2 parser and new iCommand `iquery`. For anyone already running the unreleased GenQuery2 API plugin packages, please note that an upgrade will halt and report a conflict with 4.3.2. Please uninstall the separate package before upgrading to 4.3.2.

Other notable inclusions are fixes for keyword combinations and bad inputs, a number of documentation additions, and a few new deprecation declarations.

This release consists of [125 commits from 7 contributors](https://github.com/irods/irods/compare/4.3.1...4.3.2) and [closed 154 issues marked for 4.3.2](https://github.com/irods/irods/issues?q=milestone%3A4.3.2).

The latest binary packages for CentOS7, AlmaLinux8, RockyLinux9, Ubuntu20, Ubuntu22, Debian11, and Debian12 are available at <https://packages.irods.org/>.
