The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the firmware of several NETGEAR router models.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Stack Overflow: A buffer overflow occurs on the stack, potentially overwriting return addresses or other critical data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS score of 4.5, with a high impact on availability (A:H). Exploitation could lead to device crashes or instability, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
*   Potential for Remote Code Execution (not explicitly stated but implied): While the advisory only mentions DoS, stack overflows can potentially be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the device, depending on the specific implementation and exploit technique.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Network based (AV:A): The vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.
*   Post-authentication (PR:H): The attacker needs valid administrative credentials to access the router’s management interface and trigger the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must be on the same network as the targeted device.
*   The attacker needs valid administrative access to the router’s web interface.
*   The attacker would need to craft a specific request that triggers the stack overflow.

**Affected Products:**
The advisory lists the affected router models and firmware versions:

*   R6400, firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.70
*   R7000, firmware versions prior to 1.0.11.126
*   R7900, firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.46

*   R6400v2, firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.118
*   R7000P, firmware versions prior to 1.3.3.140
*   RAX80, firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.120
*   R6700v3, firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.118
*  R6900P, running firmware versions prior to 1.3.3.140
*   RAX75, firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.120

**Mitigation:**

*   Update to the latest firmware versions. The advisory provides instructions on how to download and update the router's firmware.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory does not mention a CVE ID, but refers to it as "PSV-2020-0499". This implies that it was assigned internally by Netgear.
*   The advisory acknowledges "crixer" for reporting the vulnerability.
*   The advisory includes a CVSS vector string: `CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`
*   The advisory includes best practices for keeping firmware up to date, emphasizing both app-based and manual firmware updates.
