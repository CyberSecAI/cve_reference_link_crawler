- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `edit` method in `Funadmin\addons\curd\app\curd\controller\Table.php` directly concatenates an unfiltered ID parameter into an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization or parameterized queries.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, as well as potential privilege escalation or further system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** HTTP GET request to the `/curd/table/edit` endpoint with a malicious `id` parameter value.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have backend administrator privileges to access the vulnerable endpoint and exploit the SQL injection vulnerability. The provided proof of concept also highlights the need for an active session (PHPSESSID) and other cookies for a successful exploit.
