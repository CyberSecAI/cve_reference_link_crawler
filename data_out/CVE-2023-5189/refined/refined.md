  "CVE-2023-5189": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The tarball extraction code in galaxy-importer is vulnerable to path traversal and symlink attacks.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Path traversal vulnerability",
      "Symlink vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could craft a malicious tarball that, when extracted by the galaxy importer of Ansible Automation Hub, could drop symlinks onto the disk and overwrite arbitrary files.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafting a malicious tarball with relative paths or symlinks that target arbitrary paths.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious tarball to Ansible Automation Hub. This could be via a compromised user account or compromised repository."
