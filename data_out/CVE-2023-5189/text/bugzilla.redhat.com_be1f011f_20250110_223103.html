| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2234387#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-08-24 09:23:04 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in the galaxy importer of Ansible Automation Hub. The tarball extraction code is open to abuse in several ways (relative paths in the middle of a path, as well as symlinks that target arbitrary paths). If used to extract user-provided tarballs, this flaw could lead to arbitrary file overwrite.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2234387#c2)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2023-11-05 19:51:19 UTC  ``` Are there any details you can share about this issue? Is there an upstream report about it? Is an upstream fix known?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2234387#c3)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-11-06 09:09:32 UTC  ``` Redirecting NEEDINFO to Vipul who worked on this CVE and should be able to shed some light on it. As far as I know, the affected code can be found in _extract_archive() in galaxy-importer/collection.py. I do not know if there is a patch or any upstream discussions about it, though.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2234387#c4)  Vipul Nair    2023-11-14 17:00:58 UTC  ``` The affected code can be found at <https://github.com/ansible/galaxy-importer/blob/2c5c7c05fdfb0835878234b36de32902c703616d/galaxy_importer/collection.py#L160-L165>  It does not protect against `..` in the middle of paths, nor does it protect against directory traversals in `linkname` only `name`.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2234387#c5)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2023-11-20 06:24:45 UTC  ``` Thanks   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2234387#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-12-13 08:32:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.4 for RHEL 8   Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.4 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2023:7773 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7773](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7773)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2234387#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-03-27 13:18:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Satellite 6.14 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:1536 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1536](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1536)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2234387#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-23 17:14:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Satellite 6.15 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:2010 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2010](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A2010)   ``` |  |
