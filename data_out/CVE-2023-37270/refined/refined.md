Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-37270

**Description:** SQL Injection in "User-Agent"

**Root Cause:** The application was not sanitizing the `User-Agent` HTTP header before inserting it into a database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  SQL Injection: The application directly uses the unsanitized `User-Agent` header in an SQL INSERT statement.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `User-Agent` header, leading to arbitrary SQL execution on the server.
- **Data Leakage:** This could allow attackers to extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted `User-Agent` HTTP header during the admin login process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user that can log in to the administrator screen (even with low privileges).
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a modified `User-Agent` header.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `pwg_activity` function in `include/functions.inc.php`, specifically when logging user activity.
- The vulnerable code is in `include/functions.inc.php` at line 621.
- The SQL injection happens in the `mass_inserts` function in `include/dblayer/functions_mysqli.inc.php` at line 491, where the unsanitized user-agent is used to construct an SQL INSERT statement.
- The `User-Agent` is directly inserted into the SQL query without any sanitization or escaping.

**Patch Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Piwigo version 13.8.0.
- The fix includes sanitizing the `User-Agent` using `pwg_db_real_escape_string` before inserting it into the database.

**CVSS Score:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 7.6.
-  CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) using sleep() to demonstrate successful SQL injection.
- The advisory also includes a sample request and a sample output demonstrating the vulnerability.
- The advisory mentions that the table name is output in the error statement when SQL syntax is broken.
