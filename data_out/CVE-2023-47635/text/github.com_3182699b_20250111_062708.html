### @ahukkanen **[ahukkanen](/ahukkanen)** commented [Oct 11, 2023](#issue-1937897160)

#### üé© What? Why?

This PR simplifies the calls related to the questionnaire templates preview and removes some unnecessary code.

#### Testing

* Create the development app
* Make sure you have a survey template in the templates section (should be created by seeds)
* Create a new survey component
* Go to that component and select the template from the list
* Check that you see the preview rendering of the template

Sorry, something went wrong.
