Feb 20, 2024

The CSRF authenticity token check is currently disabled for the questionnaire templates preview as per:

[decidim/decidim-templates/app/controllers/decidim/templates/admin/questionnaire\_templates\_controller.rb](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/3187bdfd40ea1c57c2c12512b09a7fec0b2bed08/decidim-templates/app/controllers/decidim/templates/admin/questionnaire_templates_controller.rb#L11)

This was introduced by this commit in the PR that introduced this feature ([#6247](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/6247)):

[5542227](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/commit/5542227be66e3b6d7530f5b536069bce09376660)

The issue does not imply a serious security thread as you need to have access also to the session cookie in order to see this resource. This URL does not allow modifying the resource but it may allow attackers to gain access to information which was not meant to be public.

### Patches

[#11743](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/11743)

### Workarounds

Disable the templates functionality or remove all available templates.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
