    "summary": "The provided content describes a CSRF vulnerability in the Decidim platform related to the questionnaire templates preview feature. The vulnerability exists because the CSRF authenticity token check is disabled for the preview action in the `QuestionnaireTemplatesController`, which was introduced in a previous commit. This allows an attacker to potentially gain access to template information without proper authorization. The fix involves re-enabling the authenticity token check for the preview action.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause is the intentional disabling of the CSRF authenticity token check for the questionnaire templates preview action. This was done by using `skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token, only: :preview` in the `decidim-templates/app/controllers/decidim/templates/admin/questionnaire_templates_controller.rb` file.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "CSRF vulnerability due to the lack of authenticity token verification on the preview action.",
         "Information disclosure vulnerability."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker might be able to gain access to questionnaire template information that was not intended to be public. The attacker could potentially send requests to the preview URL without the necessary CSRF token, as long as they have access to the session cookie.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. An attacker would craft a malicious request targeting the questionnaire template preview endpoint, without providing the necessary CSRF token.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have access to a valid session cookie for the targeted Decidim instance. They also need knowledge of the application's structure and how to target the preview endpoint."
