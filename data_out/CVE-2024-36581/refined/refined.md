{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the ability to manipulate the prototype of an object by using the `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` properties which are not properly sanitized.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Prototype Pollution"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can alter the behavior of all objects inheriting from the affected prototype. This can lead to denial of service, remote code execution, or cross-site scripting attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By providing crafted JSON input containing `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` properties to the `setDebug` function."
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `setDebug` function."
