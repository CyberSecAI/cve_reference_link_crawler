For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmc-xss-infodisc-RL4mJFer>  This advisory is part of the October 2024 release of the Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: October 2024 Semiannual Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75300).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco FMC Software.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA) Software or Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2024-20377: Cisco FMC Software Stored XSS Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco FMC Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored XSS attack against a user of the interface.  This vulnerability is due to the web-based management interface not properly validating user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwj01321](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwj01321)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20377Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 5.4CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N  **CVE-2024-20387: Cisco FMC Software Web-Based Management Interface Stored XSS Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco FMC Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to store malicious content for use in XSS attacks.  This vulnerability is due to improper input sanitization in the web-based management interface of Cisco FMC Software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct a stored XSS attack on an affected device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwi99692](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwi99692)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20387Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 5.4CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N  **CVE-2024-20388: Cisco FMC Software API Response Information Disclosure Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the password management of Cisco FMC Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to determine valid usernames on an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to a logic error with password updates. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the API to manage passwords on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow an unauthenticated attacker to determine configured usernames.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwj03056](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwj03056)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20388Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 5.3CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x). This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities that are described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).  To use the tool, go to the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) page and follow the instructions. Alternatively, use the following form to search for vulnerabilities that affect a specific software release. To use the form, follow these steps:    1. Choose which advisories the tool will search-all advisories, only advisories with a Critical or High [Security Impact Rating (SIR)](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#asr), or only this advisory.   2. Choose the appropriate software.   3. Choose the appropriate platform.   4. Enter a release number-for example, **9.16.2.11** for Cisco ASA Software or **6.6.7** for Cisco FTD Software.   5. Click **Check**.
