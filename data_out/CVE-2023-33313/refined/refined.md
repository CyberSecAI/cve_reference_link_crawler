- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress WIP Custom Login plugin, in versions 1.2.9 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force authenticated users to perform unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could lead a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. Specific impacts may vary depending on the plugin's functionality and the actions it allows.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted request that exploits the lack of CSRF protection in the plugin. An attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into making the request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious webpage that makes a request to the vulnerable plugin. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
