  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple vulnerabilities in MySQL related to various components such as the optimizer, InnoDB, stored procedures, DDL, DML, replication, privileges, and the C API.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unspecified vulnerability in the Server Optimizer",
    "Unspecified vulnerability in InnoDB",
	  "Unspecified vulnerability in Server DDL",
    "Unspecified vulnerability in Server Replication",
    "Unspecified vulnerability in Server Security",
    "Unspecified vulnerability in the MySQL C API",
    "Unspecified vulnerability in stored procedures"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to:\n\n*   Unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server.\n*   Unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all of the MySQL Server accessible data.\n*   A hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server.\n* Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the process, privilege escalation, or complete access to all MySQL server accessible data.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network exploitation via MySQL protocol or local exploitation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker may need high privileges to exploit some vulnerabilities while other vulnerabilities may be exploited without any privileges required. Some vulnerabilities may be triggered via specially crafted SQL queries, or by specific interactions with the MySQL server."
