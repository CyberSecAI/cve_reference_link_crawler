Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23157:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of `ScreenInfo` tags within UMP files by WECON LeviStudioU. Specifically, the application fails to properly validate the length of user-supplied data when parsing the `ScrnName` and `ScrnFile` attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122):** When parsing the `ScrnName` and `ScrnFile` attributes of the `ScreenInfo` tag, the software copies user-provided data to a fixed-size heap buffer without proper length validation. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the supplied data exceeds the buffer's capacity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can exploit the heap-based buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running LeviStudioU. This could allow the attacker to take control of the system, access sensitive data, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious UMP Files:** The attacker crafts a malicious UMP file containing a `ScreenInfo` tag with an overly long `ScrnName` or `ScrnFile` attribute.
- **User Interaction:** The target user must open the malicious UMP file using the vulnerable LeviStudioU software for the vulnerability to be triggered.  It is also mentioned that a user visiting a malicious page could also trigger the vulnerability, though this is not explicitly detailed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create malicious UMP files:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a UMP file with the specially crafted ScreenInfo tag and excessively long ScrnName or ScrnFile attribute.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a user into opening the malicious UMP file using the vulnerable software.  The attacker could also need to entice a user into visiting a malicious page depending on how the vulnerability is triggered.
