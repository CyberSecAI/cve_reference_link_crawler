SSA-856475: X\_T File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Teamcenter Visualization and JT2Go

| Publication Date: | 2024-08-13 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-08-13 |
| Current Version: | V1.0 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.8 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 7.3 |

SUMMARY

Teamcenter Visualization and JT2Go are affected by out of bounds read and null pointer dereference vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the application reads files in X\_T format. If a user is tricked to open a malicious file with the affected applications, an attacker could leverage the vulnerability to perform remote code execution in the context of the current process.

Siemens has released new versions for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.
