{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The program receives the attacker's GET request through the getenv function, obtains the value of the first field, and concatenates it into a formatted string using the snprintf function. Finally, the system function is used to execute the system command.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command Injection",
    "Unfiltered user input"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary system command execution",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request to upload_file.cgi",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can send a crafted GET request to the vulnerable endpoint."
