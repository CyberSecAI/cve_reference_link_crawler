Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and validation of uploaded files in RiteCMS 3.0's file manager. Specifically, the system allows the upload of SVG files containing malicious JavaScript code.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    * **Unrestricted File Upload:** The file manager does not sufficiently restrict the types of files that can be uploaded.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The system does not sanitize the content of uploaded SVG files, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of the application when the SVG is accessed.
* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    * **Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser session.
    * **Session Hijacking:** The attacker could potentially steal cookies or other session data.
    * **Data Theft:**  The attacker could potentially access sensitive information displayed on the page.
    * **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the content of the viewed page.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious SVG file through the "Filemanager" section of the administration panel.
    * **File Access:** When a user views or accesses the uploaded malicious SVG file, the embedded JavaScript code is executed.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be logged into the RiteCMS admin panel with the necessary privileges to access and use the file manager (High privilege level).
    * **Local Attacker:** As described, the attacker is "local", this means they must have access to the system's admin interface through the network.

**Summary of the provided content:**
The provided content is from a GitHub repository that describes a stored XSS vulnerability in the file manager of RiteCMS 3.0. An attacker can upload a malicious SVG file containing embedded JavaScript code and trigger the XSS when that file is accessed/viewed within the application.
