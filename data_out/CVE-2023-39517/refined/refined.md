Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2023-39517.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The HTML sanitizer in Joplin Desktop (`packages/renderer/htmlUtils.ts::sanitizeHtml`) improperly handles `<map>` and `<area>` tags. Specifically, it does not remove the `target` and `href` attributes from these tags, unlike how it handles `<a>` links.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper sanitization of `<map>` and `<area>` tags, leaving the `target` and `href` attributes.
- Lack of sandboxing in the note preview pane, which allows the ability to perform top-level navigation through the target attribute.
- Toplevel electron pages have access to `require` and node libraries allowing for code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious note with a crafted `<map>` and `<area>` tags that, when clicked, redirects to a malicious website.
- The malicious website can execute arbitrary shell commands on the victim's machine through access to node libraries via the electron environment. This is because the `target="_top"` attribute allows replacing the main Joplin window with attacker controlled content.

**Attack vectors:**
- A user must open a specially crafted note containing malicious HTML.
- The user must click on an image within the note's preview pane that has a `usemap` attribute referencing the malicious `<map>` tag.
- The attacker can host a malicious webpage locally or remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious markdown note with specific HTML tags and attributes.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to deliver this note to a user through any method.
- The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage which is referenced via the crafted HTML.
