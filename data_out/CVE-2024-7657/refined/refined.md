  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `content` field when updating page content.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or further attacks against users of the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a POST request to `/cm/update_rows/page?id=<ID>` and modifies the `content` field with a malicious script payload.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Gila CMS application."
