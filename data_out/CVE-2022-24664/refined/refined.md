    "root_cause": "The PHP Everywhere plugin allowed execution of PHP code via a metabox, and by default, all users with the `edit_posts` capability could use this metabox.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure implementation of PHP code execution functionality.",
      "Insufficient access control allowing low-privileged users with `edit_posts` capability (e.g., Contributor-level) to execute arbitrary PHP code."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote Code Execution, leading to potential complete site takeover.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker with `edit_posts` capability can create a post, add PHP code to the PHP Everywhere metabox, and preview the post."
