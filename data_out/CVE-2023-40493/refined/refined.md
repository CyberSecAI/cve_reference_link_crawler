- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path within the `copySessionFolder` command before using it in file operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability due to insufficient path validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network attack. No authentication is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing any prior authentication to the system running the vulnerable software.
