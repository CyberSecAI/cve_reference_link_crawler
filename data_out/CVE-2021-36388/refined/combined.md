# [Release Notes for Yellowfin 9](/display/yfcurrent/Release%2BNotes%2Bfor%2BYellowfin%2B9)

##

##

Yellowfin 9 revolves aroundÂ providing business users with unique ways to engage with and act on their data and addressing the needs of data analysts and developers who want to build and deploy amazing analytical experiences.

## Yellowfin 9.14

This release introduces a major update to the REST API as well as a host of the changes requested by our customers - in addition to the usual security updates and quality improvements.

### Highlights

Click here to expand...
##### REST API Updates

Our REST API provides important functionality to our Customers who wish to automate key processes (such as automating the onboarding of new clients in a multi-tenant environment) or building custom embedded applications using Yellowfin. We have completed a major update that involves numerous quality fixes as well as the following new REST API functionality:-

* Created a new **/content** endpoint that returns a list of all of the content that a user has access to. This includes all Yellowfin Content types such as Views, Reports, Dashboards, Stories and more. This allows Customers for example, the ability to build their own content browsing solution in an embedded scenario.
* Updated the **/users** endpoint to make it easier to use and also to return and allow the update of more user profile information such as timezone and language preferences..
* Created new endpoints for **/dashboards, /presentations and /themes** to allow retrieval of lists of those content items or detailed information for a specific content item
* Enhanced the **/import-export** endpoint with an option to list the dependencies of a Content Item from within an Import File. This could be used when determining whether the dependencies for a content item already exist on a target system - and enhances the ability for Customers to automate content synchronization between environments.
* Created new **/health** endpoints that return the overall health of a Yellowfin deployment, including clustered deployments. There are two forms, a ping endpoint that does not require authentication and returns limited information, and a full health endpoint that returns comprehensive information about the deployment.
* We added REST endpoints to trigger **Cached Filter Refreshes** for Dashboards and Views. This functionality was previously only available in our SOAP API.
* We extended the **/discussion-streams** endpoint to allow new discussion streams to be created including within Client Orgs. This is useful in multi-tenant scenarios when onboarding new tenants and setting them up with a standard default environment that includes discussion streams.
* We created a new **Integration API** utility that allows external developers to get information about the user and organization. This exposes a user-friendly interface to developers to avoid them having to reference internal Yellowfin methods to get the current user, role or client organization when developing custom headers, JSPs and internal plugins like formatters and analytic functions.

Our current REST API documentation is stored in ReDoc and hosted [here.](https://developers.yellowfinbi.com/dev/api-docs/current/)

There are a few breaking changes in the V3 API. If you are migrating from an earlier version, please consult the migration [guide.](https://wiki.yellowfinbi.com/display/yfcurrent/REST%2BAPI#RESTAPI-GuidelinesformigratingtoV3oftheAPI)

#### Other Highlights

##### Report Builder

The User Interface for re-ordering columns in the Report Builder has been improved. Columns can now be re-ordered from the Column formatting page by simply dragging and dropping the column to a new location. This is especially useful for Reports with large numbers of columns.

![](/download/attachments/48991520/Report%20Builder.png?version=1&modificationDate=1733496970933&api=v2)

*CheckÂ [Column Order](https://wiki.yellowfinbi.com/display/yfcurrent/Column%2BFormatting#ColumnFormatting-ColumnOrder) for more information.*

Also in report builder we added the ability to use Calculated Totals in most Chart Types. Calculated totals are an extremely useful feature when using calculated fields in a report. It provides the option to re-execute the calculation at the total or sub-total level for a report, rather than using traditional aggregation types such as Sum, Average etc. This is useful for example where you use a calculation such as a ratio (return on equity for example). Previously, when used in a chart, this aggregation type was not available due to the fact that data was re-aggregated to create the chart itself. We have now added Calculated Total support to most chart types.

*CheckÂ [Calculated Field](https://wiki.yellowfinbi.com/display/yfcurrent/Calculations#Calculations-CalculatedTotal) for more information.*

We have continued to improve our charting capability, including the ability to apply micro-configurations to ensure our Customers can achieve the exact visual design they are looking for. In this release we have added the ability to configure the color of label lines.

![](/download/attachments/48991520/Report%20Builder%20Chart.png?version=1&modificationDate=1733496975128&api=v2)

##### Image Manager

When uploading new images, the image can now be pasted from the Clipboard of the browser. This makes it easy when adding images to Stories, Dashboards or Presentations - to search for an image (say in a Google Search result), right click to copy it and then paste it directly into the Image Manager popup.

##### User Avatar

In the event that a user has not added a profile image for their user avatar, we now display the userâs initials - similar to many modern messaging applications - as opposed to the default Yellowfin user icon. In addition, we have added the ability for users to choose a custom background color for their avatar. This uses Yellowfinâs standard color picker that allows for a choice between standard colors or a fully custom color including the ability to enter the hexadecimal code of your favorite color. You can also customize the initials that are displayed, this is particularly useful for certain languages where the first and last initial do not represent the most appropriate choice for the user.

![](/download/attachments/48991520/Mobile%20App.png?version=1&modificationDate=1733496986483&api=v2)

##### New Popup UI

A range of new popup windows were introduced as part of the Browse Page refresh in the 9.10 release. These new popups were previously only accessible from the Browse Page itself, and legacy popups were still shown elsewhere in the application. We have now unified the UI to ensure consistent popups are displayed throughout the application. This includes popups to create and edit Folders, popups for sharing content such as Reports and Stories, the View Summary popup and a variety of other confirmation popups (such as when deleting content).

In addition, we have enhanced the UI for managing User Access on Folders - including the ability to:-

* Resize the columns of the table to better see information
* Restrict what is shown in the list by selecting People Only, Groups Only or Client Groups Only
* Make the table scroll within the page so that the Save and Cancel buttons are always visible.

![](/download/attachments/48991520/New%20Popup%20UI.png?version=1&modificationDate=1733496988698&api=v2)

##### Embed Loom Videos in Stories

Loom is emerging as a popular video sharing platform particularly within companies. We have added support for Loom videos to be added to Stories, in addition to existing support for Youtube and Vimeo.

##### Enforce a default entry page for all users

We have added more control to define the initial page users see in the Yellowfin UI when they log in. A new option to enforce a standard entry page for all users has been added. Users can be directed to Dashboards, Browse Page, Favorites (Browse Page filtered for Favorite content) or Timeline. Alternatively, this can be left to the userâs preference with a system-wide default enabled for all first-time users.

*CheckÂ [Configuration System](https://wiki.yellowfinbi.com/display/yfcurrent/Configuration#Configuration-System) for more information.*

##### More fine-grained control over attachment types

We have continued to improve on Yellowfinâs market leading reporting capabilities - including the ability to export, share and broadcast reports as attachments. In this release we separated the role function for TXT and CSV to separate roles (previously these were combined in a single role), and we added fine-grained control over exactly which attachment types are supported for Reports and Dashboards, including the ability to modify the default attachment type for broadcasts.

*CheckÂ [Configuration System](https://wiki.yellowfinbi.com/display/yfcurrent/Configuration#Configuration-System) for more information.*

##### Data Source Support

We added official support for **MySQL HeatWave** data sources.

##### Regionalization

The text on a button added to a Dashboard is now exported as part of Content Translation - together with Text objects (delivered in 9.13) this now enables full multi-language Dashboards to be created. That is, a single Dashboard can be created in one language, all displayed text can be translated via the Content Translation process and shown to the user in their preferred language.

### Highlights

Click here to expand...
##### **Menu Navigation updates**

Yellowfin previously supported a left-hand side navigation menu and a top-navigation menu. We have introduced a new, modern menu style that includes:-

* Simpler, one-click navigation to move between major system functions
* A more intuitive design for accessing administration settings, the Usersâ profile and the Create Menu
  ![](/download/attachments/48991520/RN%20Highlights.png?version=2&modificationDate=1725632759346&api=v2)

The new menu structure is enabled by default for new installations, but the current settings are retained on upgrade. Administrators can change the menu style for the instance at any time via the [Configuration](https://wiki.yellowfinbi.com/display/yfcurrent/Configuration#Configuration-system) screen - under System / General Settings / Navigation Style.

The top-level toolbar has also been updated in the Report Builder - this provides greater visible differentiation between the report builder tabs, and more intuitive placement of menu options that is consistent with the View Builder.

### Change Impacts

Click here to expand...

Yellowfin 9.10 contains changes to the Browse page and other popup dialogs that can be opened from the Browse page. New CSS styles have been used to style these new UI elements. Existing custom styling may not apply colors correctly on these elements. It is recommended that you test custom styling prior to deploying Yellowfin 9.10 into production, as additional changes to your styles may be required.

These new CSS variables have been defined in ie.css. Modifying these variables will apply custom colors to new styles throughout the application.

```
--primary-color-2
--primary-button-color-2
--primary-button-hover-color-2
--grey-2
--grey-3
--dark-grey-3
--dark-grey-4
--dark-grey-5
--light-grey-6
--light-grey-7
--light-grey-8
--light-grey-9
--light-grey-10
--light-blue-2
--red
--red-2
```

Some PNG icon images have been replaced with SVG images, and if using custom images, it may be required to convert your existing PNG files to the SVG format.

#### Filtering

* We addressed lots of small issues around filtering, such as previous values persisting and caching issues. In detail, we resolved issues where:

+ a timestamp or converted date filter would not work as a parent dependent filter;
+ adding a new field to a view level filter group that had existing reports would corrupt the reports;
+ the Initial State Open/Closed preference for filter groups would not update;
+ filter breadcrumbs would not always contain a scrollbar;
+ creating a calculated filter would filter out calculated fields;
+ converting predefined dates of parameter filters would throw exceptions;
+ the value of dependent filters would update incorrectly;
+ in filter lists, if no new filter changes were made, the âApplyâ button would not refresh reports; and
+ following an upgrade, filters would disappear from filter groups.

#### Yellowfin Dashboards

Introducing the new, revamped Yellowfin Dashboard.Â The new version allows users to assemble creative, on brand infographic and actionable dashboards on a flexible, free-form canvas. Developer centric functionalities have been introduced to edit dashboard code and create integrated workflows. Functionality to create charts directly on the dashboard has also been added. New content objects have also been added, such as Filter Widgets, Code Widgets, Blueprint.

[Learn all about Yellowfin Dashboards.](/display/yfcurrent/Yellowfin%2BDashboards)

#### Yellowfin Present

The Storyboard has been replaced with Yellowfin Present as the presentation module. This module further enhances Yellowfinâs data storytelling capabilities.Â Yellowfin Present is a fully integrated presentation module designed for data led communications. This module contains functionality similar to that of the dashboard canvas. A presentation slide supports the use of multiple types of content, including live reports, text, images, shapes and icons, action buttons, filters, and even code widgets.
