{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application's proxy endpoint did not validate or restrict the target URLs, allowing an attacker to send requests to arbitrary locations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - CWE-918"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can leverage the SSRF vulnerability to perform internal network port scanning, read or update internal resources, and potentially bypass security mechanisms like Cloud WAFs to reveal the real IP addresses of backend servers. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information such as AWS metadata and internal services (e.g., databases).",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through a network request to the `/proxy` endpoint without proper validation of the target URL.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any privileges to exploit the vulnerability. They need the ability to send HTTP requests to the application's `/proxy` endpoint and supply a malicious URL as a parameter."
