# Proxy Endpoint Vulnerabliity

High

[inodb](/inodb)
published
GHSA-9h44-r3c3-q7rm
Jul 23, 2024

## Package

cBioPortal

## Affected versions

<=v6.0.11

## Patched versions

>=v6.0.12

## Description

### Impact

When running a publicly exposed proxy endpoint without authentication it could allow someone to perform a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack. Logged in users could do the same on private instances.

### Patches

Fixed in [#10884](https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/pull/10884). Released in <https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/releases/tag/v6.0.12>

### Workarounds

Might be able to disable /proxy endpoint entirely via e.g. nginx

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
