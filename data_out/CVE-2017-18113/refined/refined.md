Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The `DefaultOSWorkflowConfigurator` class in Jira Server and Jira Data Center improperly handles workflow imports, allowing the inclusion of problematic OSWorkflow classes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.
- **Unsafe OSWorkflow Classes:** The issue stems from the ability to use unsafe conditions, validators, functions, and registers from the OSWorkflow library and other Jira dependencies within workflows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to run arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Workflow Import:** An attacker must trick a system administrator into importing a malicious workflow file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Craft Malicious Workflow:** The attacker must be able to create a malicious workflow that includes unsafe OSWorkflow elements.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a system administrator to import the malicious workflow into the Jira system.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix blocks the usage of unsafe conditions, validators, functions and registers from the OSWorkflow library and other Jira dependencies.
- Atlassian-made functions or those provided by 3rd party plugins are not affected by the fix.
- A workaround is available in Jira versions 8.5.19 and 8.13.11+ by enabling a dark feature flag.
- The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS score of 8.3, categorized as high severity.
- The vulnerability affects versions prior to 8.18.1
