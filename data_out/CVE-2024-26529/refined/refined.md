Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities discussed:

**Vulnerability 1 (Related to issue #492):**

*   **Root Cause:** An integer overflow vulnerability in `mmsServer_handleGetNameListRequest` function within `src/mms/iso_mms/server/mms_get_namelist_service.c`. Specifically, a negative value for the `bufPos` variable leads to out-of-bounds read in the line `uint8_t tag = buffer[bufPos++]`
*   **Weaknesses:** Integer overflow leading to out-of-bounds read.
*   **Impact:** Segmentation fault (SEGV) and application crash.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted MMS `GetNameList` request to the server.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send network packets to the server.
*   **Affected versions:** libiec61850 version v1.4.0 and earlier.
*  **Additional Notes:** This vulnerability was identified with ASAN (AddressSanitizer). The provided PoC (`poc1` and `poc2`) triggers the issue.

**Vulnerability 2 (Related to issue #495):**

*   **Root Cause:** A null pointer dereference vulnerability in the `mmsServer_handleDeleteNamedVariableListRequest` function at `src/mms/iso_mms/server/mms_named_variable_list_service.c:146` that occurs due to invalid processing of the incoming buffer.
*   **Weaknesses:** Null pointer dereference.
*  **Impact:** Segmentation fault (SEGV) and application crash.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted MMS `DeleteNamedVariableList` request to the server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send network packets to the server.
*   **Affected versions:** All releases and any commit before commit `2823184`.
*  **Additional Notes:** The vulnerability is located in line 157 in the provided ASAN output.

It is important to note that the issues were discovered by the same user, and although the root causes differ, both vulnerabilities lead to the same effect, a segmentation fault and crash of the application.
