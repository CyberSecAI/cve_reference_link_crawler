  "CVE-2023-3758": {
    "description": "The System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) service provides a set of daemons to manage access to remote directories and authentication mechanisms. It also provides the Name Service Switch (NSS) and the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) interfaces toward the system, and a pluggable back-end system to connect to multiple different account sources.\n\nThere is a race condition during authorization which leads to GPO policies functioning inconsistently.",
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in SSSD where multiple concurrent access control requests can interfere with each other's intermediate results stored in the cache, leading to inconsistent application of GPO policies. Specifically, one request might overwrite the cache object with intermediate data while another request reads the cached data for access decisions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Inconsistent application of GPO policies"
    ],
    "impact": "Improper authorization issues can occur, leading to granting or denying access to resources inappropriately.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Concurrent access control requests"
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to initiate multiple access control requests simultaneously or in very close succession. No special privileges or network access are required. The vulnerability can be exploited by any authenticated user triggering this race condition.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability lies in how SSSD stores intermediate results during GPO policy evaluation. The fix involves storing these intermediate results in hash tables specific to each request, avoiding the race condition. The final result is then written to the cache for offline authentication."
