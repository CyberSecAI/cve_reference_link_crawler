### @sumit-bose **[sumit-bose](/sumit-bose)** commented [Apr 17, 2024](#issue-2247625500)

Currently after the evaluation of a single GPO file the intermediate

results are stored in the cache and this cache entry is updated until

all applicable GPO files are evaluated. Finally the data in the cache is

used to make the decision of access is granted or rejected.

If there are two or more access-control request running in parallel one

request might overwrite the cache object with intermediate data while

another request reads the cached data for the access decision and as a

result will do this decision based on intermediate data.

To avoid this the intermediate results are not stored in the cache

anymore but in hash tables which are specific to the request. Only the

final result is written to the cache to have it available for offline

authentication.

Sorry, something went wrong.
