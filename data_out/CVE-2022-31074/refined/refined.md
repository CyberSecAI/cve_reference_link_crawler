- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper handling of large HTTP request bodies, leading to excessive memory consumption and ultimately causing a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service, making the Cloud AdmissionController unavailable.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is sending an HTTP request with a large body to vulnerable endpoints in the Cloud AdmissionController.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An authenticated user is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Cloud AdmissionController.
