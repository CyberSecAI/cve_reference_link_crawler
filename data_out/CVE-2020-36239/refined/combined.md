**Missing Authentication for Ehcache RMI - CVE-2020-36239** **Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.

This is our assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

#### **Description**

Jira Data Center, Jira Core Data Center, Jira Software Data Center, and Jira Service Management Data Center exposed a Ehcache RMI network service which attackers, who can connect to the service, on port 40001 and potentially 40011**[0][1][2]**, could execute arbitrary code of their choice in Jira through deserialization due to a missing authentication vulnerability. While Atlassian strongly suggests restricting access to the Ehcache ports to only Data Center instances, fixed versions of Jira will now require a shared secret in order to allow access to the Ehcache service.

**[0]** In Jira Data Center, Jira Core Data Center, and Jira Software Data Center versions [prior to 7.13.1](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-66608), the Ehcache object port can be randomly allocated.

**[1]** In Jira Service Management Data Center versions [prior to 3.16.1](https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicemanagement/issues-resolved-in-3-16-1-965568942.html), the Ehcache object port can be randomly allocated.

**[2]** The default Ehcache port is 40001 but it can be configured to be on a different port, see [Installing JIRA Data Center](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/installing-jira-data-center-938846870.html#InstallingJiraDataCenter-parametersCluster.propertiesfileparameters) for more details.

The versions of Jira Data Center, Jira Core Data Center, and Jira Software Data Center **affected by this vulnerability** are:

* From version 6.3.0 before 8.5.16 (the fixed version for 8.5.x)
* From version 8.6.0 before 8.13.8 (the fixed version for 8.13.x)
* From version 8.14.0 before 8.17.0

The versions of Jira Service Management Data Center **affected by this vulnerability** are:

* From version 2.0.2 before 4.5.16 (the fixed version for 4.5.x)
* From version 4.6.0 before 4.13.8 (the fixed version for 4.13.x)
* From version 4.14.0 before 4.17.0

### **What You Need to Do**

Atlassian recommends that you upgrade to the latest version. We also recommend restricting access to the Ehcache RMI ports as per [these instructions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/installing-jira-data-center-938846870.html#InstallingJiraDataCenter-Security) & the information found below in the **Mitigation** section of this page. For a full description of the latest version, see the release notes for Jira Data Center [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracore/jira-core-release-notes-781386726.html), Jira Software Data Center [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftware/jira-software-release-notes-776821069.html), and Jira Service Management Data Center [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicemanagement/jira-service-management-release-notes-780083086.html). You can download the latest versions of Jira Data Center and Jira Service Management Data Center from the download center ([Jira Data Center](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/update) | [Jira Service Management Data Center](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-management/update)).

**Upgrade Jira Center to version 8.17.0 or higher.**

If you **cannot upgrade to 8.17.0, then upgrade to 8.5.16 or 8.13.8.**

**Upgrade Jira Service Management Data Center to version 4.17.0 or higher.**

If you **cannot upgrade to 4.17.0, then upgrade to 4.5.16 or 4.13.8.**

#### **Mitigation**

**Restrict access to the Ehcache RMI ports** to Jira Data Center, Jira Core Data Center, and Jira Software Data Center, and Jira Service Management Data Center **to only** **cluster instances** via the use of firewalls or similar technologies.

Data Center cluster nodes still need to be able to connect to other cluster nodes Ehcache ports.

In Jira Data Center, Jira Core Data Center, and Jira Software Data Center versions 7.13.1 and above ports that need to be restricted to cluster instances are:

* port 40001
* port 40011
* If you have changed from using the default Ehcache RMI ports as per [Installing JIRA Data Center](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/installing-jira-data-center-938846870.html#InstallingJiraDataCenter-parametersCluster.propertiesfileparameters), then you will need to restrict access to cluster instances to the specific ports that you have configured Ehcache RMI to use

In Jira Data Center, Jira Core Data Center, and Jira Software Data Center versions 7.13.0 [and below ports](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-66608) that need to be restricted to cluster instances are:

* port 40001
* port 40011
* ports in the range 1024-65536 (in version 7.3.1 and above you can apply the workaround detailed in <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-66608> to avoid needing to restrict access to these ports)
* If you have changed from using the default Ehcache RMI ports as per [Installing JIRA Data Center](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/installing-jira-data-center-938846870.html#InstallingJiraDataCenter-parametersCluster.propertiesfileparameters), then you will need to restrict access to cluster instances to the specific ports that you have configured Ehcache RMI to use

In Jira Service Management Data Center versions 3.16.1 and above ports that need to be restricted to cluster instances are:

* port 40001
* port 40011
* If you have changed from using the default Ehcache RMI ports as per [Installing JIRA Data Center](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/installing-jira-data-center-938846870.html#InstallingJiraDataCenter-parametersCluster.propertiesfileparameters), then you will need to restrict access to cluster instances to the specific ports that you have configured Ehcache RMI to use

In Jira Service Management Data Center versions 3.16.0 [and below ports](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-66608) that need to be restricted are:

* port 40001
* port 40011
* ports in the range 1024-65536 (in version 3.3.1 and above you can apply the workaround detailed in <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-66608> to avoid needing to restrict access to these ports)
* If you have changed from using the default Ehcache RMI ports as per [Installing JIRA Data Center](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/installing-jira-data-center-938846870.html#InstallingJiraDataCenter-parametersCluster.propertiesfileparameters), then you will need to restrict access to cluster instances to the specific ports that you have configured Ehcache RMI to use

### Description

### Issue Summary

Jira Data Center, Jira Core Data Center, Jira Software Data Center, and Jira Service Management Data Center exposed a Ehcache RMI network service which attackers, who can connect to the service, on port 40001 and potentially 40011 [0][1][2], could execute arbitrary code of their choice in Jira through deserialization due to a missing authentication vulnerability. While Atlassian strongly suggests restricting access to the Ehcache ports to only Data Center instances, fixed versions of Jira will now require a shared secret in order to allow access to the Ehcache service.

**[0]** In Jira Data Center, Jira Core Data Center, and Jira Software Data Center versions prior to 7.13.1, the Ehcache object port can be randomly allocated.

**[1]** In Jira Service Management Data Center versions prior to 3.16.1, the Ehcache object port can be randomly allocated.

**[2]** The default Ehcache port is 40001 but it can be configured to be on a different port, see [Installing JIRA Data Center](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/installing-jira-data-center-938846870.html#InstallingJiraDataCenter-parametersCluster.propertiesfileparameters) for more details.

**Affected versions:**

* From version 6.3.0 before 8.5.16 (the fixed version for 8.5.x)
* From version 8.6.0 before 8.13.8 (the fixed version for 8.13.x)
* From version 8.14.0 before 8.17.0

The versions of Jira Service Management Data Center affected by this vulnerability are:

* From version 2.0.2 before 4.5.16 (the fixed version for 4.5.x)
