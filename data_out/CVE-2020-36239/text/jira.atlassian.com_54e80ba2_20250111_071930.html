### Description

### Issue Summary

Jira Data Center, Jira Core Data Center, Jira Software Data Center, and Jira Service Management Data Center exposed a Ehcache RMI network service which attackers, who can connect to the service, on port 40001 and potentially 40011 [0][1][2], could execute arbitrary code of their choice in Jira through deserialization due to a missing authentication vulnerability. While Atlassian strongly suggests restricting access to the Ehcache ports to only Data Center instances, fixed versions of Jira will now require a shared secret in order to allow access to the Ehcache service.

**[0]** In Jira Data Center, Jira Core Data Center, and Jira Software Data Center versions prior to 7.13.1, the Ehcache object port can be randomly allocated.

**[1]** In Jira Service Management Data Center versions prior to 3.16.1, the Ehcache object port can be randomly allocated.

**[2]** The default Ehcache port is 40001 but it can be configured to be on a different port, see [Installing JIRA Data Center](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/installing-jira-data-center-938846870.html#InstallingJiraDataCenter-parametersCluster.propertiesfileparameters) for more details.
