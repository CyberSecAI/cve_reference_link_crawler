Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause is improper handling of user-supplied input in the `status` parameter of the `article.do` endpoint, leading to SQL injection. Specifically, the application uses string concatenation to build the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct inclusion of the `status` parameter into the SQL query.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization**: The application fails to sanitize the input received via the `status` parameter before using it in the SQL query.
    *   **String Concatenation for SQL Query Building:** The code uses string concatenation instead of prepared statements or parameterized queries, making it susceptible to SQL injection.

*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   **Data Breach**: Extract sensitive information from the database.
    *   **Data Modification**: Modify or delete data within the database.
    *   **Authentication Bypass**: Circumvent authentication mechanisms by manipulating SQL queries.
    *   **Denial of Service**: Cause application downtime by executing resource-intensive queries.
    *   **Full system compromise**: In severe cases, if database user permissions are high enough, complete system compromise.

*  **Attack vectors**:
    *   **HTTP GET Request**: The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted GET request to the `/admin/article.do` endpoint.
    *   **Status Parameter**: The `status` parameter within the URL is the injection point.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application.
    *   **Basic HTTP knowledge**: Ability to craft HTTP requests.
    *   **SQL Injection Knowledge**:  Understanding of SQL syntax and how to perform SQL injection.
    *   **Authentication**: An attacker would need to be logged into the admin panel of MRCMS.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in the `ArticleService.java` file within the `org.marker.mushroom.service.impl` package.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability using the `extractvalue` function to extract database user information.
*   The application does not sanitize the `status` parameter before inserting it into the SQL query, making it susceptible to SQL injection.
*  The specific vulnerable line of code is:
    ```java
        sql +=  "where a.status in ("+status+") ";
    ```
    This code directly concatenates the unsanitized `status` parameter into the SQL query string.
