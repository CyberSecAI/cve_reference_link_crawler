  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2024-31985",
    "description": "It is possible to schedule/trigger/unschedule existing jobs by having an admin visit the Job Scheduler page through a predictable URL, for example by embedding such an URL in any content as an image.",
    "affected_versions": ">= 3.1, < 14.10.19\n>= 15.0-rc-1, < 15.5.4\n>= 15.6-rc-1, < 15.9",
    "patched_versions": "14.10.19\n15.5.4\n15.9",
    "root_cause": "The XWiki job scheduler did not validate CSRF tokens before performing actions, allowing attackers to trigger unintended job operations through crafted URLs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-352"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can schedule, trigger, pause, resume, or unschedule existing jobs by tricking an administrator into visiting a malicious URL. This could potentially lead to denial of service or other unintended consequences.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can craft a malicious URL and deliver it to a victim through various means (e.g., embedding it in an image or a link).",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any special privileges; however, they do need to target an administrator user. They also need the ability to craft malicious URLs and get an administrator to visit them."
