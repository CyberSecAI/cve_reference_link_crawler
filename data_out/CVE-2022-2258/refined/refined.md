Based on the provided advisory, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Incorrect Privilege Assignment. The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Octopus Deploy handles permissions related to viewing Tagsets. Users were able to view Tagsets without having the explicit permissions to do so.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core vulnerability is an "Incorrect Privilege Assignment" issue, leading to "Information Exposure". This means that the system failed to enforce proper access controls, resulting in unauthorized access to Tagset data.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The impact of this vulnerability is that a user can view Tagsets even if they haven't been explicitly granted permission to do so. This results in unauthorized access to information.
*  **Attack Vectors:** An authenticated user can view Tagsets without being explicitly assigned permissions.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Octopus Deploy server.

In summary, the vulnerability is a broken access control issue that allowed users to view information they were not supposed to see.
