- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient verification of data authenticity in FortiOS and FortiProxy SSL-VPN tunnel mode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  An authenticated VPN user can send crafted network packets, spoofing the IP address of another user. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to  CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An authenticated VPN user can send packets appearing to originate from a different user. This could potentially be used to bypass network access controls or perform other malicious activities. However, the attacker cannot receive the spoofed packets.
- **Attack vectors:**  Crafted network packets sent by an authenticated SSL-VPN user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the SSL-VPN tunnel mode.
