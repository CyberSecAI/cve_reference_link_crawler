- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the System Management Mode (SMM) of the Dell Edge Gateway BIOS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could lead to the exposure of code within the SMM, resulting in arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local authenticated user with high privileges.
