  "CVE-2023-30806": {
    "Description": "The Sangfor Next-Gen Application Firewall (NGAF) version 8.0.17.364, available on AWS, is vulnerable to OS command injection via the PHPSESSID cookie. The vulnerability exists in the login process of the device's web interface.",
    "Root cause": "The application uses a cookie value, specifically PHPSESSID, in an echo command that is executed via a shell without proper sanitization. The backtick characters are not filtered, which allows for command injection.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "OS Command Injection",
       "Authentication Bypass",
       "Local File Read",
       "Source Code Disclosure",
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands on the underlying system. This could lead to complete compromise of the firewall appliance.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "HTTP request to the login page (port 4433)",
       "HTTP request to a PHP file (port 85)"
       ],
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker does not need authentication and can perform the attack by sending a crafted HTTP request. The attacker also needs to send a malicious value via the `PHPSESSID` cookie or the username parameter."
