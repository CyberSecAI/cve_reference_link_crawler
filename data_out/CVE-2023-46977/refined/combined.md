# TOTOLINK LR1200GB V9.1.0u.6619\_B20230130 Stack Overflow

## Product Information

Product: TOTOLINK LR1200GB
Firmware Version: V9.1.0u.6619\_B20230130

## Analysis

`v3` obtains the value from the `password` field input by the user and is processed in function `urldecode` . The processed result is stored in `v33` on stack.

[![image-20231028054948914](/shinypolaris/vuln-reports/raw/master/TOTOLINK%20LR1200GB/1/uploads/image-20231028054948914.png)](/shinypolaris/vuln-reports/blob/master/TOTOLINK%20LR1200GB/1/uploads/image-20231028054948914.png)

As shown in the two images below, in the function `urldecode`, the processed `password` (`a1`) is written to a buffer (`a2`, `v3`) located on the stack. **However, there is no validation to check if the `password` (`a1`) exceeds the length of the buffer (`a2`, `v3`).** Therefore, attackers can hijack the program or cause a DDoS attack by carefully constructing data.
