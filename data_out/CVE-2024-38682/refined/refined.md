Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-supplied data within the "Post Layouts for Gutenberg" WordPress plugin. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A malicious actor can inject scripts into the website.
*   These scripts can be used for various purposes, including redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads.
*   The injected scripts will be executed when website guests visit the site.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts via user-supplied data. The specific method of injection isn't detailed, but it would involve manipulating input fields or parameters processed by the vulnerable plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the privileges of a "Contributor" on the WordPress website, which suggests the vulnerability might be exploitable by users with limited permissions, or via an unauthenticated method.
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the application, by manipulating input data processed by the vulnerable plugin.
