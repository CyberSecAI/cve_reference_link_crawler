Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5258

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw located in the `/resource/addgood.php` file of RapidCMS Dev.1.3.1.
- The system does not properly validate user input for the `id` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- Specifically, the attacker can use double quotes to splice SQL statements, thereby manipulating the intended SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate the input provided for the `id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- This can lead to:
    - **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    - **Integrity Violation:** Modification or deletion of data.
    - **Availability Issues:** Denial of service through database manipulation or crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted POST request to `/resource/addgood.php`.
- **`id` Parameter Manipulation:** The `id` parameter in the POST data is used to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server.
- No authentication is mentioned as being required in the provided content, thus making this vulnerability easier to exploit.
- Knowledge of SQL syntax and techniques for injection is necessary to exploit the vulnerability effectively.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker uses techniques like adding `*` and double quotes in the `id` parameter to execute malicious SQL queries.
- The provided exploit example shows how to use `sqlmap` to automate the process.
- A time-based blind SQL injection payload is used to confirm the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was disclosed on September 29, 2023.
- A proof-of-concept exploit is publicly available.
- The vulnerability is tracked as [VDB-240867] on VulDB.
- The related issue on Github is present in two repositories:
  -  [yhy217/rapidcms-vul#4](https://github.com/yhy217/rapidcms-vul/issues/4)
  - [OpenRapid/rapidcms#9](https://github.com/OpenRapid/rapidcms/issues/9)

**Remediation:**
- The recommended fix is to implement proper input validation and sanitization or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
