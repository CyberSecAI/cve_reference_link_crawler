In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Check num_valid_sets before accessing reader_wm_sets[]

[WHY & HOW]
num_valid_sets needs to be checked to avoid a negative index when
accessing reader_wm_sets[num_valid_sets - 1].

This fixes an OVERRUN issue reported by Coverity.
