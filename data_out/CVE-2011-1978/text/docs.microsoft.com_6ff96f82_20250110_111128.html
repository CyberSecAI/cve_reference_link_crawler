# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-069 - Moderate

## Vulnerability in .NET Framework Could Allow Information Disclosure (2567951)

Published: August 09, 2011 | Updated: October 26, 2011

**Version:** 1.2

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft .NET Framework. The vulnerability could allow information disclosure if a user views a specially crafted Web page using a Web browser that can run XAML Browser Applications (XBAPs). In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. This vulnerability could also be used by Windows .NET applications to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions.

This security update is rated Moderate for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1, and Microsoft .NET Framework 4 on all supported editions of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the .NET Framework validates the trust level within the System.Net.Sockets namespace. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was this bulletin revised on August 23, 2011?**

Microsoft revised this security bulletin to announce a detection change in the package metadata for KB2539636 to correct an issue with installation return codes. This is a detection change only. Customers who have already successfully updated their systems do not need to take any action.

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**How do I determine which** **version of the Microsoft .NET Framework is installed?**

You can install and run multiple versions of the .NET Framework on a system, and you can install the versions in any order. There are several ways to determine which versions of the .NET Framework are currently installed. For more information, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 318785](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785).

**What is the difference between .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile?**

The .NET Framework version 4 redistributable packages are available in two profiles: .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. The .NET Framework 4 Client Profile is a subset of the .NET Framework 4 profile that is optimized for client applications. It provides functionality for most client applications, including Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Forms, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and ClickOnce features. This enables faster deployment and a smaller install package for applications that target the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. For more information, see the MSDN article, [.NET Framework Client Profile](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc656912.aspx).

**Is this security update related to MS11-066?**

No. Although both of these security updates affect the .NET Framework, the updates affect different components within the .NET Framework and are not related. These updates may be applied in any order.

**I have .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installed. Do I need to install** **any additional updates?**

This bulletin describes a vulnerability in the .NET Framework 2.0 feature layer and the .NET Framework 4. The .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installer chains in both the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 setup and the .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 setup. Therefore, customers who have .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installed also need to install security updates for .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) Web site.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Lifecycle Supported Service Packs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) Web site, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169557).

## Socket Restriction Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1978

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way that .NET Framework improperly validates the trust level within the System.Net.Sockets namespace. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would be able to access information not intended to be exposed. Additionally, this vulnerability could be used by an attacker to direct network traffic from a victim's system to other network resources the victim can access. This could allow an attacker to perform a denial of service to any system the victim's system can access or use the victim's system to perform scanning of network resources available to the victim. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to produce information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-1978](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-1978).

#### Mitigating Factors for Socket Restriction Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1978

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode mitigates this vulnerability only on Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2, and only in a Web-based attack scenario. See the FAQ section of this vulnerability for more information about Internet [Explorer Enhanced Security](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039) Configuration.
* In a Web-hosting scenario, an attacker must have permission to upload arbitrary ASP.NET pages to a Web site and ASP.NET must be installed on that Web server. In default configuration, an anonymous user cannot upload and run Microsoft .NET code on an Internet Information Server (IIS).
* Customers who have installed [KB2562394](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2562394) cannot be exploited without user interaction. This update, made available through [MS11-044](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=216436), prevents ClickOnce applications in the Internet zone from executing without prompting the user. Customers who have not installed [KB2562394](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2562394) will not receive a dialog box if the application is not using any more than Internet-only permissions. See [KB2562394](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2562394) for further information on this feature.

#### Workarounds for Socket Restriction Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1978

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable XAML browser applications in Internet Explorer**

  To help protect against this vulnerability, change your settings to prompt before running XAML browser applications (XBAPs) or to disable XBAPs in the Internet and Local intranet security zones as follows:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click the **Tools** menu and then select **Internet Options**.
  2. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **Loose XAML**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  3. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **XAML browser applications**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  4. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **XPS documents**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. On the **Security** tab, click **Custom level**. Under **.NET Framework-reliant components**, set **Run components not signed with Authenticode** to either **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**. Repeat this step for **Run components signed with Authenticode**, and then click **OK**.
  6. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**. Repeat steps 3 and 4. If you are prompted to confirm that you want to change these settings, click **Yes**. Click **OK** to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of workaround.** Microsoft .NET code will not run in Internet Explorer or will not run without prompting. Disabling Microsoft .NET applications and components in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security** **settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click the **Tools** menu, and then select **Internet Options**.
  2. Click the **Security** tab, click **Reset all zones to default level**, and then click **OK**.

#### FAQ for Socket Restriction Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1978

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would be able to access information not intended to be exposed. Additionally, this vulnerability could be used by an attacker to direct network traffic from a victim's system to other network resources the victim can access. This could allow an attacker to perform a denial of service to any system the victim's system can access or use the victim's system to perform scanning of network resources available to the victim.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused when the .NET Framework improperly validates the trust level within the System.Net.Sockets namespace.

**Whatis the System.Net.Sockets Namespace?**

The System.Net.Sockets namespace within the .NET Framework provides a managed implementation of the Windows Sockets (Winsock) interface for developers who need to tightly control access to the network. For more information, see the MSDN article, [System.Net.Sockets Namespace](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/sb27wehh.aspx).

**What is an XAML Browser Application (XBAP)?**

An XAML browser application (XBAP) combines features of both a Web application and a rich-client application. Like Web applications, XBAPs can be published to a Web server and launched from Internet Explorer. Like rich-client applications, XBAPs can take advantage of the capabilities of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). For more information about XBAPs, see MSDN article, [Windows Presentation Foundation XAML Browser Applications Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa970060.aspx).

**What are .NET Framework Code Access Security (CAS) Restrictions?**

The .NET Framework provides a security mechanism called code access security to help protect computer systems from malicious mobile code, to allow code from unknown origins to run with protection, and to help prevent trusted code from intentionally or accidentally compromising security. Code access security (CAS) enables code to be trusted to varying degrees depending on where the code originates and on other aspects of the code's identity. Code access security also enforces the varying levels of trust on code, which minimizes the amount of code that must be fully trusted in order to run. Using code access security can reduce the likelihood that your code will be misused by malicious or error-filled code. For more information on CAS, see the MSDN article, [Code Access Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c5tk9z76.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would be able to access information not intended to be exposed. Additionally, this vulnerability could be used by an attacker to direct network traffic from a victim's system to other network resources the victim can access. This could allow an attacker to perform a denial of service to any system the victim's system can access or use the victim's system to perform scanning of network resources available to the victim. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to produce information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are three scenarios possible for exploiting this vulnerability: a Web browsing scenario, a Web hosting scenario, and a Windows .NET application bypass of Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions. These scenarios are described as follows:

* **Web browsing scenario**
  An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that contains a specially crafted XBAP (XAML browser application) that could exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the Web site. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.
* **Web hosting scenario**
  If a Web hosting environment allows users to upload custom ASP.NET applications, an attacker could upload a malicious ASP.NET application that uses this vulnerability to break out of the sandbox used to prevent ASP.NET code from performing harmful actions on the server system.
* **Windows .NET applications**
  This vulnerability could also be used by Windows .NET applications to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions.

**What systems** **are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

There are three types of systems at risk from this vulnerability, described as follows: systems that are using the Web browsing scenario, systems that are using the Web hosting scenario, and systems that are using the Windows .NET applications scenario.

* **Web browsing scenario**
  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and is visiting Web sites using a Web browser capable of instantiating XBAPs. Therefore, any systems where a Web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read e-mail on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
* **Web hosting scenario**
  Web hosting sites that allow users to upload custom ASP.NET applications are at increased risk.
* **Windows .NET applications**
  Workstations and server that run untrusted Windows .NET applications are also at risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the .NET Framework validates the trust level within the System.Net.Sockets namespace.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Server 2003 (all editions)

**Reference Table**

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

| **Restart Requirement** |  |
| Restart required? | This update does not require a restart. The installer stops the required services, applies the update, and then restarts the services. However, if the required services cannot be stopped for any reason, or if required files are being used, this update will require a restart. If this behavior occurs, a message appears that advises you to restart. |
| HotPatching | Not applicable. |
| **Removal Information** | To uninstall an update installed by WUSA, use the /Uninstall setup switch or click **Control Panel**, click **System and** **Security**, and then under Windows Update, click **View installed updates** and select from the list of updates. |
| **File Information** | See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2567951](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2567951) |
| **Registry Key Verification** | **Note** A registry key does not exist to validate the presence of this update. |

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

Supported Security Update Installation Switches

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?, /h, /help** | Displays help on supported switches. |
| **/quiet** | Suppresses the display of status or error messages. |
| **/norestart** | When combined with **/quiet**, the system will not be restarted after installation even if a restart is required to complete installation. |
| **/warnrestart:<seconds>** | When combined with **/quiet**, the installer will warn the user before initiating restart. |
| **/promptrestart** | When combined with **/quiet**, the installer will prompt before initiating restart. |
| **/forcerestart** | When combined with **/quiet**, the installer will forcefully close applications and initiate restart. |
| **/log:<file name>** | Enables logging to specified file. |
| **/extract:<destination>** | Extracts the package contents to the destination folder. |
| **/uninstall /kb:<KB Number>** | Uninstalls the security update. |

**Note** For more information about the wusa.exe installer, see "Windows Update Stand-alone Installer" in the TechNet article, [Miscellaneous Changes in Windows 7](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd871148%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
