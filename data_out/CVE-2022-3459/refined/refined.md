Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the WooCommerce Multiple Free Gift plugin lacking sufficient server-side validation of products that can be added as a free gift.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Server-Side Validation:** The plugin does not properly verify if a product is actually designated as a free gift before allowing it to be added to the cart as such. This lack of validation allows manipulation of the cart using arbitrary product IDs.
- **Authorization Bypass:** This insufficient validation leads to an authorization bypass, allowing unauthenticated users to add non-gift items to their cart as a free gift.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can add non-free products to their cart as if they were free gifts. This could result in a loss of revenue for the website owner. The impact is limited to a change in data (free product added) rather than access to data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via network access. 
- The specific method of attack is through manipulating the data sent to the server when adding a free gift to a user's cart

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- They need to be able to send requests to the server.
