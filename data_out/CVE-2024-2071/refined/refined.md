Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The FAQ Management System fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within POST parameters before storing it in the database. Specifically, when updating or adding FAQs, user input is not sanitized leading to stored XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the context of the user's browser when they view the page containing the injected code, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Cookie theft
  - Defacement of the website
  - Redirection to malicious websites
  - Data theft

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code via a POST request when managing FAQs.
- Specifically, the `Manage FAQ` and `Update FAQ` functionalities are vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to access the FAQ management section of the application and the ability to create or edit FAQs. This likely requires user authentication with appropriate permissions.
