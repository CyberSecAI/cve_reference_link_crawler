### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the 'url' parameter of the theme's Button shortcode.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Impact of exploitation
- An authenticated attacker with Contributor-level access or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.

### Attack vectors
- The attacker injects malicious code through the 'url' parameter of the `[button]` shortcode.
- The injected code is stored in the database and executed when a user visits the page containing the shortcode.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least Contributor-level access to WordPress.
- The attacker needs the ability to add/edit content using the shortcode functionality.
