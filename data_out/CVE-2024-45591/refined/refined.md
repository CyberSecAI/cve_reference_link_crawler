Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper permission checks in the REST API endpoints responsible for retrieving page history. Specifically, the `PageHistoryResourceImpl.getPageHistory` and `PageTranslationHistoryResourceImpl.getPageTranslationHistory` methods did not enforce authorization checks before exposing page history information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the absence of authorization checks before returning page history data through the REST API. This allows unauthorized users to access sensitive information.
*   **Information Exposure:** The REST API endpoints disclosed the following information for each page modification: modification time, version number, author (username and display name), and version comments. This information was exposed even when the wiki was configured as fully private.
*   **CWE-359**:  This vulnerability falls under the category of "Improperly Scoped Permissions", indicating that access control is not appropriately enforced.
*   **CWE-862**: This vulnerability also falls under the category of "Missing Authorization", further emphasizing the lack of access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker, even without an account, can retrieve the history of any page if they know its name, potentially exposing sensitive information about the page's content and modifications. This includes the identities of the users who have modified the page.
*   **Bypass Access Controls:** The vulnerability allows bypassing configured access rights, granting unauthorized access even on private wikis.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The attack is conducted over the network through the REST API endpoints.
*   **Direct Request:** The attacker crafts a specific HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoints (`/xwiki/rest/wikis/{wikiName}/spaces/{spaceName:.+}/pages/{pageName}/history` or `/xwiki/rest/wikis/{wikiName}/spaces/{spaceName:.+}/pages/{pageName}/translations/{language}/history`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No privileges required:** The attacker does not need any user account or special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Page Name:** The only requirement is that the attacker must know the name of the page for which they wish to access the history, including the space and wiki in which it resides.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the XWiki instance to send REST API requests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in XWiki versions 1.8 to before 15.10.9 and versions 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.3.0-rc-1.
*   The fix was implemented in XWiki versions 15.10.9 and 16.3.0-rc-1.
*   The provided GitHub commits (9cbca98 and 26482ee) contain the code changes to address this vulnerability. These include adding access control checks and unit tests for the fix.
*   There were no known workarounds other than upgrading to a patched version.
