Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of restrictions on file uploads in the `/Employee/edit-photo.php` file of the SourceCodester Prison Management System 1.0. Specifically, the application does not properly validate the file type or content being uploaded.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows users to upload files without proper validation or sanitization. This means an attacker can potentially upload any type of file, including malicious ones.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious file (e.g., a PHP script), an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to complete compromise of the server and the application's data.
*   **System takeover:** Successful RCE would allow the attacker to perform a range of malicious actions, including but not limited to data exfiltration, data manipulation, or installing backdoors.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the `/Employee/edit-photo.php` script.
*   The attacker exploits the `$_FILES['userImage']['tmp_name']` parameter, which is used to handle the uploaded file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the file upload functionality within the `/Employee/edit-photo.php` script, which likely requires being logged in or be able to reach this functionality without authentication.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious file.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is an unrestricted file upload in the SourceCodester Prison Management System 1.0, which can lead to Remote Code Execution. An attacker can upload any type of file via the `$_FILES['userImage']['tmp_name']` parameter in `/Employee/edit-photo.php` and execute code on the server.
