proxy: fix off-by-one if \r is missing

```
A bunch of the parser assumed we only had \r\n, but I didn't actually
have that strictness set. Some commands worked and some broke in subtle
ways when just "\n" was being submitted.

I'm not 100% confident in this change yet so I'm opening a PR to stage
it while I run some more thorough tests.
```
