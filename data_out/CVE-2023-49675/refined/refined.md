{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The CODESYS Development System V2.3 does not properly validate project files, allowing the loading of corrupt project files which can lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code or crash the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Opening a maliciously crafted project file on a system with a vulnerable version of CODESYS Development System V2.3.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into opening a malicious project file.  The attacker can be local but does not need authentication."
