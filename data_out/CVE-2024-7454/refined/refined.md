Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization when handling the `patient_name` parameter in the `patients.php` file of the Clinic's Patient Management System. The application directly incorporates this user-controlled parameter into an SQL query without any restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is SQL injection. The application fails to sanitize the `patient_name` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database. This could include patient records, personal details, and potentially other confidential data.
- **Database Manipulation:** An attacker might also be able to modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP POST request to the `patients.php` file.
- **`patient_name` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `patient_name` parameter within the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameter which is `patient_name`.
- **Ability to craft HTTP POST requests:** The attacker should have the ability to craft and send malicious HTTP POST requests.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates the SQL injection via an HTTP POST request, where the `patient_name` parameter includes the malicious payload `22*`.
- The vulnerable code is in `/pms/patients.php`, where the `patient_name` parameter is directly used in an SQL query.

**Additional notes:**
- The content provides a clear description of the vulnerability, the affected file (`patients.php`), and the vulnerable parameter (`patient_name`).
- It also includes a POC, demonstrating how an attacker can inject SQL code to trigger the vulnerability.
