**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `poller_list` shortcode in the LiquidPoll plugin does not properly check the post status of polls before displaying them, leading to the exposure of private poll information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Exposure: The plugin exposes sensitive information (private poll data) to unauthorized users.
- Insufficient Access Control: The plugin fails to verify if the user has permission to view the poll.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with contributor-level access or higher can extract information from polls that are intended to be private.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `poller_list` shortcode.
- Attackers must be authenticated users (with contributor-level access or above).
- The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network via a web request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least contributor-level access.
- The attacker needs to be able to insert the `poller_list` shortcode on a post or page to trigger the vulnerability.
