Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22482:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Uninitialized variable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from an uninitialized variable. This means that the variable might contain arbitrary data, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation may result in the transmission of invalid data. This could lead to unexpected application behavior, data corruption, or other issues. The impact is considered relatively low.

**Attack vectors:** The specific attack vector is not detailed in the description but it is inferred that the vulnerability can be triggered through normal system operations or by specific API calls that involve the vulnerable variable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker would likely need to have the ability to interact with the system in a way that triggers the use of the uninitialized variable. This could involve having a malicious app or by manipulating system calls.

**Affected versions:**
* EMUI 11.0.0
* Magic UI 4.0.0
