Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation when processing the `obsidian://` URI scheme, specifically the `hook-get-address` action. The application uses `window.open` to open the provided URI without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or sanitize the URI passed to `window.open`, allowing arbitrary URIs to be opened.
*   **Arbitrary URI Handling:** The application directly uses the provided URI, including the `x-success` parameter, without proper checks or restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can achieve RCE by crafting a malicious URI that includes the `file://` protocol to execute local binaries or utilize remote locations to execute binaries (e.g., `\\samba server\shares\shellcode.exe`).
*   Attackers can use other protocols like `sftp://`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HTML:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTML file containing an iframe with a specially crafted `obsidian://` URI.
*   **Web Browser Interaction:** The victim needs to open the malicious HTML file in a web browser.
*   **User Interaction:** The browser may prompt the user to confirm opening the Obsidian application. The user must agree to proceed for the exploit to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to create and host the malicious HTML file on a server accessible to the victim.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to entice the user to open the malicious HTML file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to the developers, and they addressed it in version 0.15.5.
*   The provided CVSS v3.1 score is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, which indicates a high severity vulnerability.

The provided information confirms and expands on the nature of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-36450, which is related to improper input validation leading to potential remote code execution.
