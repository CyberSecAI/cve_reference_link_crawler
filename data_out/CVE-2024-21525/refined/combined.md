### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

#### Introduced: 20 Feb 2024

[CVE-2024-21525  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21525) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-703  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/703.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `node-twain`.

## Overview

[node-twain](https://www.npmjs.org/package/node-twain) is an A TWAIN library for nodejs.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions due to the length of the source data not being checked. Creating a new `twain.TwainSDK` with a `productName` or `productFamily`, `manufacturer`, `version.info` property of length >= 34 chars leads to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

8.3 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**

# Information

**Package:** [node-twain](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-twain)

**Tested Version:** `0.0.16`

**GitHub Repository:** <https://github.com/luomusha/node-twain>

**Vulnerability:** Buffer Overflow

# Details

Creating a new `twain.TwainSDK` with a `productName` (or `productFamily`, `manufacturer`, `version.info`) property of length >= `34` chars leads to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The `char *dest` in `strcpy` has a length `34`, and the length of the source data is not checked.

* Data read from user input: <https://github.com/Luomusha/node-twain/blob/3b592a1bc9bce3f80855608451e3c40b8387a007/src/TwainSDK.cpp#L12-L30>

```
    ...
    Napi::String versionInfo = version.Get("info").As<Napi::String>();
    Napi::String productName = configure.Get("productName").As<Napi::String>();
    Napi::String productFamily = configure.Get("productFamily").As<Napi::String>();
    Napi::String manufacturer = configure.Get("manufacturer").As<Napi::String>();
    ...
    TW_IDENTITY identity;
    strcpy((char *) identity.Version.Info, versionInfo.Utf8Value().c_str());
    strcpy((char *) identity.ProductName, productName.Utf8Value().c_str());
    strcpy((char *) identity.ProductFamily, productFamily.Utf8Value().c_str());
    strcpy((char *) identity.Manufacturer, manufacturer.Utf8Value().c_str());
    ...
```
