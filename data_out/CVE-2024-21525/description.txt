All versions of the package node-twain are vulnerable to Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions due to the length of the source data not being checked. Creating a new twain.TwainSDK with a productName or productFamily, manufacturer, version.info property of length >= 34 chars leads to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
