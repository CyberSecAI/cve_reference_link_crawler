Avada <=7.11.4 / Fusion-Builder <= 3.11.4 Improper Access Control

# Avada <=7.11.4 / Fusion-Builder <= 3.11.4 Improper Access Control

Exploit Author: Muhammad Zeeshan (Xib3rR4dAr)

### Description

In Avada theme, fusion-builder plugin is required for operation and allows contributor users to add forms. It is found that contributor users can view form submissions for forms that are created by other users or admin users by visiting /wp-admin/admin.php?page=avada-forms.

## Fix

Less privileged users should not be allowed to view submissions of forms created by other users or admin users.

The Avada | Website Builder For WordPress & WooCommerce theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in versions up to and including 7.11.5 via the form entries page. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to view the contents of all form submissions, including fields that are obfuscated (such as the contact form's "password" field).
