Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from improper access control within the Avada theme's form submission handling. Specifically, the Fusion Builder plugin, which is required for Avada's operation, allows users with "contributor" level access or higher to view all form submissions. This includes submissions to forms they didn't create and even those created by administrators.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Access Control:** The primary weakness is that the plugin doesn't properly restrict access to form submission data based on user roles or form ownership.
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Contributor-level users can access sensitive data from form submissions, including fields that are meant to be obscured, such as password fields in contact forms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers (contributor-level users) can gain unauthorized access to potentially sensitive information submitted through forms. This information may include personal data, passwords, or other private details.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is accessible through the WordPress admin panel (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=avada-forms`).
*   **Authentication Required:** An attacker needs to have at least "contributor" level access to a WordPress site using the vulnerable Avada theme and Fusion Builder plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **WordPress Account:** The attacker must have a valid WordPress account with at least the "contributor" role.
*   **Access to Admin Panel:** The attacker needs to be able to log in to the WordPress admin panel.

**Affected Software:**
*   Avada theme versions up to and including 7.11.5
*   Fusion Builder plugin versions up to and including 3.11.4

**Patched Version:**
*   Avada theme version 7.11.6
*  Wordfence indicates patch in 7.11.6, github gist indicates 3.11.4 for the builder plugin which may not be the same as the theme version.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Muhammad Zeeshan (Xib3rR4dAr).
*   The Wordfence analysis provides a CVSS score of 6.5 (Medium), with the vector string indicating the attacker does not need any special interaction (UI:N), the attack can be done via network access (AV:N), and the impact is high regarding confidentiality (C:H).
