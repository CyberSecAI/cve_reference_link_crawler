*   **CWE:** CWE-79
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution
*   **Severity:** Important
*  **CVSS Score:** 5.4
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Network-based (AV:N)

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

**Explanation:**
The vulnerability is a Stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is injected and stored within the application, and then executed when a user interacts with it. The attacker needs to have low privileges to inject the malicious script. The user must then trigger the execution of the script with a user interaction. A successful exploit can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the user's session.
