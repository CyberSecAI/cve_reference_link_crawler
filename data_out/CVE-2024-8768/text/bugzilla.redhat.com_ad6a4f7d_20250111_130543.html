| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2311895#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-09-12 11:13:07 UTC  ``` A completions API request with an empty prompt will crash the vllm API server.  The impact is limited based on what model is being served. * Serving gpt2 is affected. * Most models are not affected, as vllm will prepend tokens to the prompt, avoiding the problematic code.  <https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/commit/e25fee57c2e69161bd261f5986dc5aeb198bbd42>   ``` |  |
