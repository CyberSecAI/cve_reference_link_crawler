Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8768

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the vLLM (a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference engine for LLMs) API server. Specifically, the server crashes when it receives a completion API request with an empty prompt.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Input Validation:** The core issue is that the vLLM engine does not properly handle empty prompts. It proceeds to process the request, leading to an assertion error deep within the scheduling logic.
- **Assertion Failure:** The assertion `num_new_tokens > 0` in the `_get_num_new_tokens` function of the scheduler is triggered when the prompt is empty, because no new tokens can be generated. This causes the server to crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Sending a request with an empty prompt causes the vLLM API server to crash, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
- **Server Instability:**  The crash is not isolated to the specific request but leads to the termination of the server's background task, requiring a restart.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **API Request:** The attack vector involves sending a malicious API request to the `/v1/completions` endpoint of the vLLM server, with an empty string as the prompt.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the vLLM server to send the malicious API request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the API endpoint of the vLLM server over the network.
- **API Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of the vLLM API and how to structure a request with an empty prompt.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was identified and fixed in [pull request #7746](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/7746).
- The fix involves adding validation to the input prompts, checking for emptiness before the request enters the core processing logic. Specifically, the validation was moved to the `add_request` function to check if the prompt is empty before further processing.
- The fix also includes unit tests to ensure that empty prompts are rejected with an appropriate error message (400 Bad Request).
- The vulnerability primarily affects scenarios where the model does not prepend tokens to the prompt. For example, using gpt2 models without prepending tokens would trigger the vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**
- Applying the fix from [pull request #7746](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/7746) resolves this vulnerability.
- Ensuring input validation is in place to check that prompts are not empty.
