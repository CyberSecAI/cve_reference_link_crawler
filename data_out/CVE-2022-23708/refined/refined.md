Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23708:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Elasticsearch's upgrade assistant. When upgrading from version 6.x to 7.x (specifically to versions 7.16.0 through 7.17.0), the upgrade process inadvertently disables built-in protections on the security index.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Incorrect Security Settings:** The upgrade process incorrectly disables security protections on the security index.
-   **Privilege Escalation:**  Authenticated users with "\*" index permissions, which are normally insufficient to access the security index, gain unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:**  Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information contained within the security index due to unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable (AV:N).
-   **Authenticated Access:** Requires an authenticated user to exploit this vulnerability (PR:L)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials for an Elasticsearch user account.
-   **Index Permissions:**  The user needs to have "\*" index permissions.
-   **Vulnerable Version:** The Elasticsearch instance must be an affected version (7.16.0 through 7.17.0) that was upgraded from a 6.x version.

**Additional Notes:**
-   The vulnerability exists in Elasticsearch versions 7.16.0 through 7.17.0 when upgraded from 6.x
-   The NetApp advisory states that no NetApp products are affected.
-   The Elastic advisory provides more specific technical detail, specifically that the vulnerability occurs when upgrading from 6.x versions to 7.16.0 through 7.17.0.
