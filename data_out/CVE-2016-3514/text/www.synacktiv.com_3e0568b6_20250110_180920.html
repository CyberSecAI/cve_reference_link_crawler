Issues description

The Oracle Enterprise Communications Broker

The   Oracle   Enterprise   Communication   Broker   is   a   core   communications   controller   used   to   route   SIP   sessions   across
disparate access and application layer network elements, and simplify complex multivendor VoIP networks.

The Oracle Enterprise Communications Monitor

The Oracle Enterprise Communication Monitor allows to capture and analyze the signaling messages. It provides a better
visibility of the exchange made before establishing a call and allows an end-to-end call correlation and quality metrics.

The issues

Synacktiv has identified two configuration issues to fix respectively in Oracle Enterprise Communication Broker and Oracle
Enterprise Communication Monitor.

1. Session cookies not marked Secure and HttpOnly in Oracle Enterprise Communication
Monitor

Session cookies used by the Web application Oracle Communications Operations Monitor are not marked with the security
attributes Secure and HttpOnly.

Illustration 1: Cookies defined without security attributes by the Communications Operations Monitor Web application

Without the attribute  secure, the session cookies can transit in an insecure communication (HTTP) despite the HTTP to
HTTPS redirection.

Illustration 2: Leak of the session identifier and anti-CSRF token on an insecure HTTP channel

 2/3

The attribute  HttpOnly  attribute prevents  cookies'  manipulation by local scripts  such  as  JavaScript.  It makes  Cross-Site
Scripting (XSS) attacks more complex to exploit.

Affected versions

The following versions are affected:

•

PCZ2.0.0 MR-2 Patch 1 (Build 209)

2. Banner leak in HTTP headers in Oracle Enterprise Communication Broker

The Oracle Communications Broker web server leaks the name and the version of the HTTP server implementation.

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 08 Dec 2015 10:45:26 GMT
Server: Embedthis-Appweb/3.4.2
[...]

By analyzing the banners,  an attacker could determine which application or technology is used by the company.  If the
attacker can get the exact version of an application or of a framework, he could know if it is publicly known as vulnerable. A
hacker getting several technical data will orientate its further attacks focusing on the applications used.

Affected versions

The following versions are affected:

•

PCZ2.0.0 MR-2 Patch 1 (Build 209)

Mitigation

Install Oracle Critical Patch Update July 2016.
