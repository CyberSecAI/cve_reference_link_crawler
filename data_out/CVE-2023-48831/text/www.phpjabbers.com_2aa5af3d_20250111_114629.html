I was looking for a PHP booking script and came across phpjabbers.com, but I wanted quite a few mods done. These guy sorted them out quickly and efficiently. The after sales support is fantastic as well. Thanks, team!

Mark Thompson

â€œ

After looking at the availability booking calendar script and studied it I bought it. While Swedish is not the most used language it started out with problems to use the special characters. It took less than one hour for PHPJabbers support team to solve this for me. Now the booking form works perfectly - well invested money!
