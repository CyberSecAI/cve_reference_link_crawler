### Description

The Qi Addons For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.2 via the 'behavior' attributes found in the qi\_addons\_for\_elementor\_blog\_list shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include remote files on the server, resulting in code execution. Please note that this requires an attacker to create a non-existent directory or target an instance where file\_exists won't return false with a non-existent directory in the path, in order to successfully exploit.
