Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how certain CLI commands in Brocade Fabric OS handle shell interpreted variables. Specifically, commands like `chassisdistribute`, `reboot`, `rasman`, `errmoduleshow`, `errfilterset`, `hassiscfgperrthreshold`, `supportshowcfgdisable`, and `supportshowcfgenable` can inadvertently print the content of shell variables to the terminal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Information Disclosure:** The core issue is the unintentional disclosure of sensitive information through the printing of shell variable contents.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   An attacker with local access could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information by exploiting this vulnerability. This could lead to further attacks or compromises. The CVSS score indicates the impact as High in terms of confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs to have direct or console access to the affected system.
-   **Command Injection:** While not explicitly stated, the vulnerability strongly implies that there is command injection happening somewhere.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L), meaning they need to be a user with some level of access to the system to execute the vulnerable commands.
-   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is needed (UI:N) to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

-   **Affected Products:** Brocade Fabric OS versions prior to 9.1.1c and 9.2.0 are affected.
-   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in Brocade Fabric OS versions 9.1.1c and 9.2.0.
-   **Discovery:** The vulnerability was found during internal penetration testing.
