Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection in the Tyk Gateway.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The `api_id` parameter in the URL `https://<YOUR_URL>/api/errors/count/...` is vulnerable to blind SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database. The provided example shows the attacker is able to obtain the SQL DB banner information.
*   The content suggests that it is a blind SQL injection, indicating that it might be possible to extract other information from the database, even if it's not immediately visible in the response.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/api/errors/count/` endpoint, with the `api_id` parameter containing the malicious SQL injection payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Tyk Gateway instance.
*   They also need to have knowledge of the vulnerable URL parameter, and potentially a valid cookie for authorization.
*   The attacker would also need to have knowledge of SQL injection techniques to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The content provides an example command using SQLMap to exploit the vulnerability
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Tyk Gateway version 5.0.7.
