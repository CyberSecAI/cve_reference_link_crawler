The provided content is related to CVE-2023-46928.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `gf_media_change_pl` function within the `isom_tools.c` file. The crash occurs because the `avcc` variable is not checked for NULL before being dereferenced.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference. The code attempts to access members of the `avcc` pointer without verifying that it is not NULL.
- The `gf_media_change_pl` function is called with specific parameters causing `avcc` to be `NULL`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault (SEGV), leading to a crash of the MP4Box application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered through a crafted command line argument when using the `MP4Box` utility: `-add self:svcmode=splitbase:negctts:compat=15 poc3gpac`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted input file to the `MP4Box` application using a specific command-line argument.
- No special privileges are required, as the crash occurs within the user-level application.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was discovered by Zeng Yunxiang and Song Jiaxuan.
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding a null check for the `avcc` variable before accessing its members.
- The vulnerable code is located in `src/media_tools/isom_tools.c` at line 3293.
- The fix was committed with commit hash `0753bf6d867343a80a044bf47a27d0b7accc8bf1`.
