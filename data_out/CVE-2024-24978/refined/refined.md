- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The TvRock application is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to its inability to handle specially crafted requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption. The application fails to properly manage resources when processing malicious requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in an abnormal termination (ABEND) of the TvRock application, leading to a denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack can be triggered by a remote attacker sending a specially crafted request or by a local user clicking on a specially crafted request. This suggests a network-based vector and a potential user-interaction vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote or a local user. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker needs the ability to send or generate a specially crafted request to the TvRock application.
