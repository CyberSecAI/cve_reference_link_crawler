Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-36888:

**CVE-2022-36888**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** HashiCorp Vault Plugin for Jenkins
*   **Affected Versions:** 354.vdb\_858fd6b\_f48 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints responsible for testing Vault connections.
*   **Weaknesses:** Missing permission checks on HTTP endpoints related to Vault connection tests.
*  **Impact:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can obtain credentials stored in Vault by specifying paths and keys. This allows them to retrieve sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, API keys, etc., stored in HashiCorp Vault.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based exploitation via HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
    *   The attacker needs to be aware of the existence of the vulnerable endpoints and how to interact with them.
    *   The attacker needs knowledge of the paths and keys of the desired credentials stored in Vault.

**Summary:**
The HashiCorp Vault Plugin for Jenkins allows users with Overall/Read permissions to retrieve credentials stored in Vault by sending crafted HTTP requests with specified paths and keys due to the lack of proper permission checks. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure if an attacker obtains valid Vault paths and keys. The fixed version (355.v3b\_38d767a\_b\_a\_8) requires Overall/Administer permission to perform Vault connection tests.
