# Cloudlog

Cloudlog is an open-source PHP & MySQL based amateur radio logging application, allowing you to log contacts via a web browser on ***any device*** and ***platform***.

This is an ideal general-purpose logging application, supporting HF to Microwave, it can even interface with your radio via CAT, sync logs from WSJT-X & if you are a satellite operator integrates with SatPC32.

## Whats Cloudlog

Cloudlog was designed to be different to standard general logging applications in the sense it was always designed to work from a web browser. This came around by Peter 2M0SQL operating from other peoples radio shacks under his own callsign but logging in different applications or scraps of paper.

Cloudlog removes this hassle, available anywhere on any device, you just have to host it on a web server that has PHP7.0 and MySQL (or MariaDB) and if you’d prefer not to host yourself magicbug will happily do it for you just select a subscription option.

I don’t say that Cloudlog is feature finished, it’s very much a work in progress but the basics are ready and functioning and its under active development. Full documentation can be found on the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/magicbug/Cloudlog/wiki)
## Funding

As Cloudlog is open source, it’s developed in free time, although I do get donations via [PayPal](http://paypal.me/PGoodhall) and we have a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/2m0sql) page that helps offset some of the development time. This allows me to use time during the working day and give some extra hours to making Cloudlog the best it can be.

## Logbook

The logbook area is the home of seeing what you have worked – as you scroll through QSOs they are plotted on a map using either the grid square provided or the country of the callsign.

You get a brief overview of the QSO, information about QSLing (Paper, eQSL and LoTW) and controls to Edit the QSO, Mark QSLs as received or even delete the contact.

Clicking on the callsign pops up a window with all the details and the contact marked on a map giving you as much visual information as possible.

## QSO Panel

The Cloudlog QSO panel has taken shape over 6 years of constant usage, while it doesn’t have every input box that you might get with some logging applications we have kept to the core items.

On the left-hand side, you have the QSO entry window – this is of course where you enter details about your on-going. QSO doing this gives you:

* Country Information
* LoTW User Notification
* Notification on whether you need the grid square
* The population of Callsign details from QRZ or HamQTH

You also get a map window which will either zoom into the DXCC or if you have a grid square it will use that.

Cloudlog also displays past QSOs with the person you are contacting just for reference.

## analytics

Analytics features are still in their infancy, however you can get graphs of QSOs by Year, pie charts of QSOs by Mode, Band and also Satellite.

On top of this, we have a lovely grid square map overlay area which will show you worked, confirmed and needed grid squares either for satellites or by band.

Ideal for the VUCC awards chasers, or those looking for something different to DXCC!

#### A hosted instance of Cloudlog has been the logging system of choice here at G4VXE for a year or two. I love the fact that I can access it from anywhere, including my smartphone.

Tim, G4VXE

#### Cloudlog is a fantastic platform for anyone who wants an online logbook accessible from anywhere. Free and open source is great, and it has integration with plenty of other logbook sites too. The API and integrated tools add an extra layer of flexibility, especially the CAT and satellite plugins, and the platform even understands VHF/UHF satellites properly.

John, M5ET

#### I've been using Cloudlog for the past year and it's been a wonderful experience. Plays well with other applications like WSJT-X and WinContest and the UI is usable on a mobile phone.
