### Description

The File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 7.2.5 via the fm\_download\_backup function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator access and above, to read the contents of arbitrary zip files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.
