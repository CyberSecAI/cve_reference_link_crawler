Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the exposure of the 'client secret' within the response of the `/userEntry` endpoint of the Hattoriya mini-app. This secret should be kept confidential but is being leaked to the client-side.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200):** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the client secret, a critical credential, to an unauthorized actor (the client-side).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized access to channel access token:** An attacker who obtains the leaked client secret can use it to acquire the channel access token.
- **Malicious message broadcasting:** With the channel access token, an attacker can broadcast malicious messages to users of the affected mini-app within Line. This could include spreading links to malicious websites, fraudulent information, or other harmful content.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- The attacker needs to install and open the vulnerable mini-app ('Hattoriya') in the Line app, then intercept network requests.
- Specifically, the attacker needs to examine the response of the `/userEntry` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user of the Line app.
- The attacker needs to be able to open the 'Hattoriya' mini-app.
- The attacker needs to be able to view network requests/responses from the application.

**Additional details:**
- The affected product is the 'Hattoriya' mini-app on the Line platform.
- The specific vulnerable version is v13.6.1.
- The client secret is exposed via the response of the request to `https://asia-northeast1-pibot-order-prod.cloudfunctions.net/userEntry`
