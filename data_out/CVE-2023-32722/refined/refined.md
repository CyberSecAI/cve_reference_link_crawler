- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow occurs in the `zbxjson` module when parsing JSON files via `zbx_json_open`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Parsing specially crafted JSON files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious JSON file to be parsed by the vulnerable `zbx_json_open` function. This would likely need to come from a connection to the Zabbix Agent, Proxy, or Server depending on which component is vulnerable.
