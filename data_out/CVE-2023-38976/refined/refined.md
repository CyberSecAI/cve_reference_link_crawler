- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `handleUnbatchedGraphQLRequest` function in `handlers_graphql.go` performs a type assertion on `unbatchedRequest.Variables` without verifying its actual type. If the `Variables` field is not of type `map[string]interface{}`, a panic occurs due to an invalid type assertion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper type handling and lack of input validation, specifically in the handling of GraphQL request variables. The code assumes the `Variables` field is always a `map[string]interface{}` without checking the actual type.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending a crafted GraphQL batch request with a `Variables` field that is not a `map[string]interface{}`. This will trigger a panic in the server, crashing it.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/v1/graphql/batch` endpoint with a JSON payload that includes an invalid `variables` type.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server's `/v1/graphql/batch` endpoint. No authentication is required if `AUTHENTICATION_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS_ENABLED` is set to `true`.
