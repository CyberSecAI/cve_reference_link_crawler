## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Shield Security < 20.0.6 - Reflected XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin.

### Proof of Concept

To exploit the vulnerability, go to the Shield Security plugin tab. The result will be the path /wp-admin/admin.php with a page and the vulnerable nav\_sub parameter for the XSS vulnerability. This request also does not have a nonce to prevent CSRF, and thus a combined vulnerability can be implemented
