{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the insecure handling of the 'zbscrmcsvimpf' parameter within the 'zeroBSCRM_CSVImporterLitehtml_app' function. Specifically, the application uses `file_exists` to check if a file exists without proper validation, allowing an attacker to pass a `phar://` stream, leading to PHAR deserialization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "PHAR Deserialization",
      "Insecure handling of user-supplied input",
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - nonce check implementation flaw"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to achieve object injection. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server if they can upload a malicious phar archive and trick an administrator into clicking a link that triggers the deserialization.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By injecting a `phar://` stream via the `zbscrmcsvimpf` parameter.",
      "Phishing/social engineering the admin user to click a link that triggers the exploit."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to upload a phar archive to the target server (e.g., through image uploads) or have access to an already uploaded one. They also need to trick an administrator into interacting with a crafted link or form submission.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present because the nonce check in the function fails to take any action when it fails. This is immediately followed by a `file_exists()` check on the `zbscrmcsvimpf` parameter. By passing a `phar://` stream as this parameter, it triggers PHAR deserialization which then enables object injection on the system."
