### @maxshine **[maxshine](/maxshine)** commented [Aug 23, 2019](#issue-484417124)

## Problem Description

For a pattern with asterisk as suffix, the `parseWildcardRules` forms the result array wrongly.

i.e. for an allowed origin of `http://localhost*`, the `parseWildcardRules` returns the result as

`[]string {"http://localhos", "*"}` instead of `[]string {"http://localhost", "*"}`

## Root Cause

The cause of this error is the code snippet

[cors/cors.go](https://github.com/gin-contrib/cors/blob/5f50d4fb4e0306dcacc6f8e9bea2dcee784dbbdf/cors.go#L138)

Line 138
in
[5f50d4f](/gin-contrib/cors/commit/5f50d4fb4e0306dcacc6f8e9bea2dcee784dbbdf)

|  | wRules = append(wRules, []string{o[:i-1], "\*"}) |
| --- | --- |

The `i` is the index where asterisk character found and I think it should take a substring with end of `i` then the last non-asterisk character is kept.

## Solution

The solution is as this PR, using `i` to take the substring.

Please kindly review the change and accept it if this makes sense.

Thanks

Sorry, something went wrong.

| fixed in [#106](https://github.com/gin-contrib/cors/pull/106)  I don't understand the rationale of your action to take the same change as my PR from a later PR without endorsing mine.  I provided this fix FIVE years ago but it was just override by another most recent one with exactly the same change. |

| [@maxshine](https://github.com/maxshine)  I would like to extend my sincerest apologies for the oversight regarding the handling of your pull request (PR). I understand your frustration and disappointment in seeing that a more recent PR with the same change has been accepted and merged, while your original contribution, which was submitted five years ago, was not given the due recognition it deserved.  Your early identification of the issue and the fix you provided should have been acknowledged and merged at the time of submission. The fact that it was overlooked is a failure on our part, and I take full responsibility for this mistake. The process of reviewing and merging PRs should be thorough and fair, and in this instance, we did not meet that standard.  Please know that your contributions are valuable to us, and the situation you've experienced is not indicative of the level of respect and consideration we strive to uphold for all contributors. I am personally reviewing our PR management process to ensure that such an error does not happen again. We will also look into ways of rectifying this situation, such as crediting you for the change in our project's documentation or release notes.  Once again, I apologize for any inconvenience or disheartenment this may have caused you. Your work and time are greatly appreciated, and we are committed to making things right.  Please see the [v1.6.0 release note](https://github.com/gin-contrib/cors/releases/tag/v1.6.0).
