### @Hvitgar **[Hvitgar](/Hvitgar)** commented [Jul 7, 2022](#issue-1297775425)

I think there is a bug in the parseWildcardRules function - if the wildcard is at the end of the origin string, the character right before the wildcard is cut off, leading to potentially unwanted matches, for instance `https://example.com/*` would also validate anything on `https://example.community/*`.

For verification, just execute the code below:

```
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"strings"
)

type Config struct {
	AllowWildcard bool
	AllowOrigins  []string
}

func (c Config) parseWildcardRules() [][]string {
	var wRules [][]string

	if !c.AllowWildcard {
		return wRules
	}

	for _, o := range c.AllowOrigins {
		if !strings.Contains(o, "*") {
			continue
		}

		if c := strings.Count(o, "*"); c > 1 {
			panic(errors.New("only one * is allowed").Error())
		}

		i := strings.Index(o, "*")
		if i == 0 {
			wRules = append(wRules, []string{"*", o[1:]})
			continue
		}
		if i == (len(o) - 1) {
			wRules = append(wRules, []string{o[:i-1], "*"})
			continue
		}

		wRules = append(wRules, []string{o[:i], o[i+1:]})
	}

	return wRules
}

func main() {
	c1 := Config{AllowWildcard: true, AllowOrigins: []string{
		"https://example.com/*",
		"https://example.com/*/helloWorld",
		"*/helloWorld",
	}}

	wrules := c1.parseWildcardRules()
	for i, wr := range wrules {
		println(c1.AllowOrigins[i] + " ->")
		println(wr[0])
		println(wr[1])
		println()
	}
}
```

which results in

```
https://example.com/* ->
https://example.com                 # incorrect, should be https://example.com/
*

https://example.com/*/helloWorld ->
https://example.com/
/helloWorld

*/helloWorld ->
*
/helloWorld

```

| Note that [Web origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin) do not contain a path. But I agree with you that a trailing wildcard is a terrible footgun; for instance, `https://example.*` would match Web origin `https://example.attacker.com`. |

| Hey, I just discovered this bug as well. Will this be merged or what's the status? Even though Web origins do not contain a path, it leads to the situation where you configure `https://example.*` and it would match `https://example-without-a-dot.com`. Sure it's a footgun, but it's even worse as I would consider this an unwanted behavior. |

### @maxshine **[maxshine](/maxshine)** commented [Aug 23, 2019](#issue-484417124)

## Problem Description

For a pattern with asterisk as suffix, the `parseWildcardRules` forms the result array wrongly.

i.e. for an allowed origin of `http://localhost*`, the `parseWildcardRules` returns the result as

`[]string {"http://localhos", "*"}` instead of `[]string {"http://localhost", "*"}`

## Root Cause

The cause of this error is the code snippet

[cors/cors.go](https://github.com/gin-contrib/cors/blob/5f50d4fb4e0306dcacc6f8e9bea2dcee784dbbdf/cors.go#L138)

Line 138
in
[5f50d4f](/gin-contrib/cors/commit/5f50d4fb4e0306dcacc6f8e9bea2dcee784dbbdf)

|  | wRules = append(wRules, []string{o[:i-1], "\*"}) |
| --- | --- |

The `i` is the index where asterisk character found and I think it should take a substring with end of `i` then the last non-asterisk character is kept.

## Solution

The solution is as this PR, using `i` to take the substring.

Please kindly review the change and accept it if this makes sense.

Thanks

Sorry, something went wrong.

| fixed in [#106](https://github.com/gin-contrib/cors/pull/106)  I don't understand the rationale of your action to take the same change as my PR from a later PR without endorsing mine.  I provided this fix FIVE years ago but it was just override by another most recent one with exactly the same change. |

| [@maxshine](https://github.com/maxshine)  I would like to extend my sincerest apologies for the oversight regarding the handling of your pull request (PR). I understand your frustration and disappointment in seeing that a more recent PR with the same change has been accepted and merged, while your original contribution, which was submitted five years ago, was not given the due recognition it deserved.  Your early identification of the issue and the fix you provided should have been acknowledged and merged at the time of submission. The fact that it was overlooked is a failure on our part, and I take full responsibility for this mistake. The process of reviewing and merging PRs should be thorough and fair, and in this instance, we did not meet that standard.  Please know that your contributions are valuable to us, and the situation you've experienced is not indicative of the level of respect and consideration we strive to uphold for all contributors. I am personally reviewing our PR management process to ensure that such an error does not happen again. We will also look into ways of rectifying this situation, such as crediting you for the change in our project's documentation or release notes.  Once again, I apologize for any inconvenience or disheartenment this may have caused you. Your work and time are greatly appreciated, and we are committed to making things right.  Please see the [v1.6.0 release note](https://github.com/gin-contrib/cors/releases/tag/v1.6.0).

1. [test: improve CORS wildcard handling and testing (](/gin-contrib/cors/commit/85bf9fb45757fab3a0f5a7237ec2cad06604a2f1)[#144](https://github.com/gin-contrib/cors/pull/144)[)](/gin-contrib/cors/commit/85bf9fb45757fab3a0f5a7237ec2cad06604a2f1)
    …

   ```
   - Add two new test functions in `cors_test.go` for parsing wildcard rules: one without wildcards and one with invalid wildcards
