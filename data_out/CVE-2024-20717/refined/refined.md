Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown for CVE-2024-20717:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored on the server and executed when a user views the affected content.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker can potentially gain control of a user's session or perform malicious actions within the context of the user's browser when they interact with the injected script.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker can inject the malicious script through the application's interface. The user interaction (UI:R) is required; the user must view the content containing the injected script.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker requires low privileges (PR:L) and needs to be authenticated (yes) to exploit this vulnerability. This suggests that the attacker has access to an account and can modify content where the vulnerability exists.
