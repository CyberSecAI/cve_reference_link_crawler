- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress SpeedyCache plugin versions 1.1.2 and earlier are vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin allows a malicious actor to make requests from the server to arbitrary domains.
- **Impact of exploitation:** This could allow an attacker to find sensitive information of other services running on the system by making the server send requests to attacker-controlled domains.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the vulnerable plugin, allowing an attacker to cause the website to execute requests to an arbitrary domain.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable plugin, requiring at least a "subscriber" level privilege on the WordPress site.
