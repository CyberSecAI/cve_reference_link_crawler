Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The application stores user passwords without salting them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unsalted Password Storage:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of salt when hashing user passwords. This makes them susceptible to offline attacks, such as rainbow table lookups.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The application allows administrators to view the stored, unsalted password hashes, effectively disclosing sensitive information

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Compromise of Plaintext Passwords:** Attackers who gain access to the unsalted password hashes can potentially recover the original plaintext passwords through offline attacks.
*   **Account Takeover:** With access to plaintext passwords, attackers can potentially compromise user accounts and gain unauthorized access to the application and its data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The vulnerability is only exploitable by authenticated administrators of the application. An attacker would need to compromise an administrative account first or be an administrator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Administrator Privileges:** The attacker must have valid administrator credentials for the PHP Point of Sale application.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was discovered by Edward Prior on behalf of The Missing Link Security.
* The affected version is PHP Point of Sale version 19.0.
* The vendor has stated they will not fix this vulnerability ("Won't fix.").
