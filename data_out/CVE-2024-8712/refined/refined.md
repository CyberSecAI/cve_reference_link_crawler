Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8712

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the plugin's use of `add_query_arg` without proper output escaping in the `class-gtm-server-side-admin.php` file. This allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to sanitize user-controlled input when generating URLs, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability. Specifically, the `add_query_arg` function is used to construct URLs for the tab navigation without escaping, which can be exploited by injecting malicious code into the `tab` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a vulnerable WordPress site. This could lead to various malicious activities:
    *   **Data theft:** Stealing session cookies or sensitive information.
    *   **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious sites or injecting malware.
    *   **Website defacement:** Modifying website content.
    *   **Account takeover:**  Potentially gaining control over user accounts.
    *   **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through specially crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript code in the `tab` query parameter.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when a user clicks on a malicious link that contains the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on a malicious link.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is present in GTM Server Side plugin versions up to and including 2.1.19.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 2.1.20 by using `esc_url()` on the output of `add_query_arg()`.
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `templates/class-gtm-server-side-admin.php` file.
*   The fix involves escaping the URL generated by `add_query_arg` with `esc_url()` before it is outputted in the HTML.
