{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly uses user-supplied input from HTTP requests (query strings and POST parameters) to construct SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Additionally, user-controlled parameters are directly output into the page, causing XSS vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Information Disclosure",
     "Unauthorized Access"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries to access, modify, or delete data, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. They could also inject malicious scripts to perform actions in the context of other users' sessions (XSS). Also, the application reveals sensitive information like the physical path of the website in error messages, and can potentially lead to command execution if coupled with other vulnerabilities. Unauthorized access to files is possible through direct access using predictable parameters.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET requests with manipulated query string parameters.",
    "HTTP POST requests with manipulated form data.",
    "Direct URL access to download files using manipulated parameters."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be an unauthenticated user with network access to the application. No specific user role or internal network access is required. For SQL injection, attacker needs to manipulate certain parameters in the requests. For XSS, the attacker can manipulate the parameters to inject malicious JavaScript code. For unauthorized access, the attacker can directly manipulate parameters in the URL to download files."
