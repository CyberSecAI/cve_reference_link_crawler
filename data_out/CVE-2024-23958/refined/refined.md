- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the BLE AppAuthenRequest command handler within the Autel MaxiCharger AC Elite Business C50 charging station software. This handler uses hardcoded credentials as a fallback in case of an authentication request failure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hardcoded credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Attackers can bypass authentication, which could allow unauthorized manipulation of the charging station.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-adjacent attackers exploiting the BLE protocol to communicate with the charging station.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be within network proximity to the charging station using the BLE protocol. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
