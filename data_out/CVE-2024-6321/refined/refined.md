- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing nonce validation and missing file type validation in the 'options\_page' function within the ScrollTo Bottom plugin for WordPress.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) leading to Arbitrary File Upload.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated attackers can upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server. This may allow for remote code execution if a malicious file is uploaded.
- **Attack vectors:** Forged requests. The attacker needs to trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication. They need to trick a site administrator into interacting with a malicious link.
