Subject: PHP security releases 8.3.8, 8.2.20, and 8.1.29

In [https://fosstodon.org/@php/112570710411472992](https://fosstodon.org/%40php/112570710411472992) it is written:

> Announcing the availability of:
>
> - PHP 8.3.8
> - PHP 8.2.20
> - PHP 8.1.29
>
> ‼️ These SECURITY releases fix:
>
> - Argument Injection in PHP-CGI
> - Bypass in filter_var FILTER_VALIDATE_URL
> - proc_open workaround Windows with escaping arguments for bat/cmd files
> - openssl_private_decrypt vulnerability to the Marvin attack
>
> Please upgrade ASAP.
>
> Changelog: <https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-8.php>
> Source: <https://www.php.net/downloads>

The Changelog link includes further details:

  - Fixed bug GHSA-3qgc-jrrr-25jv (Bypass of CVE-2012-1823, Argument Injection
    in PHP-CGI). (CVE-2024-4577)

  - Fixed bug GHSA-w8qr-v226-r27w (Filter bypass in filter_var
    FILTER_VALIDATE_URL). (CVE-2024-5458)

  - Fixed bug GHSA-9fcc-425m-g385 (Bypass of CVE-2024-1874). (CVE-2024-5585)

  - The openssl_private_decrypt function in PHP, when using PKCS1 padding
    (OPENSSL_PKCS1_PADDING, which is the default), is vulnerable to the
    Marvin Attack unless it is used with an OpenSSL version that includes
    the changes from this pull request:
        <https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/13817>
    (rsa_pkcs1_implicit_rejection). These changes are part of OpenSSL 3.2
    and have also been backported to stable versions of various Linux
    distributions, as well as to the PHP builds provided for Windows since
    the previous release. All distributors and builders should ensure that
    this version is used to prevent PHP from being vulnerable.

Unfortunately the related advisories don't seem to be published yet under those
GHSA id's on <https://github.com/php/php-src/security> .
