Package        : php7.3
Version        : 7.3.31-1~deb10u7
CVE ID         : CVE-2024-5458
Debian Bug     : 1072885

PHP, a widely-used open source general purpose scripting language, is affected
by a security problem when parsing certain types of URLs.

Due to a code logic error filtering functions such as filter_var when
validating URLs (FILTER_VALIDATE_URL) will result in invalid user information
(username + password part of URLs) being treated as valid user information.
This may lead to the downstream code accepting invalid URLs as valid and
parsing them incorrectly. The problem is related to CVE-2020-7071 but affects
IPv6 host parts.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
7.3.31-1~deb10u7.

We recommend that you upgrade your php7.3 packages.

For the detailed security status of php7.3 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/php7.3>
