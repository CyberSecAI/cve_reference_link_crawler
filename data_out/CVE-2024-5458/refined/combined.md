Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2024-49aba7b305
2024-06-12 01:10:41.116204
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : php
Product : Fedora 40
Version : 8.3.8
Release : 1.fc40
URL : <http://www.php.net/>
Summary : PHP scripting language for creating dynamic web sites
Description :
PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. PHP attempts to make it
easy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages. PHP also
offers built-in database integration for several commercial and
non-commercial database management systems, so writing a
database-enabled webpage with PHP is fairly simple. The most common
use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI scripts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

PHP version 8.3.8 (06 Jun 2024)
CGI:
Fixed buffer limit on Windows, replacing read call usage by \_read. (David
Carlier)
Fixed bug GHSA-3qgc-jrrr-25jv (Bypass of CVE-2012-1823, Argument Injection in
PHP-CGI). (CVE-2024-4577) (nielsdos)
CLI:
Fixed bug GH-14189 (PHP Interactive shell input state incorrectly handles quoted
heredoc literals.). (nielsdos)
Core:
Fixed bug GH-13970 (Incorrect validation of #[Attribute] flags type for non-
compile-time expressions). (ilutov)
DOM:
Fix crashes when entity declaration is removed while still having entity
references. (nielsdos)
Fix references not handled correctly in C14N. (nielsdos)
Fix crash when calling childNodes next() when iterator is exhausted. (nielsdos)
Fix crash in ParentNode::append() when dealing with a fragment containing text
nodes. (nielsdos)
Filter:
Fixed bug GHSA-w8qr-v226-r27w (Filter bypass in filter\_var FILTER\_VALIDATE\_URL).
(CVE-2024-5458) (nielsdos)
FPM:
Fix bug GH-14175 (Show decimal number instead of scientific notation in systemd
status). (Benjamin Cremer)
Hash:
ext/hash: Swap the checking order of \_\_has\_builtin and \_\_GNUC\_\_ (Saki Takamachi)
Intl:

shm). (ilutov)
OpenSSL:
The openssl\_private\_decrypt function in PHP, when using PKCS1 padding
(OPENSSL\_PKCS1\_PADDING, which is the default), is vulnerable to the Marvin
Attack unless it is used with an OpenSSL version that includes the changes from
this pull request: <https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/13817>
(rsa\_pkcs1\_implicit\_rejection). These changes are part of OpenSSL 3.2 and have
also been backported to stable versions of various Linux distributions, as well
as to the PHP builds provided for Windows since the previous release. All
distributors and builders should ensure that this version is used to prevent PHP
from being vulnerable. (CVE-2024-2408)
Standard:
Fixed bug GHSA-9fcc-425m-g385 (Bypass of CVE-2024-1874). (CVE-2024-5585)
(nielsdos)
XML:

Package        : php7.3
Version        : 7.3.31-1~deb10u7
CVE ID         : CVE-2024-5458
Debian Bug     : 1072885

PHP, a widely-used open source general purpose scripting language, is affected
by a security problem when parsing certain types of URLs.

Due to a code logic error filtering functions such as filter_var when
validating URLs (FILTER_VALIDATE_URL) will result in invalid user information
(username + password part of URLs) being treated as valid user information.
This may lead to the downstream code accepting invalid URLs as valid and
parsing them incorrectly. The problem is related to CVE-2020-7071 but affects
IPv6 host parts.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
7.3.31-1~deb10u7.

We recommend that you upgrade your php7.3 packages.

For the detailed security status of php7.3 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/php7.3>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2024-52c23ef1ec
2024-06-13 03:03:09.807841
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : php
Product : Fedora 39
Version : 8.2.20
Release : 1.fc39
URL : <http://www.php.net/>
Summary : PHP scripting language for creating dynamic web sites
Description :
PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. PHP attempts to make it
easy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages. PHP also
offers built-in database integration for several commercial and
non-commercial database management systems, so writing a
database-enabled webpage with PHP is fairly simple. The most common
use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI scripts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

PHP version 8.2.20 (06 Jun 2024)
CGI:
Fixed buffer limit on Windows, replacing read call usage by \_read. (David
Carlier)
Fixed bug GHSA-3qgc-jrrr-25jv (Bypass of CVE-2012-1823, Argument Injection in
PHP-CGI). (CVE-2024-4577) (nielsdos)
CLI:
Fixed bug GH-14189 (PHP Interactive shell input state incorrectly handles quoted
heredoc literals.). (nielsdos)
Core:
Fixed bug GH-13970 (Incorrect validation of #[Attribute] flags type for non-
compile-time expressions). (ilutov)
Fixed bug GH-14140 (Floating point bug in range operation on Apple Silicon
hardware). (Derick, Saki)
DOM:
Fix crashes when entity declaration is removed while still having entity
references. (nielsdos)
Fix references not handled correctly in C14N. (nielsdos)
Fix crash when calling childNodes next() when iterator is exhausted. (nielsdos)
Fix crash in ParentNode::append() when dealing with a fragment containing text
nodes. (nielsdos)
FFI:
Fixed bug GH-14215 (Cannot use FFI::load on CRLF header file with
apache2handler). (nielsdos)
Filter:
Fixed bug GHSA-w8qr-v226-r27w (Filter bypass in filter\_var FILTER\_VALIDATE\_URL).
(CVE-2024-5458) (nielsdos)
FPM:
Fix bug GH-14175 (Show decimal number instead of scientific notation in systemd

Opcache:
Fixed bug GH-14109 (Fix accidental persisting of internal class constant in
shm). (ilutov)
OpenSSL:
The openssl\_private\_decrypt function in PHP, when using PKCS1 padding
(OPENSSL\_PKCS1\_PADDING, which is the default), is vulnerable to the Marvin
Attack unless it is used with an OpenSSL version that includes the changes from
this pull request: <https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/13817>
(rsa\_pkcs1\_implicit\_rejection). These changes are part of OpenSSL 3.2 and have
also been backported to stable versions of various Linux distributions, as well
as to the PHP builds provided for Windows since the previous release. All
distributors and builders should ensure that this version is used to prevent PHP
from being vulnerable. (CVE-2024-2408)
Standard:
Fixed bug GHSA-9fcc-425m-g385 (Bypass of CVE-2024-1874). (CVE-2024-5585)
(nielsdos)
XML:

Subject: PHP security releases 8.3.8, 8.2.20, and 8.1.29

In [https://fosstodon.org/@php/112570710411472992](https://fosstodon.org/%40php/112570710411472992) it is written:

> Announcing the availability of:
>
> - PHP 8.3.8
> - PHP 8.2.20
> - PHP 8.1.29
>
> ‼️ These SECURITY releases fix:
>
> - Argument Injection in PHP-CGI
> - Bypass in filter_var FILTER_VALIDATE_URL
> - proc_open workaround Windows with escaping arguments for bat/cmd files
> - openssl_private_decrypt vulnerability to the Marvin attack
>
> Please upgrade ASAP.
>
> Changelog: <https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-8.php>
> Source: <https://www.php.net/downloads>

The Changelog link includes further details:

  - Fixed bug GHSA-3qgc-jrrr-25jv (Bypass of CVE-2012-1823, Argument Injection
    in PHP-CGI). (CVE-2024-4577)

  - Fixed bug GHSA-w8qr-v226-r27w (Filter bypass in filter_var
    FILTER_VALIDATE_URL). (CVE-2024-5458)

  - Fixed bug GHSA-9fcc-425m-g385 (Bypass of CVE-2024-1874). (CVE-2024-5585)

  - The openssl_private_decrypt function in PHP, when using PKCS1 padding
    (OPENSSL_PKCS1_PADDING, which is the default), is vulnerable to the
    Marvin Attack unless it is used with an OpenSSL version that includes
    the changes from this pull request:
        <https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/13817>
    (rsa_pkcs1_implicit_rejection). These changes are part of OpenSSL 3.2
    and have also been backported to stable versions of various Linux
    distributions, as well as to the PHP builds provided for Windows since
    the previous release. All distributors and builders should ensure that
    this version is used to prevent PHP from being vulnerable.

Unfortunately the related advisories don't seem to be published yet under those
GHSA id's on <https://github.com/php/php-src/security> .

# Filter bypass in filter\_var (FILTER\_VALIDATE\_URL)

Moderate

[smalyshev](/smalyshev)

GHSA-w8qr-v226-r27w

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

7.3.27 - 7.3.33, 7.4.15 - 7.4.33, 8.0.2 - 8.0.30, 8.1.0 - 8.1.28, 8.2.0 - 8.2.19, 8.3.0 - 8.3.7

## Patched versions

8.1.29, 8.2.20, 8.3.8.

## Description

### Summary

An early-return in filter\_var (FILTER\_VALIDATE\_URL) will result in invalid user information (username + password part of URLs) being treated as valid user information.

This causes the same problems as [CVE-2020-7071](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-grxx-qh3p-vx7g "CVE-2020-7071"), but with IPv6 host parts.

### Details

The function `php_filter_validate_url` in [php-src/ext/filter/logical\_filters.c](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/ext/filter/logical_filters.c) contains the logic for validating URLs.

For HTTP-IPv6 addresses the implementation contains an early return statement that results in further checks on the user\_info being skipped.

The offending return statement is at: <https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/ext/filter/logical_filters.c#L618>

This results in invalid user information being passed as valid for URLs with IPv6 Hosts.

Fix: Restructuring the code to include the user\_info checks if the IPv6-host part is correct.

This could be done by only return "SUCCESS" if the end of the function is reached.

### PoC

To prove the user info check was skipped I looked for a character that is not allowed in usernames. (Based on the validation code in `is_userinfo_valid`)

I chose `[`.

The following statements show that the handling of the URLs is different if the "host" part of the URL is changed.

```
var_dump(filter_var("http://t[est@127.0.0.1", FILTER_VALIDATE_URL));
var_dump(filter_var("http://t[est@[::1]", FILTER_VALIDATE_URL));
```

Output for 7.3.27 - 7.3.33, 7.4.15 - 7.4.33, 8.0.2 - 8.0.30, 8.1.0 - 8.1.28, 8.2.0 - 8.2.19, 8.3.0 - 8.3.7

```
bool(false)
string(18) "http://t[est@[::1]"

```

Output for 7.3.26, 7.4.14, 8.0.1 ([CVE-2020-7071](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-grxx-qh3p-vx7g "CVE-2020-7071") was patched here!)

```
string(22) "http://t[est@127.0.0.1"
string(18) "http://t[est@[::1]"

```

Output for 5.2.13 - 5.2.17, 5.3.2 - 5.3.29, 5.4.0 - 5.4.45, 5.5.0 - 5.5.38, 5.6.0 - 5.6.40

```
string(22) "http://t[est@127.0.0.1"
bool(false)

```
### Impact

This bug impacts users that expect only completely valid URLs to be returned by `filter_var` (FILTER\_VALIDATE\_URL).

As this function is meant to validate user supplied strings this will be exposed to raw user input often.

As this is almost the same vulnerability as [CVE-2020-7071](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-grxx-qh3p-vx7g "CVE-2020-7071") this should also have a MEDIUM impact.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
