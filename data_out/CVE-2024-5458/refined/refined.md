{
  "CVE-2024-5458": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "An early-return statement in `php_filter_validate_url` function, which is used to validate URLs, causes user information checks to be skipped when an IPv6 host is present.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is a filter bypass in `filter_var` with the `FILTER_VALIDATE_URL` flag. It occurs due to a logic error in the URL validation process, specifically when handling IPv6 addresses in URLs. This results in the function incorrectly accepting invalid user information in the URL (username/password part).",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to the acceptance of invalid URLs, which could cause issues in downstream applications that rely on the functionâ€™s validation to make security decisions or correctly process user input. This could lead to data modification.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, using crafted URLs that include IPv6 addresses to bypass the user information check during validation.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker requires no special privileges or user interaction. They can exploit this vulnerability remotely by crafting a malicious URL and providing it as input to an application that uses the vulnerable PHP `filter_var` function with `FILTER_VALIDATE_URL`."
