{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `GetMdState`'s JSON `param` parser incorrectly assumes that the `param` JSON element is always an object and accesses it using the subscription operator, but a string value can be provided instead.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The `cgiserver.cgi` process will crash, leading to a device reboot, resulting in a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted HTTP POST request to the camera's API with the command `GetMdState` and a string value for the `param`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device.  While most of these vulnerabilities require a logged-in user, they can be exploited without authentication by leveraging TALOS-2021-1420."
