Export from Illustrator (don‚Äôt ‚ÄúSave As‚Ä¶‚Äù, export to SVG) and bring it into WP.
Edit your template with Elementor and choose the ‚ÄúInline SVG‚Äù widget.
Choose to override colors, or to add a hover color, etc.
No step 4.

Not sure why others haven‚Äôt been able to get this to work as it was a flawless experience for me. I did also install Safe SVG as recommended by another reviewer as it‚Äôs also an excellent plugin. Would be nice for this plugin to include what Safe SVG does so you just have the one plugin, but that‚Äôs being a little picky üôÇ
All-in-all it does exactly what you want without fuss. Couldn‚Äôt be happier and many thanks to the author for creating this and spending their time on it.

Using latest Elementor Pro together with the Astra theme and Elementor Inline SVG allows me to easily add and style vector graphics helping towards site speed and responsiveness.
This will definitely be an essential tool for every site when using Elementor Builder.

A couple of comments to address previous reviewers who couldn‚Äôt get it to work:
1) Make sure that you know how to work with svg files. You may need to edit your svg‚Äôs in Adobe Illustrator (or another vector program) so that the actual vector drawing covers most of the artboard (i.e. touches top/bottom if portrait svg or left/right if landscape svg). I use this plugin to display vector icons and standardized my artboard size to be 50px x 50px (widthxheight) with (x, y) set to (25px, -25px). That way, when I select the icon from the WP media library, using this widget, I can apply the same styling (notably sizing/width and padding) across all of my icons.
See https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/12904/how-to-change-artboard-size-in-ai-cs6
2) The vector image will not be viewable within the Elementor editor. You need to view the page.

### Description

The Elementor Inline SVG plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.
