Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9064:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the "Elementor Inline SVG" WordPress plugin. This lack of proper handling of user-supplied input allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to adequately sanitize SVG file uploads, allowing attackers to embed malicious JavaScript within the SVG files. This malicious script is then stored on the server and executed when the SVG is accessed.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin doesn't properly sanitize the content of uploaded SVG files.
- **Improper Output Escaping**: The plugin doesn't properly escape the SVG content when it is rendered on the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute in the context of any user viewing a page containing the maliciously crafted SVG file. This can lead to a wide range of malicious actions:
    - **Session hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
    - **Redirection to malicious sites:** Redirecting users to phishing or malware-laden websites.
    - **Defacement:** Altering the content of the website.
    - **Data theft:** Gaining access to sensitive information.
    - **Privilege escalation**: Gaining higher access rights to the site.
- **Compromise of User Accounts**: Due to the XSS, an attacker could compromise user accounts by stealing session cookies, potentially leading to complete site takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **SVG File Uploads:** The vulnerability is triggered through the upload of maliciously crafted SVG files.
- **Web Pages Displaying SVG Content:** The injected script executes when a user accesses a web page that renders the uploaded SVG file, including other admin users if the SVG is used on admin pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least "Author" level privileges or higher. This level is generally required to upload media files, including SVG.
- **Ability to Upload Files:** Attacker must have the capacity to upload SVG files via the WordPress media library.

**Additional Notes:**
- The plugin has been closed on October 8, 2024, due to the security issue and is not available for download, and there is no patch available.
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.2.0.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Francesco Carlucci.
