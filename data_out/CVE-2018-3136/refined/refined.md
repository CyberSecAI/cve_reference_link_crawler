Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-3136:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided documents, especially the Oracle CPU and the various RHSA entries, clearly state that CVE-2018-3136 is a vulnerability related to incorrect handling of unsigned attributes in signed JAR manifests in OpenJDK. This matches the official description of CVE-2018-3136.

**2. Root cause of the vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how OpenJDK handles unsigned attributes within signed JAR (Java Archive) manifests. Specifically, the affected versions of OpenJDK fail to properly verify that the elements within a manifest file are signed before being used.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

The core vulnerability is a lack of proper verification of signed attributes within a JAR file's manifest. This allows unsigned attributes to be processed as if they were signed, leading to the possibility of malicious manipulation. The weakness is present within the Security component of OpenJDK.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to craft a malicious Java application or applet that bypasses Java sandbox restrictions. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or other malicious activities depending on the application's permissions and the target environment.

**5. Attack vectors:**

The primary attack vector is through a maliciously crafted JAR file containing a manifest with unsigned attributes that bypass security checks. This JAR file could be delivered through various means:
* Through web browsers as applets
* As part of a downloaded or installed application
* As a component loaded by a running Java process.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

An attacker needs the ability to:

*   Create or modify a JAR file to include a manifest containing specific unsigned attributes.
*   Deliver or entice a user to execute the malicious JAR file within a vulnerable Java environment. This might be through social engineering, phishing or website manipulation.

**Additional details:**

*   The Red Hat security advisories note that the fix requires restarting all running instances of OpenJDK Java.
*   Oracle's advisory mentions multiple components within the Java SE environment being affected and strongly recommends applying patches as soon as possible.
*   The severity of CVE-2018-3136 is rated as "Critical" or "Important" across various advisories, indicating a significant security risk.

In summary, CVE-2018-3136 represents a critical security flaw due to the lack of manifest verification in OpenJDK, allowing for potential sandbox escape and arbitrary code execution through maliciously crafted JAR files. Patches should be applied promptly to mitigate this risk.
