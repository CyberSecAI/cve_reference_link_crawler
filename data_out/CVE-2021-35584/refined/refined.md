    "content": "The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Oracle MySQL, including CVE-2021-35584. It also includes information regarding affected NetApp products using MySQL.\n\n**CVE-2021-35584:**\n\n- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is located within the `ndbcluster/plugin DDL` component of MySQL Cluster.\n- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability lies in how the `ndbcluster/plugin DDL` handles operations. This could allow for incorrect or unexpected behavior during DDL operations.\n- **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition and low impact to confidentiality and integrity. The provided document describes a low impact to availability. The attacker does not have direct read and write access to data and thus it is a DoS condition. The Oracle document also indicates that the exploit is network based with low complexity.\n- **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector for this vulnerability is over the network. The NetApp documentation also mentions the attack vector as network based.\n- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs low privileges to exploit this issue and it is adjacent network based.  Netapp describes it as requiring high privileges. It is not clear if the access is pre or post authentication. Oracle describes it as not requiring authentication.   The complexity of the attack is low.",
     "additional_info": "The provided content from both Oracle and NetApp offer further detail about the vulnerability, including the affected product versions and available patches.  The risk matrix included in the Oracle document is valuable for understanding the impact, complexity and exploitability of CVE-2021-35584 in the listed products.  The NetApp document provides a list of NetApp products affected as a result of including the affected version of MySQL."
