The content relates to CVE-2024-39910.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WYSIWYG editor QuillJS is vulnerable to XSS if an attacker can modify the HTML before it's uploaded to the server. Specifically, an attacker could inject malicious code like `<svg onload=alert('XSS')>`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided HTML content in the QuillJS WYSIWYG editor.
- The application does not properly sanitize or validate HTML input from the editor before storing it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the application's users who view the crafted content.
- Attackers could potentially perform actions such as stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to modify the HTML content within the QuillJS editor before it is submitted to the server. This could potentially be done by intercepting and modifying the request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a user account with administrative access or access to the admin panel with the ability to modify content using the QuillJS editor.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft or manipulate the HTML that gets sent from the editor to the server.
- High privileges are required.
- User interaction is required as the attacker needs to insert malicious payload using the rich text editor.
