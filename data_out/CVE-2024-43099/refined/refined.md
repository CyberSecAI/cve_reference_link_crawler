The provided content is related to CVE-2024-43099.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper session key protection in the application layer's control mechanism. An attacker can capture a valid session key and inject traffic by spoofing the originating host's IP and MAC address.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-294 (Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay):**  The system is vulnerable to session hijacking due to the ability to capture and replay the session key. This bypasses the authentication mechanism.
*  **CWE-384 (Session Fixation):** The PLC accepts multiple distinct packets as valid authentication responses, diverging from standard security practices.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:
    *   Inject traffic into an ongoing authenticated session.
    *   Authenticate as a valid user.
*   This could lead to complete compromise of the PLC, allowing for unauthorized control, data manipulation, and disruption of operations.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker on an adjacent network can capture a session key.
*   The attacker needs to spoof the IP and MAC addresses of the originating host.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be on an adjacent network to the targeted PLC.
*   The attacker needs the capability to capture network traffic.
*   The attacker must be able to spoof IP and MAC addresses.
*   No user interaction is required.

**Additional Information:**

* The advisory also mentions a related vulnerability (CVE-2024-45368) related to session fixation.
* The affected product is the AutomationDirect DirectLogic H2-DM1E PLC.
* The vendor considers this product to be end-of-life, therefore the recommendation is to upgrade to the BRX platform and implement mitigation strategies.
