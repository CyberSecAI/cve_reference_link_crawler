Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within several functions of the "Product Extra Tabs Pro" module. Specifically, the `searchcategory()`, `searchproduct()`, and `searchmanufacturer()` methods use unsanitized search parameters directly in SQL queries, making them susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    * **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the failure to sanitize user input before constructing SQL queries. The module uses string concatenation to build queries, directly inserting the user-provided search term into the SQL `LIKE` clause.

* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    * **Data Breach:** Attackers can steal sensitive data from the database, including admin credentials, customer information, and financial details.
    * **Unauthorized Access:** Successful SQL injection can allow attackers to bypass authentication and gain administrative access to the PrestaShop installation.
    * **Data Manipulation/Deletion:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
    * **Webskimmer Deployment:**  The advisory mentions that the vulnerability is actively being exploited to deploy webskimmers for credit card theft.
    * **Hijacked Emails:** Attackers can rewrite SMTP settings to intercept emails

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Network:** The attack can be carried out remotely over the network by sending crafted POST requests to the `ajax_extratabspro.php` endpoint.
    * **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered through specially crafted POST requests containing malicious SQL code within the search parameters.

* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any prior privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
    * **Basic HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests.

**Additional Details:**

* **Exploitable even if module is not activated:** The vulnerability can be exploited even if the "Product Extra Tabs Pro" module is not activated.
* **Proof of Concept (PoC) provided:** The advisory includes a PoC demonstrating how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability using `curl` commands with a time-based injection payload.
* **Patch Details:** The provided patch shows the use of `pSQL()` function to sanitize user-provided search parameter within the SQL query, addressing the vulnerability. Also, the `id` parameter in the `getSuppliers()` method is cast to integer `(int)`.
* **Actively Exploited:** The advisory highlights that the vulnerability is being actively exploited for malicious purposes.
* **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability is assigned a critical severity score of 9.8.
