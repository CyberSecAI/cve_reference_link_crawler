# Overwrite of builtin Cody commands facilitates RCE

Critical

[andreeleuterio](/andreeleuterio)
published
GHSA-8wmq-fwv7-xmwq
Oct 23, 2023

## Package

Cody AI VSCode extension

## Affected versions

>=0.10.0 <=0.14.0

## Patched versions

0.14.1

## Description

### Impact

The Cody AI VSCode extension versions >=0.10.0 and <=0.14.0 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution under certain conditions.

An attacker in control of a malicious repository could modify the Cody configuration file `.vscode/cody.json` and overwrite Cody commands. If a user with the extension installed opens this malicious repository and runs a Cody command such as /explain or /doc, this could allow arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.

The vulnerability is rated as critical severity, but with low exploitability. It requires the user to have a malicious repository loaded and execute the overwritten command in VS Code. The issue is exploitable regardless of the user blocking code execution on a repository through [VS Code Workspace Trust](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspace-trust).

The issue was found during a regular 3rd party penetration test. We do not have evidence of open source repositories having malicious `.vscode/cody.json` files to exploit this vulnerability.

### Patches

The issue is fixed in version 0.14.1 of the Cody VSCode extension.

### Reference

[PR](https://github.com/sourcegraph/cody/pull/1414)

### Workarounds

In case users can't promptly upgrade they should not open any untrusted repositories with the Cody extension loaded.

You may use the following Sourcegraph search query to find repositories overwriting Cody commands: `file:^.vscode/cody.json$ "command"`. These can be compared against the [default settings](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:sourcegraph/cody+file:%5E.vscode/cody.json%24+%22command%22&patternType=standard&sm=1&groupBy=repo).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @abeatrix **[abeatrix](/abeatrix)** commented [Oct 17, 2023](#issue-1947516631)

RE: <https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C052G9Y5Y8H/p1697536651010599?thread_ts=1697536557.499619&cid=C052G9Y5Y8H>

fix: swap custom prompts and default prompts order

The order of adding custom prompts and default prompts to allCommands map is swapped to prioritize default prompts over custom.

This fixes an issue where custom prompts were overriding default prompts with the same name.

Loom provided by Vincent: <https://www.loom.com/share/d8aea1426d4b409a86fde3eaefc76ed0?sid=2058611d-5f2d-4457-b3cf-6490ceefe08b>

## Test plan

* Create a custom command and name it `explain`
* Before: you will be running the custom command when trying to run `/explain`
* After: the new custom command will not override the built-in `/explain` command
