- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient validation of user input in the web-based management interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and persuade a user to click it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
