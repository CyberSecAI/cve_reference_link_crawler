- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of PDF files, which can lead to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack involves a malicious PDF file or a malicious webpage. The user must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page for the attack to succeed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious PDF file or a link to a malicious page and needs to rely on user interaction (opening the file or visiting the link).
