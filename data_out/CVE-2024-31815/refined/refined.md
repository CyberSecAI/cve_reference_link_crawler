Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists because the `/cgi-bin/ExportSettings.sh` script allows unauthorized access to the `apmib` configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper authentication or authorization checks on the `/cgi-bin/ExportSettings.sh` endpoint. This allows any attacker to access the sensitive configuration file without needing credentials.
- **Information Disclosure:** The `apmib` configuration file, which contains sensitive information like usernames and passwords, is exposed due to the lack of access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain the `apmib` configuration file, which contains usernames and passwords.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** With the leaked credentials, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the device's management interface, leading to further malicious actions such as:
    - Modifying device settings
    - Compromising the network
    - Performing denial-of-service attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the TOTOLINK EX200 device.
- **Direct Request to Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a direct HTTP request to the `/cgi-bin/ExportSettings.sh` URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device or have network access to it.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any login credentials or prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable firmware version is TOTOLINK EX200 V4.0.3c.7314_B20191204.
- The specific filename of the config file will be in the format of Config-EX200-xxxxxxxx.dat
- The decoded file is stated to contain the username and password.
- The provided text has a reference to a firmware download.
