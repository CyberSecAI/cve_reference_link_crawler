Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-2879:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of the cryptographic format used by Oracle Access Manager (OAM) for encrypting messages. Specifically, the use of a block cipher in CBC mode without proper authentication mechanisms allows for a padding oracle attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Padding Oracle:** The system acts as a padding oracle by disclosing whether a provided encrypted string, when decrypted, has a valid padding. This is achieved by the OAM responding differently (or not responding with an error) to properly padded messages versus improperly padded ones, when exploited correctly.
*   **Lack of Authenticity:** The cryptographic format uses a simple MD5 hash for message integrity instead of a HMAC, which does not provide proper authenticity. This allows attackers to calculate the hash without knowing the secret key.
*  **Space Character Bypass:** The OAM ignores any garbage that is appended to a decrypted message if it is separated by a space character, allowing the attacker to append blocks to test padding validity after a valid message with a space.
*   **CBC Mode Weakness**: The vulnerability relies on the use of CBC encryption mode which can be exploited via padding oracle attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** By exploiting the padding oracle, an attacker can decrypt arbitrary messages, including authentication tokens.
*   **Session Token Fabrication:** An attacker can craft valid session tokens for any user.
*   **User Impersonation:** An attacker can impersonate any user known to the OAM, including administrators, gaining access to protected resources and breaking the main functionality of OAM.
*   **Complete takeover:** By crafting a fake cookie with the user's information and encrypting it with the padding oracle attack, an attacker can successfully pass the crafted cookie to the web server, bypassing authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack is conducted over the network by sending specially crafted encrypted messages (encquery, encreply, OAMAuthnCookie) to the OAM or WebGate components.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OAM system and the target web applications.
*   **Understanding of Cryptography:** The attacker needs an understanding of padding oracle attacks and how CBC mode works.
*   **Ability to Capture Encrypted Messages:** The attacker needs to be able to capture valid, encrypted messages from the OAM (e.g., through a browser or proxy) to use as a base for their attacks.
*   **Brute-force:** The attacker needs the ability to perform brute force attacks to find the correct prefix that adds a space character after a valid decrypted message.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affected both OAM 11g and 12c.
*   A successful attack can leave a distinct pattern in logs: a large number of decryption failures resulting from bad padding (*javax.crypto.BadPaddingException*).
*   An exploit script called OAMbuster was released, implementing a multi-threaded version of this attack.
*   Oracle provided a fix in their April 2018 Critical Patch Update.
