package/skeleton-init-sysv: Set sticky bit on /dev/shm

```
/dev/shm is a world-writable directory, like /tmp, and should also
have the sticky bit set.  Without this, any user can delete and
replace another user's files in /dev/shm.

This bug has been present since /dev/shm was added to the skeleton
/etc/fstab, but appears to have been fixed for systems using systemd
by commit [76fc927](https://github.com/buildroot/buildroot/commit/76fc9275f14ec295b0125910464969bfa7441b85) "system: separate sysv and systemd parts of the
skeleton" which went into Buildroot 2017.08.
