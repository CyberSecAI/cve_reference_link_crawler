Thanks for th efeedback. The fix has already been committed, with commit
0b2967e158 (package/skeleton-init-sysv: Set sticky bit on /dev/shm) that
I applied on 2024-04-11.

Yann E. MORIN.

package/skeleton-init-sysv: Set sticky bit on /dev/shm

```
/dev/shm is a world-writable directory, like /tmp, and should also
have the sticky bit set.  Without this, any user can delete and
replace another user's files in /dev/shm.

This bug has been present since /dev/shm was added to the skeleton
/etc/fstab, but appears to have been fixed for systems using systemd
by commit [76fc927](https://github.com/buildroot/buildroot/commit/76fc9275f14ec295b0125910464969bfa7441b85) "system: separate sysv and systemd parts of the
skeleton" which went into Buildroot 2017.08.

Subject: Buildroot: incorrect permissons on /dev/shm

Buildroot is a Linux distribution and system builder for embedded
systems.  Starting in Buildroot 2011.08, its default /etc/fstab
included an entry for /dev/shm with incorrect permissons (sticky bit
not set). (CWE-276)

Buildroot 2017.08 removed this entry for systems using systemd, and it
has never been included for systems using OpenRC.  So this only
affects Buildroot-built systems that use sysvinit, and some older
systems that use systemd.
