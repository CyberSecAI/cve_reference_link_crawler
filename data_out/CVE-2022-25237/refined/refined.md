Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** An overly broad filter pattern in the API authorization filters of Bonita Web allows for authentication/authorization bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Filter Pattern:** The `excludePattern` parameter in the `web.xml` file used for authorization filters is too broad. It checks if a specific string ("i18ntranslation") exists *anywhere* in the URL path to bypass the authorization filter.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** By appending the string "/i18ntranslation/../" or ";i18ntranslation" to the API URL, an attacker can bypass authentication/authorization checks, even with a low-privileged user session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized API Access:** Attackers can access privileged API endpoints without proper authorization.
*  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can leverage the unauthorized API access to deploy malicious code onto the server, resulting in RCE.

**Attack Vectors:**
*  **URL Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the API URL by appending "/i18ntranslation/../" or ";i18ntranslation" to bypass authorization checks.
*  **API Exploitation:** The attacker leverages the API to deploy malicious code once the authorization is bypassed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Valid User Session:** The attacker needs a valid user session, although the user does not need to have any specific permission.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Bonita server where they can make HTTP requests to the vulnerable API endpoints.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Payloads:** After exploiting the authorization bypass, the attacker needs to craft malicious payloads to deploy on the server, if the goal is RCE.

**Additional Details (from the provided content):**
*   The vulnerability is present in Bonita Web versions prior to 2022.1-u0
*   The fix is included in 2022.1-u0 for community and subscription versions, as well as in other subscription versions.
*  The vulnerability exists due to an insecure implementation of a filter in `web.xml`, and more specifically, the logic behind `sessionIsNotNeeded` function.
*  A Proof of Concept (PoC) for achieving code execution is available on the Rhino Security Labs GitHub repository.
