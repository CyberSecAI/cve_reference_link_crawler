- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of malformed NTLM packets by PAN-OS firewalls.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of the syntactic correctness of NTLM input packets (CWE-1286).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can cause the PAN-OS firewall to reboot by sending malformed NTLM packets. Repeated attacks can lead the firewall to enter maintenance mode, requiring manual intervention to recover. This results in a Denial of Service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based; an attacker sends the malicious packets over the network to the firewall.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable firewall. NTLM authentication must be enabled on the firewall for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
