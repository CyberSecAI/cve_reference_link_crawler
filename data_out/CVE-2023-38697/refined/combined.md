## [1.](#section-1) [Introduction](#name-introduction)

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-level
request/response protocol that uses extensible semantics and
self-descriptive messages for flexible interaction with network-based
hypertext information systems. HTTP/1.1 is defined by:[¶](#section-1-1)

* This document[¶](#section-1-2.1)
* "HTTP Semantics" [[HTTP](#HTTP)][¶](#section-1-2.2)
* "HTTP Caching" [[CACHING](#CACHING)][¶](#section-1-2.3)

This document specifies how HTTP semantics are conveyed using the
HTTP/1.1 message syntax, framing, and connection management mechanisms.
Its goal is to define the complete set of requirements for HTTP/1.1
message parsers and message-forwarding intermediaries.[¶](#section-1-3)

This document obsoletes the portions of
[RFC 7230](#RFC7230) related to HTTP/1.1
messaging and connection management, with the changes being summarized in
[Appendix C.3](#changes.from.rfc.7230). The other parts of
[RFC 7230](#RFC7230) are obsoleted by
"HTTP Semantics" [[HTTP](#HTTP)].[¶](#section-1-4)

### [1.1.](#section-1.1) [Requirements Notation](#name-requirements-notation)

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 [[RFC2119](#RFC2119)] [[RFC8174](#RFC8174)]
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.[¶](#section-1.1-1)

Conformance criteria and considerations regarding error handling
are defined in [Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-2) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)].[¶](#section-1.1-2)

### [1.2.](#section-1.2) [Syntax Notation](#name-syntax-notation)

This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of
[[RFC5234](#RFC5234)], extended with the notation for case-sensitivity
in strings defined in [[RFC7405](#RFC7405)].[¶](#section-1.2-1)

It also uses a list extension, defined in [Section 5.6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-5.6.1) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)],
that allows for compact definition of comma-separated lists using a "#"
operator (similar to how the "\*" operator indicates repetition). [Appendix A](#collected.abnf) shows the collected grammar with all list
operators expanded to standard ABNF notation.[¶](#section-1.2-2)

As a convention, ABNF rule names prefixed with "obs-" denote
obsolete grammar rules that appear for historical reasons.[¶](#section-1.2-3)

The following core rules are included by
reference, as defined in [[RFC5234](#RFC5234)], [Appendix B.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5234#appendix-B.1):
ALPHA (letters), CR (carriage return), CRLF (CR LF), CTL (controls),
DIGIT (decimal 0-9), DQUOTE (double quote),
HEXDIG (hexadecimal 0-9/A-F/a-f), HTAB (horizontal tab), LF (line feed),
OCTET (any 8-bit sequence of data), SP (space), and
VCHAR (any visible [[USASCII](#USASCII)] character).[¶](#section-1.2-4)

The rules below are defined in [[HTTP](#HTTP)]:[¶](#section-1.2-5)

```
  BWS           = <BWS, see [HTTP], Section 5.6.3>
  OWS           = <OWS, see [HTTP], Section 5.6.3>
  RWS           = <RWS, see [HTTP], Section 5.6.3>
  absolute-path = <absolute-path, see [HTTP], Section 4.1>
  field-name    = <field-name, see [HTTP], Section 5.1>
  field-value   = <field-value, see [HTTP], Section 5.5>
  obs-text      = <obs-text, see [HTTP], Section 5.6.4>
  quoted-string = <quoted-string, see [HTTP], Section 5.6.4>
  token         = <token, see [HTTP], Section 5.6.2>
  transfer-coding =
                  <transfer-coding, see [HTTP], Section 10.1.4>

```
[¶](#section-1.2-6)

The rules below are defined in [[URI](#URI)]:[¶](#section-1.2-7)

```
  absolute-URI  = <absolute-URI, see [URI], Section 4.3>
  authority     = <authority, see [URI], Section 3.2>
  uri-host      = <host, see [URI], Section 3.2.2>
  port          = <port, see [URI], Section 3.2.3>
  query         = <query, see [URI], Section 3.4>

```
[¶](#section-1.2-8)

## [2.](#section-2) [Message](#name-message)

HTTP/1.1 clients and servers communicate by sending messages.
See [Section 3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-3) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)] for
the general terminology and core concepts of HTTP.[¶](#section-2-1)

### [2.1.](#section-2.1) [Message Format](#name-message-format)

An HTTP/1.1 message consists of a start-line followed by a CRLF and a
sequence of
octets in a format similar to the Internet Message Format
[[RFC5322](#RFC5322)]: zero or more header field lines (collectively
referred to as the "headers" or the "header section"), an empty line
indicating the end of the header section, and an optional message body.[¶](#section-2.1-1)

```
  HTTP-message   = start-line CRLF
                   *( field-line CRLF )
                   CRLF
                   [ message-body ]

```
[¶](#section-2.1-2)

A message can be either a request from client to server or a
response from server to client. Syntactically, the two types of messages
differ only in the start-line, which is either a request-line (for requests)
or a status-line (for responses), and in the algorithm for determining
the length of the message body ([Section 6](#message.body)).[¶](#section-2.1-3)

```
  start-line     = request-line / status-line

```
[¶](#section-2.1-4)

In theory, a client could receive requests and a server could receive
responses, distinguishing them by their different start-line formats.
In practice, servers are implemented to only expect a request
(a response is interpreted as an unknown or invalid request method),
and clients are implemented to only expect a response.[¶](#section-2.1-5)

HTTP makes use of some protocol elements similar to
the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) [[RFC2045](#RFC2045)].
See [Appendix B](#differences.between.http.and.mime) for the
differences between HTTP and MIME messages.[¶](#section-2.1-6)

### [2.2.](#section-2.2) [Message Parsing](#name-message-parsing)

The normal procedure for parsing an HTTP message is to read the
start-line into a structure, read each header field line into a hash
table by field name until the empty line, and then use the parsed
data to determine if a message body is expected. If a message body
has been indicated, then it is read as a stream until an amount
of octets equal to the message body length is read or the connection
is closed.[¶](#section-2.2-1)

A recipient MUST parse an HTTP message as a sequence of octets in an
encoding that is a superset of US-ASCII [[USASCII](#USASCII)].
Parsing an HTTP message as a stream of Unicode characters, without regard
for the specific encoding, creates security vulnerabilities due to the
varying ways that string processing libraries handle invalid multibyte
character sequences that contain the octet LF (%x0A). String-based
parsers can only be safely used within protocol elements after the element
has been extracted from the message, such as within a header field line value
after message parsing has delineated the individual field lines.[¶](#section-2.2-2)

Although the line terminator for the start-line and
fields is the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a
single LF as a line terminator and ignore any preceding CR.[¶](#section-2.2-3)

A sender MUST NOT generate a bare CR (a CR character not immediately
followed by LF) within any protocol elements other than the content.
A recipient of such a bare CR MUST consider that element to be invalid or
replace each bare CR with SP before processing the element or forwarding
the message.[¶](#section-2.2-4)

Older HTTP/1.0 user agent implementations might send an extra CRLF
after a POST request as a workaround for some early server
applications that failed to read message body content that was
not terminated by a line-ending. An HTTP/1.1 user agent MUST NOT
preface or follow a request with an extra CRLF. If terminating
the request message body with a line-ending is desired, then the
user agent MUST count the terminating CRLF octets as part of the
message body length.[¶](#section-2.2-5)

In the interest of robustness, a server that is expecting to receive and
parse a request-line SHOULD ignore at least one empty line (CRLF)
received prior to the request-line.[¶](#section-2.2-6)

A sender MUST NOT send whitespace between the start-line and
the first header field.[¶](#section-2.2-7)

A recipient that receives whitespace between the start-line and
the first header field MUST either reject the message as invalid or
consume each whitespace-preceded line without further processing of it
(i.e., ignore the entire line, along with any subsequent lines preceded
by whitespace, until a properly formed header field is received or the
header section is terminated).
Rejection or removal of invalid whitespace-preceded lines is necessary
to prevent their misinterpretation by downstream recipients that might
be vulnerable to request smuggling ([Section 11.2](#request.smuggling))
or response splitting ([Section 11.1](#response.splitting)) attacks.[¶](#section-2.2-8)

When a server listening only for HTTP request messages, or processing
what appears from the start-line to be an HTTP request message,
receives a sequence of octets that does not match the HTTP-message
grammar aside from the robustness exceptions listed above, the
server SHOULD respond with a 400 (Bad Request) response
and close the connection.[¶](#section-2.2-9)

### [2.3.](#section-2.3) [HTTP Version](#name-http-version)

HTTP uses a "<major>.<minor>" numbering scheme to indicate
versions of the protocol. This specification defines version "1.1".
[Section 2.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-2.5) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)] specifies the semantics of HTTP version
numbers.[¶](#section-2.3-1)

The version of an HTTP/1.x message is indicated by an HTTP-version field
in the [start-line](#message.format). HTTP-version is case-sensitive.[¶](#section-2.3-2)

```
  HTTP-version  = HTTP-name "/" DIGIT "." DIGIT
  HTTP-name     = %s"HTTP"

```
[¶](#section-2.3-3)

When an HTTP/1.1 message is sent to an HTTP/1.0 recipient
[[HTTP/1.0](#HTTP10)] or a recipient whose version is unknown,
the HTTP/1.1 message is constructed such that it can be interpreted
as a valid HTTP/1.0 message if all of the newer features are ignored.
This specification places recipient-version requirements on some
new features so that a conformant sender will only use compatible
features until it has determined, through configuration or the
receipt of a message, that the recipient supports HTTP/1.1.[¶](#section-2.3-4)

Intermediaries that process HTTP messages (i.e., all intermediaries
other than those acting as tunnels) MUST send their own HTTP-version
in forwarded messages, unless it is purposefully downgraded as a workaround
for an upstream issue. In other words, an intermediary is not allowed to blindly
forward the [start-line](#message.format) without ensuring that the
protocol version in that message matches a version to which that
intermediary is conformant for both the receiving and
sending of messages. Forwarding an HTTP message without rewriting
the HTTP-version might result in communication errors when downstream
recipients use the message sender's version to determine what features
are safe to use for later communication with that sender.[¶](#section-2.3-5)

A server MAY send an HTTP/1.0 response to an HTTP/1.1 request
if it is known or suspected that the client incorrectly implements the
HTTP specification and is incapable of correctly processing later
version responses, such as when a client fails to parse the version
number correctly or when an intermediary is known to blindly forward
the HTTP-version even when it doesn't conform to the given minor
version of the protocol. Such protocol downgrades SHOULD NOT be
performed unless triggered by specific client attributes, such as when
one or more of the request header fields (e.g., User-Agent)
uniquely match the values sent by a client known to be in error.[¶](#section-2.3-6)

## [3.](#section-3) [Request Line](#name-request-line)

A request-line begins with a method token, followed by a single
space (SP), the request-target, and another single space (SP), and ends
with the protocol version.[¶](#section-3-1)

```
  request-line   = method SP request-target SP HTTP-version

```
[¶](#section-3-2)

Although the request-line grammar rule requires that each of the component
elements be separated by a single SP octet, recipients MAY instead parse
on whitespace-delimited word boundaries and, aside from the CRLF
terminator, treat any form of whitespace as the SP separator while
ignoring preceding or trailing whitespace; such whitespace includes one or
more of the following octets: SP, HTAB, VT (%x0B), FF (%x0C), or bare CR.
However, lenient parsing can result in request smuggling security
vulnerabilities if there are multiple recipients of the message and each
has its own unique interpretation of robustness
(see [Section 11.2](#request.smuggling)).[¶](#section-3-3)

HTTP does not place a predefined limit on the length of a request-line,
as described in [Section 2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-2.3) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)].
A server that receives a method longer than any that it implements
SHOULD respond with a 501 (Not Implemented) status code.
A server that receives a request-target longer than any URI it wishes to
parse MUST respond with a
414 (URI Too Long) status code (see [Section 15.5.15](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-15.5.15) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]).[¶](#section-3-4)

Various ad hoc limitations on request-line length are found in practice.
It is RECOMMENDED that all HTTP senders and recipients support, at a
minimum, request-line lengths of 8000 octets.[¶](#section-3-5)

### [3.1.](#section-3.1) [Method](#name-method)

The method token indicates the request method to be performed on the
target resource. The request method is case-sensitive.[¶](#section-3.1-1)

```
  method         = token

```
[¶](#section-3.1-2)

The request methods defined by this specification can be found in
[Section 9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-9) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)], along with information regarding the HTTP method
registry and considerations for defining new methods.[¶](#section-3.1-3)

### [3.2.](#section-3.2) [Request Target](#name-request-target)

The request-target identifies the target resource upon which to apply the
request. The client derives a request-target from its desired target URI.
There are four distinct formats for the request-target, depending on both
the method being requested and whether the request is to a proxy.[¶](#section-3.2-1)

```
  request-target = origin-form
                 / absolute-form
                 / authority-form
                 / asterisk-form

```
[¶](#section-3.2-2)

No whitespace is allowed in the request-target.
Unfortunately, some user agents fail to properly encode or exclude
whitespace found in hypertext references, resulting in those disallowed
characters being sent as the request-target in a malformed request-line.[¶](#section-3.2-3)

Recipients of an invalid request-line SHOULD respond with either a
400 (Bad Request) error or a 301 (Moved Permanently)
redirect with the request-target properly encoded. A recipient SHOULD NOT
attempt to autocorrect and then process the request without a redirect,
since the invalid request-line might be deliberately crafted to bypass
security filters along the request chain.[¶](#section-3.2-4)

A client MUST send a Host header field ([Section 7.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-7.2) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)])
in all HTTP/1.1 request messages. If the target URI includes an authority component, then a client MUST
send a field value for Host that is identical to that authority
component, excluding any userinfo subcomponent and its "@" delimiter
([Section 4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-4.2) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]).
If the authority component is missing or undefined for the target URI,
then a client MUST send a Host header field with an empty field value.[¶](#section-3.2-5)

A server MUST respond with a 400 (Bad Request) status code
to any HTTP/1.1 request message that lacks a Host header field and
to any request message that contains more than one Host header field line
or a Host header field with an invalid field value.[¶](#section-3.2-6)

#### [3.2.1.](#section-3.2.1) [origin-form](#name-origin-form)

The most common form of request-target is the "origin-form".[¶](#section-3.2.1-1)

```
  origin-form    = absolute-path [ "?" query ]

```
[¶](#section-3.2.1-2)

When making a request directly to an origin server, other than a CONNECT
or server-wide OPTIONS request (as detailed below),
a client MUST send only the absolute path and query components of
the target URI as the request-target.
If the target URI's path component is empty, the client MUST send
"/" as the path within the origin-form of request-target.
A Host header field is also sent, as defined in
[Section 7.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-7.2) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)].[¶](#section-3.2.1-3)

For example, a client wishing to retrieve a representation of the resource
identified as[¶](#section-3.2.1-4)

```

  http://www.example.org/where?q=now

```
[¶](#section-3.2.1-5)

directly from the origin server would open (or reuse) a TCP connection
to port 80 of the host "www.example.org" and send the lines:[¶](#section-3.2.1-6)

```
GET /where?q=now HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.org

```
[¶](#section-3.2.1-7)

followed by the remainder of the request message.[¶](#section-3.2.1-8)

#### [3.2.2.](#section-3.2.2) [absolute-form](#name-absolute-form)

When making a request to a proxy, other than a CONNECT or server-wide
OPTIONS request (as detailed below), a client MUST send the target URI
in "absolute-form" as the request-target.[¶](#section-3.2.2-1)

```
  absolute-form  = absolute-URI

```
[¶](#section-3.2.2-2)

The proxy is requested to either service that request from a valid cache,
if possible, or make the same request on the client's behalf either to
the next inbound proxy server or directly to the origin server indicated
by the request-target. Requirements on such "forwarding" of messages are
defined in [Section 7.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-7.6) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)].[¶](#section-3.2.2-3)

An example absolute-form of request-line would be:[¶](#section-3.2.2-4)

```
GET http://www.example.org/pub/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1

```
[¶](#section-3.2.2-5)

A client MUST send a Host header field in an HTTP/1.1 request even
if the request-target is in the absolute-form, since this
allows the Host information to be forwarded through ancient HTTP/1.0
proxies that might not have implemented Host.[¶](#section-3.2.2-6)

When a proxy receives a request with an absolute-form of
request-target, the proxy MUST ignore the received
Host header field (if any) and instead replace it with the host
information of the request-target. A proxy that forwards such a request
MUST generate a new Host field value based on the received
request-target rather than forward the received Host field value.[¶](#section-3.2.2-7)

When an origin server receives a request with an absolute-form of
request-target, the origin server MUST ignore the received Host header
field (if any) and instead use the host information of the request-target.
Note that if the request-target does not have an authority component, an
empty Host header field will be sent in this case.[¶](#section-3.2.2-8)

A server MUST accept the absolute-form in requests even though most
HTTP/1.1 clients will only send the absolute-form to a proxy.[¶](#section-3.2.2-9)

#### [3.2.3.](#section-3.2.3) [authority-form](#name-authority-form)

The "authority-form" of request-target is only used for
CONNECT requests ([Section 9.3.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-9.3.6) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]). It consists of only the
uri-host and port number of the tunnel
destination, separated by a colon (":").[¶](#section-3.2.3-1)

```
  authority-form = uri-host ":" port

```
[¶](#section-3.2.3-2)

When making a CONNECT request to establish a tunnel through one or more
proxies, a client MUST send only the host and port of the tunnel
destination as the request-target. The client obtains the host and port
from the target URI's [authority](#imported.uri.rules) component, except that it
sends the scheme's default port if the target URI elides the port.
For example, a CONNECT request to "http://www.example.com" looks like the following:[¶](#section-3.2.3-3)

```
CONNECT www.example.com:80 HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com

```
[¶](#section-3.2.3-4)

#### [3.2.4.](#section-3.2.4) [asterisk-form](#name-asterisk-form)

The "asterisk-form" of request-target is only used for a server-wide
OPTIONS request ([Section 9.3.7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-9.3.7) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]).[¶](#section-3.2.4-1)

```
  asterisk-form  = "*"

```
[¶](#section-3.2.4-2)

When a client wishes to request OPTIONS
for the server as a whole, as opposed to a specific named resource of
that server, the client MUST send only "\*" (%x2A) as the request-target.
For example,[¶](#section-3.2.4-3)

```
OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1

```
[¶](#section-3.2.4-4)

If a proxy receives an OPTIONS request with an absolute-form of
request-target in which the URI has an empty path and no query component,
then the last proxy on the request chain MUST send a request-target
of "\*" when it forwards the request to the indicated origin server.[¶](#section-3.2.4-5)

For example, the request[¶](#section-3.2.4-6)

```
OPTIONS http://www.example.org:8001 HTTP/1.1

```
[¶](#section-3.2.4-7)

would be forwarded by the final proxy as[¶](#section-3.2.4-8)

```
OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.org:8001

```
[¶](#section-3.2.4-9)

after connecting to port 8001 of host "www.example.org".[¶](#section-3.2.4-10)

### [3.3.](#section-3.3) [Reconstructing the Target URI](#name-reconstructing-the-target-u)

The target URI is the [request-target](#request.target) when the
request-target is in [absolute-form](#absolute-form). In that case,
a server will parse the URI into its generic components for further
evaluation.[¶](#section-3.3-1)

Otherwise, the server reconstructs the target URI from the connection
context and various parts of the request message in order to identify the
target resource ([Section 7.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-7.1) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]):[¶](#section-3.3-2)

* If the server's configuration provides for a fixed URI scheme, or a scheme
  is provided by a trusted outbound gateway, that scheme is used for the
  target URI. This is common in large-scale deployments because a gateway
  server will receive the client's connection context and replace that with
  their own connection to the inbound server.
  Otherwise, if the request is received over a secured connection,
  the target URI's scheme is "https"; if not, the scheme is "http".[¶](#section-3.3-3.1)
* If the request-target is in [authority-form](#authority-form),
  the target URI's authority component is the request-target.
  Otherwise, the target URI's authority component is the field value of the
  Host header field. If there is no Host
  header field or if its field value is empty or invalid,
  the target URI's authority component is empty.[¶](#section-3.3-3.2)
* If the request-target is in [authority-form](#authority-form) or
  [asterisk-form](#asterisk-form), the target URI's combined
  path and [query](#imported.uri.rules) component is empty.
  Otherwise, the target URI's combined path and
  [query](#imported.uri.rules) component is the request-target.[¶](#section-3.3-3.3)
* The components of a reconstructed target URI, once determined as above,
  can be recombined into [absolute-URI](#imported.uri.rules) form by concatenating
  the scheme, "://", authority, and combined path and query component.[¶](#section-3.3-3.4)

Example 1: The following message received over a secure connection[¶](#section-3.3-4)

```
GET /pub/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.org

```
[¶](#section-3.3-5)

has a target URI of[¶](#section-3.3-6)

```

  https://www.example.org/pub/WWW/TheProject.html

```
[¶](#section-3.3-7)

Example 2: The following message received over an insecure connection[¶](#section-3.3-8)

```
OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.org:8080

```
[¶](#section-3.3-9)

has a target URI of[¶](#section-3.3-10)

```

  http://www.example.org:8080

```
[¶](#section-3.3-11)

If the target URI's authority component is empty and its URI scheme
requires a non-empty authority (as is the case for "http" and "https"),
the server can reject the request or determine whether a configured
default applies that is consistent with the incoming connection's context.
Context might include connection details like address and port, what
security has been applied, and locally defined information specific to
that server's configuration. An empty authority is replaced with the
configured default before further processing of the request.[¶](#section-3.3-12)

Supplying a default name for authority within the context of a secured
connection is inherently unsafe if there is any chance that the user
agent's intended authority might differ from the default.
A server that can uniquely identify an authority from the request
context MAY use that identity as a default without this risk.
Alternatively, it might be better to redirect the request to a safe
resource that explains how to obtain a new client.[¶](#section-3.3-13)

Note that reconstructing the client's target URI is only half of the
process for identifying a target resource. The other half is determining
whether that target URI identifies a resource for which the server is
willing and able to send a response, as defined in
[Section 7.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-7.4) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)].[¶](#section-3.3-14)

## [4.](#section-4) [Status Line](#name-status-line)

The first line of a response message is the status-line, consisting
of the protocol version, a space (SP), the status code, and another space
and ending with an OPTIONAL textual phrase describing the status code.[¶](#section-4-1)

```
  status-line = HTTP-version SP status-code SP [ reason-phrase ]

```
[¶](#section-4-2)

Although the status-line grammar rule requires that each of the component
elements be separated by a single SP octet, recipients MAY instead parse
on whitespace-delimited word boundaries and, aside from the line
terminator, treat any form of whitespace as the SP separator while
ignoring preceding or trailing whitespace; such whitespace includes one or
more of the following octets: SP, HTAB, VT (%x0B), FF (%x0C), or bare CR.
However, lenient parsing can result in response splitting security
vulnerabilities if there are multiple recipients of the message and each
has its own unique interpretation of robustness
(see [Section 11.1](#response.splitting)).[¶](#section-4-3)

The status-code element is a 3-digit integer code describing the
result of the server's attempt to understand and satisfy the client's
corresponding request. A recipient parses and interprets the remainder
of the response message in light of the semantics defined for that
status code, if the status code is recognized by that recipient,
or in accordance with the class of that status code when the specific
code is unrecognized.[¶](#section-4-4)

```
  status-code    = 3DIGIT

```
[¶](#section-4-5)

HTTP's core status codes are defined in [Section 15](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-15) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)],
along with the classes of status codes, considerations for the
definition of new status codes, and the IANA registry for collecting
such definitions.[¶](#section-4-6)

The reason-phrase element exists for the sole purpose of providing a
textual description associated with the numeric status code, mostly out of
deference to earlier Internet application protocols that were more
frequently used with interactive text clients.[¶](#section-4-7)

```
  reason-phrase  = 1*( HTAB / SP / VCHAR / obs-text )

```
[¶](#section-4-8)

A client SHOULD ignore the reason-phrase content because it is not a
reliable channel for information (it might be translated for a given locale,
overwritten by intermediaries, or discarded when the message is forwarded
via other versions of HTTP).
A server MUST send the space that separates the status-code from the
reason-phrase even when the reason-phrase is absent (i.e., the status-line
would end with the space).[¶](#section-4-9)

## [5.](#section-5) [Field Syntax](#name-field-syntax)

Each field line consists of a case-insensitive field name
followed by a colon (":"), optional leading whitespace, the field line value,
and optional trailing whitespace.[¶](#section-5-1)

```
  field-line   = field-name ":" OWS field-value OWS

```
[¶](#section-5-2)

Rules for parsing within field values are
defined in [Section 5.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-5.5) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]. This section covers the
generic syntax for header field inclusion within, and extraction from,
HTTP/1.1 messages.[¶](#section-5-3)

### [5.1.](#section-5.1) [Field Line Parsing](#name-field-line-parsing)

Messages are parsed using a generic algorithm, independent of the
individual field names. The contents within a given field line value are
not parsed until a later stage of message interpretation (usually after the
message's entire field section has been processed).[¶](#section-5.1-1)

No whitespace is allowed between the field name and colon.
In the past, differences in the handling of such whitespace have led to
security vulnerabilities in request routing and response handling.
A server MUST reject, with a response status code of
400 (Bad Request), any received request message that contains
whitespace between a header field name and colon.
A proxy MUST remove any such whitespace
from a response message before forwarding the message downstream.[¶](#section-5.1-2)

A field line value might be preceded and/or followed by optional whitespace
(OWS); a single SP preceding the field line value is preferred for consistent
readability by humans.
The field line value does not include that leading or trailing whitespace: OWS
occurring before the first non-whitespace octet of the field line value,
or after the last non-whitespace octet of the field line value, is excluded by
parsers when extracting the field line value from a field line.[¶](#section-5.1-3)

### [5.2.](#section-5.2) [Obsolete Line Folding](#name-obsolete-line-folding)

Historically, HTTP/1.x field values could be extended over multiple
lines by preceding each extra line with at least one space or horizontal
tab (obs-fold). This specification deprecates such line folding except
within the "message/http" media type
([Section 10.1](#media.type.message.http)).[¶](#section-5.2-1)

```
  obs-fold     = OWS CRLF RWS
               ; obsolete line folding

```
[¶](#section-5.2-2)

A sender MUST NOT generate a message that includes line folding
(i.e., that has any field line value that contains a match to the
[obs-fold](#line.folding) rule) unless the message is intended for packaging
within the "message/http" media type.[¶](#section-5.2-3)

A server that receives an [obs-fold](#line.folding) in a request message that
is not within a "message/http" container MUST either reject the message by
sending a 400 (Bad Request), preferably with a
representation explaining that obsolete line folding is unacceptable, or
replace each received [obs-fold](#line.folding) with one or more
[SP](#core.rules) octets prior to interpreting the field value or
forwarding the message downstream.[¶](#section-5.2-4)

A proxy or gateway that receives an [obs-fold](#line.folding) in a response
message that is not within a "message/http" container MUST either discard
the message and replace it with a 502 (Bad Gateway)
response, preferably with a representation explaining that unacceptable
line folding was received, or replace each received [obs-fold](#line.folding)
with one or more [SP](#core.rules) octets prior to interpreting the field
value or forwarding the message downstream.[¶](#section-5.2-5)

A user agent that receives an [obs-fold](#line.folding) in a response message
that is not within a "message/http" container MUST replace each received
[obs-fold](#line.folding) with one or more [SP](#core.rules) octets prior to
interpreting the field value.[¶](#section-5.2-6)

## [6.](#section-6) [Message Body](#name-message-body)

The message body (if any) of an HTTP/1.1 message is used to carry content
([Section 6.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-6.4) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]) for the request or response. The
message body is identical to the content unless a transfer coding has
been applied, as described in [Section 6.1](#field.transfer-encoding).[¶](#section-6-1)

```
  message-body = *OCTET

```
[¶](#section-6-2)

The rules for determining when a message body is present in an HTTP/1.1
message differ for requests and responses.[¶](#section-6-3)

The presence of a message body in a request is signaled by a
[Content-Length](#body.content-length) or [Transfer-Encoding](#field.transfer-encoding) header
field. Request message framing is independent of method semantics.[¶](#section-6-4)

The presence of a message body in a response, as detailed in
[Section 6.3](#message.body.length), depends on both the request
method to which it is responding and the response status code.
This corresponds to when response content is
allowed by HTTP semantics ([Section 6.4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-6.4.1) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]).[¶](#section-6-5)

### [6.1.](#section-6.1) [Transfer-Encoding](#name-transfer-encoding)

The Transfer-Encoding header field lists the transfer coding names
corresponding to the sequence of transfer codings that have been
(or will be) applied to the content in order to form the message body.
Transfer codings are defined in [Section 7](#transfer.codings).[¶](#section-6.1-1)

```
  Transfer-Encoding = #transfer-coding
                       ; defined in [HTTP], Section 10.1.4

```
[¶](#section-6.1-2)

Transfer-Encoding is analogous to the Content-Transfer-Encoding field of
MIME, which was designed to enable safe transport of binary data over a
7-bit transport service ([[RFC2045](#RFC2045)], [Section 6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2045#section-6)).
However, safe transport has a different focus for an 8bit-clean transfer
protocol. In HTTP's case, Transfer-Encoding is primarily intended to
accurately delimit dynamically generated content. It also serves to
distinguish encodings that are only applied in transit from the encodings
that are a characteristic of the selected representation.[¶](#section-6.1-3)

A recipient MUST be able to parse the chunked transfer coding
([Section 7.1](#chunked.encoding)) because it plays a crucial role in
framing messages when the content size is not known in advance.
A sender MUST NOT apply the chunked transfer coding more than once to a
message body (i.e., chunking an already chunked message is not allowed).
If any transfer coding other than chunked is applied to a request's content,
the sender MUST apply chunked as the final transfer coding to
ensure that the message is properly framed.
If any transfer coding other than chunked is applied to a response's content,
the sender MUST either apply chunked as the final transfer coding
or terminate the message by closing the connection.[¶](#section-6.1-4)

For example,[¶](#section-6.1-5)

```
Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked

```
[¶](#section-6.1-6)

indicates that the content has been compressed using the gzip
coding and then chunked using the chunked coding while forming the
message body.[¶](#section-6.1-7)

Unlike Content-Encoding ([Section 8.4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-8.4.1) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]),
Transfer-Encoding is a property of the message, not of the representation.
Any recipient along the request/response chain MAY decode the received
transfer coding(s) or apply additional transfer coding(s) to the message
body, assuming that corresponding changes are made to the Transfer-Encoding
field value. Additional information about the encoding parameters can be
provided by other header fields not defined by this specification.[¶](#section-6.1-8)

Transfer-Encoding MAY be sent in a response to a HEAD request or in a
304 (Not Modified) response ([Section 15.4.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-15.4.5) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]) to a GET request,
neither of which includes a message body,
to indicate that the origin server would have applied a transfer coding
to the message body if the request had been an unconditional GET.
This indication is not required, however, because any recipient on
the response chain (including the origin server) can remove transfer
codings when they are not needed.[¶](#section-6.1-9)

A server MUST NOT send a Transfer-Encoding header field in any response
with a status code of
1xx (Informational) or 204 (No Content).
A server MUST NOT send a Transfer-Encoding header field in any
2xx (Successful) response to a CONNECT request ([Section 9.3.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-9.3.6) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]).[¶](#section-6.1-10)

A server that receives a request message with a transfer coding it does
not understand SHOULD respond with 501 (Not Implemented).[¶](#section-6.1-11)

Transfer-Encoding was added in HTTP/1.1. It is generally assumed that
implementations advertising only HTTP/1.0 support will not understand
how to process transfer-encoded content, and that an HTTP/1.0 message
received with a Transfer-Encoding is likely to have been forwarded
without proper handling of the chunked transfer coding in transit.[¶](#section-6.1-12)

A client MUST NOT send a request containing Transfer-Encoding unless it
knows the server will handle HTTP/1.1 requests (or later minor revisions);
such knowledge might be in the form of specific user configuration or by
remembering the version of a prior received response.
A server MUST NOT send a response containing Transfer-Encoding unless
the corresponding request indicates HTTP/1.1 (or later minor revisions).[¶](#section-6.1-13)

Early implementations of Transfer-Encoding would occasionally send both
a chunked transfer coding for message framing and an estimated Content-Length
header field for use by progress bars. This is why Transfer-Encoding is
defined as overriding Content-Length, as opposed to them being mutually
incompatible. Unfortunately, forwarding such a message can lead to
vulnerabilities regarding
request smuggling ([Section 11.2](#request.smuggling)) or
response splitting ([Section 11.1](#response.splitting)) attacks
if any downstream recipient fails to parse the message according to this
specification, particularly when a downstream recipient only implements
HTTP/1.0.[¶](#section-6.1-14)

A server MAY reject a request that contains both Content-Length and
Transfer-Encoding or process such a request in accordance with the
Transfer-Encoding alone. Regardless, the server MUST close the connection
after responding to such a request to avoid the potential attacks.[¶](#section-6.1-15)

A server or client that receives an HTTP/1.0 message containing a
Transfer-Encoding header field MUST treat the message as if the framing
is faulty, even if a Content-Length is present, and close the connection
after processing the message. The message sender might have retained a
portion of the message, in buffer, that could be misinterpreted by further
use of the connection.[¶](#section-6.1-16)

### [6.2.](#section-6.2) [Content-Length](#name-content-length)

When a message does not have a [Transfer-Encoding](#field.transfer-encoding) header
field, a Content-Length header field ([Section 8.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-8.6) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]) can provide the anticipated size,
as a decimal number of octets, for potential content.
For messages that do include content, the Content-Length field value
provides the framing information necessary for determining where the data
(and message) ends. For messages that do not include content, the
Content-Length indicates the size of the selected representation
([Section 8.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-8.6) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]).[¶](#section-6.2-1)

A sender MUST NOT send a Content-Length header field in any message that
contains a [Transfer-Encoding](#field.transfer-encoding) header field.[¶](#section-6.2-2)

**Note:** HTTP's use of Content-Length for message framing differs
significantly from the same field's use in MIME, where it is an optional
field used only within the "message/external-body" media-type.[¶](#section-6.2-3.1)

### [6.3.](#section-6.3) [Message Body Length](#name-message-body-length)

The length of a message body is determined by one of the following
(in order of precedence):[¶](#section-6.3-1)

1. Any response to a HEAD request and any response with a
   1xx (Informational), 204 (No Content), or
   304 (Not Modified) status code is always
   terminated by the first empty line after the header fields, regardless of
   the header fields present in the message, and thus cannot contain a
   message body or trailer section.[¶](#section-6.3-2.1)
2. Any 2xx (Successful) response to a CONNECT request implies that the
   connection will become a tunnel immediately after the empty line that
   concludes the header fields. A client MUST ignore any
   [Content-Length](#body.content-length) or [Transfer-Encoding](#field.transfer-encoding) header
   fields received in such a message.[¶](#section-6.3-2.2)
3. If a message is received with both a [Transfer-Encoding](#field.transfer-encoding)
   and a [Content-Length](#body.content-length) header field, the Transfer-Encoding
   overrides the Content-Length. Such a message might indicate an attempt to
   perform request smuggling ([Section 11.2](#request.smuggling)) or
   response splitting ([Section 11.1](#response.splitting)) and ought to be
   handled as an error.
   An intermediary that chooses to forward the message MUST first remove the
   received Content-Length field and process the Transfer-Encoding
   (as described below) prior to forwarding the message downstream.[¶](#section-6.3-2.3)
4. If a [Transfer-Encoding](#field.transfer-encoding) header field is present
   and the chunked transfer coding ([Section 7.1](#chunked.encoding))
   is the final encoding, the message body length is determined by reading
   and decoding the chunked data until the transfer coding indicates the
   data is complete.[¶](#section-6.3-2.4.1)

   If a [Transfer-Encoding](#field.transfer-encoding) header field is present in a
   response and the chunked transfer coding is not the final encoding, the
   message body length is determined by reading the connection until it is
   closed by the server.[¶](#section-6.3-2.4.2)

   If a [Transfer-Encoding](#field.transfer-encoding) header field is present in a request
   and the chunked transfer coding is not the final encoding, the message body
   length cannot be determined reliably; the server MUST respond with
   the 400 (Bad Request) status code and then close the
   connection.[¶](#section-6.3-2.4.3)
5. If a message is received without [Transfer-Encoding](#field.transfer-encoding) and with
   an invalid [Content-Length](#body.content-length) header field, then the message
   framing is invalid and the recipient MUST treat it as an unrecoverable
   error, unless the field value can be successfully parsed as a
   comma-separated list ([Section 5.6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-5.6.1) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]), all values in the
   list are valid, and all values in the list are the same (in which case, the
   message is processed with that single value used as the Content-Length field
   value).
   If the unrecoverable error is in a request message,
   the server MUST respond with
   a 400 (Bad Request) status code and then close the connection.
   If it is in a response message received by a proxy,
   the proxy MUST close the connection to the server, discard the received
   response, and send a 502 (Bad Gateway) response to the
   client.
   If it is in a response message received by a user agent,
   the user agent MUST close the connection to the server and discard the
   received response.[¶](#section-6.3-2.5)
6. If a valid [Content-Length](#body.content-length) header field is present without
   [Transfer-Encoding](#field.transfer-encoding), its decimal value defines the
   expected message body length in octets.
   If the sender closes the connection or the recipient times out before the
   indicated number of octets are received, the recipient MUST consider
   the message to be incomplete and close the connection.[¶](#section-6.3-2.6)
7. If this is a request message and none of the above are true, then the
   message body length is zero (no message body is present).[¶](#section-6.3-2.7)
8. Otherwise, this is a response message without a declared message body
   length, so the message body length is determined by the number of octets
   received prior to the server closing the connection.[¶](#section-6.3-2.8)

Since there is no way to distinguish a successfully completed,
close-delimited response message from a partially received message interrupted
by network failure, a server SHOULD generate encoding or
length-delimited messages whenever possible. The close-delimiting
feature exists primarily for backwards compatibility with HTTP/1.0.[¶](#section-6.3-3)

**Note:** Request messages are never close-delimited because they are always
explicitly framed by length or transfer coding, with the absence of both implying
the request ends immediately after the header section.[¶](#section-6.3-4.1)

A server MAY reject a request that contains a message body but
not a [Content-Length](#body.content-length) by responding with
411 (Length Required).[¶](#section-6.3-5)

Unless a transfer coding other than chunked has been applied,
a client that sends a request containing a message body SHOULD
use a valid [Content-Length](#body.content-length) header field if the message body
length is known in advance, rather than the chunked transfer coding, since some
existing services respond to chunked with a 411 (Length Required)
status code even though they understand the chunked transfer coding. This
is typically because such services are implemented via a gateway that
requires a content length in advance of being called, and the server
is unable or unwilling to buffer the entire request before processing.[¶](#section-6.3-6)

A user agent that sends a request that contains a message body MUST send
either a valid [Content-Length](#body.content-length) header field or use the
chunked transfer coding. A client MUST NOT use the chunked transfer
coding unless it knows the server will handle HTTP/1.1 (or later)
requests; such knowledge can be in the form of specific user configuration
or by remembering the version of a prior received response.[¶](#section-6.3-7)

If the final response to the last request on a connection has been
completely received and there remains additional data to read, a user agent
MAY discard the remaining data or attempt to determine if that data
belongs as part of the prior message body, which might be the case if the
prior message's Content-Length value is incorrect. A client MUST NOT
process, cache, or forward such extra data as a separate response, since
such behavior would be vulnerable to cache poisoning.[¶](#section-6.3-8)

## [7.](#section-7) [Transfer Codings](#name-transfer-codings)

Transfer coding names are used to indicate an encoding
transformation that has been, can be, or might need to be applied to a
message's content in order to ensure "safe transport" through the network.
This differs from a content coding in that the transfer coding is a
property of the message rather than a property of the representation
that is being transferred.[¶](#section-7-1)

All transfer-coding names are case-insensitive and ought to be registered
within the HTTP Transfer Coding registry, as defined in
[Section 7.3](#transfer.coding.registry).
They are used in the [Transfer-Encoding](#field.transfer-encoding)
([Section 6.1](#field.transfer-encoding)) and TE
([Section 10.1.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-10.1.4) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]) header fields (the latter also
defining the "transfer-coding" grammar).[¶](#section-7-2)

### [7.1.](#section-7.1) [Chunked Transfer Coding](#name-chunked-transfer-coding)

The chunked transfer coding wraps content in order to transfer it
as a series of chunks, each with its own size indicator, followed by an
OPTIONAL trailer section containing trailer fields. Chunked enables content
streams of unknown size to be transferred as a sequence of length-delimited
buffers, which enables the sender to retain connection persistence and the
recipient to know when it has received the entire message.[¶](#section-7.1-1)

```
  chunked-body   = *chunk
                   last-chunk
                   trailer-section
                   CRLF

  chunk          = chunk-size [ chunk-ext ] CRLF
                   chunk-data CRLF
  chunk-size     = 1*HEXDIG
  last-chunk     = 1*("0") [ chunk-ext ] CRLF

  chunk-data     = 1*OCTET ; a sequence of chunk-size octets

```
[¶](#section-7.1-2)

The chunk-size field is a string of hex digits indicating the size of
the chunk-data in octets. The chunked transfer coding is complete when a
chunk with a chunk-size of zero is received, possibly followed by a
trailer section, and finally terminated by an empty line.[¶](#section-7.1-3)

A recipient MUST be able to parse and decode the chunked transfer coding.[¶](#section-7.1-4)

HTTP/1.1 does not define any means to limit the size of a
chunked response such that an intermediary can be assured of buffering the
entire response. Additionally, very large chunk sizes may cause overflows
or loss of precision if their values are not represented accurately in a
receiving implementation. Therefore, recipients MUST anticipate
potentially large hexadecimal numerals and prevent parsing errors due to
integer conversion overflows or precision loss due to integer
representation.[¶](#section-7.1-5)

The chunked coding does not define any parameters. Their presence
SHOULD be treated as an error.[¶](#section-7.1-6)

#### [7.1.1.](#section-7.1.1) [Chunk Extensions](#name-chunk-extensions)

The chunked coding allows each chunk to include zero or more chunk
extensions, immediately following the [chunk-size](#chunked.encoding), for the
sake of supplying per-chunk metadata (such as a signature or hash),
mid-message control information, or randomization of message body size.[¶](#section-7.1.1-1)

```
  chunk-ext      = *( BWS ";" BWS chunk-ext-name
                      [ BWS "=" BWS chunk-ext-val ] )

  chunk-ext-name = token
  chunk-ext-val  = token / quoted-string

```
[¶](#section-7.1.1-2)

The chunked coding is specific to each connection and is likely to be
removed or recoded by each recipient (including intermediaries) before any
higher-level application would have a chance to inspect the extensions.
Hence, the use of chunk extensions is generally limited to specialized HTTP
services such as "long polling" (where client and server can have shared
expectations regarding the use of chunk extensions) or for padding within
an end-to-end secured connection.[¶](#section-7.1.1-3)

A recipient MUST ignore unrecognized chunk extensions.
A server ought to limit the total length of chunk extensions received in a
request to an amount reasonable for the services provided, in the same way
that it applies length limitations and timeouts for other parts of a
message, and generate an appropriate 4xx (Client Error)
response if that amount is exceeded.[¶](#section-7.1.1-4)

#### [7.1.2.](#section-7.1.2) [Chunked Trailer Section](#name-chunked-trailer-section)

A trailer section allows the sender to include additional fields at the end
of a chunked message in order to supply metadata that might be dynamically
generated while the content is sent, such as a message integrity
check, digital signature, or post-processing status. The proper use and
limitations of trailer fields are defined in [Section 6.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-6.5) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)].[¶](#section-7.1.2-1)

```
  trailer-section   = *( field-line CRLF )

```
[¶](#section-7.1.2-2)

A recipient that removes the chunked coding from a message MAY
selectively retain or discard the received trailer fields. A recipient
that retains a received trailer field MUST either store/forward the
trailer field separately from the received header fields or merge the
received trailer field into the header section.
A recipient MUST NOT merge a received trailer field into the
header section unless its corresponding header field definition
explicitly permits and instructs how the trailer field value can be
safely merged.[¶](#section-7.1.2-3)

#### [7.1.3.](#section-7.1.3) [Decoding Chunked](#name-decoding-chunked)

A process for decoding the chunked transfer coding
can be represented in pseudo-code as:[¶](#section-7.1.3-1)

```
  length := 0
  read chunk-size, chunk-ext (if any), and CRLF
  while (chunk-size > 0) {
     read chunk-data and CRLF
     append chunk-data to content
     length := length + chunk-size
     read chunk-size, chunk-ext (if any), and CRLF
  }
  read trailer field
  while (trailer field is not empty) {
     if (trailer fields are stored/forwarded separately) {
         append trailer field to existing trailer fields
     }
     else if (trailer field is understood and defined as mergeable) {
         merge trailer field with existing header fields
     }
     else {
         discard trailer field
     }
     read trailer field
  }
  Content-Length := length
  Remove "chunked" from Transfer-Encoding

```
[¶](#section-7.1.3-2)

### [7.2.](#section-7.2) [Transfer Codings for Compression](#name-transfer-codings-for-compre)

The following transfer coding names for compression are defined by
the same algorithm as their corresponding content coding:[¶](#section-7.2-1)

compress (and x-compress)
See [Section 8.4.1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-8.4.1.1) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)].[¶](#section-7.2-2.2)

deflate
See [Section 8.4.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-8.4.1.2) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)].[¶](#section-7.2-2.4)

gzip (and x-gzip)
See [Section 8.4.1.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-8.4.1.3) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)].[¶](#section-7.2-2.6)

The compression codings do not define any parameters. The presence
of parameters with any of these compression codings SHOULD be treated
as an error.[¶](#section-7.2-3)

### [7.3.](#section-7.3) [Transfer Coding Registry](#name-transfer-coding-registry)

The "HTTP Transfer Coding Registry" defines the namespace for transfer
coding names. It is maintained at <<https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-parameters>>.[¶](#section-7.3-1)

Registrations MUST include the following fields:[¶](#section-7.3-2)

* Name[¶](#section-7.3-3.1)
* Description[¶](#section-7.3-3.2)
* Pointer to specification text[¶](#section-7.3-3.3)

Names of transfer codings MUST NOT overlap with names of content codings
([Section 8.4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-8.4.1) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]) unless the encoding transformation is identical, as
is the case for the compression codings defined in
[Section 7.2](#compression.codings).[¶](#section-7.3-4)

The TE header field ([Section 10.1.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-10.1.4) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]) uses a
pseudo-parameter named "q" as the rank value when multiple transfer codings
are acceptable. Future registrations of transfer codings SHOULD NOT
define parameters called "q" (case-insensitively) in order to avoid
ambiguities.[¶](#section-7.3-5)

Values to be added to this namespace require IETF Review (see
[Section 4.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8126#section-4.8) of [[RFC8126](#RFC8126)]) and MUST
conform to the purpose of transfer coding defined in this specification.[¶](#section-7.3-6)

Use of program names for the identification of encoding formats
is not desirable and is discouraged for future encodings.[¶](#section-7.3-7)

### [7.4.](#section-7.4) [Negotiating Transfer Codings](#name-negotiating-transfer-coding)

The TE field ([Section 10.1.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-10.1.4) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]) is used in HTTP/1.1 to indicate
what transfer codings, besides chunked, the client is willing to accept
in the response and whether the client is willing to preserve
trailer fields in a chunked transfer coding.[¶](#section-7.4-1)

A client MUST NOT send the chunked transfer coding name in TE;
chunked is always acceptable for HTTP/1.1 recipients.[¶](#section-7.4-2)

Three examples of TE use are below.[¶](#section-7.4-3)

```
TE: deflate
TE:
TE: trailers, deflate;q=0.5

```
[¶](#section-7.4-4)

When multiple transfer codings are acceptable, the client MAY rank the
codings by preference using a case-insensitive "q" parameter (similar to
the qvalues used in content negotiation fields; see [Section 12.4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-12.4.2) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]). The rank value
is a real number in the range 0 through 1, where 0.001 is the least
preferred and 1 is the most preferred; a value of 0 means "not acceptable".[¶](#section-7.4-5)

If the TE field value is empty or if no TE field is present, the only
acceptable transfer coding is chunked. A message with no transfer coding
is always acceptable.[¶](#section-7.4-6)

The keyword "trailers" indicates that the sender will not discard trailer
fields, as described in [Section 6.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-6.5) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)].[¶](#section-7.4-7)

Since the TE header field only applies to the immediate connection,
a sender of TE MUST also send a "TE" connection option within the
Connection header field ([Section 7.6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-7.6.1) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)])
in order to prevent the TE header field from being forwarded by intermediaries
that do not support its semantics.[¶](#section-7.4-8)

## [8.](#section-8) [Handling Incomplete Messages](#name-handling-incomplete-message)

A server that receives an incomplete request message, usually due to a
canceled request or a triggered timeout exception, MAY send an error
response prior to closing the connection.[¶](#section-8-1)

A client that receives an incomplete response message, which can occur
when a connection is closed prematurely or when decoding a supposedly
chunked transfer coding fails, MUST record the message as incomplete.
Cache requirements for incomplete responses are defined in
[Section 3.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-3.3) of [[CACHING](#CACHING)].[¶](#section-8-2)

If a response terminates in the middle of the header section (before the
empty line is received) and the status code might rely on header fields to
convey the full meaning of the response, then the client cannot assume
that meaning has been conveyed; the client might need to repeat the
request in order to determine what action to take next.[¶](#section-8-3)

A message body that uses the chunked transfer coding is
incomplete if the zero-sized chunk that terminates the encoding has not
been received. A message that uses a valid [Content-Length](#body.content-length) is
incomplete if the size of the message body received (in octets) is less than
the value given by Content-Length. A response that has neither chunked
transfer coding nor Content-Length is terminated by closure of the
connection and, if the header section was received intact, is considered
complete unless an error was indicated by the underlying connection
(e.g., an "incomplete close" in TLS would leave the response incomplete,
as described in [Section 9.8](#tls.connection.closure)).[¶](#section-8-4)

## [9.](#section-9) [Connection Management](#name-connection-management)

HTTP messaging is independent of the underlying transport- or
session-layer connection protocol(s). HTTP only presumes a reliable
transport with in-order delivery of requests and the corresponding
in-order delivery of responses. The mapping of HTTP request and
response structures onto the data units of an underlying transport
protocol is outside the scope of this specification.[¶](#section-9-1)

As described in [Section 7.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-7.3) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)], the specific
connection protocols to be used for an HTTP interaction are determined by
client configuration and the target URI.
For example, the "http" URI scheme
([Section 4.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-4.2.1) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]) indicates a default connection of TCP
over IP, with a default TCP port of 80, but the client might be
configured to use a proxy via some other connection, port, or protocol.[¶](#section-9-2)

HTTP implementations are expected to engage in connection management,
which includes maintaining the state of current connections,
establishing a new connection or reusing an existing connection,
processing messages received on a connection, detecting connection
failures, and closing each connection.
Most clients maintain multiple connections in parallel, including
more than one connection per server endpoint.
Most servers are designed to maintain thousands of concurrent connections,
while controlling request queues to enable fair use and detect
denial-of-service attacks.[¶](#section-9-3)

### [9.1.](#section-9.1) [Establishment](#name-establishment)

It is beyond the scope of this specification to describe how connections
are established via various transport- or session-layer protocols.
Each HTTP connection maps to one underlying transport connection.[¶](#section-9.1-1)

### [9.2.](#section-9.2) [Associating a Response to a Request](#name-associating-a-response-to-a)

HTTP/1.1 does not include a request identifier for associating a given
request message with its corresponding one or more response messages.
Hence, it relies on the order of response arrival to correspond exactly
to the order in which requests are made on the same connection.
More than one response message per request only occurs when one or more
informational responses (1xx; see [Section 15.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-15.2) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]) precede a
final response to the same request.[¶](#section-9.2-1)

A client that has more than one outstanding request on a connection MUST
maintain a list of outstanding requests in the order sent and MUST
associate each received response message on that connection to the
first outstanding request that has not yet received a final
(non-1xx) response.[¶](#section-9.2-2)

If a client receives data on a connection that doesn't have
outstanding requests, the client MUST NOT consider that data to be a
valid response; the client SHOULD close the connection, since message
delimitation is now ambiguous, unless the data consists only of one or
more CRLF (which can be discarded per
[Section 2.2](#message.parsing)).[¶](#section-9.2-3)

### [9.3.](#section-9.3) [Persistence](#name-persistence)

HTTP/1.1 defaults to the use of "persistent connections",
allowing multiple requests and responses to be carried over a single
connection. HTTP implementations SHOULD support persistent connections.[¶](#section-9.3-1)

A recipient determines whether a connection is persistent or not based on
the protocol version and Connection header field
([Section 7.6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-7.6.1) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]) in the
most recently received message, if any:[¶](#section-9.3-2)

* If the "[close](#persistent.tear-down)" connection option is present
  ([Section 9.6](#persistent.tear-down)), the
  connection will not persist after the current response; else,[¶](#section-9.3-3.1)
* If the received protocol is HTTP/1.1 (or later), the connection will
  persist after the current response; else,[¶](#section-9.3-3.2)
* If the received protocol is HTTP/1.0, the "keep-alive" connection
  option is present, either the recipient is not a proxy or the
  message is a response, and the recipient wishes to honor the
  HTTP/1.0 "keep-alive" mechanism, the connection will persist after
  the current response; otherwise,[¶](#section-9.3-3.3)
* The connection will close after the current response.[¶](#section-9.3-3.4)

A client that does not support [persistent connections](#persistent.connections)
MUST
send the "[close](#persistent.tear-down)" connection option in every request message.[¶](#section-9.3-4)

A server that does not support [persistent connections](#persistent.connections)
MUST
send the "[close](#persistent.tear-down)" connection option in every response message
that does not have a 1xx (Informational) status code.[¶](#section-9.3-5)

A client MAY send additional requests on a persistent connection until it
sends or receives a "[close](#persistent.tear-down)" connection option or receives an
HTTP/1.0 response without a "keep-alive" connection option.[¶](#section-9.3-6)

In order to remain persistent, all messages on a connection need to
have a self-defined message length (i.e., one not defined by closure
of the connection), as described in [Section 6](#message.body).
A server MUST read the entire request message body or close
the connection after sending its response; otherwise, the
remaining data on a persistent connection would be misinterpreted
as the next request. Likewise,
a client MUST read the entire response message body if it intends
to reuse the same connection for a subsequent request.[¶](#section-9.3-7)

A proxy server MUST NOT maintain a persistent connection with an
HTTP/1.0 client (see [Appendix C.2.2](#compatibility.with.http.1.0.persistent.connections) for
information and discussion of the problems with the Keep-Alive header field
implemented by many HTTP/1.0 clients).[¶](#section-9.3-8)

See [Appendix C.2.2](#compatibility.with.http.1.0.persistent.connections)
for more information on backwards compatibility with HTTP/1.0 clients.[¶](#section-9.3-9)

#### [9.3.1.](#section-9.3.1) [Retrying Requests](#name-retrying-requests)

Connections can be closed at any time, with or without intention.
Implementations ought to anticipate the need to recover
from asynchronous close events. The conditions under which a client can
automatically retry a sequence of outstanding requests are defined in
[Section 9.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-9.2.2) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)].[¶](#section-9.3.1-1)

#### [9.3.2.](#section-9.3.2) [Pipelining](#name-pipelining)

A client that supports persistent connections MAY "pipeline"
its requests (i.e., send multiple requests without waiting for each
response). A server MAY process a sequence of pipelined requests in
parallel if they all have safe methods ([Section 9.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-9.2.1) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]), but it MUST send
the corresponding responses in the same order that the requests were
received.[¶](#section-9.3.2-1)

A client that pipelines requests SHOULD retry unanswered requests if the
connection closes before it receives all of the corresponding responses.
When retrying pipelined requests after a failed connection (a connection
not explicitly closed by the server in its last complete response), a
client MUST NOT pipeline immediately after connection establishment,
since the first remaining request in the prior pipeline might have caused
an error response that can be lost again if multiple requests are sent on a
prematurely closed connection (see the TCP reset problem described in
[Section 9.6](#persistent.tear-down)).[¶](#section-9.3.2-2)

Idempotent methods ([Section 9.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-9.2.2) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]) are significant to pipelining
because they can be automatically retried after a connection failure.
A user agent SHOULD NOT pipeline requests after a non-idempotent method,
until the final response status code for that method has been received,
unless the user agent has a means to detect and recover from partial
failure conditions involving the pipelined sequence.[¶](#section-9.3.2-3)

An intermediary that receives pipelined requests MAY pipeline those
requests when forwarding them inbound, since it can rely on the outbound
user agent(s) to determine what requests can be safely pipelined. If the
inbound connection fails before receiving a response, the pipelining
intermediary MAY attempt to retry a sequence of requests that have yet
to receive a response if the requests all have idempotent methods;
otherwise, the pipelining intermediary SHOULD forward any received
responses and then close the corresponding outbound connection(s) so that
the outbound user agent(s) can recover accordingly.[¶](#section-9.3.2-4)

### [9.4.](#section-9.4) [Concurrency](#name-concurrency)

A client ought to limit the number of simultaneous open
connections that it maintains to a given server.[¶](#section-9.4-1)

Previous revisions of HTTP gave a specific number of connections as a
ceiling, but this was found to be impractical for many applications. As a
result, this specification does not mandate a particular maximum number of
connections but, instead, encourages clients to be conservative when opening
multiple connections.[¶](#section-9.4-2)

Multiple connections are typically used to avoid the "head-of-line
blocking" problem, wherein a request that takes significant server-side
processing and/or transfers very large content would block subsequent
requests on the
same connection. However, each connection consumes server resources.[¶](#section-9.4-3)

Furthermore, using multiple connections can cause undesirable side effects
in congested networks.
Using larger numbers of connections can also cause side effects in
otherwise uncongested networks, because their aggregate and initially
synchronized sending behavior can cause congestion that would not have
been present if fewer parallel connections had been used.[¶](#section-9.4-4)

Note that a server might reject traffic that it deems abusive or
characteristic of a denial-of-service attack, such as an excessive number
of open connections from a single client.[¶](#section-9.4-5)

### [9.5.](#section-9.5) [Failures and Timeouts](#name-failures-and-timeouts)

Servers will usually have some timeout value beyond which they will
no longer maintain an inactive connection. Proxy servers might make
this a higher value since it is likely that the client will be making
more connections through the same proxy server. The use of persistent
connections places no requirements on the length (or existence) of
this timeout for either the client or the server.[¶](#section-9.5-1)

A client or server that wishes to time out SHOULD issue a graceful close
on the connection. Implementations SHOULD constantly monitor open
connections for a received closure signal and respond to it as appropriate,
since prompt closure of both sides of a connection enables allocated system
resources to be reclaimed.[¶](#section-9.5-2)

A client, server, or proxy MAY close the transport connection at any
time. For example, a client might have started to send a new request
at the same time that the server has decided to close the "idle"
connection. From the server's point of view, the connection is being
closed while it was idle, but from the client's point of view, a
request is in progress.[¶](#section-9.5-3)

A server SHOULD sustain persistent connections, when possible, and allow
the underlying transport's flow-control mechanisms to resolve temporary overloads rather
than terminate connections with the expectation that clients will retry.
The latter technique can exacerbate network congestion or server load.[¶](#section-9.5-4)

A client sending a message body SHOULD monitor
the network connection for an error response while it is transmitting
the request. If the client sees a response that indicates the server does
not wish to receive the message body and is closing the connection, the
client SHOULD immediately cease transmitting the body and close its side
of the connection.[¶](#section-9.5-5)

### [9.6.](#section-9.6) [Tear-down](#name-tear-down)

The "close" connection option is defined as a signal that the sender
will close this connection after completion of the response.
A sender SHOULD send a Connection header field
([Section 7.6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-7.6.1) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]) containing the "close" connection option
when it intends to close a connection. For example,[¶](#section-9.6-1)

```
Connection: close

```
[¶](#section-9.6-2)

as a request header field indicates that this is the last request that
the client will send on this connection, while in a response, the same
field indicates that the server is going to close this connection after
the response message is complete.[¶](#section-9.6-3)

Note that the field name "Close" is reserved, since using that name as a
header field might conflict with the "close" connection option.[¶](#section-9.6-4)

A client that sends a "close" connection option MUST NOT
send further requests on that connection (after the one containing the
"close") and MUST close the connection after reading the
final response message corresponding to this request.[¶](#section-9.6-5)

A server that receives a "close" connection option MUST
initiate closure of the connection (see below) after it sends the
final response to the request that contained the "close" connection option.
The server SHOULD send a "close" connection option in its final response
on that connection. The server MUST NOT process any further requests
received on that connection.[¶](#section-9.6-6)

A server that sends a "close" connection option MUST
initiate closure of the connection (see below) after it sends the
response containing the "close" connection option. The server MUST NOT process
any further requests received on that connection.[¶](#section-9.6-7)

A client that receives a "close" connection option MUST
cease sending requests on that connection and close the connection
after reading the response message containing the "close" connection option;
if additional pipelined requests had been sent on the connection,
the client SHOULD NOT assume that they will be processed by the server.[¶](#section-9.6-8)

If a server performs an immediate close of a TCP connection, there is a
significant risk that the client will not be able to read the last HTTP
response. If the server receives additional data from the client on a
fully closed connection, such as another request sent by the
client before receiving the server's response, the server's TCP stack will
send a reset packet to the client; unfortunately, the reset packet might
erase the client's unacknowledged input buffers before they can be read
and interpreted by the client's HTTP parser.[¶](#section-9.6-9)

To avoid the TCP reset problem, servers typically close a connection in
stages. First, the server performs a half-close by closing only the write
side of the read/write connection. The server then continues to read from
the connection until it receives a corresponding close by the client, or
until the server is reasonably certain that its own TCP stack has received
the client's acknowledgement of the packet(s) containing the server's last
response. Finally, the server fully closes the connection.[¶](#section-9.6-10)

It is unknown whether the reset problem is exclusive to TCP or might also
be found in other transport connection protocols.[¶](#section-9.6-11)

Note that a TCP connection that is half-closed by the client does not
delimit a request message, nor does it imply that the client is no longer
interested in a response. In general, transport signals cannot be relied
upon to signal edge cases, since HTTP/1.1 is independent of transport.[¶](#section-9.6-12)

### [9.7.](#section-9.7) [TLS Connection Initiation](#name-tls-connection-initiation)

Conceptually, HTTP/TLS is simply sending HTTP messages over a connection
secured via TLS [[TLS13](#TLS13)].[¶](#section-9.7-1)

The HTTP client also acts as the TLS client. It initiates a connection to
the server on the appropriate port and sends the TLS ClientHello to begin
the TLS handshake. When the TLS handshake has finished, the client may then
initiate the first HTTP request. All HTTP data MUST be sent as TLS
"application data" but is otherwise treated like a normal connection for
HTTP (including potential reuse as a persistent connection).[¶](#section-9.7-2)

### [9.8.](#section-9.8) [TLS Connection Closure](#name-tls-connection-closure)

TLS uses an exchange of closure alerts prior to (non-error) connection
closure to provide secure connection closure; see [Section 6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-6.1) of [[TLS13](#TLS13)]. When a
valid closure alert is received, an implementation can be assured that no
further data will be received on that connection.[¶](#section-9.8-1)

When an implementation knows that it has sent or received all the
message data that it cares about, typically by detecting HTTP message
boundaries, it might generate an "incomplete close" by sending a
closure alert and then closing the connection without waiting to
receive the corresponding closure alert from its peer.[¶](#section-9.8-2)

An incomplete close does not call into question the security of the data
already received, but it could indicate that subsequent data might have been
truncated. As TLS is not directly aware of HTTP message framing, it is
necessary to examine the HTTP data itself to determine whether messages are
complete. Handling of incomplete messages is defined in
[Section 8](#incomplete.messages).[¶](#section-9.8-3)

When encountering an incomplete close, a client SHOULD treat as completed
all requests for which it has received either[¶](#section-9.8-4)

1. as much data as specified in the [Content-Length](#body.content-length) header
   field or[¶](#section-9.8-5.1)
2. the terminal zero-length chunk (when [Transfer-Encoding](#field.transfer-encoding) of chunked is used).[¶](#section-9.8-5.2)

A response that has neither chunked
transfer coding nor Content-Length is complete only if a valid closure alert
has been received. Treating an incomplete message as complete could expose
implementations to attack.[¶](#section-9.8-6)

A client detecting an incomplete close SHOULD recover gracefully.[¶](#section-9.8-7)

Clients MUST send a closure alert before closing the connection.
Clients that do not expect to receive any more data MAY choose not
to wait for the server's closure alert and simply close the
connection, thus generating an incomplete close on the server side.[¶](#section-9.8-8)

Servers SHOULD be prepared to receive an incomplete close from the client,
since the client can often locate the end of server data.[¶](#section-9.8-9)

Servers MUST attempt to initiate an exchange of closure alerts with
the client before closing the connection. Servers MAY close the
connection after sending the closure alert, thus generating an
incomplete close on the client side.[¶](#section-9.8-10)

## [10.](#section-10) [Enclosing Messages as Data](#name-enclosing-messages-as-data)

### [10.1.](#section-10.1) [Media Type message/http](#name-media-type-message-http)

The "message/http" media type can be used to enclose a single HTTP request or
response message, provided that it obeys the MIME restrictions for all
"message" types regarding line length and encodings. Because of the line length
limitations, field values within "message/http" are allowed to use
line folding ([obs-fold](#line.folding)), as described in
[Section 5.2](#line.folding), to convey the field value over multiple
lines. A recipient of "message/http" data MUST replace any obsolete line
folding with one or more SP characters when the message is consumed.[¶](#section-10.1-1)

## [11.](#section-11) [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations)

This section is meant to inform developers, information providers, and
users about known security considerations relevant to HTTP message syntax
and parsing. Security considerations about HTTP semantics,
content, and routing are addressed in [[HTTP](#HTTP)].[¶](#section-11-1)

### [11.1.](#section-11.1) [Response Splitting](#name-response-splitting)

Response splitting (a.k.a. CRLF injection) is a common technique, used in
various attacks on Web usage, that exploits the line-based nature of HTTP
message framing and the ordered association of requests to responses on
persistent connections [[Klein](#Klein)]. This technique can be
particularly damaging when the requests pass through a shared cache.[¶](#section-11.1-1)

Response splitting exploits a vulnerability in servers (usually within an
application server) where an attacker can send encoded data within some
parameter of the request that is later decoded and echoed within any of the
response header fields of the response. If the decoded data is crafted to
look like the response has ended and a subsequent response has begun, the
response has been split, and the content within the apparent second response
is controlled by the attacker. The attacker can then make any other request
on the same persistent connection and trick the recipients (including
intermediaries) into believing that the second half of the split is an
authoritative answer to the second request.[¶](#section-11.1-2)

For example, a parameter within the request-target might be read by an
application server and reused within a redirect, resulting in the same
parameter being echoed in the Location header field of the
response. If the parameter is decoded by the application and not properly
encoded when placed in the response field, the attacker can send encoded
CRLF octets and other content that will make the application's single
response look like two or more responses.[¶](#section-11.1-3)

A common defense against response splitting is to filter requests for data
that looks like encoded CR and LF (e.g., "%0D" and "%0A"). However, that
assumes the application server is only performing URI decoding rather
than more obscure data transformations like charset transcoding, XML entity
translation, base64 decoding, sprintf reformatting, etc. A more effective
mitigation is to prevent anything other than the server's core protocol
libraries from sending a CR or LF within the header section, which means
restricting the output of header fields to APIs that filter for bad octets
and not allowing application servers to write directly to the protocol
stream.[¶](#section-11.1-4)

### [11.2.](#section-11.2) [Request Smuggling](#name-request-smuggling)

Request smuggling ([[Linhart](#Linhart)]) is a technique that exploits
differences in protocol parsing among various recipients to hide additional
requests (which might otherwise be blocked or disabled by policy) within an
apparently harmless request. Like response splitting, request smuggling
can lead to a variety of attacks on HTTP usage.[¶](#section-11.2-1)

This specification has introduced new requirements on request parsing,
particularly with regard to message framing in
[Section 6.3](#message.body.length), to reduce the effectiveness of
request smuggling.[¶](#section-11.2-2)

### [11.3.](#section-11.3) [Message Integrity](#name-message-integrity)

HTTP does not define a specific mechanism for ensuring message integrity,
instead relying on the error-detection ability of underlying transport
protocols and the use of length or chunk-delimited framing to detect
completeness. Historically, the lack of
a single integrity mechanism has been justified by the informal nature of
most HTTP communication. However, the prevalence of HTTP as an information
access mechanism has resulted in its increasing use within environments
where verification of message integrity is crucial.[¶](#section-11.3-1)

The mechanisms provided with the "https" scheme, such as authenticated
encryption, provide protection against modification of messages. Care
is needed, however, to ensure that connection closure cannot be used to
truncate messages (see [Section 9.8](#tls.connection.closure)). User agents
might refuse to accept incomplete messages or treat them specially. For
example, a browser being used to view medical history or drug interaction
information needs to indicate to the user when such information is detected
by the protocol to be incomplete, expired, or corrupted during transfer.
Such mechanisms might be selectively enabled via user agent extensions or
the presence of message integrity metadata in a response.[¶](#section-11.3-2)

The "http" scheme provides no protection against accidental or malicious
modification of messages.[¶](#section-11.3-3)

Extensions to the protocol might be used to mitigate the risk of unwanted
modification of messages by intermediaries, even when the "https" scheme is
used. Integrity might be assured by using message authentication codes
or digital
signatures that are selectively added to messages via extensible metadata
fields.[¶](#section-11.3-4)

### [11.4.](#section-11.4) [Message Confidentiality](#name-message-confidentiality)

HTTP relies on underlying transport protocols to provide message
confidentiality when that is desired. HTTP has been specifically designed
to be independent of the transport protocol, such that it can be used
over many forms of encrypted connection, with the selection of
such transports being identified by the choice of URI scheme or within
user agent configuration.[¶](#section-11.4-1)

The "https" scheme can be used to identify resources that require a
confidential connection, as described in [Section 4.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-4.2.2) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)].[¶](#section-11.4-2)

## [12.](#section-12) [IANA Considerations](#name-iana-considerations)

The change controller for the following registrations is:
"IETF (iesg@ietf.org) - Internet Engineering Task Force".[¶](#section-12-1)

### [12.1.](#section-12.1) [Field Name Registration](#name-field-name-registration)

IANA has added the following field names to the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Field
Name Registry" at <<https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-fields>>,
as described in [Section 18.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-18.4) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)].[¶](#section-12.1-1)

[Table 1](#table-1)
| Field Name | Status | Section | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Close | permanent | [9.6](#persistent.tear-down) | (reserved) |
| MIME-Version | permanent | [B.1](#mime-version) |  |
| Transfer-Encoding | permanent | [6.1](#field.transfer-encoding) |  |

### [12.2.](#section-12.2) [Media Type Registration](#name-media-type-registration)

IANA has updated the "Media Types" registry at
<<https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types>>
with the registration information in Sections
[10.1](#media.type.message.http) and
[10.2](#media.type.application.http) for the media types
"message/http" and "application/http", respectively.[¶](#section-12.2-1)

### [12.3.](#section-12.3) [Transfer Coding Registration](#name-transfer-coding-registratio)

IANA has updated the "HTTP Transfer Coding Registry" at
<<https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-parameters/>>
with the registration procedure of [Section 7.3](#transfer.coding.registry)
and the content coding names summarized in the table below.[¶](#section-12.3-1)

[Table 2](#table-2)
| Name | Description | Section |
| --- | --- | --- |
| chunked | Transfer in a series of chunks | [7.1](#chunked.encoding) |
| compress | UNIX "compress" data format [[Welch](#Welch)] | [7.2](#compression.codings) |
| deflate | "deflate" compressed data ([[RFC1951](#RFC1951)]) inside the "zlib" data format ([[RFC1950](#RFC1950)]) | [7.2](#compression.codings) |
| gzip | GZIP file format [[RFC1952](#RFC1952)] | [7.2](#compression.codings) |
| trailers | (reserved) | [12.3](#transfer.coding.registration) |
| x-compress | Deprecated (alias for compress) | [7.2](#compression.codings) |
| x-gzip | Deprecated (alias for gzip) | [7.2](#compression.codings) |

**Note:** the coding name "trailers" is reserved because its use would
conflict with the keyword "trailers" in the TE
header field ([Section 10.1.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-10.1.4) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]).[¶](#section-12.3-3.1)

## [Appendix B.](#appendix-B) [Differences between HTTP and MIME](#name-differences-between-http-an)

HTTP/1.1 uses many of the constructs defined for the
Internet Message Format [[RFC5322](#RFC5322)] and Multipurpose
Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) [[RFC2045](#RFC2045)] to
allow a message body to be transmitted in an open variety of
representations and with extensible fields. However, some
of these constructs have been reinterpreted to better fit the needs
of interactive communication, leading to some differences in how MIME
constructs are used within HTTP. These differences were carefully
chosen to optimize performance over binary connections, allow
greater freedom in the use of new media types, ease date comparisons,
and accommodate common implementations.[¶](#appendix-B-1)

This appendix describes specific areas where HTTP differs from MIME.
Proxies and gateways to and from strict MIME environments need to be
aware of these differences and provide the appropriate conversions
where necessary.[¶](#appendix-B-2)

### [B.1.](#appendix-B.1) [MIME-Version](#name-mime-version)

HTTP is not a MIME-compliant protocol. However, messages can
include a single MIME-Version header field to indicate what
version of the MIME protocol was used to construct the message. Use
of the MIME-Version header field indicates that the message is in
full conformance with the MIME protocol (as defined in [[RFC2045](#RFC2045)]).
Senders are responsible for ensuring full conformance (where
possible) when exporting HTTP messages to strict MIME environments.[¶](#appendix-B.1-1)

### [B.2.](#appendix-B.2) [Conversion to Canonical Form](#name-conversion-to-canonical-for)

MIME requires that an Internet mail body part be converted to canonical
form prior to being transferred, as described in [Section 4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2049#section-4) of [[RFC2049](#RFC2049)], and that content with a type of "text" represents
line breaks as CRLF, forbidding the use of CR or LF outside of line break
sequences [[RFC2046](#RFC2046)]. In contrast, HTTP does not care whether
CRLF, bare CR, or bare LF are used to indicate a line break within content.[¶](#appendix-B.2-1)

A proxy or gateway from HTTP to a strict MIME
environment ought to translate all line breaks within text media
types to the RFC 2049 canonical form of CRLF. Note, however,
this might be complicated by the presence of a Content-Encoding
and by the fact that HTTP allows the use of some charsets
that do not use octets 13 and 10 to represent CR and LF, respectively.[¶](#appendix-B.2-2)

Conversion will break any cryptographic
checksums applied to the original content unless the original content
is already in canonical form. Therefore, the canonical form is
recommended for any content that uses such checksums in HTTP.[¶](#appendix-B.2-3)

### [B.3.](#appendix-B.3) [Conversion of Date Formats](#name-conversion-of-date-formats)

HTTP/1.1 uses a restricted set of date formats ([Section 5.6.7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-5.6.7) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]) to
simplify the process of date comparison. Proxies and gateways from
other protocols ought to ensure that any Date header field
present in a message conforms to one of the HTTP/1.1 formats and rewrite
the date if necessary.[¶](#appendix-B.3-1)

### [B.4.](#appendix-B.4) [Conversion of Content-Encoding](#name-conversion-of-content-encod)

MIME does not include any concept equivalent to HTTP's
Content-Encoding header field. Since this acts as a modifier
on the media type, proxies and gateways from HTTP to MIME-compliant
protocols ought to either change the value of the Content-Type
header field or decode the representation before forwarding the message.
(Some experimental applications of Content-Type for Internet mail have used
a media-type parameter of ";conversions=<content-coding>" to perform
a function equivalent to Content-Encoding. However, this parameter is
not part of the MIME standards.)[¶](#appendix-B.4-1)

### [B.5.](#appendix-B.5) [Conversion of Content-Transfer-Encoding](#name-conversion-of-content-trans)

HTTP does not use the Content-Transfer-Encoding field of MIME.
Proxies and gateways from MIME-compliant protocols to HTTP need to remove
any Content-Transfer-Encoding prior to delivering the response message to
an HTTP client.[¶](#appendix-B.5-1)

Proxies and gateways from HTTP to MIME-compliant protocols are
responsible for ensuring that the message is in the correct format
and encoding for safe transport on that protocol, where "safe
transport" is defined by the limitations of the protocol being used.
Such a proxy or gateway ought to transform and label the data with an
appropriate Content-Transfer-Encoding if doing so will improve the
likelihood of safe transport over the destination protocol.[¶](#appendix-B.5-2)

### [B.6.](#appendix-B.6) [MHTML and Line Length Limitations](#name-mhtml-and-line-length-limit)

HTTP implementations that share code with MHTML [[RFC2557](#RFC2557)]
implementations need to be aware of MIME line length limitations.
Since HTTP does not have this limitation, HTTP does not fold long lines.
MHTML messages being transported by HTTP follow all conventions of MHTML,
including line length limitations and folding, canonicalization, etc.,
since HTTP transfers message-bodies without modification and, aside from the
"multipart/byteranges" type ([Section 14.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-14.6) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]),
does not interpret
the content or any MIME header lines that might be contained therein.[¶](#appendix-B.6-1)

## [Appendix C.](#appendix-C) [Changes from Previous RFCs](#name-changes-from-previous-rfcs)

### [C.1.](#appendix-C.1) [Changes from HTTP/0.9](#name-changes-from-http-09)

Since HTTP/0.9 did not support header fields in a request, there is no
mechanism for it to support name-based virtual hosts (selection of resource
by inspection of the Host header field).
Any server that implements name-based virtual hosts ought to disable
support for HTTP/0.9. Most requests that appear to be HTTP/0.9 are, in
fact, badly constructed HTTP/1.x requests caused by a client failing to
properly encode the request-target.[¶](#appendix-C.1-1)

### [C.2.](#appendix-C.2) [Changes from HTTP/1.0](#name-changes-from-http-10)

#### [C.2.1.](#appendix-C.2.1) [Multihomed Web Servers](#name-multihomed-web-servers)

The requirements that clients and servers support the Host
header field ([Section 7.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-7.2) of [[HTTP](#HTTP)]), report an error if it is
missing from an HTTP/1.1 request, and accept absolute URIs
([Section 3.2](#request.target))
are among the most important changes defined by HTTP/1.1.[¶](#appendix-C.2.1-1)

Older HTTP/1.0 clients assumed a one-to-one relationship of IP
addresses and servers; there was no established mechanism for
distinguishing the intended server of a request other than the IP address
to which that request was directed. The Host header field was
introduced during the development of HTTP/1.1 and, though it was
quickly implemented by most HTTP/1.0 browsers, additional requirements
were placed on all HTTP/1.1 requests in order to ensure complete
adoption. At the time of this writing, most HTTP-based services
are dependent upon the Host header field for targeting requests.[¶](#appendix-C.2.1-2)

#### [C.2.2.](#appendix-C.2.2) [Keep-Alive Connections](#name-keep-alive-connections)

In HTTP/1.0, each connection is established by the client prior to the
request and closed by the server after sending the response. However, some
implementations implement the explicitly negotiated ("Keep-Alive") version
of persistent connections described in [Section 19.7.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2068#section-19.7.1) of [[RFC2068](#RFC2068)].[¶](#appendix-C.2.2-1)

Some clients and servers might wish to be compatible with these previous
approaches to persistent connections, by explicitly negotiating for them
with a "Connection: keep-alive" request header field. However, some
experimental implementations of HTTP/1.0 persistent connections are faulty;
for example, if an HTTP/1.0 proxy server doesn't understand
Connection, it will erroneously forward that header field
to the next inbound server, which would result in a hung connection.[¶](#appendix-C.2.2-2)

One attempted solution was the introduction of a Proxy-Connection header
field, targeted specifically at proxies. In practice, this was also
unworkable, because proxies are often deployed in multiple layers, bringing
about the same problem discussed above.[¶](#appendix-C.2.2-3)

As a result, clients are encouraged not to send the Proxy-Connection header
field in any requests.[¶](#appendix-C.2.2-4)

Clients are also encouraged to consider the use of "Connection: keep-alive"
in requests carefully; while they can enable persistent connections with
HTTP/1.0 servers, clients using them will need to monitor the
connection for "hung" requests (which indicate that the client ought to stop
sending the header field), and this mechanism ought not be used by clients
at all when a proxy is being used.[¶](#appendix-C.2.2-5)

#### [C.2.3.](#appendix-C.2.3) [Introduction of Transfer-Encoding](#name-introduction-of-transfer-en)

HTTP/1.1 introduces the [Transfer-Encoding](#field.transfer-encoding) header field
([Section 6.1](#field.transfer-encoding)).
Transfer codings need to be decoded prior to forwarding an HTTP message
over a MIME-compliant protocol.[¶](#appendix-C.2.3-1)

### [C.3.](#appendix-C.3) [Changes from RFC 7230](#name-changes-from-rfc-7230)

Most of the sections introducing HTTP's design goals, history, architecture,
conformance criteria, protocol versioning, URIs, message routing, and
header fields have been moved to [[HTTP](#HTTP)].
This document has been reduced to just the messaging syntax and
connection management requirements specific to HTTP/1.1.[¶](#appendix-C.3-1)

Bare CRs have been prohibited outside of content.
([Section 2.2](#message.parsing))[¶](#appendix-C.3-2)

The ABNF definition of [authority-form](#authority-form) has changed from the
more general authority component of a URI (in which port is optional) to
the specific host:port format that is required by CONNECT.
([Section 3.2.3](#authority-form))[¶](#appendix-C.3-3)

Recipients are required to avoid smuggling/splitting attacks when processing an
ambiguous message framing.
([Section 6.1](#field.transfer-encoding))[¶](#appendix-C.3-4)

In the ABNF for chunked extensions, (bad) whitespace around
";" and "=" has been reintroduced. Whitespace was removed
in [[RFC7230](#RFC7230)], but that change was found to break existing
implementations. ([Section 7.1.1](#chunked.extension))[¶](#appendix-C.3-5)

Trailer field semantics now transcend the specifics of chunked transfer coding.
The decoding algorithm for chunked ([Section 7.1.3](#decoding.chunked)) has
been updated to encourage storage/forwarding of trailer fields separately
from the header section, to only allow merging into the header section if
the recipient knows the corresponding field definition permits and defines
how to merge, and otherwise to discard the trailer fields instead of
merging. The trailer part is now called the trailer section to be more
consistent with the header section and more distinct from a body part.
([Section 7.1.2](#chunked.trailer.section))[¶](#appendix-C.3-6)

Transfer coding parameters called "q" are disallowed in order to avoid
conflicts with the use of ranks in the TE header field.
([Section 7.3](#transfer.coding.registry))[¶](#appendix-C.3-7)

# Strict validation of content length and chunk length.

Moderate

Aug 2, 2023

## Package

bundler

protocol-http1
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

<0.15.1

## Patched versions

0.15.1

## Description

### Impact

[RFC 9112 Section 7.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#name-chunked-transfer-coding) defined the format of chunk size, chunk data and chunk extension (detailed ABNF is in Appendix section).

In summary:

* The value of Content-Length header should be a string of 0-9 digits.
* The chunk size should be a string of hex digits and should split from chunk data using CRLF.
* The chunk extension shouldn't contain any invisible character.

However, we found that Falcon has following behaviors while disobey the corresponding RFCs.

* Falcon accepts Content-Length header values that have "+" prefix.
* Falcon accepts Content-Length header values that written in hexadecimal with "0x" prefix.
* Falcon accepts "0x" and "+" prefixed chunk size.
* Falcon accepts LF in chunk extension.

This behavior can lead to desync when forwarding through multiple HTTP parsers, potentially results in HTTP request smuggling and firewall bypassing. Note that while these issues were reproduced in Falcon (the server), the issue is with `protocol-http1` which implements the HTTP/1 protocol parser. We have not yet been advised of any real world exploit or practical attack.

### Patches

Fixed in `protocol-http1` v0.15.1+.

### Workarounds

No.

### References

[#20](https://github.com/socketry/protocol-http1/pull/20)

Discovered by Keran Mu and Jianjun Chen, from Tsinghua University and Zhongguancun Laboratory.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @ioquatix **[ioquatix](/ioquatix)** commented [Jul 30, 2023](#issue-1827744925) • edited Loading

Security researchers [@mukeran](https://github.com/mukeran) and [@chenjj](https://github.com/chenjj) have reported issues with parsing content length and chunk lengths:

[RFC 9112 Section 7.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#name-chunked-transfer-coding) defined the format of chunk size, chunk data and chunk extension (detailed ABNF is in Appendix secion).

In a word:

* The value of Content-Length header should be a string of 0-9 digits.
* The chunk size should be a string of hex digits and should split from chunk data using CRLF.
* The chunk extension shouldn't contain any invisible character.

However, we found that Falcon has following behaviors while disobey the corresponding RFCs.

* Falcon accepts Content-Length header values that have "+" prefix.
* Falcon accepts Content-Length header values that written in hexadecimal with "0x" prefix.
* Falcon accepts "0x" and "+" prefixed chunk size.
* Falcon accepts LF in chunk extension.

This behavior can lead to desync when forwarding through multiple HTTP parsers, potentially results in HTTP request smuggling and firewall bypassing.

When sending the following requests to the server, falcon successfully parsed our requests and our application successfully read request body.

## Impact

The above is a valid assessment of the behaviour of the HTTP/1 parser. However, as this gem does not expose the raw body or forward it in any way, I don't believe it can cause issues in the real world. However, I accept that stricter parsing of the length fields is a good idea.

Regarding chunk extensions, these are ignored and not exposed to the user. Therefore, I don't believe it would be valuable to validate these. Feel free to correct me here.

## Actions

* Adopt stricter parsing of the content length field according to the RFC.
* Adopt stricter parsing of the chunk length according to the RFC.
* Explicitly ignore any chunk extension fields.

## Types of Changes

* Security

## Contribution

* I added tests for my changes.
* I tested my changes locally.
* I agree to the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1](https://developercertificate.org/).

Sorry, something went wrong.
