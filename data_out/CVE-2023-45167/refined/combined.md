# Security Bulletin: AIX is affected by a denial of service (CVE-2023-45167) and a security restrictions bypass (CVE-2023-40217) due to Python

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

A vulnerability in Python could allow a non-privileged local user to cause a denial of service (CVE-2023-45167) and a remote attacker to cause a security restrictions bypass (CVE-2023-40217). Python is used by AIX as part of Ansible node management automation.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2023-45167](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/267965)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| AIX | 7.3 |
| VIOS | 4.1 |

The following fileset levels are vulnerable:

| Fileset | Lower Level | Upper Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| python3.9.base | 3.9.0.0 | 3.9.17.1 |

Note:

A. Latest level of Python fileset is available from the web download site:

<https://www.ibm.com/resources/mrs/assets?source=aixbp>

To find out whether the affected filesets are installed on your systems, refer to the lslpp command found in the AIX user's guide.

Example:  lslpp -L | grep -i python3.9.base

## Remediation/Fixes

**FIXES**

IBM strongly recommends addressing the vulnerability now.

A fix is available, and it can be downloaded from:

<https://www.ibm.com/resources/mrs/assets?source=aixbp>

To extract the fixes from the tar file:

zcat python-3.9.18.0.tar.Z | tar xvf -

IMPORTANT: If possible, it is recommended that a mksysb backup of the system be created.  Verify it is both bootable and readable before proceeding.

Note that all the previously reported security vulnerability fixes are also included in above mentioned fileset level.

To preview the fix installation:

installp -apYd . python3.9.base

To install the fix package:

installp -aXYd . python3.9.base

openssl dgst -sha256 -verify [pubkey\_file] -signature [advisory\_file].sig [advisory\_file]

openssl dgst -sha256 -verify [pubkey\_file] -signature [ifix\_file].sig [ifix\_file]

## Disclaimer

According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.

IBM SECURITY ADVISORY
First Issued: Tue Nov 7 11:16:49 CST 2023
The most recent version of this document is available here:
https://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/python\_advisory6.asc
Security Bulletin: AIX is affected by a denial of service (CVE-2023-45167) and
a security restrictions bypass (CVE-2023-40217) due to Python
===============================================================================
SUMMARY:
A vulnerability in Python could allow a non-privileged local user to cause
a denial of service (CVE-2023-45167) and a remote attacker to cause a
security restrictions bypass (CVE-2023-40217). Python is used by AIX as
part of Ansible node management automation.
===============================================================================
VULNERABILITY DETAILS:
CVEID: CVE-2023-45167
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-45167
DESCRIPTION: IBM AIX's Python implementation could allow a non-privileged
local user to exploit a vulnerability to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 6.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See
https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/267965
for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined
CVSS Vector:(CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
CVEID: CVE-2023-40217
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-40217
DESCRIPTION: Python could allow a remote attacker to bypass security
restrictions, caused by a race condition in the SSLSocket module.
When the socket is closed before the TLS handshake is complete, the
data is treated as if it had been encrypted by TLS. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability to bypass the TLS handshake and inject a
malicious client certificate into the connection and gain access to
the server's resources without being authenticated.
CVSS Base Score: 7.4
CVSS Temporal Score: See
https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/264374
