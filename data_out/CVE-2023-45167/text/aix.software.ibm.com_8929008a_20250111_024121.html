Security Bulletin: AIX is affected by a denial of service (CVE-2023-45167) and
a security restrictions bypass (CVE-2023-40217) due to Python
===============================================================================
SUMMARY:
A vulnerability in Python could allow a non-privileged local user to cause
a denial of service (CVE-2023-45167) and a remote attacker to cause a
security restrictions bypass (CVE-2023-40217). Python is used by AIX as
part of Ansible node management automation.
===============================================================================
VULNERABILITY DETAILS:
CVEID: CVE-2023-45167
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-45167
DESCRIPTION: IBM AIX's Python implementation could allow a non-privileged
local user to exploit a vulnerability to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 6.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See
https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/267965
for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined
CVSS Vector:(CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
CVEID: CVE-2023-40217
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-40217
DESCRIPTION: Python could allow a remote attacker to bypass security
restrictions, caused by a race condition in the SSLSocket module.
When the socket is closed before the TLS handshake is complete, the
data is treated as if it had been encrypted by TLS. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability to bypass the TLS handshake and inject a
malicious client certificate into the connection and gain access to
the server's resources without being authenticated.
CVSS Base Score: 7.4
CVSS Temporal Score: See
https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/264374
for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined
CVSS Vector:(CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)
AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS:
AIX 7.3
VIOS 4.1
The following fileset levels are vulnerable:
key\_fileset = osrcaix
Fileset Lower Level Upper Level KEY
------------------------------------------------------
python3.9.base 3.9.0.0 3.9.17.1 key\_w\_fs
Note:
A. Latest level of Python fileset is available from the web download site:
https://www.ibm.com/resources/mrs/assets?source=aixbp
To find out whether the affected filesets are installed on your systems,
refer to the lslpp command found in the AIX user's guide.
Example: lslpp -L | grep -i python3.9.base
REMEDIATION:
FIXES
IBM strongly recommends addressing the vulnerability now.
A fix is available, and it can be downloaded from:
https://www.ibm.com/resources/mrs/assets?source=aixbp
To extract the fixes from the tar file:
zcat python-3.9.18.0.tar.Z | tar xvf -
IMPORTANT: If possible, it is recommended that a mksysb backup
of the system be created. Verify it is both bootable and
readable before proceeding.
Note that all the previously reported security vulnerability fixes
are also included in above mentioned fileset level.
To preview the fix installation:
installp -apYd . python3.9.base
To install the fix package:
installp -aXYd . python3.9.base
