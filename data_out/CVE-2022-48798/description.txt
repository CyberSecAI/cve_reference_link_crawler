In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/cio: verify the driver availability for path_event call

If no driver is attached to a device or the driver does not provide the
path_event function, an FCES path-event on this device could end up in a
kernel-panic. Verify the driver availability before the path_event
function call.
