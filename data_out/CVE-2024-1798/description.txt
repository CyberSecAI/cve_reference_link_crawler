The Tutor LMS â€“ Migration Tool plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the tutor_lp_export_xml function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to export courses, including private and password protected courses.
