- **Root cause:** Improper input validation in UEFI Firmware.
- **Weaknesses:** The UEFI firmware lacks proper input validation, specifically boundary checks.
- **Impact:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute SMM (System Management Mode) memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or system instability.
- **Attack vector:** Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the vulnerable system to trigger the vulnerability by providing malicious input to the UEFI firmware.
