Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50436:

**CVE-2023-50436**

*   **Description:** The internal Full Admin user for cluster management credentials leaked to the log file.
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** A logging event caused the internal `@ns_server` admin credentials to be leaked in an encoded form within the `diag.log` file.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Credential Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive admin credentials in a log file, which should not occur under normal circumstances. The credentials were not properly redacted or masked before being written to the log.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** If an attacker gains access to the `diag.log` file, they can potentially extract the leaked credentials. This would allow the attacker to gain full administrative privileges over the Couchbase cluster.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** With admin privileges, the attacker can gain full control over the database, including data manipulation, deletion, and access to sensitive information, which could result in a full compromise of the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Log File Access:** Attackers need access to the server's filesystem where the `diag.log` is stored. This could happen via:
        *   **Compromised System:** An attacker who has already compromised the server where Couchbase is running.
        *   **Internal Access:** A malicious insider with access to the server's filesystem or the logs.
        *   **Vulnerable Backup:** Accessing the log file via compromised backups that are not properly secured.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Access to Log Files:** The attacker must have the ability to read the `diag.log` file.
    *   **Knowledge of Encoding:** The attacker would need to be able to decode the credentials to gain access to the system.

This information is more detailed than the official CVE description, as it explains the specific mechanism of the vulnerability (logging of internal credentials), the required access to exploit the vulnerability (filesystem access to the log file) and the potential impact of the exploit.
