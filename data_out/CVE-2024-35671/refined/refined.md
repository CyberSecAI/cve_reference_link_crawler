- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, allowing an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute higher privileged actions, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or access to sensitive data. The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a function within the WordPress plugin `MJ Update History` that lacks appropriate access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A user with `Contributor` privilege (or less) is required to exploit the vulnerability.
