Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how the `get_refresh_token` function in `saleor.graphql.account.mutations.authentication.refresh_token.py` handles the refresh token. The original code prioritizes a refresh token passed in the request body over a token present in cookies. This behavior bypasses CSRF protection measures, as an attacker can supply a token in the request body without a valid CSRF token.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CSRF Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the bypass of CSRF protection. The logic in `get_refresh_token` allows an attacker to submit a refresh token in the request body, which is then used to generate new JWT tokens, bypassing the intended CSRF protection mechanism that relies on cookies and checking of the CSRF token.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a malicious actor to gain access to the signed-in user's JWT tokens. This access can be used to impersonate the user, potentially leading to account takeover, unauthorized access to resources, and data breaches.
- **Mitigation through CORS:** The vulnerability is mitigated to some extent by browsers' CORS policies, which prevent cross-origin requests. However, if the server is configured to allow all hosts, this mitigation is ineffective.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as the attacker sends crafted requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires user interaction, as the victim must be tricked into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request that includes a valid refresh token in the request body.
- The attacker must also induce a logged-in user to send this malicious request. This could be achieved via social engineering techniques or by exploiting other web vulnerabilities.

**Technical Details:**
- The original code in `saleor.graphql.account.mutations.authentication.refresh_token.py` had the following logic:
```python
def get_refresh_token(cls, info: ResolveInfo, refresh_token: Optional[str] = None) -> Optional[str]:
    request = info.context
    refresh_token = refresh_token or request.COOKIES.get(
        JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME, None
    )
    return refresh_token
```
- The vulnerability lies in the line `refresh_token = refresh_token or request.COOKIES.get(...)`, which prioritizes the refresh token passed in the body over the one in the cookie if a token is passed via body.
- The corrected code now ensures that the refresh token from the cookie is used if no token is explicitly passed as argument:
```python
  def get_refresh_token(cls, info: ResolveInfo, refresh_token: Optional[str] = None) -> Optional[str]:
      request = info.context
      if refresh_token is None:
          refresh_token = request.COOKIES.get(JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME, None)
      return refresh_token
```
- The fix ensures that the cookie is only used to fetch a token, if the `refresh_token` parameter was not provided via other means. This restores the CSRF protection.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix results in the function returning `JWT_MISSING_TOKEN` instead of `JWT_INVALID_TOKEN` when the token is missing.
- The provided commit diff highlights the code changes required to fix the issue.
