# CSRF bypass in refreshToken mutation

## Package

saleor
(GHCR)

## Affected versions

>= 3.10.0, < 3.14.64
>= 3.15.0, < 3.15.39
>= 3.16.0, < 3.16.39
>= 3.17.0, < 3.17.35
>= 3.18.0, < 3.18.31
>= 3.19.0, < 3.19.19

## Patched versions

3.14.64
3.15.39
3.16.39
3.17.35
3.18.31
3.19.19

## Description

A CSRF bypass vulnerability was present in the refresh token mutation.

### Impact

Malicious actors could abuse the `refreshToken` to gain access to the signed-in user's JWT tokens. It is mitigated by browsers through CORS out of the box (unless configured to allow all hosts).

### Workaround

Replace `saleor.graphql.account.mutations.authentication.refresh_token.py.get_refresh_token`:

```
def get_refresh_token(cls, info: ResolveInfo, refresh_token: Optional[str] = None) -> Optional[str]:
    request = info.context
    refresh_token = refresh_token or request.COOKIES.get(
        JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME, None
    )
    return refresh_token

```

with:

```
  def get_refresh_token(cls, info: ResolveInfo, refresh_token: Optional[str] = None) -> Optional[str]:
      request = info.context
      if refresh_token is None:
          refresh_token = request.COOKIES.get(JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME, None)
      return refresh_token

```

This will fix the issue, but be aware, that it returns `JWT_MISSING_TOKEN` instead of `JWT_INVALID_TOKEN`

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
