The provided content contains detailed information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2022-41001.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the use of `sprintf` with unchecked input sizes when parsing commands in the `DetranCLI` binary. The `sprintf` function writes formatted output to a buffer without verifying if the buffer has enough space, leading to buffer overflows.

**Vulnerability:**
- **CWE-120:**  Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')
- Stack-based buffer overflow when parsing the `icmp check link` command due to unchecked input sizes in the `sprintf` function.

**Impact:**
An attacker can send a specially crafted network packet to trigger a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted network packet containing the vulnerable command `icmp check link WORD destination WORD interval <1-255> retries <1-255> description (WORD|null)`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device.
- The attacker needs to know the specific command and its structure to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker likely needs to have some level of access to the device's command-line interface or be able to send commands through a network service. The CVSS score indicates high privileges are needed, which likely means an attacker would need to be an authenticated user or be able to take advantage of other vulnerabilties to reach the DetranCLI interface

**Specific details for CVE-2022-41001:**
- Vulnerable command template: `icmp check link WORD destination WORD interval <1-255> retries <1-255> description (WORD|null)`
- Vulnerable code snippet: `sprintf(buff_0x80,"%d<%s<%s<%d<%d<%s",1,*argv,argv[1],atoi_argv_2,atoi_argv[3],argv[4]);`
- The buffer `buff_0x80` is a stack buffer of 128 bytes, and the size of the arguments are not checked. The `atoi_argv_2`, `atoi_argv[3]` and `argv[4]` are user-supplied values and can be manipulated to create an overflow.
