<P>Certain Avaya products utilize Microsoft Operating Systems and may be affected by this vulnerability.</P>

<P><B>Recommended Actions for System Products:</B><BR>Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow 
networking and security best practices by implementing 
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate 
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such 
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's 
product and the surrounding network from this potential 
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these 
practices are implemented until such time as the product 
recommended action is applied. 
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the 
customer's security policies may be required during this 
interim period.</P>

<H2>3. Avaya Software-Only Products:</H2>
<P>Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose 
operating systems.  Occasionally 
vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying 
operating system or applications that come with the operating system.  
These vulnerabilities often do not impact the 
software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of 
the underlying platform.</P>
<P>In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are 
not affected by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Microsoft Windows 
platform may be.  For affected Microsoft Operating Systems, 
Microsoft recommends installing patches.  Detailed instructions for 
patching the Operating System are given by Microsoft at the following link:</P>
