  - Root cause of vulnerability: Multiple vulnerabilities in Oracle MySQL Server versions through 8.0.36 and 8.3.0. These vulnerabilities stem from flaws within the MySQL server code itself and its components, including but not limited to the data dictionary, optimizer, DML, DDL, thread pooling, and group replication plugin.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Multiple weaknesses are present, including:
    *   Bugs in the server's DML and DDL handling.
    *   Flaws in the data dictionary.
    *   Issues with the optimizer.
    *   Incorrect permission checking in the security/privileges subsystem.
    *   Vulnerabilities in the server's thread pooling mechanism.
    *   Flaws in the Group Replication Plugin.
    *   OpenSSL related issues.
  - Impact of exploitation:
    *   Complete Denial of Service (DOS): The server may hang or crash repeatedly.
    *   Partial Denial of Service (DOS): The server may become unstable or operate with degraded performance.
    *   Unauthorized Data Access: Attackers may gain unauthorized access to read, update, insert, or delete data accessible by MySQL Server.
  - Attack vectors:
    *   Network access via multiple protocols, including MySQL protocol and TLS.
    *   Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the server's components through network communication.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position:
    *   Network access to the vulnerable MySQL server.
    *   For some vulnerabilities, authenticated access to the server might be required.
