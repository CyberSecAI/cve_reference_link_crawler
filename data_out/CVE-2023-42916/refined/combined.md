Internet connection and have installed the latest version of iTunes

Selecting Don't Install will present the option the next time you
connect your iOS device.  The automatic update process may take up to
a week depending on the day that iTunes or the device checks for
updates. You may manually obtain the update via the Check for Updates
button within iTunes, or the Software Update on your device.  To
check that the iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad has been updated:  *
Navigate to Settings * Select General * Select About. The version

This update is available through iTunes and Software Update on your
iOS device, and will not appear in your computer's Software Update
application, or in the Apple Downloads site. Make sure you have an
Internet connection and have installed the latest version of iTunes
from <https://www.apple.com/itunes/>  iTunes and Software Update on the

to be installed is presented to the user when the iOS device is
docked. We recommend applying the update immediately if possible.
Selecting Don't Install will present the option the next time you
connect your iOS device.  The automatic update process may take up to
a week depending on the day that iTunes or the device checks for
updates. You may manually obtain the update via the Check for Updates
button within iTunes, or the Software Update on your device.  To
check that the iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad has been updated:  *
Navigate to Settings * Select General * Select About. The version
after applying this update will be "iOS 16.7.3 and iPadOS 16.7.3".

This update is available through iTunes and Software Update on your
iOS device, and will not appear in your computer's Software Update
application, or in the Apple Downloads site. Make sure you have an
Internet connection and have installed the latest version of iTunes
from <https://www.apple.com/itunes/>  iTunes and Software Update on the
device will automatically check Apple's update server on its weekly
schedule. When an update is detected, it is downloaded and the option
to be installed is presented to the user when the iOS device is
docked. We recommend applying the update immediately if possible.
Selecting Don't Install will present the option the next time you
connect your iOS device.  The automatic update process may take up to
a week depending on the day that iTunes or the device checks for
updates. You may manually obtain the update via the Check for Updates
button within iTunes, or the Software Update on your device.  To
check that the iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad has been updated:  *
Navigate to Settings * Select General * Select About. The version
after applying this update will be "iOS 15.8.1 and iPadOS 15.8.1".
All information is also posted on the Apple Security Updates
