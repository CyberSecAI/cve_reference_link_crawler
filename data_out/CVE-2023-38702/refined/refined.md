The provided content is related to CVE-2023-38702.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of user-provided filenames during file uploads in the `/knowage/restful-services/dossier/importTemplateFile` endpoint. The application does not sanitize the filename, allowing directory traversal by using relative paths such as `../`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal: The application directly appends the user-supplied filename to the server-side file path without validation.
- Lack of Authorization: The endpoint doesn't require authorization.
- Insecure File Upload: The application allows uploading arbitrary file types.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary File Write: An attacker can write files to any location accessible to the server process.
- Remote Code Execution: By uploading a malicious JSP file to the web application's directory, an attacker can gain remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via HTTP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker needs low privileges, as no authorization is required to reach the vulnerable endpoint.
