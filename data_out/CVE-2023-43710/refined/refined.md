The provided content relates to CVE-2023-43710.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the osCommerce application, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into specific parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing and displaying it, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they view the affected pages. This could lead to:
- Session hijacking.
- Phishing attacks.
- Defacement of the web application.
- Redirecting users to malicious sites.
- Theft of sensitive information.
- Other malicious actions performed on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP requests to vulnerable endpoints within the osCommerce admin panel. The attacker injects the malicious payload into specific parameters within these requests.
- `/admin/modules/save?set=shipping`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have access to the osCommerce admin panel and must be able to modify the vulnerable parameter `configuration_title[1][MODULE_SHIPPING_PERCENT_TEXT_TITLE]`. This likely requires an authenticated user with sufficient privileges.
