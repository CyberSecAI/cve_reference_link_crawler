{
  "CVE-2024-29180": {
    "Description": "The **webpack-dev-middleware** middleware does not validate the supplied URL address sufficiently before returning the local file. It is possible to access any file on the developer's machine.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from insufficient validation of the URL path. The middleware does not properly unescape and normalize the URL before using it to construct the local file path. Specifically, the public path prefix is stripped from the URL, and the unescaped path suffix is appended to the outputPath. Because the URL is not unescaped and normalized, it is possible to use %2e and %2f sequences to perform path traversal attacks.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Path Traversal"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate its content, including passwords, configuration files, and private source code. If the development server is listening on a public IP address, an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim. If the server allows access from third-party domains (CORS, 'Allow-Access-Origin: *'), an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client-side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network-based: An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable development server.",
      "Through a malicious link: If the server allows CORS, an attacker can trick a user into visiting a malicious link that exploits the vulnerability."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable development server. This can be achieved if the development server is exposed on a public IP or is accessible within the local network. If CORS is enabled, the attack can be performed from a third party domain via a malicious link."
