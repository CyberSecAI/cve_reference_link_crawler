# Path traversal in webpack-dev-middleware

## Package

npm

webpack-dev-middleware
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 7.0.0
<= 6.1.1
<= 5.3.3

## Patched versions

7.1.0
6.1.2
5.3.4

## Description

### Summary

*The **webpack-dev-middleware** middleware does not validate the supplied URL address sufficiently before returning the local file. It is possible to access any file on the developer's machine.*

### Details

The middleware can either work with the physical filesystem when reading the files or it can use a virtualized in-memory *memfs* filesystem.

If *writeToDisk* configuration option is set to **true**, the physical filesystem is used:

[webpack-dev-middleware/src/utils/setupOutputFileSystem.js](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/setupOutputFileSystem.js#L21)

Line 21
in
[7ed24e0](/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377)

|  | else if (context.options.writeToDisk !== true) { |
| --- | --- |

The ***getFilenameFromUrl*** method is used to parse URL and build the local file path.

The public path prefix is stripped from the URL, and the **unsecaped** path suffix is appended to the *outputPath*:

[webpack-dev-middleware/src/utils/getFilenameFromUrl.js](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/getFilenameFromUrl.js#L82)

Line 82
in
[7ed24e0](/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/commit/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377)

|  | if ( |
| --- | --- |

As the URL is not unescaped and normalized automatically before calling the midlleware, it is possible to use *%2e* and *%2f* sequences to perform path traversal attack.
### PoC

*A blank project can be created containing the following configuration file **webpack.config.js**:*

`module.exports = { devServer: { devMiddleware: { writeToDisk: true } } };`

When started, it is possible to access any local file, e.g. */etc/passwd*:

`$ curl localhost:8080/public/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f../etc/passwd`

```
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin
sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync
games:x:5:60:games:/usr/games:/usr/sbin/nologin

```
### Impact

The developers using *webpack-dev-server* or *webpack-dev-middleware* are affected by the issue. When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content (e.g. password, configuration files, private source code, ...).

If the development server is listening on a public IP address (or **0.0.0.0**), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port).

If the server allows access from third-party domains (CORS, ***Allow-Access-Origin: \**** ), an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files.

### Recommendation

The URL should be unescaped and normalized before any further processing.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
