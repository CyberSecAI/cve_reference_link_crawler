| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['6662']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to trigger a denial of service condition on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows; remote code execution is also theoretically possible. User interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists in the processing of SMB requests. By specifying malformed values during an NT Trans2 request an attacker can cause the target system to kernel panic thereby requiring a reboot of the system. Further manipulation can theoretically result in remote unauthenticated code execution. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-001.mspx> |
