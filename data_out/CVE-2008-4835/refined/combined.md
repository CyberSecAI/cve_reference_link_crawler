## SMB Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4834

An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol software handles specially crafted SMB packets. An attempt to exploit the vulnerability would not require authentication, allowing an attacker to exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted network message to a computer running the Server service. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the system. Most attempts to exploit this vulnerability would result in a system denial of service condition, however remote code execution is theoretically possible.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-4834](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4834).

#### Mitigating Factors for SMB Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4834

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. In this case, the SMB ports should be blocked from the Internet.
* Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 are not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for SMB Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4834

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  **Impact of workaround.** Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:

  + Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
  + Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
  + Server (File and Print Sharing)
  + Group Policy
  + Net Logon
  + Distributed File System (DFS)
  + Terminal Server Licensing
  + Print Spooler
  + Computer Browser
  + Remote Procedure Call Locator
  + Fax Service
  + Indexing Service
  + Performance Logs and Alerts

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

# Advisory Details

January 13th, 2009
## Microsoft SMB NT Trans2 Request Parsing Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-09-002ZDI-CAN-379

| CVE ID | [CVE-2008-4835](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4835) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE |  |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Windows 2000 SP4](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/2000/default.aspx) [Windows XP](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-xp/) [Windows Server 2003](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/) [Windows Vista](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/) [Windows Server 2008](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['6662']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to trigger a denial of service condition on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows; remote code execution is also theoretically possible. User interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists in the processing of SMB requests. By specifying malformed values during an NT Trans2 request an attacker can cause the target system to kernel panic thereby requiring a reboot of the system. Further manipulation can theoretically result in remote unauthenticated code execution. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-001.mspx> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2008-08-14 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2009-01-13 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
