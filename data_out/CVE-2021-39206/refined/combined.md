# Incorrectly handling of URI '#fragment' element as part of the path element

High

[lizan](/lizan)
published
GHSA-r222-74fw-jqr9
Aug 24, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

1.19.0, 1.18.3, 1.17.3, 1.16.4

## Patched versions

1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4, 1.16.5

## Description

CVSS score 8.6 (High), Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)

Envoy incorrectly handled a URI '#fragment' element as part of the path element.

Envoy is configured with an RBAC filter for authorization or similar mechanism with an

explicit case of a final "/admin" path element, or is using a negative assertion with

final path element of "/admin". The client sends request to "/app1/admin#foo"

In Envoy prior to 1.18.0, or 1.18.0+ configured with path\_normalization=false

Envoy treats fragment as a suffix of the query string when present, or as a suffix

of the path when query string is absent, so it evaluates the final path element

as "/admin#foo" and mismatches with the configured "/admin" path element

In Envoy 1.18.0+ configured with path\_normalization=true

Envoy transforms this to /app1/admin%23foo and mismatches with the configured /admin prefix

The resulting URI is sent to the next server-agent with the offending "#foo" fragment which

violates RFC3986 or with the nonsensical "%23foo" text appended.

### Impact

Escalation of Privileges when path based request authorization extensions.

### Attack vector

A specifically constructed request with URI containing '#fragment' element delivered by an untrusted client in the presence of path based request authorization.

### Patches

Envoy versions 1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4, 1.16.5 contain fixes that removes fragment from URI path in incoming requests.

### Workarounds

None

# Incorrect Authorization with specially crafted requests

High

[travisgroth](/travisgroth)
published
GHSA-cfc2-wjcm-c8fm
Sep 9, 2021

## Package

gomod

pomerium
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

0.11.0-0.14.7, 0.15.0

## Patched versions

0.14.8, 0.15.1

## Description

Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities:

* [CVE-2021-32777](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32779): incorrectly transform a URL containing a `#fragment` element, causing a mismatch in path-prefix based authorization decisions.
* [CVE-2021-32779](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32777): incorrectly handle duplicate headers, dropping all but the last. This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions.

### Impact

With specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium.

### Patches

Pomerium v0.14.8 and v0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with these vulnerabilities patched.

### Workarounds

* This issue can only be triggered when using path prefix based policy. Removing any such policies should provide mitigation.

# Incorrect concatenation of multiple value request headers in ext-authz extension

## Package

## Patched versions

## Description

CVSS score 8.6 (High), Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)

When ext-authz extension is sending request headers to the external authorization service it must merge multiple value headers according to the HTTP spec. However, only the last header value is sent. This may allow specifically crafted requests to bypass authorization.

### Impact

Escalation of Privileges when using ext-authz extension or back end service that uses multiple value headers for authorization.

### Attack vector

A specifically constructed request delivered by an untrusted downstream peer in the presence of ext-authz extension.

### Patches

Envoy versions 1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4, 1.16.5 contain fixes to the ext-authz extension to correctly merge multiple request header values, when sending request for authorization.

Hello Envoy Community,

We would like to announce the availability of Envoy **1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4****,** and **1.16.5**!
These versions contain fixes for the following CVE(s):

* **CVE-2021-32777** (CVSS score 8.6, High): Envoy through 1.19.1 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an HTTP request with multiple value headers may bypass authorization policies in ext\_authz extension.
* **CVE-2021-32779** (CVSS score 8.6, High): Envoy through 1.19.1 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an HTTP request with #fragment in the URI path may bypass Envoy’s URI path based authorization policies.
* **CVE-2021-32781** (CVSS score 8.6, High): Envoy through 1.19.1 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability that affects Envoy's decompressor, json-transcoder or grpc-web extensions or proprietary extensions that modify and increase the size of request or response bodies. Modifying and increasing the size of the body in an Envoy’s extension beyond internal buffer size may lead to Envoy accessing deallocated memory and terminating abnormally.
* **CVE-2021-32778** (CVSS score 8.6, High): Envoy through 1.19.1 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an Envoy client opening and then resetting a large number of HTTP/2 requests may lead to excessive CPU consumption.
  IMPORTANT: Due to significant divergence in affected source code between Envoy versions 1.16 and 1.17 it is not feasible to backport the fix into the 1.16 stable branch without increasing the risk of destabilizing it. As a result, operators of Envoy version 1.16 are recommended to limit the number of simultaneous HTTP/2 streams for upstream and downstream peers to a low number, i.e. 10.
* **CVE-2021-32780** (CVSS score 8.6, High): Envoy 1.18 through 1.19.1 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an untrusted upstream service may cause Envoy to terminate abnormally by sending the GOAWAY frame followed by the SETTINGS frame with the SETTINGS\_MAX\_CONCURRENT\_STREAMS parameter set to 0.
  Note: this vulnerability does not impact downstream client connections.

Upgrading to **1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4,**or**1.16.5**is encouraged to fix these issues.

Checking whether you are vulnerable:
Run `envoy --version` and if it indicates a base version matching or older than **1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4,**or**1.16.5** you are running a vulnerable version.
