# Incorrectly handling of URI '#fragment' element as part of the path element

High

[lizan](/lizan)

GHSA-r222-74fw-jqr9
Aug 24, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

1.19.0, 1.18.3, 1.17.3, 1.16.4

## Patched versions

1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4, 1.16.5

## Description

CVSS score 8.6 (High), Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)

Envoy incorrectly handled a URI '#fragment' element as part of the path element.

Envoy is configured with an RBAC filter for authorization or similar mechanism with an

explicit case of a final "/admin" path element, or is using a negative assertion with

final path element of "/admin". The client sends request to "/app1/admin#foo"

In Envoy prior to 1.18.0, or 1.18.0+ configured with path\_normalization=false

Envoy treats fragment as a suffix of the query string when present, or as a suffix

of the path when query string is absent, so it evaluates the final path element

as "/admin#foo" and mismatches with the configured "/admin" path element

In Envoy 1.18.0+ configured with path\_normalization=true

Envoy transforms this to /app1/admin%23foo and mismatches with the configured /admin prefix

The resulting URI is sent to the next server-agent with the offending "#foo" fragment which

violates RFC3986 or with the nonsensical "%23foo" text appended.

### Impact

Escalation of Privileges when path based request authorization extensions.

### Attack vector

A specifically constructed request with URI containing '#fragment' element delivered by an untrusted client in the presence of path based request authorization.

### Patches

Envoy versions 1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4, 1.16.5 contain fixes that removes fragment from URI path in incoming requests.

### Workarounds

None
