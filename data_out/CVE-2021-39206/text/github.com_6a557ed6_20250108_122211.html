# Incorrect Authorization with specially crafted requests

High

[travisgroth](/travisgroth)
published
GHSA-cfc2-wjcm-c8fm
Sep 9, 2021

## Package

gomod

pomerium
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

0.11.0-0.14.7, 0.15.0

## Patched versions

0.14.8, 0.15.1

## Description

Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities:

* [CVE-2021-32777](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32779): incorrectly transform a URL containing a `#fragment` element, causing a mismatch in path-prefix based authorization decisions.
* [CVE-2021-32779](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32777): incorrectly handle duplicate headers, dropping all but the last. This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions.

### Impact

With specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium.

### Patches

Pomerium v0.14.8 and v0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with these vulnerabilities patched.

### Workarounds

* This issue can only be triggered when using path prefix based policy. Removing any such policies should provide mitigation.
