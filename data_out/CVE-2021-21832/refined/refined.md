- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An integer overflow occurs when parsing a crafted ISO file. The size of a directory record is read from the ISO, shifted left by 4 bits, and used as the size for a `malloc` call. Because the shift operation is done in a 32-bit register, an overflow can occur, causing a small or zero-size buffer to be allocated. Subsequent writes to this small buffer will cause a heap out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow leading to heap out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory corruption, leading to a crash. The report doesn't specify if arbitrary code execution is possible, but an attacker could potentially achieve it by further exploiting the memory corruption.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted ISO file needs to be provided to the vulnerable software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to provide a malicious ISO file to the vulnerable application. No special position is required, and no user interaction is needed other than opening the crafted file with the vulnerable software.
