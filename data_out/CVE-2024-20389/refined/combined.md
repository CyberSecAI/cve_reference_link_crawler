For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nso-rwpesc-qrQGnh3f>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect Cisco Crosswork NSO.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  For more information about how Cisco Crosswork NSO is affected by each vulnerability, see the following sections. CVE-2024-20326 Cisco Crosswork NSO is only affected by the vulnerability that is described in CVE-2024-20326 if one or more of the following conditions are true:    + The device is running an *ncs.ccl* CLI specification file (clispec) that has been modified.   + The device is not running the installation-provided *ncs.ccl* clispec.   + Users can execute the Cisco Crosswork NSO Network Simulator (Netsim) on the underlying operating system. **Note:** If users can execute the Netsim tool, the device is affected, regardless of the clispec status.  For more information about the Netsim tool, see the [Network Simulator](https://cisco-tail-f.gitbook.io/nso-documentation/operation-and-usage/cli/network-simulator-netsim) section of the Cisco Crosswork NSO documentation.  **Determine Whether the *ncs.ccl* clispec Is Running on a Device**  Cisco Crosswork NSO allows for customization of the default clispec (*ncs.ccl*). If a device is running a modified *ncs.ccl* clispec, if the *ncs.ccl* clispec has been removed, or if the *ncs.ccl* clispec is not configured on the device, then the device is affected.  To determine whether the *ncs.ccl* clispec is running on a device, use the **describe ping** command, as shown in the following example:  ```   admin@ncs> describe pingCommon    Source : clispec    File   : /opt/ncs/ncs-6.2.4/etc/ncs/ncs.cclCallback [os command]...   ```  If the command returns a **Source** value of **clispec** and a **File** value of **/etc/ncs/ncs.ccl**, then the device is running the *ncs.ccl* clispec. The *ncs.ccl* clispec should be checked to see if it has been modified.  If the **describe ping** command produces output for the **Source** or **File** values that differs from the preceding example, then the device is affected, and no further checks are required. The following example shows output from an affected device:  ```   admin@ncs> describe pingCommon    Source : built-inCallback [os command]...   ```  **Determine Whether the *ncs.ccl* clispec Has Been Modified**  To determine whether an administrator has modified the *ncs.ccl* clispec, calculate the hash of the *ncs.cli* clispec source file using the **shasum -a 256 ncs.cli** command from thesource directory, as shown in the following example:  ```   /src/ncs/cli/ shasum -a 256 ncs.cli1bbcf2ec885311eed22a21644cbe02c211ee45e8a4ff2be56769324534a26f0d  ncs.cli    ```  If the returned hash value matches the preceding example exactly, then the source file has not been modified. CVE-2024-20389 Only Cisco Crosswork NSO releases 6.0.11 and 6.2.1 are affected by the vulnerability that is described in CVE-2024-20389. All other software releases are not affected. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2024-20326: Cisco Crosswork NSO Arbitrary File Read and Write Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the Cisco Crosswork NSO CLI could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, local attacker to read and write arbitrary files as *root* on the underlying operating system.  This vulnerability is due to improper authorization enforcement when specific CLI commands are used.
