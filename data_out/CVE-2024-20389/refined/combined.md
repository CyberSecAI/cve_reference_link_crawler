Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2024-20326: ConfD Arbitrary File Read and Write Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the ConfD CLI could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, local attacker to read and write arbitrary files as *root* on the underlying operating system.  This vulnerability is due to improper authorization enforcement when specific CLI commands are used. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing an affected CLI command with crafted arguments.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nso-rwpesc-qrQGnh3f>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect Cisco Crosswork NSO.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  For more information about how Cisco Crosswork NSO is affected by each vulnerability, see the following sections. CVE-2024-20326 Cisco Crosswork NSO is only affected by the vulnerability that is described in CVE-2024-20326 if one or more of the following conditions are true:    + The device is running an *ncs.ccl* CLI specification file (clispec) that has been modified.   + The device is not running the installation-provided *ncs.ccl* clispec.   + Users can execute the Cisco Crosswork NSO Network Simulator (Netsim) on the underlying operating system. **Note:** If users can execute the Netsim tool, the device is affected, regardless of the clispec status.  For more information about the Netsim tool, see the [Network Simulator](https://cisco-tail-f.gitbook.io/nso-documentation/operation-and-usage/cli/network-simulator-netsim) section of the Cisco Crosswork NSO documentation.  **Determine Whether the *ncs.ccl* clispec Is Running on a Device**  Cisco Crosswork NSO allows for customization of the default clispec (*ncs.ccl*). If a device is running a modified *ncs.ccl* clispec, if the *ncs.ccl* clispec has been removed, or if the *ncs.ccl* clispec is not configured on the device, then the device is affected.  To determine whether the *ncs.ccl* clispec is running on a device, use the **describe ping** command, as shown in the following example:  ```   admin@ncs> describe pingCommon    Source : clispec    File   : /opt/ncs/ncs-6.2.4/etc/ncs/ncs.cclCallback [os command]...   ```  If the command returns a **Source** value of **clispec** and a **File** value of **/etc/ncs/ncs.ccl**, then the device is running the *ncs.ccl* clispec. The *ncs.ccl* clispec should be checked to see if it has been modified.  If the **describe ping** command produces output for the **Source** or **File** values that differs from the preceding example, then the device is affected, and no further checks are required. The following example shows output from an affected device:  ```   admin@ncs> describe pingCommon    Source : built-inCallback [os command]...   ```  **Determine Whether the *ncs.ccl* clispec Has Been Modified**  To determine whether an administrator has modified the *ncs.ccl* clispec, calculate the hash of the *ncs.cli* clispec source file using the **shasum -a 256 ncs.cli** command from thesource directory, as shown in the following example:  ```   /src/ncs/cli/ shasum -a 256 ncs.cli1bbcf2ec885311eed22a21644cbe02c211ee45e8a4ff2be56769324534a26f0d  ncs.cli    ```  If the returned hash value matches the preceding example exactly, then the source file has not been modified. CVE-2024-20389 Only Cisco Crosswork NSO releases 6.0.11 and 6.2.1 are affected by the vulnerability that is described in CVE-2024-20389. All other software releases are not affected. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2024-20326: Cisco Crosswork NSO Arbitrary File Read and Write Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the Cisco Crosswork NSO CLI could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, local attacker to read and write arbitrary files as *root* on the underlying operating system.  This vulnerability is due to improper authorization enforcement when specific CLI commands are used. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a specific CLI command with crafted arguments. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or write arbitrary files on the underlying operating system with *root*-level privileges.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwi31715](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwi31715)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20326Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 7.8CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  **CVE-2024-20389: Cisco Crosswork NSO Privilege Escalation Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the Cisco Crosswork NSO CLI could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, local attacker to elevate privileges to *root* on the underlying operating system.  The vulnerability is due to an incorrect privilege assignment when specific CLI commands are used. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing an affected CLI command.

Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
