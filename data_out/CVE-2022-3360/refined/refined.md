- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The LearnPress plugin unserializes user-controlled input in a REST API endpoint, leading to PHP Object Injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated PHP Object Injection vulnerability due to insecure deserialization of user input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote Code Execution (RCE) can occur if a suitable gadget chain is present, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted JSON payload to the `/wp-json/lp/v1/widgets/api` REST API endpoint. This endpoint is accessible to unauthenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to know the site's secrets to generate a valid hash, calculated using the `wp_hash()` function. This hash is included in the payload to bypass initial checks. The attacker must also craft a serialized PHP object that leverages an existing "gadget" class within the application, which will be unserialized and executed on the server.
