### Interface group members are not validated on load/save on ``interfaces\_groups\_edit.php``, and are printed without encoding on ``interfaces\_groups.php``

**Description**

When submitting interface group members on `interfaces_groups_edit.php` the member list is not validated before it is then stored in the configuration. The group member list is then printed without encoding on `interfaces_groups.php`, leading to a potential stored XSS.

Updated subject/description to match observed behavior. Keeping public for now since it was submitted publicly.

I was able to confirm a problem here but the screenshot at the linked URL is weird in that the URL and XSS dialog in the screenshot are from `interfaces_groups.php` but that does not match the rest of the content in the screenshot background which is from `interfaces_groups_edit.php`. Might be a browser quirk or how the screenshot was created, but it's still odd. There isn't any way I could find that resulted in an XSS dialog on `interfaces_groups_edit.php` directly with the error message shown in the screenshot about the group already existing. The XSS appeared on `interfaces_groups.php` where it prints the member list, which matches the URL in the screenshot.
