# GHSL-2023-191: Arbitrary File Read

## Package

## Affected versions

## Patched versions

None

## Description

# GitHub Security Lab (GHSL) Vulnerability Report, ShokoServer: `GHSL-2023-191`

The [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com) team has identified a potential security vulnerability in [ShokoServer](https://github.com/ShokoAnime/ShokoServer).

We are committed to working with you to help resolve this issue. In this report you will find everything you need to effectively coordinate a resolution of this issue with the GHSL team.

If at any point you have concerns or questions about this process, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at `securitylab@github.com` (please include `GHSL-2023-191` as a reference).

If you are *NOT* the correct point of contact for this report, please let us know!

## Summary

An arbitrary file read exists in the `/api/Image/WithPath` endpoint that would allow unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files on Windows systems.

## Product

ShokoServer

## Tested Version

[v4.2.2](https://github.com/ShokoAnime/ShokoServer/releases/tag/v4.2.2)

## Details

### [/api/Image/WithPath](https://github.com/ShokoAnime/ShokoServer/blob/3ac502196d9522da4ab707dd033ffcc7fb5692fd/Shoko.Server/API/v1/Implementations/ShokoServiceImplementationImage.cs#L42) arbitrary file read (`GHSL-2023-191`)

The [`/api/Image/WithPath`](https://github.com/ShokoAnime/ShokoServer/blob/3ac502196d9522da4ab707dd033ffcc7fb5692fd/Shoko.Server/API/v1/Implementations/ShokoServiceImplementationImage.cs#L42) endpoint is accessible without authentication and is supposed to return default server images. The endpoint accepts the parameter `serverImagePath`, which is not sanitized in any way before being passed to `System.IO.File.OpenRead`, which results in an arbitrary file read.

```
  [HttpGet("WithPath/{serverImagePath}")]
    public object GetImageUsingPath(string serverImagePath)
    {
        if (!System.IO.File.Exists(serverImagePath))
        {
            logger.Trace("Could not find AniDB_Cover image: {0}", serverImagePath);
            return NotFound();
        }

        Response.ContentType = Mime.GetMimeMapping(serverImagePath);
        return System.IO.File.OpenRead(serverImagePath);
    }
```
#### Impact

This issue may lead to `Arbitrary File Read`. The windows installer installs the ShokoServer as administrator, so any unauthenticated attacker may be able to access sensitive information and read files stored on the server.

#### Remediation

1. Ensure that the user input `serverImagePath` is within the expected path by first calling `fullPath = System.IO.Path.GetFullPath(serverImagePath)`
2. Call `fullPath.StartsWith(basePath)`, where `basePath` represents the folder that the images should be stored in.

#### Resources

In order to exploit this vulnerability on Windows, run `curl http:/shokoserever.domain/api/Image/withpath/C:\Windows\secret.txt`, where `shokoserever.domain` is your ShokoServer instance. This will return the contents of `C:\Windows\secret.txt`. Browsers will auto convert \ to / so use a tool like curl or a proxy to ensure the path is correct.

This vulnerability was found with the help of [CodeQl's Path Injection Query](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/go/go-path-injection).

## GitHub Security Advisories

We recommend you create a private [GitHub Security Advisory](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/creating-a-security-advisory) for this finding. This also allows you to invite the GHSL team to collaborate and further discuss this finding in private before it is [published](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/publishing-a-security-advisory).

## Credit

This issue was discovered and reported by GHSL team member [@Kwstubbs (Kevin Stubbings)](https://github.com/Kwstubbs).

## Contact

You can contact the GHSL team at `securitylab@github.com`, please include a reference to `GHSL-2023-191` in any communication regarding this issue.

## Disclosure Policy

This report is subject to a 90-day disclosure deadline, as described in more detail in our [coordinated disclosure policy](https://securitylab.github.com/advisories#policy).
