Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `/api/Image/WithPath` endpoint in ShokoServer allows unauthenticated access to read files.
*   The `serverImagePath` parameter, which is provided by the user, is not validated or sanitized before being used in `System.IO.File.OpenRead()`. This allows an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read (CWE-22):**  The primary vulnerability is that the server reads and returns the contents of any file accessible to the server process.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerable endpoint is accessible without any authentication, making it easily exploitable.
*   **Path Traversal:** The lack of input sanitization allows attackers to traverse the file system by crafting malicious `serverImagePath` inputs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including configuration files, database files, or any other sensitive data.
*   **Compromised System:** Since the ShokoServer is often installed as an administrator on Windows systems, the attacker can potentially read files with administrator privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/api/Image/WithPath` endpoint.
*   **`serverImagePath` parameter:** The attacker modifies the `serverImagePath` parameter in the request with the path to the file they want to read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the ShokoServer instance.
*   **No authentication:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials for the ShokoServer application.
*   **Basic understanding of HTTP and file paths**: The attacker needs the ability to craft HTTP requests and understand file path conventions on the server's operating system.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by GHSL team member Kwstubbs.
*   The advisory suggests a remediation by:
    1.  Using `System.IO.Path.GetFullPath(serverImagePath)` to get the absolute path.
    2.  Ensuring that the absolute path starts with a known base path.
*   The provided example shows how to exploit the vulnerability using `curl` with a crafted URL.
*  The vulnerability was fixed by removing the vulnerable endpoint.
