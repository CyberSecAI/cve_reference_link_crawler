- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of validation of an object's existence before performing operations on it during the parsing of OXPS files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-After-Free vulnerability. The software attempts to use a pointer to an object that may no longer be valid. This can cause the program to crash, or could allow arbitrary code execution by writing to an address that is no longer valid.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information. This vulnerability can be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious OXPS file or visits a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to create a malicious OXPS file or host a malicious page that, when interacted with by a user, triggers the vulnerability. User interaction is required. The attacker has to entice a user to open the file or visit a malicious page.
