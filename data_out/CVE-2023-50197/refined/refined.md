- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists within the Intel Driver & Support Assistant (DSA) Service. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to write a file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The DSA Service is vulnerable to symbolic link abuse, allowing arbitrary file writes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM level and execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker with the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system can create a symbolic link to abuse the DSA Service and write arbitrary files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system to create a symbolic link and abuse the vulnerable service.
