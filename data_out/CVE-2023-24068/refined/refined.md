The provided content describes two vulnerabilities, CVE-2023-24068 and CVE-2023-24069, in Signal Desktop Client versions 6.2.0 and earlier.

**CVE-2023-24069:**

*   **Root cause:** Signal Desktop Client stores attachments in a local cache directory without encryption. These files are not always purged when deleted by the user, especially if the attachment was replied to, or quoted in the conversation.
*   **Weakness:** Cleartext storage of sensitive information. Failure to properly purge cached files.
*   **Impact:** An attacker with local access to the user's machine can access unencrypted attachments (images, documents, etc.). This can lead to exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Attack vector:** Local file system access to the `attachments.noindex` directory.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Local host access is required.

**CVE-2023-24068:**

*   **Root cause:** Signal Desktop Client does not validate modifications to cached attachment files. The client will use modified attachments as if they are the original.
*   **Weakness:** Incorrect resource transfer, lack of validation of cached files.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can replace an existing cached attachment with a malicious one. When the user forwards the attachment, the malicious file will be distributed to other users. This can lead to malware distribution, phishing, or other attacks.
*   **Attack vector:** Local file system access to the `attachments.noindex` directory.
*  **Required attacker capabilities:** Local host access is required.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerabilities affect Windows, macOS, and Linux versions of the Signal Desktop Client.
*   The `attachments.noindex` directory contains subdirectories, where attachments are stored unencrypted
*   The vulnerabilities can be chained: an attacker can first recover unencrypted attachments (CVE-2023-24069), then replace them with malicious files (CVE-2023-24068).
*   An attacker can backdoor existing files and wait for the victim to forward them, which can lead to silent and covert distribution of malware.
*   The Signal client does not validate the file contents of attachments when forwarding, relying on the filename and extension instead.
