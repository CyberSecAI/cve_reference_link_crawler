Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-10184:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content from Wordfence directly mentions CVE-2024-10184 and describes a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the StreamWeasels Kick Integration plugin.
   - The description aligns with the provided official information.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - **Insufficient Input Sanitization and Output Escaping**: The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied attributes within the `sw-kick-embed` shortcode and does not perform output escaping when rendering the embedded content.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The vulnerability allows malicious scripts to be stored in the database and executed in the victim's browser when the affected page is accessed. This is a "Stored" XSS because the malicious payload is stored persistently in the database.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary Web Script Execution**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute within the context of a user's browser when they visit a page containing the vulnerable shortcode.
   - **Account Takeover**: Successful XSS exploitation could allow attackers to potentially steal cookies, session data, or perform other malicious actions such as redirecting users to phishing websites or injecting content.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **`sw-kick-embed` Shortcode Attributes**:  The attack vector is through user supplied attributes when using the shortcode `[sw-kick-embed ...]` in the page content of a post or page. The attributes that are not sanitized would be the source of the XSS.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Authenticated Access**: The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least 'Contributor' level access. This is because contributor-level access is usually required for adding shortcodes and page content.
   - **Ability to Create/Edit Content**: The attacker needs the ability to create or edit pages or posts in WordPress to inject the malicious shortcode containing the XSS payload.

**Summary of Technical Details:**
   - The `sw-kick-embed` shortcode in the StreamWeasels Kick Integration plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS.
   - User-supplied attributes to the shortcode are not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via shortcode attributes.
   - The injected code is stored in the database as part of the page content and executed when users visit the affected page.
   - An authenticated user with 'Contributor' access or higher is required to exploit this vulnerability.

The provided information clearly identifies the vulnerability as a stored XSS due to insufficient sanitization, making it a security issue. The associated files also show that escaping and sanitization were improved in later versions.
