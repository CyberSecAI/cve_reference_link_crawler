| hi, great project!  I think it's better to limit the size of `res`, otherwise it may cause the program to crash, such as performing "cat /dev/random | od -x", which maybe unlikely in reality.  ``` char *execute_command(char *command) { 	FILE *fp; 	char *res = calloc(4096, sizeof(char)); 	char buf[1024];  	fp = popen(command, "r"); 	if (fp == NULL) { 		perror("Failed to run command"); 		return NULL; 	}  	while (fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), fp) != NULL) { 		strcat(res, buf); 	} 	// printf("RESULT OF COMMAND: %s\n", res);  	pclose(fp); 	return res; 	}  ``` |

| You're right. There is surely more instances like this one. Tagging this as a security bug to be fixed at some point. Thanks! |

| Well, there are other security issues. There is no limit to the length of program parameters, which may cause overflow.  src/client/client.c  ``` void main(int argc, char* argv[]){ ...     int opt;     char dest_address[32];     char path_arg[512];      while ((opt = getopt(argc, argv, ":S:c:e:u:a:p:s:h")) != -1) {         switch (opt) {         case 'S': ...             strcpy(dest_address, optarg); ``` |

| Is this the reason I get  `Illegal instruction (core dumped)` - when I run `./simple_timer`. and a `segmentation fault (core dumped)` - when I run `./simple_open`?  I have not been able to carry out a PoC due to the above errors. |

| [@Ifex370](https://github.com/Ifex370) I am moving your issue to a different thread ([#44](https://github.com/h3xduck/TripleCross/issues/44)) since it is not related to this security-related issue |
