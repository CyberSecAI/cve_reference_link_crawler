- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the affected page. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, and redirection.
- **Attack vectors:** A high privilege user (e.g., admin) can inject malicious JavaScript into the plugin's settings via the "Name" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative or editor-level privileges to access and modify the plugin settings.
