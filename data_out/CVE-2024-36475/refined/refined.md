Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-36475:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the presence of active debug code within the Century Systems FutureNet NXR, VXR, and WXR series devices. This debug functionality, when improperly secured, can be exploited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Active Debug Code (CWE-489):** The devices contain debug functionality that can be accessed by a user who knows how to use it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who knows how to use the debug function and has logged into the device can use the debug functionality to execute arbitrary OS commands. This allows for complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack, potentially through a local network.
- Successful exploitation requires a user to be logged in to the device and know how to utilize the debug functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid credentials to log into the device.
- The attacker must be aware of how to use the debug function of the affected devices.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability exists because a debug function is active and available after a user logs in. An attacker with knowledge of this function can leverage it to execute arbitrary commands on the device.
