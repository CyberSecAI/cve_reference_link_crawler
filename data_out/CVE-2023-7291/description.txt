The Paytium: Mollie payment forms & donations plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the create_mollie_account function in versions up to, and including, 4.3.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access to set up a mollie account.
