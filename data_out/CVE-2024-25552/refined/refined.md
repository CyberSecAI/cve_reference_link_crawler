- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unquoted search path in the Windows registry.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software products use an unquoted search path, allowing a local attacker to insert a malicious executable file in the path.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can execute arbitrary code and gain administrative privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required. The attacker must be able to write to the affected path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the system and must be able to write to the location where the vulnerable application searches for files. They also need to place a malicious executable with the same name that the application is searching for in that location.
