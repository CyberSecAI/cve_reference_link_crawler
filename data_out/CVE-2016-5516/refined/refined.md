  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2016-5516",
    "description": "The provided document describes a Critical Patch Update (CPU) for Oracle products, and CVE-2016-5516 is mentioned within the Oracle Database Server Risk Matrix. It concerns a vulnerability in Kernel PDB, specifically related to the execution of DBMS_PDB_EXEC_SQL. This entry does not provide a full CVE description, but rather a risk matrix entry within a larger CPU advisory.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Oracle Database Server version 12.1.0.2"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The root cause lies in the improper handling of execution permissions on DBMS_PDB_EXEC_SQL within the Kernel PDB component of the Oracle Database Server.",
    "vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists in the Kernel PDB component of the Oracle Database Server. It specifically relates to how the database handles execution permissions on the DBMS_PDB_EXEC_SQL procedure.",
    "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to a loss of availability. The impact to confidentiality and integrity are listed as none, however, the scope is changed.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is local, requiring access to the database server, but exploitation can be achieved over the network using the Oracle Net protocol.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create a session on the database server and then use the DBMS_PDB_EXEC_SQL procedure. Although network access can be used to establish the database session, the attacker must still execute code locally on the database server due to the required privileges. The low impact scores on confidentiality and integrity suggest the attacker is restricted in the data they can access or modify."
