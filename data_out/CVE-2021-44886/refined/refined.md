- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper permission handling when an agent configures "out of office" periods and substitute persons. The substitute person could receive ticket notifications for tickets that they don't have access to.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure due to insufficient permission checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to ticket information for substitute agents without the necessary permissions, potentially exposing sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:** By configuring "out of office" periods with substitute agents who lack the same permissions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a Zammad agent with the ability to configure "out of office" periods and substitute persons.
