{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from Trivy's handling of image scanning from potentially malicious registries. If Trivy is tricked into scanning a container image from a malicious registry, it could leak credentials for legitimate registries (AWS ECR, Google Cloud Artifact/Container Registry, or Azure Container Registry) by attempting to authenticate with them using the default credential provider chain.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Credential Leakage: Trivy could expose registry credentials if it is directed to scan images from a malicious registry. The vulnerability lies in Trivy attempting to obtain credentials from the default provider chain when interacting with any registry, even malicious ones."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could obtain legitimate registry credentials (tokens) and use them to push/pull images from the legitimate registries to which the compromised identity/user has access.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a malicious registry crafted by an attacker. The attacker needs to trick Trivy into scanning an image from this registry.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to: create a malicious registry that Trivy is directed to scan, and the attacker must be able to get Trivy to scan a container image from this malicious registry. Additionally, the user running Trivy must have access to legitimate registries via default credential provider chains for the attack to be successful."
