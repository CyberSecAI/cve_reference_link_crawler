Primary/Secundary Counters are supposed to be 16 bytes values, if the
server has implemented them incorrectly it may lead to the following
crash:

# Advisory Details

December 20th, 2023
## BlueZ Phone Book Access Profile Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-23-1811ZDI-CAN-20936

| CVE ID | [CVE-2023-50229](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50229) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.1, [AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [BlueZ](http://www.bluez.org/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [BlueZ](http://www.bluez.org/) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of BlueZ. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must connect to a malicious Bluetooth device.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of the Phone Book Access profile. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | BlueZ has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2023-04-26 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2023-12-20 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
