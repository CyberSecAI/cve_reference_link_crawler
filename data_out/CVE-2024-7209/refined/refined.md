The provided content is related to CVE-2024-7209.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insufficient verification of the authenticated sender against their allowed domain identities in multi-tenant hosting providers. Specifically, the shared SPF records are not adequately checked against the authenticated user, allowing an attacker to abuse the network authorization and spoof the email identity of the sender.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate verification of the authenticated sender against authorized domain identities.
- Shared SPF records in multi-tenant environments allow for the abuse of network authorization.
- Lack of strict matching between the network sender identity (MAIL FROM) and the Message Header (FROM:).
- Circumvention of DMARC policy and sender verification.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An authenticated attacker can spoof the identity of a sender in the email Message Header.
- Sending emails as anyone within the hosted domains of the hosting provider while being authenticated as a user of a different domain.
-  Spoofed emails can bypass DMARC policies, making them appear as valid and attested messages.
- Email impersonation and potential for phishing attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack via network or SMTP authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the vulnerable multi-tenant hosting provider.
- They must have the ability to send emails through the provider's SMTP server.
