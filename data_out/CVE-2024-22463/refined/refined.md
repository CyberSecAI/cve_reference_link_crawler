Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-22463:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the use of a "broken or risky cryptographic algorithm" within Dell PowerScale OneFS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Use of Broken/Risky Cryptographic Algorithm:** The core issue is the implementation of a weak cryptographic algorithm, which could allow attackers to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Compromise of Confidentiality:** Successful exploitation could lead to the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.
- **Compromise of Integrity:** Attackers could potentially modify or corrupt sensitive information, leading to data manipulation or loss of trust in the data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Unprivileged Access:**  The attacker does not require any specific user privileges or credentials to exploit the vulnerability, further widening the attack surface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:**  The attacker must have network access to the affected Dell PowerScale OneFS system.
- **No authentication is needed:** The attacker does not need to have any kind of authentication credentials to leverage the vulnerability.

**Affected Products and Remediation:**

- **Affected Products:**
    - Dell PowerScale OneFS versions 8.2.x through 9.6.0.x are affected by this vulnerability.
 - **Remediation:**
    - Upgrade to versions 9.4.0.17 or later for versions 8.2.0 through 9.4.0.16.
    - Upgrade to version 9.5.0.6 or later for versions 9.5.0.0 through 9.5.0.5.
    - Upgrade to version 9.7.0.0 or later for version 9.6.1.0.

**Workarounds/Mitigations:**
- The vulnerability can be mitigated on Dell PowerScale OneFS version 9.5 or later by manually updating the following ciphers in `http-config` and `web-config` by root:
  ```
  # isi_gconfig -t http-config cipher_suites=ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
  ```
  ```
  # isi_gconfig -t web-config cipher_suites=ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
  ```
- In Compliance Mode:
  ```
  % sudo isi_gconfig -t http-config cipher_suites=ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
  ```
  ```
  % sudo isi_gconfig -t web-config cipher_suites=ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
