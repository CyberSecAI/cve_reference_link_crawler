Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-3244:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `embedpress_calendar` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided input, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into WordPress pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user views the compromised page.
- **Account Takeover, Data Theft, and other malicious actions:**  By injecting malicious JavaScript code, attackers could potentially perform actions like:
   - Stealing user cookies and session data.
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
   - Defacing websites.
   - Performing actions on behalf of a logged-in user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers inject the malicious JavaScript through the attributes of the `embedpress_calendar` shortcode.
- The shortcode can be embedded in posts or pages, and when those pages are rendered, the malicious scripts will be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** Attackers need to have at least "contributor-level" access to the WordPress site.
- **Ability to Create/Edit Content:** They need to have permissions to create or edit posts or pages where they can insert the shortcode with malicious attributes.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in all versions of the EmbedPress plugin up to and including version 3.9.14.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.9.15
- The provided diff shows a change in the Embedpress_Google_Helper.php file, where the attributes are sanitized using `esc_attr()` function.
