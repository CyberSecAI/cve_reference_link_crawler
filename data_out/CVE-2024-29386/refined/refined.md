Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `view/criticalResourceExport.php` component of ProjeQtOr. This occurs because user-supplied input from the `startDateCriticalResources` and `endDateCriticalResources` parameters is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query within the `Affectable::tranformPlanningResult` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  The application directly embeds user-provided date parameters into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to adequately validate or sanitize the `startDateCriticalResources` and `endDateCriticalResources` inputs, enabling the SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The SQL injection can be used to create a new user with administrative privileges. This is achieved by injecting an `INSERT` SQL statement into the query to add a new user into the `resource` table.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** After gaining admin access, an attacker can upload a malicious plugin containing a PHP shell, leading to remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious GET request to `/view/criticalResourceExport.php`.
*   **Manipulated URL Parameters:** The attacker manipulates the `startDateCriticalResources` and `endDateCriticalResources` parameters in the URL to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable ProjeQtOr instance.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how to construct HTTP requests and manipulate URL parameters.
*  **No prior authentication:** The exploit can be carried out with guest credentials

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `model/Affectable.php` and `view/CriticalResourceExport.php`.
*   The `Affectable::tranformPlanningResult` function constructs a SQL query using unsanitized inputs.
*   The `RequestHandler::getValue` and `RequestHandler::getDatetime` are used to get the input, but there is no sanitization of it before it's used in the SQL query
*   The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates the creation of a new admin user via SQL injection, using a crafted GET request. The injected SQL code is within the `startDateCriticalResources` parameter and it adds a new entry into the `resource` table, which represents the users of the application, in order to create a new admin user.
