- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A segmentation fault occurs within the `SortByPTypeProcess::Execute` function at line 175 in `SortByPTypeProcess.cpp`. The crash is due to an invalid memory read access, potentially a null pointer dereference or an out-of-bounds memory access. This happens during the post-processing step when the code attempts to sort meshes by primitive type while handling malformed input files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122), specifically an out-of-bounds memory read.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS). A crafted 3D model file can trigger the segmentation fault and cause the application using the library to crash.
- **Attack vectors:** Maliciously crafted 3D model files processed by the Assimp library.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted 3D model file as input to the application using the vulnerable Assimp library. The attacker does not need to be in any specific network position, as the vulnerability is triggered by the processing of a malicious file.
