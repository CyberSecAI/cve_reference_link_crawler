- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `Migration_DisableModules_Action` class in Vtiger CRM does not implement a specific `checkPermission` function, thus falling back to the default implementation that grants access to every authenticated user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control. Low-privileged users can directly interact with the `Migration` administrative module.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker could disable arbitrary modules, leading to a service disruption.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted POST request to the `/index.php` endpoint, including the `module=Migration`, `action=DisableModules`, and a list of modules to disable, using the PHPSESSID and a valid anti-CSRF token.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with low privileges. The attacker also needs to obtain a valid PHPSESSID and CSRF token.
