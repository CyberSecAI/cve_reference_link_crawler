# Deserialization of Untrusted Data leads to Remote Code Execution

Critical

[tabuna](/tabuna)
published
GHSA-ph6g-p72v-pc3p
Jul 11, 2023

## Package

composer

orchid/platform
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

14.0.0-alpha4-14.4.0

## Patched versions

14.5.0

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability is related to the deserialization of untrusted data from the `_state` query parameter, which can result in remote code execution.

### Patches

The issue has been addressed in version `14.5.0`. Users are advised to upgrade their software to this version or any subsequent versions that include the patch.

### Workarounds

In this case, it is recommended for users to upgrade to the patched version rather than relying on workarounds. Upgrading to the fixed version ensures that the vulnerability is no longer present and provides the best protection against remote code execution

### References

For more detailed information about this workaround and its effectiveness, users should consult the support channels provided by the software or system developer. They can provide specific guidance on implementing this workaround and any potential limitations or caveats associated with it.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
