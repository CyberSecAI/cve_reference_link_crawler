- **Root cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `ArchiveService` component where there is improper handling of symlinks.
- **Weaknesses:** The vulnerability is a sandbox escape, meaning it allows an app to break out of its designated sandbox.
- **Impact:** An app could potentially bypass security restrictions of the sandbox.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the use of an app that exploits the improper handling of symlinks within the `ArchiveService`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have a malicious application that can manipulate symlinks. The specific requirements or privileges needed are not further specified.
