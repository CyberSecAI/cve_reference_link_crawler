Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5815:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `bdp_get_more_post` function in the "Blog Designer Pack" WordPress plugin. This function uses `extract()` on user-supplied POST data, and then passes some of that extracted data into an `include()` statement without proper sanitization, leading to Local File Inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsafe use of `extract()`:** The `extract()` function imports array keys as variables into the current scope. When used on unfiltered user input like `$_POST`, this allows an attacker to inject arbitrary variables into the scope of the function.
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The vulnerable `include()` statement, combined with the ability to control the included file path through user-supplied variables, allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary PHP files located on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By including a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete compromise of the WordPress site.
*   **Full System Access (potentially):** Successful RCE can allow attackers to gain control over the underlying system, not just the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated AJAX Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an AJAX action that does not require authentication. This means an attacker can exploit the flaw without having an account on the WordPress site.
*   **Manipulated POST Data:** Attackers control the file path injected into the `include` statement through the `$_POST['shrt_param']` parameter and its keys.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No authentication needed:** The attacker can be unauthenticated.
*   **Ability to send HTTP POST requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send POST requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the AJAX endpoint being used to trigger the function (`bdp_get_more_post`).
*   **Ability to place or create PHP code on the server (in some exploitation scenarios)**: For a full RCE, the attacker needs a way to either upload a PHP file or leverage a known location for a PHP file on the server. The writeup by leavesongs.com shows one method to leverage `pearcmd.php` to achieve this on docker environments.
    
**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **`pearcmd.php` exploitation**: The article on leavesongs.com provides an exploit using the `pearcmd.php` file that's included in some PHP Docker images. By using the `config-create` option of this command line tool, a malicious PHP file can be created at a known location.
*   **Docker Environment Exploitation**: The writeup highlights how this vulnerability is particularly dangerous in Docker environments, which might have limited writeable locations.
*  **`session.upload_progress` exploitation**: The content also mentions exploiting `session.upload_progress` to create files with controlled content.
*   **Temporary File Exploitation:** The document discusses methods for exploiting temporary files, using both Race Condition techniques with `phpinfo()` and Windows wildcard character support.
