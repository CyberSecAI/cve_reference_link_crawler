## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Top Bar < 3.0.5 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to "Top Bar" in WP Admin
2. Save the settings and intercept the request in Burp
3. Change the `tpbr\_color` parameter to: `"+onmouseover='alert(1)'"`
4. Submit and see XSS when you mouseover the bar on the frontend

### Affects Plugins
