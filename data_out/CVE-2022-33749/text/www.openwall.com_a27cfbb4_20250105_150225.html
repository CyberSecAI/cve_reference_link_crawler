Subject: Xen Security Advisory 413 v2 (CVE-2022-33749) - XAPI open file
 limit DoS

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2022-33749 / XSA-413
                               version 2

                       XAPI open file limit DoS

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

It is possible for an unauthenticated client on the network to cause
XAPI to hit its file-descriptor limit. This causes XAPI to be unable
to accept new requests for other (trusted) clients, and blocks XAPI
from carrying out any tasks that require the opening of file
descriptors.

IMPACT
======

An attacker is capable of blocking connections to the XAPI HTTP
interface, and also interrupt ongoing operations, causing a XAPI
toolstack Denial of Service.  Such DoS would also affect any guests
that require toolstack actions.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of XAPI are vulnerable.

Systems which are not using the XAPI toolstack are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Not exposing to untrusted clients the network interface XAPI is
listening on will prevent the issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the attached patches resolves this issue.

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
