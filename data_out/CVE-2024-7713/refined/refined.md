- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin stores the OpenAI API key in a way that allows it to be accessed by unauthenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive data exposure (OpenAI API key disclosure)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain the OpenAI API key, potentially using it to make unauthorized calls to the OpenAI API, leading to financial loss or other security risks.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - For versions 2.0.8 and below: Intercepting the `ays_chatgpt_admin_ajax` AJAX call and base64 decoding the `dataObj` parameter.
    - For versions prior to 2.0.8: Intercepting the request to `api.openai.com` and extracting the API key from the `Authorization` header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special capabilities or position are needed as the vulnerability is accessible to unauthenticated users, requiring only the ability to intercept network requests made by the plugin.
