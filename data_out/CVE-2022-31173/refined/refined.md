{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the lack of a limit on the depth of nested fragment processing during GraphQL query execution. This allows an attacker to create a deeply nested structure of fragments, leading to excessive resource consumption and potentially causing a denial-of-service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
      "CWE-674: Improper Handling of Recursion"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service by sending a crafted GraphQL query with deeply nested fragments. This can lead to excessive memory consumption and potentially crash the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network: The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending malicious GraphQL queries to a server running a vulnerable version of the software."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send GraphQL queries to the server.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered by nested fragment structures in a GraphQL query. The vulnerability is triggered when processing the fragments, without checking the level of nesting, eventually consuming all the available memory, and crashing the application. The vulnerability is fixed by rewriting recursive algorithms for fragment processing to use the heap instead of stack and prevent stack overflow, additionally a test case was added to prevent this vulnerability in the future."
