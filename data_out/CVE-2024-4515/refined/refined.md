Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `grade` parameter of the `/view/timetable_grade_wise.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS. This occurs because user-supplied input is directly included in the HTML output without proper encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Code Execution:** Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page viewed by the user.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers can modify the content of the website.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can use XSS to redirect users to malicious sites or initiate malware downloads.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal session cookies to impersonate legitimate users.
*   **Reputation Damage:**  Compromised websites can harm the reputation of the site owner.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The `grade` parameter in the URL is used to inject the malicious payload.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The payload is reflected back to the user in the response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to create a URL with a malicious payload in the `grade` parameter.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker may need to trick a user into clicking the malicious URL. Alternatively, they can use the crafted link in a phishing campaign.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Vulnerable File:** `/view/timetable_grade_wise.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `grade`
