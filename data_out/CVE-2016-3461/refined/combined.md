# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2016

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2016

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 136 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

**Please note that on March 23, 2016, Oracle released [Security Alert for Java SE for CVE-2016-0636](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2016-0636.html) . Customers of affected Oracle product(s) are strongly advised to apply the fixes that were announced for CVE-2016-0636.**

Please also note that the vulnerabilities in this Critical Patch Update are scored using versions 3.0 and 2.0 of Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS). Future Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts will be scored using CVSS version 3.0 only.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) . An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2016verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Starting with this Critical Patch Update, security vulnerabilities are now scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see  [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0). Previous Critical Patch Updates were scored using CVSS version 2.0. To aid in the transition from CVSS version 2.0 to CVSS version 3.0 scoring, for this Critical Patch Update only, both scores are provided (see  [Critical Patch Update - April 2016 CVSS version 2.0](/security-alerts/cpuapr2016.html)).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review previous  [Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update April 2016 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 2102148.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2102148.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1) . Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 9 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2016verbose.html#JAVA) .

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

# [R1] Oracle MySQL Enterprise Monitor Multiple Library readObject() Function Java Object Deserialization Remote Code Execution

High

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Oracle MySQL Enterprise Monitor is vulnerable to several Java object deserialization attacks that result in remote code execution. While Oracle has addressed one of these vectors (Apache Commons Collections `InvokerTransformer` Class) in WebLogic Server (CVE-2015-4852), no advisory or CPU has mentioned MySQL Enterprise Monitor being affected. In addition to the `InvokerTransformer` vector, the same type of attack can be conducted via the `readObject()` call in the implementation of Apache Commons FileUpload as well as their implementation of SpringFramework. This is the first product we've seen to actually be vulnerable to the SpringFramework vector (published by Chris Frohoff in ysoserial on 2015-01-28, no CVE), so that was fun! All testing was performed against an installation on Windows 7, but exploitation can be trivially modified to work against Linux as well.

**Exploit Vector**

Oracle MySQL Enterprise Monitor offers an authenticated REST API. One of the URLs for this API is `https://[target]:18443/v3/dataflow/0/0`. This URL accepts HTTP POST requests with a content type of “`application/octet-stream`”. POSTing to this URL invokes the `DataflowRouter.class post()` function (part of the `com.mysql.etools.springboard.rest` package in `mysql-etools-springboard-3.1.1.7806.jar`). The `post()` function eventually leads to loading the payload of the HTTP POST request into an `ObjectInputStream` and calling `readObject()`.

**Apache Commons FileUpload Exploitation**

Apache Commons FileUpload contains an object called `DiskFileItem`, which is normally harmless. However, the object can be modified after it is serialized to behave in ways that were not intended. Specifically we can modify DiskFileItem to:

1. Create a new file anywhere the Java process has permission.
2. Write anything we would like to that new file.
3. We can also move (copy and delete) any file on the remote system that we have permission to.

There are two limitations though:

1. We don’t control the filename. This is generated by `DiskFileItem` class as “`upload_$uuid_$counter.tmp`".
2. Files are created using the `File.createTempFile()` interface. That means the lifetime of the file is totally dependent on the usage of `deleteOnExit()`, how long the JVM runs, and if it is moved after creation (If the move is done by the exploit then it will still be deleted. However, if the move is done by the `InvokerTransformer` exploit then it will not be deleted). It is our observation that files appear to last ~30 seconds when creating them via the `DataFlowRouter` interface, which is more than enough time for most nefarious purposes.

**Apache Commons Collections Exploitation**

There has been plenty said about using various Commons Collections Objects to invoke `cmd.exe`. We will not rehash it here, but simply point to the FoxGlove Security article for background. To verify this vulnerability, we created a serialized object that invokes the shell and creates the directory "cheese" in `C:\Users\Public`. Due to CVE abstraction for the Apache Commons Collections issue being tracked on a per-vendor basis, this vector will fall under CVE-2015-4852, and is somehow only the second Oracle product to be found vulnerable. Despite that, Oracle issued a new CVE for this specific product being affected.

**SpringFramework Exploitation**

Although Chris Frohoff released [proof of gaining shell access via SpringFramework Object deserialization](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/blob/master/src/main/java/ysoserial/payloads/Spring1.java) back in early 2015, this technique has not gained the infamy that the Commons Collections techniques have. This is largely due to the fact that fairly new versions of spring-core and spring-beans are required (4.1.4.RELEASE), which many products don't use. Unfortunately, MySQL Enterprise Monitor has these libraries on its `classpath`.

Oracle has classified this as a High access complexity for exploitation, likely due to it relying on varying factors related to which library is present. However, a rather vanilla install of the product allows for trivial exploitation and just requires credentials. As such, we are classifying the access complexity as low.

**Apache vs Vendors, Attributing Blame**

We brought the FileUpload issue to Apache's attention and they do not see it as a vulnerability. In their response to us, they stated:

"*Having reviewed your report we have concluded that it does not represent a valid vulnerability in Apache Commons File Upload. If an application deserializes data from an untrusted source without filtering and/or validation that is an application vulnerability not a vulnerability in the library a potential attacker might leverage.*"

Tenable argued that if an application intends to deserialize `DiskFileItems` then they are still vulnerable to the altered object and they could have files written anywhere on their server, which seems to cross the privilege boundaries intended by the library based on the code.

Based on our research, there is no warning about distrusting this object included in their library, or mentioning the potential for problems. It seems like there could be a few lines of code to prevent the unintended aspect of this (files written to arbitrary locations), while still maintaining the functionality of the library. In doing that, it would add a layer of protection for companies that implement the library (which many do, and we are finding vulnerable).

After another Apache person mentioned that "`java.io.File` *is serializable, too .. And, I assume that an intruder who manages to have a `DiskFileItem` created and `getInputStream()` invoked on it, can just as well create a File (or a String), and invoke new `File(Input|Output)Stream`?*" We reminded them that the act of deserializing a `DiskFileItem` can cause arbitrary files to be written to disk. The attacker does not need to invoke a new `outputstream` because `DiskFileItem's readObject()` function has already done that for him. This is not expected behavior as best we can tell. This is also not at all like deserializing a `Java.io.File`. That said, we respect Apache's stance on this and are contacting vendors that implement the Commons FileUpload library in a way that makes their software vulnerable.

### Solution

Oracle has released a patch to address this issue, as [part of the April, 2016 CPU](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuapr2016v3-2985753.html).
