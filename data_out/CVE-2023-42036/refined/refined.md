**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of PDF files, leading to a memory corruption condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory corruption due to inadequate input validation in PDF parsing.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a malicious PDF file. The user must open the specially crafted PDF file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PDF file to a user of Kofax Power PDF, and the user must then open this file to trigger the vulnerability.
