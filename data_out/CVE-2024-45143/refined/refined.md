Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2024-45143:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Adobe Substance 3D Stager. This type of vulnerability occurs when a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer in the heap memory region.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker could potentially run malicious code on the victim's system, gaining control of the application and potentially the entire machine.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L) meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need privileges (PR:N). User interaction is required (UI:R) meaning some action by the user is needed to trigger the vulnerability, such as opening a crafted file. The scope of the vulnerability is unchanged (S:U).

**CVSS Score:** The CVSS base score is 7.8, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. This indicates a high severity vulnerability.
