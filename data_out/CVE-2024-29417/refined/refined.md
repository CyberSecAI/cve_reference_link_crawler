Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the "Forgot / Locked the PASSWORD" feature of the Horacius IAM software. Specifically, when the device is disconnected from the network and this feature is activated, it opens a web browser. By manipulating this browser functionality, an attacker can gain access to a privileged command prompt.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The "Forgot/Locked Password" feature can be accessed without any authentication.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The browser, opened in a specific context (disconnected from the network), allows access to file system functions which are then manipulated to gain SYSTEM level privileges.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The Horacius software does not properly sanitize or validate user interactions with the password reset feature, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Improper Handling of Network Disconnection:** The software does not handle network disconnections securely, leading to the exploitable browser behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Control:** Attackers can achieve NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM level privileges.
*   **Malicious Actions:** Attackers can disable security software, install malware, steal sensitive data, and perform other malicious activities.
*   **Complete Compromise:** The vulnerability allows for complete compromise of the targeted system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** Physical access to the targeted device is required.
*   **Network Disconnection:** The device must be disconnected from the network before exploiting the vulnerability.
*   **Abuse of "Forgot Password" Feature:** The attacker uses the intended password reset feature in an unintended way.
*   **Browser Manipulation:** By leveraging the browser's file save dialog, an attacker can execute commands in a privileged context

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs to be physically present at the machine.
*   **Basic Windows Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be familiar with using basic Windows functionality (file explorer, command prompt).
*   **No Credentials Required:** The attacker does not need to know any user credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was found during a physical penetration test by PRIDE Security.
*   The affected versions are 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 of Horacius IAM.
*   The vulnerability is reportedly fixed in version 1.3, though this was not validated by the researchers.
*   The attack steps are clearly detailed with screenshots.
*   The vulnerability can also be triggered remotely if network access to the Horacius server can be disrupted.
