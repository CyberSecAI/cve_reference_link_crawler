### Description

The ProfileGrid – User Profiles, Memberships, Groups and Communities plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized deletion of data due to a missing capability check on the pm\_upload\_cover\_image function in all versions up to, and including, 5.8.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access or higher, to delete attachments.
