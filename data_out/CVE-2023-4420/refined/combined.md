Vulnerability Overview

CVE-2023-4418 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption

Description: A remote unprivileged attacker can sent multiple packages to the LMS5xx to disrupt its
availability through a TCP SYN-based denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. By exploiting this vulnerability,
an attacker can flood the targeted LMS5xx with a high volume of TCP SYN requests, overwhelming its
resources and causing it to become unresponsive or unavailable for legitimate users.

CVE-2023-4418 has been assigned to this vulnerability.
CVSSv3.1 base score: 7.5
CVSSv3.1 vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
CWE identifier: CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption)

CVE-2023-4419 Use of Hard-coded Credentials

Description: The LMS5xx uses hard-coded credentials, which potentially allow low-skilled unauthorized
remote attackers to reconfigure settings and /or disrupt the functionality of the device.

CVE-2023-4419 has been assigned to this vulnerability.
CVSSv3.1 base score: 9.8
CVSSv3.1 vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
CWE identifier: CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)

CVE-2023-4420 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

Description: A remote unprivileged attacker can intercept the communication via e.g. Man-In-The-
Middle, due to the absence of Transport Layer Security (TLS) in the SICK LMS5xx. This lack of encryp-
tion in the communication channel can lead to the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. The
attacker can exploit this weakness to eavesdrop on the communication between the LMS5xx and the
Client, and potentially manipulate the data being transmitted.

CVE-2023-4420 has been assigned to this vulnerability.
CVSSv3.1 base score: 9.8
CVSSv3.1 vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
CWE identifier: CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information)

CVE-2023-31412 Use of Weak Hash

Description: The LMS5xx uses weak hash generation methods, resulting in the creation of insecure
hashs.
If an attacker manages to retrieve the hash, it could lead to collision attacks and the potential
retrieval of the password.

CVE-2023-31412 has been assigned to this vulnerability.
CVSSv3.1 base score: 7.5
CVSSv3.1 vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

General Security Practices

General Security Measures

As general security measures, SICK recommends to minimize network exposure of the devices, restrict
network access and follow recommended security practices in order to run the devices in a protected IT
environment.

Vulnerability Classification

SICK performs vulnerability classification by using the CVSS scoring system (CVSS v3.1). The environ-
mental score is dependent on the customer’s environment and can affect the overall CVSS score. SICK
recommends that customers individually evaluate the environmental score to achieve final scoring.

# SICK Product Security Incident Response Team (SICK PSIRT)

[SICK Security Advisories](/de/en/w/psirt#advisories)

SICK AG products and services are subject to the highest quality requirements. That is why cyber security is taken into account and tested in the development phase. To ensure that products and services are secure throughout their entire service life, reports on possible vulnerabilities are taken very seriously and handled with the greatest sense of responsibility. Uncovering vulnerabilities is understood as a common goal of different parties with the aim of offering our customers a consistently high level of security.

![](https://cdn.sick.com/media/content/he5/h20/9665608056862.jpg)

![](https://cdn.sick.com/media/content/he5/h20/9665608056862.jpg)

### The SICK Product Security Incident Response Team (SICK PSIRT)

The SICK PSIRT is the central team of SICK AG which is authorized to answer reports regarding the cyber security of products, solutions and services as well as provide information. All reports concerning potential vulnerabilities or other security incidents connected to SICK AG products can be passed on to the SICK PSIRT.

The SICK PSIRT manages the inspection, internal coordination and disclosure of security vulnerabilities. A security advisory is issued for confirmed vulnerabilities as soon as a solution is available. If the situation requires, a security advisory with the measures to be taken is sent out before an update is available.

Reports on potential vulnerabilities or other incidents are more than welcome from anyone, regardless of their customer status. SICK AG respects and takes into account the different interests of reporters and encourages the reporting of information to the SICK PSIRT. The aim is to follow a process of coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities (coordinated vulnerability disclosure).

Handling vulnerabilities is described in document “[Vulnerability Handling Guideline](https://cdn.sick.com/media/content/hc8/h9b/9649321148446.pdf)”.

### Reporting a vulnerability

The SICK PSIRT aims to process every vulnerability with confidentiality and professionalism together with the respective reporters. Neither a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) nor another type of contract is necessary or a requirement for collaboration.

Coordinated vulnerability reports from all members of the security community are greatly appreciated. These include security researchers, universities, CERTs, business partners, authorities, industry associations and suppliers.

Many SICK AG products fulfill important protective functions and are used in critical infrastructures. SICK AG therefore asks for cooperation when dealing with the coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities and also requests that vulnerability information not be disclosed prematurely.

SICK AG requests that as much information as possible is provided in a report in order to speed up processing. This information should contain the following:

* **Contact information and availability**
* **Affected product including model and version number**
* **Classification of the vulnerability** (buffer overflow, XSS, …)
* **Detailed description of the vulnerability** (with verification if possible)
* **Effect of the vulnerability** (if know)
* **Current level of awareness of the vulnerability** (are there plans to disclose it?)
* **(Company) affiliation of the reporter** (if reporter is prepared to provide such information)
* **CVSS score** (if known)

If more information is necessary for the inspection of a vulnerability, the SICK PSIRT will contact the reporter.

If the reporter would like, he/she will be publicly acknowledged after disclosing a new vulnerability.

### Contact information

Reports for the SICK PSIRT are to be sent to this address:
