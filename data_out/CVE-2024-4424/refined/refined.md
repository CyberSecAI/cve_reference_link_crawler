Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-4424:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation**, which leads to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the CemiPark software's access control module does not properly validate user-entered data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The software fails to sanitize or properly encode user-supplied input before displaying it on a web page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code that will be stored and later executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious scripts into the system. When other administrators access the page where the injected script is stored, the malicious code will execute within their browsers. This could allow the attacker to:
    *   Steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the victim, potentially leading to unauthorized changes in the system.
    *   Redirect users to malicious sites, causing further compromise.
    *   Deface the user interface.
    *   Potentially gain further control of the system via other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is located in the web interface of the CemiPark software, specifically within the access control module.
*   **User-Supplied Input:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious code via input fields or parameters that are not properly validated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges in the CemiPark software to create the malicious page or inject the malicious code.
*  **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the CemiPark software's web interface to perform the initial injection.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions 4.5, 4.7, and 5.03 of CemiPark and potentially other versions, as the vendor has not provided a specific range of affected products.
