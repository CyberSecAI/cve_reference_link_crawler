I used to always use Header and Footer Builder. When I tried UAE on a new site it caused all sorts of problems and then I couldn’t get rid of the effects, i.e. I removed the plugin but the header and footer remained on the site. I am really concerned about all my other sites. What will happen if I upgrade to UAE. Will they all break? Bring back the old plugin!!!!

Why when something works exactly as we need it, as simply as we need it, do developers shove something we didn’t ask for down our throats and break our workflow.
I can no longer edit my header or footer templates. So now what?
