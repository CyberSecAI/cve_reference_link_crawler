Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering of the `page` parameter in the `index.php` file of the Airline Reservation System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application is vulnerable to LFI due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input used in file inclusion operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive files on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By manipulating the `page` parameter in the URL, an attacker can include arbitrary local files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as being needed.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `page` in `index.php`.
- The provided PoC demonstrates how to include the `login` file by using the `php://filter` wrapper with base64 encoding.
- Example PoC: `http://192.168.17.22/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=login`
