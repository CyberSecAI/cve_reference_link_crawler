Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-0540:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in Jira's web authentication framework, Jira Seraph. Specifically, it stems from how `roles-required` is handled at the `webwork1` action namespace level versus the action level within first and third party apps. When an app specifies roles-required at the namespace level but *not* at the action level, and the action doesn't perform other authentication/authorization checks, it is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Authentication Bypass:** The core issue is the ability to bypass authentication and authorization checks.
- **Insufficient Authorization Granularity**:  Setting authorization at the namespace level is insufficient for specific actions that require more granular control.
- **Lack of Redundant Checks**: Affected actions do not implement additional authentication or authorization checks, relying solely on the flawed namespace configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can gain access to protected resources or functionalities by exploiting the authentication bypass.
- **Potential Data Breach:** This could expose sensitive information, depending on the vulnerable actions exposed.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** The attacker could potentially execute actions they are not authorized to, leading to data modification or system disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Specially Crafted URLs:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to a specific URL corresponding to a vulnerable WebWork action.
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, indicating a high degree of accessibility.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the target Jira instance.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Actions:** The attacker must be aware of affected apps and vulnerable actions to construct the malicious URL. No other specialized knowledge is required, and a scanner could likely identify vulnerable actions.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects Jira Server and Data Center products but not Jira Cloud.
- A large number of third-party apps are affected because they use the documented, but vulnerable functionality.
- Atlassian has provided a list of affected Marketplace apps, along with fixed versions where available.
- The severity is rated as critical when affected apps are used, and medium otherwise.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Khoadha of Viettel Cyber Security.
- Fixes involve upgrading Jira and related apps to specific versions.
- Workarounds include disabling vulnerable apps until fixes are applied.
