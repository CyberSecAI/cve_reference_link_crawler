---

Jira Service Management Server and Data Center vulnerable to an authentication bypass in its web authentication framework, Jira Seraph.

Although the vulnerability is in the core of Jira, it affects first and third party apps that specify roles-required at the webwork1 action namespace level and do not specify it at an action level. For a specific action to be affected, the action will also need to not perform any other authentication or authorization checks.

For more information on potentially affected apps, please refer to the *Determining which apps are affected* section in [Atlassian's security advisory](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Jira%2BSecurity%2BAdvisory%2B2022-04-20).

A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this by requesting a specially crafted URL to bypass authentication and authorization requirements in WebWork actions using an affected configuration.

**This vulnerability was discovered by Khoadha of Viettel Cyber Security.**

**Affected versions:**

* version < 4.13.18
* 4.14.0 ≤ version < 4.20.6
* 4.21.0 ≤ version < 4.22.0

**Fixed versions:**

* 4.13.x >= 4.13.18
* 4.20.x >= 4.20.6
* All versions >= 4.22.0

| Summary | CVE-2022-0540 - Authentication bypass in Seraph |
| --- | --- |
| Advisory Release Date | 20 Apr 2022 10:00 AM PDT (Pacific Time, -7 hours) |
| Affected Products | * Jira   + Jira Core Server   + Jira Software Server   + Jira Software Data Center * Jira Service Management   + Jira Service Management Server   + Jira Service Management Data Center   Jira Cloud is not affected.Jira Service Management Cloud is not affected. |
| CVE ID(s) | CVE-2022-0540 |

### **Summary of Vulnerability**

Jira and Jira Service Management are vulnerable to an authentication bypass in its web authentication framework, Jira Seraph.

Although the vulnerability is in the core of Jira, it affects first and third party apps that specify `roles-required` at the `webwork1` action namespace level and do not specify it at an `action` level. For a specific action to be affected, the action will also need to not perform any other authentication or authorization checks.

A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to bypass authentication and authorization requirements in WebWork actions using an affected configuration.

### **Severity**

For installations that use apps that have an affected configuration, Atlassian rates the [severity level](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels) of this vulnerability as **critical**, though this may vary if an affected app uses additional permissions checks. For more detailed information on the impact to each app listed in the *Determining which apps are affected* section below, contact the app vendor.

For installations that **do not** use any apps that have an affected configuration as described in the *Summary of Vulnerability* section above, Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **medium**.

This is our assessment, and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

### **Affected Jira Versions**

This includes the following products:

* Jira Core Server
* Jira Software Server
* Jira Software Data Center

* All versions before 8.13.18
* 8.14.x

* 8.17.x
* 8.18.x

* 8.21.x

### **Fixed Jira Versions**

* 8.13.x >= 8.13.18
* 8.20.x >= 8.20.6
* All versions >= 8.22.0

You can download the latest versions from the download pages for [Jira Core](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/core/download) or [Jira Software](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/update).

Please note, these are the first versions that include the fix for CVE-2022-0540. More current bug fix releases are available for the three releases listed above. Atlassian recommends upgrading to the most current bug fix version.

### **Affected Jira Service Management Versions**

This includes the following products:

* Jira Service Management Server
* Jira Service Management Data Center

* All versions before 4.13.18
* 4.14.x

* 4.20.x before 4.20.6
* 4.21.x

### **Fixed Jira Service Management Versions**

* 4.13.x >= 4.13.18
* 4.20.x >= 4.20.6
* All versions >= 4.22.0

You can download the latest versions from the [download page for Jira Service Management](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-management/update).

Please note, these are the first versions that include the fix for CVE-2022-0540. More current bug fix releases are available for the three releases listed above. Atlassian recommends upgrading to the most current bug fix version.

### **Determining which apps are affected**

An app is only affected by CVE-2022-0540 when both of the following conditions are true:

* It’s installed in one of the affected Jira or Jira Service Management versions listed above
* It’s using a configuration vulnerable to CVE-2022-0540

Although app configuration is one factor that determines whether or not it is vulnerable, it is not the cause of the vulnerability. These apps are correctly using documented functionality that was previously implemented by Jira and Jira Service Management in a vulnerable way. If you have already installed a fixed version of Jira or Jira Service Management, you are protected against this vulnerability no matter which apps you have installed.

Atlassian has determined which Atlassian Marketplace apps use a configuration vulnerable to CVE-2022-0540 (see the *List of affected Atlassian Marketplace Apps* section below). If you are using an app that is not listed on Atlassian Marketplace, please contact the developer to determine if it’s using an affected configuration.

The list of affected apps includes two Atlassian apps:

* [Insight - Asset Management](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1212137/insight-asset-management?tab=overview)
  + Versions 8.x and earlier are available from the Atlassian Marketplace

### **Workarounds**

Installing a fixed version of Jira or Jira Service Management is the surest way to remediate CVE-2022-0540. Once a fixed version has been installed, all apps in your instance are protected against CVE-2022-0540 and no further action is required.

If you’re unable to install a fixed version of Jira or Jira Service Management and you’re using any affected apps, refer to the table in the *Determining which apps are affected* section above to determine if non-affected versions of those apps are available. If so, [update](https://confluence.atlassian.com/upm/updating-apps-273875710.html) any affected apps to a non-affected version.

As a last resort, if you’re using any apps listed in the *Determining which apps are affected* section and all versions of the app are affected, you can mitigate the security risk by [disabling the app](https://confluence.atlassian.com/upm/disabling-and-enabling-apps-273875716.html) until you’re able to install a fixed version of Jira or Jira Service Management.

DO NOT disable Insight - Asset Management on the following versions of Jira Service Management

* 4.19.x
* 4.20.x < 4.20.3

In these versions of Jira Service Management, disabling **Insight - Asset Management** causes all of Jira Service Management to be disabled.

For more information on how to disable the **Insight - Asset Management** app, refer to [this Jira KB article](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-install-uninstall-enable-or-disable-insight-asset-management-app-in-different-jira-server-management-instance-type-and-version-1087533700.html).

Jira Server and Data Center vulnerable to an authentication bypass in its web authentication framework, Jira Seraph.

Although the vulnerability is in the core of Jira, it affects first and third party apps that specify roles-required at the webwork1 action namespace level and do not specify it at an action level. For a specific action to be affected, the action will also need to not perform any other authentication or authorization checks.

For more information on potentially affected apps, please refer to the *Determining which apps are affected* section in [Atlassian's security advisory](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Jira%2BSecurity%2BAdvisory%2B2022-04-20).

A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this by requesting a specially crafted URL to bypass authentication and authorization requirements in WebWork actions using an affected configuration.

**This vulnerability was discovered by Khoadha of Viettel Cyber Security.**

**Affected versions:**

* version < 8.13.18
* 8.14.0 ≤ version < 8.20.6
* 8.21.0 ≤ version < 8.22.0

**Fixed versions:**

* 8.13.x >= 8.13.18
* 8.20.x >= 8.20.6
* All versions >= 8.22.0

## Key highlights of the appTimeline, Resource planning, Team capacity

### Impressive timeline view

Visually simple yet powerful roadmap for your project. It is configured in a couple of clicks, and the whole project is in front of your eyes.

### Drag to Assign or set Version

You can use drag and drop to assign a task to an employee or assign a version to the task in which it will be executed.

### More details

You know how it happens: Deadlines are missing, it is unclear what the team members are busy with, it is not known where to move on.

We wondered how to simplify the life of the team and its leaders in solving these problems. It seems that the solution is on the surface, this is a visualization of the project plan, in the context of the team members. But manually creating such a report takes a lot of time.

Our timeline allows you to build such reports on the fly, as well as share them with team members or management. You will be aware of potential problems before they arise.
