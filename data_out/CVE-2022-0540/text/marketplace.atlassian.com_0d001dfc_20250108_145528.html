## Key highlights of the appTimeline, Resource planning, Team capacity

### Impressive timeline view

Visually simple yet powerful roadmap for your project. It is configured in a couple of clicks, and the whole project is in front of your eyes.

### Drag to Assign or set Version

You can use drag and drop to assign a task to an employee or assign a version to the task in which it will be executed.

### More details

You know how it happens: Deadlines are missing, it is unclear what the team members are busy with, it is not known where to move on.

We wondered how to simplify the life of the team and its leaders in solving these problems. It seems that the solution is on the surface, this is a visualization of the project plan, in the context of the team members. But manually creating such a report takes a lot of time.

Our timeline allows you to build such reports on the fly, as well as share them with team members or management. You will be aware of potential problems before they arise.
