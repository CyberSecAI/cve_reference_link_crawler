- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-use-after-free flaw in the `InitializeImage()` function within the `PngDecoderCore.cs` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-use-after-free.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: Passing a specially crafted PNG image file to ImageSharp for conversion.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PNG image file to the ImageSharp library. User interaction (processing the malicious image) is required. The attack vector is local to the system running ImageSharp.
