{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Uninitialized memory being leaked to an untrusted process due to unused fields in SurfaceControl not being zeroed.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information disclosure due to memory leak.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Leak of sensitive information to an untrusted process.",
  "Attack vectors": "An untrusted process receiving a SurfaceControl object with uninitialized memory.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be an untrusted process that is able to receive a SurfaceControl object."
