Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6162:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in how Undertow handles URL-encoded request paths, specifically when using the AJP listener.
- The same buffer is used to decode paths for multiple concurrent requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Path Handling:** Due to the shared buffer, the path information for concurrent requests can become mixed up. This results in the server attempting to access the wrong resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is a potential denial of service. This occurs because legitimate resources become inaccessible due to the path mix-up, leading to errors like "404 Not Found" or other application failures.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Concurrent Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered when multiple requests are made to the server concurrently.
- **URL-Encoded Paths:** The issue arises specifically when the request path contains URL-encoded characters.
- **AJP Listener:** The vulnerability is specific to the AJP (Apache JServ Protocol) listener within Undertow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send multiple, concurrent requests to a server using the AJP listener and with URL-encoded paths.  No special privileges are required.

**Summary of Affected Products:**

Based on the provided advisories, the following products are confirmed to be affected:

-   NetApp:
