## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Social Pixel <= 2.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to: https://example.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=social-pixel
2. Under "Facebook" add the payload `'); alert(2); console.log('blah` for the "Identificador".
3. Click the checkbox next to "Activación"
4. Save the settings and view the site to see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
