The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Social Pixel WordPress plugin, and it matches the CVE ID.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin fails to sanitize and escape some of its settings. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they access the affected pages.
- This could lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user, like modifying data, creating admin users or etc.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the "Identificador" field of the plugin's settings under the Facebook section, via the WordPress admin interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrative privileges (or other high-privilege role with access to the plugin settings page) on the WordPress website.
- The unfiltered\_html capability can be disallowed (for example in multisite setup) yet the vulnerability is still exploitable.
