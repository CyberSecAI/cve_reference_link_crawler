## Summary

Kohya\_ss v22.6.1 is vulnerable to multiple command injections and path injections.

## Project

kohya\_ss

## Tested Version

[v22.6.1](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss/releases/tag/v22.6.1)

## Details

### Issue 1: Command injection in `basic_caption_gui.py` (`GHSL-2024-019`)

The `gradio_basic_caption_gui_tab` function in `basic_caption_gui.py` takes multiple user input, [`images_dir`](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss/blob/6d0a9ba0d2d3fea61d5b0e18e989a34f760d5c61/library/basic_caption_gui.py#L93-L97) among others, and uses it as an argument in a command, which is later [executed](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss/blob/6d0a9ba0d2d3fea61d5b0e18e989a34f760d5c61/library/basic_caption_gui.py#L54) leading to arbitrary command injection.

```
def caption_images(
    caption_text,
    images_dir,
    overwrite,
    caption_ext,
    prefix,
    postfix,
    find_text,
    replace_text,
):

        # Code cut for readability
        run_cmd = f'python "tools/caption.py"'
        run_cmd += f' --caption_text="{caption_text}"'

        # Add optional flags to the command
        if overwrite:
            run_cmd += f' --overwrite'
        if caption_ext:
            run_cmd += f' --caption_file_ext="{caption_ext}"'

        run_cmd += f' "{images_dir}"'

        log.info(run_cmd)

        # Run the command based on the operating system
        if os.name == 'posix':
            os.system(run_cmd)
        else:
            subprocess.run(run_cmd)

```
### Issue 2: Command injection in `git_caption_gui.py` (`GHSL-2024-020`)

The `gradio_git_caption_gui_tab` function in `git_caption_gui.py` takes multiple user input, [`train_data_dir`](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss/blob/6d0a9ba0d2d3fea61d5b0e18e989a34f760d5c61/library/git_caption_gui.py#L77C13-L81) among others, and uses it as an argument in a command, which is later [executed](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss/blob/6d0a9ba0d2d3fea61d5b0e18e989a34f760d5c61/library/git_caption_gui.py#L51) leading to arbitrary command injection.

```
def caption_images(
    train_data_dir,
    caption_ext,
    batch_size,
    max_data_loader_n_workers,
    max_length,
    model_id,
    prefix,
    postfix,
):
    # Code cut for readability
    run_cmd = f'{PYTHON} finetune/make_captions_by_git.py'
    if not model_id == '':
        run_cmd += f' --model_id="{model_id}"'
    run_cmd += f' --batch_size="{int(batch_size)}"'
    run_cmd += (
        f' --max_data_loader_n_workers="{int(max_data_loader_n_workers)}"'
    )
    run_cmd += f' --max_length="{int(max_length)}"'
    if caption_ext != '':
        run_cmd += f' --caption_extension="{caption_ext}"'
    run_cmd += f' "{train_data_dir}"'

    log.info(run_cmd)

    # Run the command
    if os.name == 'posix':
        os.system(run_cmd)
    else:
        subprocess.run(run_cmd)

```
### Issue 3: Command injection in `group_images_gui.py` (`GHSL-2024-021`)

The `gradio_group_images_gui_tab` function in `group_images_gui.py` takes multiple user input, [`group_size`](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss/blob/f8d2673641778ed5b362f107f9f92a20aa15979a/library/group_images_gui.py#L92-L100) among others, and uses it as an argument in a command, which is later [executed](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss/blob/f8d2673641778ed5b362f107f9f92a20aa15979a/library/group_images_gui.py#L50) leading to arbitrary command injection.

```
 def group_images(
    input_folder,
    output_folder,
    group_size,
    include_subfolders,
    do_not_copy_other_files,
    generate_captions,
    caption_ext,
):
    # Code cut for readability
    run_cmd = f'{PYTHON} "{os.path.join("tools","group_images.py")}"'
    run_cmd += f' "{input_folder}"'
    run_cmd += f' "{output_folder}"'
    run_cmd += f' {(group_size)}'
    if include_subfolders:
        run_cmd += f' --include_subfolders'
    if do_not_copy_other_files:
        run_cmd += f' --do_not_copy_other_files'
    if generate_captions:
        run_cmd += f' --caption'
        if caption_ext:
            run_cmd += f' --caption_ext={caption_ext}'

    log.info(run_cmd)

    if os.name == 'posix':
        os.system(run_cmd)
    else:
        subprocess.run(run_cmd)

```
### Issue 4: command injection in `finetune_gui.py` (`GHSL-2024-022`)

The `finetune_tab` function in `finetune_gui.py` takes multiple user input, [`caption_metadata_filename`](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss/blob/f8d2673641778ed5b362f107f9f92a20aa15979a/finetune_gui.py#L819-L822) among others, and uses it as an argument in a command, which is later [executed](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss/blob/f8d2673641778ed5b362f107f9f92a20aa15979a/finetune_gui.py#L478) leading to arbitrary command injection.

```
    if generate_caption_database:
        if not os.path.exists(train_dir):
            os.mkdir(train_dir)

        run_cmd = f"{PYTHON} finetune/merge_captions_to_metadata.py"
        if caption_extension == "":
            run_cmd += f' --caption_extension=".caption"'
        else:
            run_cmd += f" --caption_extension={caption_extension}"
        run_cmd += f' "{image_folder}"'
        run_cmd += f' "{train_dir}/{caption_metadata_filename}"'
        if full_path:
            run_cmd += f" --full_path"

        log.info(run_cmd)

        if not print_only_bool:
            # Run the command
            if os.name == "posix":
                os.system(run_cmd)
            else:
                subprocess.run(run_cmd)

```
#### Impact

These issues may lead to arbitrary command injection on the server. Please note that the issues affects posix systems. The command is also executed on Windows systems on [line 56](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss/blob/6d0a9ba0d2d3fea61d5b0e18e989a34f760d5c61/library/basic_caption_gui.py#L56), but is run without invoking the shell (without `shell=True` argument), which [prevents exploitation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#security-considerations) via the PoC provided above.

### Issue 5: path injection in `common_gui.py` `add_pre_postfix` function (`GHSL-2024-023`)

[`add_pre_postfix`](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss/blob/f8d2673641778ed5b362f107f9f92a20aa15979a/library/common_gui.py#L302) function takes user-controlled input from many sources, f.ex. the `gradio_basic_caption_gui_tab` function in `basic_caption_gui.py` variable [`images_dir`](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss/blob/6d0a9ba0d2d3fea61d5b0e18e989a34f760d5c61/library/basic_caption_gui.py#L93-L97) and uses it to create a path and write a file to it.

The vulnerability can only be exploited if the folder that the attacker wants to write to contains one of the files with the extensions: “.jpg”, “.jpeg”, “.png”, “.webp” due to [this check](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss/blob/f8d2673641778ed5b362f107f9f92a20aa15979a/library/common_gui.py#L322-L325). With this vulnerability, it is possible to control the contents of the file, the extension, but not the file name. Due to this limitations, it is a limited file write.

```
def add_pre_postfix(
    folder: str = "",
    prefix: str = "",
    postfix: str = "",
    caption_file_ext: str = ".caption",
) -> None:

    if prefix == "" and postfix == "":
        return

    image_extensions = (".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".webp")
    image_files = [
        f for f in os.listdir(folder) if f.lower().endswith(image_extensions)
    ]

    for image_file in image_files:
        caption_file_name = os.path.splitext(image_file)[0] + caption_file_ext
        caption_file_path = os.path.join(folder, caption_file_name)

        if not os.path.exists(caption_file_path):
            with open(caption_file_path, "w", encoding="utf8") as f:
                separator = " " if prefix and postfix else ""
                f.write(f"{prefix}{separator}{postfix}")
        else:
            with open(caption_file_path, "r+", encoding="utf8") as f:
                content = f.read()
                content = content.rstrip()
                f.seek(0, 0)

                prefix_separator = " " if prefix else ""
                postfix_separator = " " if postfix else ""
                f.write(
                    f"{prefix}{prefix_separator}{content}{postfix_separator}{postfix}"
                )

```
### Issue 6: path injection in `common_gui.py` `find_and_replace` function (`GHSL-2024-024`)

[`find_and_replace`](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss/blob/f8d2673641778ed5b362f107f9f92a20aa15979a/library/common_gui.py#L365) function takes multiple user input `folder_path`, `caption_file_ext`, `search_text`, `replace_text` which allow for finding and replacing contents of any files on the system, that the attacker knows the contents of. For example, an attacker would be able to change the contents of a configuration file for a service with arbitrary data.

```
def find_replace(
    folder_path: str = "",
    caption_file_ext: str = ".caption",
    search_text: str = "",
    replace_text: str = "",
) -> None:

    log.info("Running caption find/replace")

    if not has_ext_files(folder_path, caption_file_ext):
        msgbox(
            f"No files with extension {caption_file_ext} were found in {folder_path}..."
        )
        return

    if search_text == "":
        return

    caption_files = [f for f in os.listdir(folder_path) if f.endswith(caption_file_ext)]

    for caption_file in caption_files:
        with open(os.path.join(folder_path, caption_file), "r", errors="ignore") as f:
            content = f.read()

        content = content.replace(search_text, replace_text)

        with open(os.path.join(folder_path, caption_file), "w") as f:
            f.write(content)

```
### Impact

These issues may lead to `limited file write`.
