**Vulnerabilities:**

*   The advisory states that multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Apache Traffic Server that could lead to HTTP request smuggling or MITM attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **HTTP Request Smuggling:** An attacker could potentially manipulate or inject HTTP requests, leading to unexpected behavior by the server and potentially allowing them to bypass security measures, access restricted resources, or perform unauthorized actions.
*   **MITM Attacks:** A Man-in-the-Middle attack could allow an attacker to intercept and potentially alter communications between clients and the server.

**Root Cause:**

*   The advisory does not specify the exact root cause of CVE-2021-44040, but it is grouped with other CVEs that led to HTTP request smuggling or MITM attacks.
