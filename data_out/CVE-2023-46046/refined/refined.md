Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46046:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing null pointer check in the `ti_expr` within the MiniZinc parser. This means that under certain conditions, the parser might attempt to dereference a null pointer, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is the potential dereference of a null pointer. This occurs when the parser encounters a specific syntax error and fails to handle a null value appropriately.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation leads to a crash of the MiniZinc compiler (specifically, a segmentation fault - SEGV). This can prevent users from compiling and executing MiniZinc models, effectively causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted `.mzn` file:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted `.mzn` file (MiniZinc model file). The specific structure of this file causes the parser to encounter the null pointer and attempt to dereference it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious `.mzn` file to the MiniZinc compiler. This could be through direct access to the compiler, through a web interface that uses MiniZinc, or some other way of feeding input to the compiler.
- **No Special Privileges:** Exploitation doesn't require special privileges, as it's triggered by parsing a malformed input file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `afe67acc20898e4308044b54c4acf7a08df544f0`, which included a missing nullptr check.
- The specific issue was reported in GitHub issue #730.
- The affected version is MiniZinc 2.7.6
