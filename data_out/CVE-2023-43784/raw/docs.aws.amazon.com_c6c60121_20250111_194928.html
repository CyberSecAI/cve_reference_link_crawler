      credentials</em> to verify who you are and whether you have permission to access the
    resources that you are requesting. AWS uses the security credentials to authenticate and
    authorize your requests.</p><p>For example, if you want to download a protected file from an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, your
    credentials must allow that access. If your credentials don't show you are authorized to
    download the file, AWS denies your request. However, your AWS security credentials aren't
    required for you to download a file in an Amazon S3 bucket that is publicly shared.</p><p>There are different types of users in AWS, each with their own security credentials: </p><div class="itemizedlist">
     
     
     
     
  <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
      <p><b>Account owner (root user)</b> â The user who created
        the AWS account and has full access.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
      <p><b>AWS IAM Identity Center users</b> â Users managed in
        AWS IAM Identity Center.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
      <p><b>Federated users</b> â Users from external identity
        providers who are granted temporary access to AWS through federation. For more information
        about federated identities, see <a href="./id_roles_providers.html">Identity providers and federation</a>.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
      <p><b>IAM users</b> â Individual users created within
        the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service.</p>
    </li></ul></div><p>Users have either long-term or temporary security credentials. Root user, IAM user,
    and access keys have long-term security credentials that do not expire. To protect long-term
    credentials have processes in place to <a href="./id_credentials_access-keys.html">manage access
      keys</a>, <a href="./id_credentials_passwords.html">change passwords</a>, and <a href="./id_credentials_mfa.html">enable MFA</a>. </p><p>To simplify managing root user credentials across member accounts in AWS Organizations, you can
    centrally secure the root user credentials of your AWS accounts managed using AWS Organizations. <a href="./id_root-user.html#id_root-user-access-management">Centrally manage root access for member
        accounts</a> lets
    you centrally remove and prevent long-term root user credential recovery, preventing unintended
    root access at scale.</p><p>IAM roles, users in AWS IAM Identity Center, and federated users have temporary security credentials.
    Temporary security credentials expire after a defined period of time or when the user ends their
    session. Temporary credentials work almost identically to long-term credentials, with the
    following differences:</p><div class="itemizedlist">
     
     
  <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
      <p>Temporary security credentials are <em>short-term</em>, as the
        name implies. They can be configured to last for anywhere from a few minutes to several
        hours. After the credentials expire, AWS no longer recognizes them or allows any kind of
        access from API requests made with them.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
      <p>Temporary security credentials are not stored with the user but are generated
        dynamically and provided to the user when requested. When (or even before) the temporary
        security credentials expire, the user can request new credentials, as long as the user
        requesting them still has permissions to do so.</p>
    </li></ul></div><p>As a result, temporary credentials have the following advantages over long-term
    credentials:</p><div class="itemizedlist">
     
     
     
  <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
      <p>You do not have to distribute or embed long-term AWS security credentials with an
        application.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
      <p>You can provide access to your AWS resources to users without having to define an
        AWS identity for them. Temporary credentials are the basis for <a href="./id_roles.html">roles and identity federation</a>.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
      <p>The temporary security credentials have a limited lifetime, so you do not have to update
        them or explicitly revoke them when they're no longer needed. After temporary security
        credentials expire, they cannot be reused. You can specify how long the credentials are
        valid, up to a maximum limit. </p>
    </li></ul></div>
    <h2 id="security-considerations-ref">Security considerations</h2>
    <p>We recommend that you consider the following information when determining the security
      provisions for your AWS account:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
    <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
        <p> When you create an AWS account, we create the account root user. The credentials of
          the root user (account owner) allow full access to all resources in the account. The first
          task you perform with the root user is to grant another user administrative permissions to
          your AWS account so that you minimize the usage of the root user. </p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) provides an extra level of security for users who
          can access your AWS account. For additional security, we recommend that you require MFA
          on the AWS account root user credentials and all IAM users. For more information, see <a href="./id_credentials_mfa.html">AWS Multi-factor authentication in IAM</a>.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>AWS requires different types of security credentials, depending on how you access
          AWS and what type of AWS user you are. For example, you use sign-in credentials for
          the AWS Management Console while you use access keys to make programmatic calls to AWS. For help
          determining your user type and sign-in page, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/what-is-sign-in.html">What is AWS Sign-In</a> in the
            <em>AWS Sign-In User Guide</em>.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>You can't use IAM policies to deny the root user access to resources explicitly. You
          can only use an AWS Organizations <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_type-auth.html">service control policy (SCP)</a> to limit the permissions of the root user. </p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>If you forget or lose your root user password, you must have access to the email address
          associated with your account in order to reset it.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>If you lose your root user access keys, you must be able to sign in to your account as
          the root user to create new ones.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Do not use the root user for your everyday tasks. Use it to perform the tasks that only
          the root user can perform. For the complete list of tasks that require you to sign in as the
          root user, see <a href="./id_root-user.html#root-user-tasks">Tasks that require root user credentials</a>.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Security credentials are account-specific. If you have access to multiple
          AWS accounts, you have separate credentials for each account.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><a href="./access_policies.html">Policies</a> determine what actions a user, role,
          or member of a user group can perform, on which AWS resources, and under what
          conditions. Using policies you can securely control access to AWS services and resources
          in your AWS account. If you must modify or revoke permissions in response to a security
          event, you delete or modify the policies instead of making changes directly to the
          identity.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Be sure to save the sign-in credentials for your <em>Emergency Access</em>
          IAM user and any access keys you created for programmatic access in a secure location.
          If you lose your access keys, you must sign in to your account to create new ones.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>We strongly recommend that you use temporary credentials provided by IAM roles and
          federated users instead of the long-term credentials provided by IAM users and access
          keys.</p>
