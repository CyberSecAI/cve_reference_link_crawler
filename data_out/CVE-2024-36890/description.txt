In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/slab: make __free(kfree) accept error pointers

Currently, if an automatically freed allocation is an error pointer that
will lead to a crash.  An example of this is in wm831x_gpio_dbg_show().

   171	char *label __free(kfree) = gpiochip_dup_line_label(chip, i);
   172	if (IS_ERR(label)) {
   173		dev_err(wm831x->dev, "Failed to duplicate label\n");
   174		continue;
   175  }

The auto clean up function should check for error pointers as well,
otherwise we're going to keep hitting issues like this.
