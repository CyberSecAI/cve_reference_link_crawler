- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Faulty implementation of the JWT (JSON Web Token) library in the web configuration interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient verification of data authenticity (CWE-345), leading to authentication bypass (CAPEC-115).
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Bypassing password authentication in the web configuration interface.
    - Enabling and disabling Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and LTE interfaces of the charger.
    - Initiating a factory reset causing short-term denial-of-service, settings reset and disconnect from the owner’s Wi-Fi network.
    - Enumerating available Wi-Fi networks SSIDs at charger’s location.
    - Obtaining system information (serial numbers, software versions, MAC addresses).
    - Managing user preferences.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Access to the private network to which the charger is connected.
    - Local access to the Ethernet interface of the charger.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Network access or local physical access to the charger's Ethernet interface.
