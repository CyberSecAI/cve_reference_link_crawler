Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.23.1 and 1.22.7, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 3 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* go/parser: stack exhaustion in all Parse\* functions

  Calling any of the Parse functions on Go source code which contains deeply nested literals can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  This is CVE-2024-34155 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/69138>.
* encoding/gob: stack exhaustion in Decoder.Decode

  Calling Decoder.Decode on a message which contains deeply nested structures can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  This is a follow-up to CVE-2022-30635.

  Thanks to Md Sakib Anwar of The Ohio State University (anwa...@osu.edu) for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2024-34156 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/69139>.
* go/build/constraint: stack exhaustion in Parse

  Calling Parse on a "// +build" build tag line with deeply nested expressions can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  This is CVE-2024-34158 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/69141>.

View the release notes for more information:

<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.23.1>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go website:

<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.23.1` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Dmitri and Michael for the Go team

This change makes sure that we are properly checking the ignored field
recursion depth in decIgnoreOpFor consistently. This prevents stack
exhaustion when attempting to decode a message that contains an
extremely deeply nested struct which is ignored.
