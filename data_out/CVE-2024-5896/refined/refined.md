Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `username` parameter in the `/employee_gatepass/classes/Users.php?f=save` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through this parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates the user-supplied `username` parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- Unrestricted SQL execution: The injected SQL code is executed without any restrictions or filtering.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Sensitive information disclosure: An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential information by injecting SQL queries to retrieve such data.
- Data manipulation: The attacker could also modify or delete data in the database, potentially causing data integrity issues and business disruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `/employee_gatepass/classes/Users.php?f=save` endpoint.
- The `username` parameter within the POST request's form-data is the injection point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No authentication is mentioned as being required to exploit the vulnerability, which suggests this endpoint is accessible to unauthenticated users.
- The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to extract the database name using the `updatexml` function, confirming the SQL injection vulnerability.
- The vulnerable software is identified as "Employee and Visitor Gate Pass Logging System 1.0".
- The `id` parameter is also mentioned as related to the SQL statement.
- The code analysis confirms the direct usage of the `username` parameter in the SQL query without sanitization.
