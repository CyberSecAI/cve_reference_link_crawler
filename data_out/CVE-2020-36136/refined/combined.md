| Hi, [@cskaza](https://github.com/cskaza) I found a high-risk time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability in the member function module. （[http://website/member/edit）](http://website/member/edit%EF%BC%89) [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45351599/103391758-f8003a80-4b55-11eb-9d30-b797e309761d.png) the vulnerable code is on cszcms/models/csz\_model.php [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45351599/103391806-1fef9e00-4b56-11eb-8d48-5d14498f2382.png) The vulnerability parameter is pm\_sendmail.This parameter is passed to the database query without any filtering, resulting in a vulnerability. [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45351599/103391846-4a415b80-4b56-11eb-99a2-f51752f1bd10.png) All the data in the database can be obtained by using sqlmap.
