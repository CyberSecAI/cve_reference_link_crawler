- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `pm_sendmail` parameter is passed to a database query without any filtering.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Time-based blind SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain all data from the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is located in the member function module, specifically at `http://website/member/edit`. The vulnerable parameter is `pm_sendmail`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint with malicious SQL injection payloads in the `pm_sendmail` parameter. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
