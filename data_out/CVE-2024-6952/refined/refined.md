Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and sanitization of the `seme` parameter within the `view_single_result.php` file of the `itsourcecode University Management System 1.0`. Specifically, the `$stid` variable in `php/functions.php` lacks proper filtering, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of an SQL injection vulnerability. This allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries executed by the application.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not adequately sanitize or validate user-provided input, specifically the `seme` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, student records, and other confidential information.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data within the database, leading to data corruption or loss.
*   **System Compromise:** In severe cases, an attacker might be able to leverage SQL injection to gain further access to the server by executing system-level commands on the database server, depending on the database system configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to `/view_single_result.php` with a maliciously crafted `seme` parameter.
*   **Specifically vulnerable parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is the `seme` field sent in the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **User Account:** The attacker must have a registered student account to access the vulnerable functionality.
*   **Understanding of SQL:**  The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft malicious payloads.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when a user, logged in as a student, accesses the `/view_single_result.php` page.
*   The `vr` parameter represents the `StudentID`, and `vn` represents the student's name.
*   The 'view Result' button triggers a POST request that contains the vulnerable `seme` parameter.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) includes:
    *   **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:** A payload that uses `SLEEP()` to confirm the injection by causing a time delay.
        ```
        seme=1st' AND (SELECT 4900 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))IWYu) AND 'sLik'='sLik
        ```
    *   **Union-Based SQL Injection:** A payload that uses `UNION ALL SELECT` to retrieve data from other database tables.
        ```
        seme=1st' UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x716b7a7171,0x424b4d66785475486669785141445a6a4e4f72774d675543446e585856446d686c56674b58685a57,0x7176767871),NULL-- -
        ```
* The vulnerability exists in `php/functions.php` page, specifically due to the unsanitized `$stid` field.
