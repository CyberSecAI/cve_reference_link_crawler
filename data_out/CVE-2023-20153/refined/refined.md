- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user-supplied input in specific Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) CLI commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability (CWE-77).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to perform command injection attacks on the underlying operating system and elevate privileges to *root*.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated, local attacker with valid *Administrator* privileges can exploit the vulnerability by submitting a crafted CLI command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user with *Administrator* privileges on the affected Cisco ISE device.
