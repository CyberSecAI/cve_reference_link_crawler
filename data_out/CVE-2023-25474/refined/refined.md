- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress About Me 3000 widget plugin does not properly implement CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force a higher-privileged user to perform unwanted actions, such as modifying settings or content, under their current authentication. The specific impact varies from case to case.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into submitting it. This could be done through a link in an email or on a malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in user to click on a malicious link or visit a malicious website. The attacker does not require any privileges on the target website. The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
