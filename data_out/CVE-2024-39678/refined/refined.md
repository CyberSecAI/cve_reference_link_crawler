- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing or incorrect nonce validation on the AJAX action handler in the Cooked plugin for WordPress.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick users into performing actions they did not intend to perform under their current authentication. In this specific case, the attacker can retrieve recipe IDs.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTML form that triggers a POST request to the WordPress admin-ajax.php endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious page containing the crafted form.
