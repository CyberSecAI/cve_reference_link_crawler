**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability is present.
- The application uses user-provided input directly in SQL queries, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data leakage, modification, or deletion.
- The attacker can retrieve sensitive information from the database, as demonstrated by the provided payload which attempts to leak the database name.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `/gasmark/editbrand.php` with a malicious payload in the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is required to exploit the SQL injection in the identified file `/gasmark/editbrand.php`.
