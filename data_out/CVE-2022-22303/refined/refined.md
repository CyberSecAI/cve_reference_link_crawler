Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an "exposure of sensitive system information to an unauthorized control sphere" (CWE-497). Specifically, FortiGate user credentials are being stored in cleartext within the FortiManager configuration conflict file.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    -  Cleartext storage of sensitive data (FortiGate user credentials) in the config conflict file.
    -  Exposure of this file to potentially unauthorized, albeit low-privileged, users.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** A low-privileged authenticated user can gain access to FortiGate user credentials by accessing the config conflict file, leading to information disclosure. This could potentially enable further unauthorized actions if the compromised credentials provide access to other resources.

* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local. An attacker would need to have a low-privileged account on the FortiManager system.

* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker must have a valid, albeit low-privileged, user account on the affected FortiManager system.
    - They must be able to access the configuration conflict file.

* **Affected Products:**
    - FortiManager version 7.0.0 through 7.0.2
* **Solution:** Upgrade to FortiManager version 7.0.3 or above, or upgrade to 6.4.8 or above.
