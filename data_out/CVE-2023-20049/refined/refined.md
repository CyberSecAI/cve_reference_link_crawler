- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of malformed Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) packets received on line cards where the BFD hardware offload feature is enabled.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the improper processing of malformed BFD packets when BFD hardware offload is enabled on specific Cisco ASR 9000 series routers and line cards. This can lead to memory corruption or other resource exhaustion issues resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit can cause line card exceptions or a hard reset, leading to loss of traffic over the affected line card while it reloads, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote and requires sending a crafted IPv4 BFD packet to an affected device. The vulnerability is not exploitable with IPv6 BFD packets directly. However, an IPv6 BFD session with an IPv4 address configured on the attached interface can be targeted using a crafted IPv4 BFD packet sent to the IPv4 address.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable device and does not require authentication. The attacker can be remote.
