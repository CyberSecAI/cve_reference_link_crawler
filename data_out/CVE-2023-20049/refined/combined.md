| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS XR Software for ASR 9000 Series Routers Bidirectional Forwarding Detection Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-bfd-XmRescbT  First Published: 2023 March 8 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [Yes](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCwc39336](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc39336)     CVE-2023-20049     CWE-805       CVSS Score: [Base 8.6](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2023-20049     CWE-805       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-bfd-XmRescbT/csaf/cisco-sa-bfd-XmRescbT.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) hardware offload feature of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers, ASR 9902 Compact High-Performance Routers, and ASR 9903 Compact High-Performance Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a line card to reset, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of malformed BFD packets that are received on line cards where the BFD hardware offload feature is enabled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv4 BFD packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause line card exceptions or a hard reset, resulting in loss of traffic over that line card while the line card reloads.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:[https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-bfd-XmRescbT)[/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-bfd-XmRescbT](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-bfd-XmRescbT)  This advisory is part of the March 2023 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: March 2023 Semiannual Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74917).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software and have BFD hardware offload enabled for any of the installed line cards:    + ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers only if they have a Lightspeed or Lightspeed-Plus-based line card installed   + ASR 9902 Compact High-Performance Routers   + ASR 9903 Compact High-Performance Routers For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine Which Line Cards are Installed To determine which line cards are installed in the device, use the **show platform** CLI command.  Cisco ASR 9902 and 9903 Compact High-Performance Routers integrate a Lightspeed-Plus-based line card.  The following line cards are Lightspeed-based:    + A9K-16X100GE-TR   + A99-16X100GE-X-SE   + A99-32X100GE-TR The following line cards are Lightspeed-Plus-based:    + A9K-4HG-FLEX-SE   + A9K-4HG-FLEX-TR   + A9K-8HG-FLEX-SE   + A9K-8HG-FLEX-TR   + A9K-20HG-FLEX-SE   + A9K-20HG-FLEX-TR   + A99-4HG-FLEX-SE   + A99-4HG-FLEX-TR   + A99-10X400GE-X-SE   + A99-10X400GE-X-TR   + A99-32X100GE-X-SE   + A99-32X100GE-X-TR For more information about line card type identification, see [ASR 9000 Series Line Card Types](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/asr-9000-series-aggregation-services-routers/116726-qanda-product-00.html).  **Note:** The Cisco Lightspeed-Plus list of product identifiers was accurate at the time of publication. For specific questions and further clarification about a product identifier, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC). Determine Whether BFD Hardware Offload is Enabled To determine which line cards have BFD hardware offload enabled, use the **show bfd hw-offload state** CLI command. If the configuration and operational states are enabled on one of the previously mentioned line cards, the device is affected by this vulnerability. The following example shows a device in which BFD hardware offload is not enabled:  ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006#show bfd hw-offload state   Wed Mar 8 16:00:00.000 UTC   BFD HW OFFLOAD Feature state:   0/2/CPU0   -----------------   Configuration State:   Disabled   Operational   State:   Disabled   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006#   ```  The following example shows a device in which BFD hardware offload is enabled:  ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006#show bfd hw-offload state   Wed Mar 8 16:00:00.000 UTC      BFD HW OFFLOAD Feature state:   0/2/CPU0   -----------------   Configuration State:  Enabled   Operational   State:  Enabled   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006#      ```  Not all BFD sessions are handled in hardware even if BFD hardware offload is enabled. At least one BFD session has to indicate **H/W** as **Yes**,as shown in the following example:  ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006#show bfd all session   Wed Mar 8 16:00:00.000 UTC   IPv4:   -----   Interface  Dest Addr         Local det time(int*mult)      State                           Echo         Async   H/W   NPU   ---------- -------------   ------------ ----------------   ----------   ti100      10.0.0.1        0s(0s*0)     900ms(300ms*3)     UP                                              No    n/aHu0/2/0/15 192.168.100.100 0s(0s*0)     900ms(300ms*3)     UP                                              Yes   0/2/CPU0   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006#      ```    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-lsplus-Z6AQEOjk#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + IOS Software   + IOS XE Software   + IOS XR Platforms not listed in the [Vulnerable Products](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-lsplus-Z6AQEOjk#vp) section of this advisory   + NX-OS Software  Details  * This vulnerability cannot be exploited with IPv6 BFD packets. However, if an IPv6 BFD session also has an IPv4 address configured on the attached interface, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv4 BFD packet to the configured IPv4 address on the interface. If interface Te0/1/0/10/0 was also configured with IPv4 address 192.168.1.1, the attacker could exploit the IPv6 BFD session by sending a crafted IPv4 BFD packet to 192.168.1.1, as shown in the following example:  ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006#show bfd all session   Wed Mar 8 16:00:00.000 UT   IPv4:   -----         IPv6:   -----   Interface           Dest Addr                                          Local det time(int*mult)      State   H/W                 NPU             Echo             Async   ------------------- --------------- ---------------- ---------------- ----------   Te0/1/0/10/0        fe80::36f8:e7ff:fee0:947   Yes                 0/1/CPU0        0s(0s*0)         900ms(300ms*3)   UP      ```  Workarounds  * There is a workaround and a mitigation that address this vulnerability.  The only workaround that fully mitigates this vulnerability is disabling BFD hardware offload. Creating Infrastructure Access Control Lists (iACLs) is a mitigation that only limits the attack surface.  **Disable BFD Hardware Offload**  To disable BFD hardware offload, remove any of the **hw-module bfw-hw-offload enable** commands and reset the assigned line card, as shown in the following example:  ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006#config terminalWed Mar 8 16:00:00.000 UTCRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006(config)#no hw-module bfd-hw-offload enable location 0/2/CPU0RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006(config)#commitRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006(config)#endRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006#hw-module subslot 0/2/CPU0 reload   ```  **Create Infrastructure Access Control Lists**  While iACLs limit the attack surface, they do not prevent exploitation from allowed peers and are subject to spoofing.  The following example shows an iACL that allows only infrastructure BFD peers (where 192.0.2.x/24 is the infrastructure address space):  ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006# show running-config ipv4 access-listipv4 access-list BFD_DROP  5 remark * Mark sure to Allow Legitimate BFD peers * 10 permit udp 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq bfd 11 remark * Depending on BFD deployment may need * 12 permit udp 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq 4784 13 permit udp 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq 6784 15 remark * Drop all other attempts to the infrastructure address space * 20 deny udp any 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq bfd 30 permit ipv4 any any!RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006#   ```  Apply this iACL to all exposed interfaces.  The following example shows an iACL that allows only BFD packets with a Time to Live (TTL) of 255 (expected for single hop sessions):  ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006# show running-config ipv4 access-listipv4 access-list BFD_DROP_TTL 5 remark * Drop based purely on TTL. Allow our Single Hop BFD sessions * 10 permit udp any 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq bfd ttl eq 25511 remark * Depending on BFD deployment may need *12 permit udp any 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq 4784 ttl eq 25513 permit udp any 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq 6784 ttl eq 25514 remark * You would need to tune the above two lines for multi-hop sessions *15 remark * Deny anything else for BFD * 20 deny udp any any eq bfd ttl lt 25521 remark * You would need to tune the above line for multi-hop sessions *30 permit ipv4 any any!RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006#   ```  Apply this iACL to all exposed interfaces.  While this workaround and mitigation have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.
