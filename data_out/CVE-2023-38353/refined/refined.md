- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing SSL certificate validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure in-app payment system. The application does not properly validate SSL certificates when communicating with payment servers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can steal highly sensitive information via a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. This information is related to the in-app payment system.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the application and the payment server.
