- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization and capability checks on the `ajax__shortcode_cache` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated shortcode execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary shortcodes available on the target site. This could potentially lead to various impacts depending on the available shortcodes (e.g., information disclosure, modification of content, privilege escalation).
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks targeting the `ajax__shortcode_cache` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs no authentication and can be located remotely.
