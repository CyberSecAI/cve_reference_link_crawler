### Description

The Geo Controller plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized shortcode execution due to missing authorization and capability checks on the ajax\_\_shortcode\_cache function in all versions up to, and including, 8.6.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes available on the target site.
