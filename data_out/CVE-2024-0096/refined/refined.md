Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-0096:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper privilege management within the NVIDIA ChatRTX UI. Specifically, a user can manipulate the execution flow by sending specific user inputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper privilege management (CWE-269).
- The ability for a user to control execution flow via user input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure.
- Escalation of privileges.
- Data tampering.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access (AV:L).
- Attack complexity is high (AC:H), possibly indicating that specific conditions or crafted inputs are required for successful exploitation.
- Requires low privileges (PR:L), meaning any local user can potentially trigger the vulnerability.
- No user interaction is required (UI:N).
- The scope is changed (S:C), meaning a successful exploit can impact other components within the application's trust boundary.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs local access to the system where NVIDIA ChatRTX is installed.
- Attacker needs to have a user account with low privileges on the system.
- Attacker needs to be able to craft user inputs that will change the execution flow.
