# Privilege escalation by design

Critical

## Package

Stalwart Mail Server

## Affected versions

<= 0.7.3

## Patched versions

0.8.0

## Description

### Summary

Attackers who achieved Arbitrary Code Execution as the stalwart-mail user (including web interface admins) can gain complete root access to the system.

### Details

Usually, system services are run as a separate user (not as root) to isolate an attacker with Arbitrary Code Execution to the current service. Therefore, other system services and the system itself remains protected in case of a successful attack. stalwart-mail runs as a separate user, but it can give itself full privileges again in a simple way, so this protection is practically ineffective. Actually, it is so simple, there is even a web admin GUI to do this:

### PoC

1. Modify the configuration to run stalwart-mail as root (either via overwriting the file as the local stalwart-mail user, or over the network using the admin interface needing admin credentials)
2. Run arbitrary commands as root by configuring them as pipe filter and triggering these filters (technically, not part of the privilege escalation; untested)

### Impact

1. Server admins who handed out the admin credentials to the mail server, but didn't want to hand out complete root access to the system.
2. Any attacked user when the attackers gained Arbitrary Code Execution using another vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
