Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the CMSmadesimple v2.2.18 application. Specifically, the "Page Specific Metadata" and "Smarty data" fields within the Content Manager Menu do not adequately sanitize or escape user-provided scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS, where malicious JavaScript code is injected and stored within the application's database. This code is then executed when a user accesses the affected page.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The primary vulnerability is the insufficient sanitization of user inputs in the "Page Specific Metadata" and "Smarty data" fields within the Content Manager Menu, allowing malicious scripts to be injected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser session.
*   **Malicious Actions:** The attacker can use the XSS to perform a wide range of malicious actions, including:
    *   Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Possibly gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information if the victim has elevated permissions

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Content Manager Menu:** The vulnerability is specifically located within the "Content Manager Menu" of CMSmadesimple.
*   **Page Specific Metadata and Smarty Data Fields:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into the "Page Specific Metadata" and "Smarty data" fields within the Content Manager Menu.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have an account with the ability to access and edit content within the "Content Manager Menu".
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Fields:** The attacker needs to know which specific fields ("Page Specific Metadata" and "Smarty data") are vulnerable.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Scripts:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content includes Proof of Concept (POC) details and example XSS payloads.
*   The content mentions that the vulnerability is present in CMSmadesimple version 2.2.18.
*   The exploit uses the `<object>` tag with a javascript URL scheme to execute the payload.
