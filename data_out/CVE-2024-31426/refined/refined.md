- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Inline Related Posts plugin for WordPress versions 3.3.1 and below is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could craft a malicious web page or link that, when visited by a logged-in user, sends a forged request to the vulnerable WordPress plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious web page or clicking a malicious link. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to WordPress.
