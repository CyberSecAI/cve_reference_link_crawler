- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unprivileged users can perform privileged actions. The specific impact varies.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a function that lacks proper access control checks, likely through a web request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A subscriber-level user (or an unauthenticated user, if that is the case of the missing authentication) can exploit the vulnerability.
