# Docker escape when running from docker-compose.yml included in git repo

Jul 10, 2023

## Package

auto-gpt

## Affected versions

< 0.4.3

## Patched versions

0.4.3

## Description

### Impact

Running Auto-GPT < v0.4.3 by cloning the git repo and executing `docker compose run auto-gpt` in the repo root uses a different docker-compose.yml file from the one suggested in the official docker set up instructions. The docker-compose.yml file located in the repo root mounts itself into the docker container without write protection.

This means that if malicious custom python code is executed via the `execute_python_file` and `execute_python_code` commands, it can overwrite the docker-compose.yml file and abuse it to gain control of the host system the next time Auto-GPT is started.

### Patches

The issue has been patched in PR [#4761](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/pull/4761), and the patch is included in release v0.4.3.

### Workarounds

If you are unable or not willing to upgrade to the newest version of Auto-GPT, the patch can be applied manually in docker-compose.yml as follows:

```
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
      # add the following two lines:
      - ./docker-compose.yml:/app/docker-compose.yml:ro
      - ./Dockerfile:/app/Dockerfile:ro
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
