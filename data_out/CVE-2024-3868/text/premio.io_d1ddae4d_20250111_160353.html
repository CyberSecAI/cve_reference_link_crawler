## Why Folders?

## Dynamic Folders

Automatically organize your files into folders based on specific criteria or metadata, such as date created, file type, author, tags, or keywords. With this feature, you can arrange and store large numbers of files with varied data. As you add new files, they are automatically categorized and placed in the appropriate folder based on defined rules.

![Import Folders from Pre-Existing Folder Plugins](https://premio.io/wp-content/themes/premio-website/assets/img/product/folders/import-folders.webp)
## Import Folders from Pre-Existing Folder Plugins

Suppose you switch from a pre-existing plugin or competitor to Premio's Folders. In that case, you can easily import your existing folder structure, ensuring a smooth transition. All folders are imported using the same structure as the initial plugin, promoting consistency and organization within your folder system.

[Learn More](https://premio.io/downloads/folders/import-folders)
## Custom Posts Types

Organize your website's content beyond the standard categories and tags by creating custom post types (e.g. WooCommerce products, orders, coupons, Elementor templates, product displays, and more). This helps you group similar content together, making it easier for users to navigate and find what they're looking for.

## Download Media Folders

Download all the contents of your media folders easily in a ZIP file, allowing you to access and use your content on any device. This is particularly useful for freelancers, photographers, or anyone who relies on their media for work. Free up space on your website and save time compared to downloading individual files from your folders.

[Learn More](https://premio.io/downloads/folders/download-media-folders)
## Bulk Organize The Media Library Files, Custom Posts, Pages

Save time and effort when organizing or moving your files in Folders. Use bulk actions to organize, rearrange, and move media files, custom posts, and pages. Bulk actions are significantly faster than individual file moves, especially when dealing with hundreds or thousands of files. This frees up your time and allows you to focus on other tasks.

## Keyboard Shortcuts for Editing

If you frequently edit files within the Folders plugin, keyboard shortcuts can save you considerable time, especially for repetitive tasks like copying, pasting, renaming, or deleting files. Editing files becomes faster and more intuitive, allowing you to navigate and complete tasks without needing to switch between keyboard and mouse.

## User Access to Folders

If your folders contain confidential information, user access restrictions can prevent unauthorized viewing or modification, mitigating security risks. This is especially crucial for folders containing financial data, client information, or internal documents.

## Lock Folders

Locking folders can prevent accidental modifications or deletions by unauthorized users, maintaining the integrity of your data. You can secure confidential or personal files, such as financial documents, contracts, or personal photos, by restricting access to authorized users only.

[Learn More](https://premio.io/downloads/folders/lock-folders)
## Folders Customization

With font, icon, and background color customization, you can design your folders to match your exact preferences. No more bland, generic folders - make them visually appealing, easy to navigate, and enjoyable to use.

[Learn More](https://premio.io/downloads/folders/delete-unused-media)

Instead of uploading files one by one, you can drag and drop entire folders containing multiple files at once, saving significant time and effort. This feature is especially useful for projects where you already have your media organized in specific folders on your computer.
