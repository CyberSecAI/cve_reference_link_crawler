Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to the specified CVEs:

**CVE-2022-31557**:

*   **Root Cause:** Absolute path traversal due to unsafe use of the Flask `send_file` function.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application directly uses user-controlled input to construct file paths for the `send_file` function, without proper sanitization or validation.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially access and download arbitrary files on the server's filesystem. This could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, such as configuration files, source code, or other confidential data.
*  **Attack Vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL to download files, specifying an absolute path or directory traversal sequences, an attacker can gain access to arbitrary files that the user has read permission to.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have knowledge on file system structure or other related information to download certain files.

*   **Root Cause:** The Flask `send_file` function is used without proper validation, allowing absolute path traversal.
*   **Weaknesses:** These vulnerabilities occur because applications directly use user-controlled input to construct file paths for the `send_file` function.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can potentially access and download files on the server's filesystem. This could reveal source code or other sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Attackers can exploit the issue by sending requests with manipulated file paths, using absolute paths or directory traversal sequences like `../`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attackers need network access to the vulnerable application and basic knowledge of common directory traversal techniques.

**Summary of Common Elements:**

*   **Vulnerability:** All listed CVEs indicate a consistent pattern, an absolute path traversal vulnerability due to insecure usage of Flaskâ€™s `send_file` function.
*   **Root Cause:**  The underlying issue is the direct use of user-controlled input in file path construction without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact:** They all share the potential for arbitrary file access on the server, leading to information disclosure and potential further attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The main attack vector is crafting malicious requests that contains absolute path or path traversal sequences to the server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Generally, the attacker needs a network connection to reach the server. No special privileges are required or user interaction is required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text mentions `github/securitylab#669 (comment)` as a reference for all CVEs, indicating that they were found through the same vulnerability analysis research/process.
*   Many of these projects are described as "personal", "academic", or "hobby" projects. This means they likely lack thorough security practices, thus making them vulnerable to path traversal attacks.
*   The advisory database entries for all mentioned CVE's show the same CVSS score of 9.3, except for **CVE-2022-31570** with a 9.8 and **CVE-2022-31566** which is an 8.6, which highlights the criticality of such vulnerabilities.
*   A common remediation strategy across multiple CVEs is the recommendation to use `flask.safe_join` or replace `flask.send_file` with `flask.send_from_directory`.
