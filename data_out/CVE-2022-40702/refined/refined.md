- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the "Advanced Local Pickup for WooCommerce" plugin. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, specifically missing authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user (Subscriber) could potentially perform actions they are not authorized to perform. The specific impact varies case by case
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting a function lacking proper access controls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a registered user with the "Subscriber" privilege level.
