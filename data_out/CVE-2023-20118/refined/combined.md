For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has not released software updates to address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sbr042-multi-vuln-ej76Pke5>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products   CVE-2023-20025 affects all software releases that are running on the following Cisco products:   + RV016 Multi-WAN VPN Routers   + RV042 Dual WAN VPN Routers   + RV042G Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers   + RV082 Dual WAN VPN RoutersCVE-2023-20026 and CVE-2023-20118 affect all software releases that are running on the following Cisco products:   + RV016 Multi-WAN VPN Routers   + RV042 Dual WAN VPN Routers   + RV042G Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers   + RV082 Dual WAN VPN Routers   + RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers   + RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN RoutersProducts Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the following Cisco RV Series Small Business Routers:    + RV160 VPN Routers   + RV160W Wireless-AC VPN Routers   + RV260 VPN Routers   + RV260P VPN Routers with PoE   + RV260W Wireless-AC VPN Routers   + RV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers   + RV340W Dual WAN Gigabit Wireless-AC VPN Routers   + RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers   + RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit PoE VPN Routers  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  **CVE-2023-20025: Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, and RV082 Routers Authentication Bypass Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, and RV082 Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication on an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user input within incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and gain *root* access on the underlying operating system.  Cisco has not and will not release software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, administrators may disable the affected feature as described in the [Workarounds](#workarounds) section.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwd47551](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd47551)CVE ID: CVE-2023-20025Security Impact Rating (SIR): CriticalCVSS Base Score: 9.0CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H  **CVE-2023-20026 and CVE-2023-20118: Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320 and RV325 Routers Remote Command Execution Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320 and RV325 Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user input within incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain *root*-level privileges and access unauthorized data. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have valid administrative credentials on the affected device.  Cisco has not and will not release software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, administrators may disable the affected feature as described in the [Workarounds](#workarounds) section.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwd60199](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd60199) and [CSCwe41652](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe41652)CVE ID: CVE-2023-20026 and CVE-2023-20118SIR: MediumCVSS Base Score: 6.5CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities. However, administrators can mitigate the vulnerabilities by disabling remote management and blocking access to ports 443 and 60443. The routers will still be accessible through the LAN interface after the mitigation has been implemented. Disable Remote Management To disable remote management, do the following:    1. Log in to the web-based management interface for the device.   2. Choose **Firewall > General**.   3. Uncheck the **Remote Management** check box.Block Access to Ports 443 and 60443 First, add a new service to the access rules of the device for port 60443. It is not necessary to create a service for port 443 because it is predefined in the services list.    1. Log in to the web-based management interface for the device.   2. Choose **Firewall > Access Rules**.   3. Click **Service Management**.   4. In the **Service Name** field, enter **TCP-60443**.   5. From the **Protocol** drop-down list, choose **TCP**.   6. In both of the **Port Range** fields, enter **60443**.   7. Click **Add to List**.   8. Click **OK**. Next, create access rules to block ports 443 and 60443. To create an access rule to block port 443, do the following:    1. Log in to the web-based management interface for the device.   2. Choose **Firewall > Access Rules**.   3. Click **Add**.   4. From the **Action** drop-down list, choose **Deny**.   5. From the **Service** drop-down list, choose **HTTPS (TCP 443-443)**.   6. From the **Log** drop-down list, choose **Log packets match this rule**.   7. From the **Source Interface** drop-down list, choose the option that matches the WAN connection on the device.   8. From the **Source IP** drop-down list, choose **Any**.   9. From the **Destination IP** drop-down list, choose **Single**.   10. In both of the **Destination IP** fields, enter the WAN IP address.   11. Click **Save**. To create an access rule to block port 60443, repeat the preceding steps, but for Step 5, choose **HTTPS (TCP 60443-60443)** from the **Service** drop-down list.  **Note**: If a second WAN port is being used, two additional ACL rules need to be set up using the WAN number and IP address for the second WAN port.  While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.
