Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35086:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `findPage` function within the `BpmTaskFromMapper.xml` file. This function is used in a call chain involving `ProcessInstanceController`, `FlowableProcessInstanceServiceImpl` and `ProcessInstanceMapper`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the mentioned `findPage` function. This indicates that user-supplied input, likely within the parameters of the `findPage` function, is not properly sanitized and is directly incorporated into an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** A successful SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to:
    - **Extract sensitive data** from the database, potentially including user information, application secrets, or other confidential details.
    - **Modify or delete existing data,** leading to data corruption or denial of service.
    - **Potentially gain control** over the database server itself, depending on the database privileges and specific injection techniques.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests to the application endpoint that uses the vulnerable `findPage` function.
- **Input Parameters:** The attacker manipulates input parameters within the HTTP request to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application to send malicious requests.
- **Understanding of the API:** The attacker needs to understand the API of the `findPage` function to correctly structure the injection.
- **No Authentication Details Given:**  It is not explicitly specified if authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, but it is likely the vulnerable endpoint would require some level of access.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable software is J2EEFAST version 2.7.0.
- The vendor website is `https://www.j2eefast.com/`.
- The vulnerability is fixed in a newer version of J2EEFAST (version not specified but the website mentions 2.8.0).
- The content also highlights that J2eeFAST uses Spring Boot 2.X, MyBatis-Plus 3.3.1, Apache Shiro, Redis, Freemarker, Flowable 6.4.2 and Jquery + Bootstrap.
