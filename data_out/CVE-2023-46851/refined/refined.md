- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Allura Discussion and Allura Forum import functionalities do not restrict URL values specified in attachments.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Unrestricted URL values in attachments during import allow for local file reading and exposure.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Exposure of internal files, potentially leading to session hijacking or remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Project administrators using the import functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a project administrator to run these imports, and supply a crafted attachment with a URL pointing to a file on the server.
