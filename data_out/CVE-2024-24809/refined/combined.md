# Path Traversal: 'dir/../../filename' and Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type in traccar

High

[tananaev](/tananaev)
published
GHSA-vhrw-72f6-gwp5
Apr 10, 2024

## Package

traccar

## Affected versions

<=5.12

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

Since the system allows registration by default, attackers can acquire ordinary user permissions by registering an account and exploit this vulnerability to upload files with the prefix `device.` under any folder.

Attackers can use this vulnerability for phishing, cross-site scripting attacks, and potentially execute arbitrary commands on the server.

### Details

#### Vulnerability Reproduction

1. Register a regular account.
2. Log in with this account.
3. Create a device.
4. Upload an image for this device and click save.
5. Modify the Identifier of the device to `WulNPNAK/../../../../../opt/traccar/modern` and click save.
6. Re-upload a file.
7. Finally, the file can be found in the root directory of the site.

#### Implementation Principle

In the `uploadImage` interface within [src/main/java/org/traccar/api/resource/DeviceResource.java](https://github.com/traccar/traccar/blob/v5.12/src/main/java/org/traccar/api/resource/DeviceResource.java), if the `content-type` is set to `image/html`, `image/txt`, etc., the generated file will also have `html` or `txt` as the suffix.

Furthermore, this interface uses `device.getUniqueId()` as the upload path. Attackers can set `uniqueId` to `WulNPNAK/../../../../../opt/traccar/modern`, causing the uploaded file to be stored in a different location.

When exploiting this vulnerability, I observed that if the `uniqueId` is set to `WulNPNAK/../../../../../opt/traccar/modern` from the first attempt and an image is uploaded, the upload fails. During debugging, I found that the failure was due to the unsuccessful creation of a folder. However, I am not aware of the specific reason for this failure, so I attempted the upload twice.

### PoC

Usageï¼š`python3 exp.py http://example.com:8082`

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
