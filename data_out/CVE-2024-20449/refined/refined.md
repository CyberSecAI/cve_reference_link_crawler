- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper path validation in Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC) when using the Secure Copy Protocol (SCP).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability (CWE-23). This allows an attacker to bypass intended path restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in a specific container with root privileges. This can lead to a complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, utilizing the SCP protocol to upload malicious code to an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated and have low-level privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
