The content is related to CVE-2020-25887.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `mg_resolve_from_hosts_file` function within `mongoose/src/mg_resolv.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `sscanf` function is used to copy data from a potentially large input string `p` into a fixed-size buffer `alias` (size 256) without proper bounds checking.
- The input `p` can originate from a "tainted" hosts file and can be up to 1024 characters long (minus the IP digits).
- Specifically, `sscanf(p, "%ss%n", alias, &len)` is vulnerable, as the `%s` format specifier doesn't limit the amount of data written to alias, causing a buffer overflow when the hostname in the hosts file exceeds 255 characters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malformed hosts file containing a hostname larger than 256 bytes can trigger a buffer overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other undefined behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted hosts file with an overly long hostname.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the contents of the hosts file read by the `mg_resolve_from_hosts_file` function.
