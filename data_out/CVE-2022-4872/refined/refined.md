      "Missing authorization checks",
      "Missing CSRF protection",

    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can craft a URL that includes the desired option to be changed and send the request to the affected WordPress site.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any authentication or special privileges. A network connection is the only requirement"
