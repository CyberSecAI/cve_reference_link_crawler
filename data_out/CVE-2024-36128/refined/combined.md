# Soft-lock Directus by providing a string value to random string util

High

[br41nslug](/br41nslug)
published
GHSA-632p-p495-25m5
Jun 3, 2024

## Package

npm

directus
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<=10.11.1

## Patched versions

10.11.2

## Description

### Describe the Bug

Providing a non-numeric length value to the random string generation utility will create a memory issue breaking the capability to generate random strings platform wide. This creates a denial of service situation where logged in sessions can no longer be refreshed as sessions depend on the capability to generate a random session ID.

### To Reproduce

1. Test if the endpoint is working and accessible, `GET http://localhost:8055/utils/random/string`
2. Do a bad request `GET http://localhost:8055/utils/random/string?length=foo`
3. After this all calls to `GET http://localhost:8055/utils/random/string` will return an empty string instead of a random string
4. In this error situation you'll see authentication refreshes fail for the app and api.

### Impact

This counts as an unauthenticated denial of service attack vector so this impacts all unpatched instances reachable over the internet.

### Severity

High

7.5

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-36128
