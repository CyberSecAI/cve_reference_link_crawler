The provided content describes a hardcoded password vulnerability in the TOTOLINK N600R router firmware.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `/etc/shadow.sample` file in the firmware contains a hardcoded password for the root user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Hardcoded password:** The root password, "cs2012", is directly included in the firmware image.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can gain root access to the router using the hardcoded password.
*   This would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, modify settings, potentially install malware, and compromise the device and the network it connects to.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Network access to the router's administrative interface.
*   An attacker could potentially gain access via remote exploitation if the administrative interface is exposed to the internet or via an internal network if the attacker is connected to it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have access to the router's login interface.
*   The attacker must know the presence and value of the hardcoded password (which is provided in the document).
