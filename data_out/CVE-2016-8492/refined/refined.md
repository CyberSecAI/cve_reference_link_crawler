- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of the ANSI X9.31 Random Number Generator (RNG) with a static seed to generate cryptographic keys in long-lived security tunnels such as SSL/TLS/SSH/IPSec. This was used in older versions of FortiOS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    -  Use of a weak random number generator, ANSI X9.31, which was removed from the list of FIPS-approved random number generation algorithms in January 2016.
    - Using a static seed for the RNG, which makes the generated keys predictable.
    - The use of the vulnerable RNG for generating keys used in long-lived security tunnels.
-  **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exploit the predictable cryptographic keys generated by the vulnerable RNG to perform unauthorized disclosure of information. This can result in the decryption of previously recorded encrypted communications.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is a cryptanalytic attack against the RNG.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to perform cryptanalysis on the output of the vulnerable RNG. Additionally, the attacker needs to have captured encrypted traffic to be able to decrypt it.
