Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7484:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content clearly relates to CVE-2024-7484. The Wordfence article explicitly states that the vulnerability is "CRM Perks Forms <= 1.1.3 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Arbitrary File Upload" and references CVE-2024-7484. The vulnerability details and affected versions also align. The included trac links show the vulnerable code and the fix.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper file validation in the `handle_uploaded_files` function within the CRM Perks Forms plugin. This allows an attacker to upload files with dangerous extensions.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin does not adequately check the file types being uploaded.
    *   **Insecure File Handling:** The `handle_uploaded_files` function lacks sufficient validation of uploaded file extensions, allowing for potentially harmful file types.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload any file type to the server, including executable code.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading malicious code (e.g., PHP scripts), the attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server, leading to complete site compromise and control.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a standard HTTP POST request to the WordPress site, specifically targeting the file upload functionality.
    *   **File Upload Form:** The attacker would need to utilize a form that triggers the vulnerable `handle_uploaded_files` function.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with, at minimum, administrator-level privileges. This means that a lower level user cannot exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site to send the malicious requests.

**3. Additional Technical Details:**

*   **File Type Check Bypass:** The vulnerability exists because the plugin only checked for allowed extensions but not for extensions that should be denied.
*   **Specific Code Location:** The vulnerable function is located at `crm-perks-forms/trunk/includes/front-form.php`.
*   **Patch:** The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.1.4 of the CRM Perks Forms plugin. The patch added a list of disallowed file extensions.
*   **Wordfence Analysis:** The Wordfence analysis confirms the vulnerability and the conditions for exploitation, and recommends updating to the latest version.

**4. Summary**
The CRM Perks Forms plugin up to version 1.1.3 is vulnerable to an authenticated arbitrary file upload. The lack of file extension validation in the `handle_uploaded_files` function allows authenticated users to upload malicious files, leading to potential remote code execution. An attacker requires administrator-level access and network access to exploit this vulnerability. Users should update to version 1.1.4 or later.
