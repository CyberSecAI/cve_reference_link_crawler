# ZipInputStream-related security bugs in Minecraft mods

Advisory issued on January 11th, 2024 (UTC) by apple502j.

Several Minecraft mods were found to have path traversal security bugs related to improper `ZipInputStream` usage. These bugs allow for writing files and installing mods unexpectedly. Note that while the underlying issues are the same, the method of exploitation significantly differs across mods.

## Affected Mods

The following mods are affected. Note that this information will be updated as the authors patch the issue.

* [ServerRPExposer](https://github.com/Kihron/ServerRPExposer): 1.0.0-1.0.2. **Update to 1.0.3.**
* [ARRP](https://github.com/Devan-Kerman/ARRP): 0.5.4-the first version named 0.8.1. **Update to the second version named 0.8.1.**
* [MCRPX](https://github.com/Speedy11CZ/mcrpx): Until 1.4.0. **Update to 1.4.1.**
* [Reden](https://github.com/zly2006/reden-is-what-we-made): Until 0.2.445. **Update to 0.2.514.**
* [Advanced Backups](https://github.com/MommyHeather/AdvancedBackups): Until 3.5.3. **Update to 3.6.**
* An unnamed Forge mod (pending resolution)
* An unnamed Spigot plugin (disclosure deferred)
* An unnamed Paper plugin (pending resolution)

### ServerRPExposer (CVE-2024-22779)

The victim must connect to a malicious multiplayer server then accept the server resource pack. Files in the resource pack may be written outside the expected directory, possibly to `mods` folder, leading to RCE.

* CVSS3.1: 8.8 (High) - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
* CVSS4.0: 8.6 (High) - CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/AU:N/V:D/RE:L

### ARRP (CVE-2024-24042)

This is a bug in a library mod. It is only exploitable when another mod uses ARRP in the following ways:

* Calling `addRootResource` with attacker-provided `path` and `data`, OR calling `load(ZipInputStream)` with attacker-provided zip, **and**
* Calling `dumpDirect(Path)`, `dump(Path)`, or `dump(File)`.

In this unlikely situation, files may be written outside the expected directory, possibly to `mods` folder, leading to RCE.

Note: `load(Path)` and `dump(ZipOutputStream)` are safe. **If you use ARRP without loading zips, you are likely safe.** We found zero mods that would allow exploitation of the vulnerability on GitHub; however some non-GitHub mods may be using this, hence this advisory.

There are two versions named "0.8.1", due to a broken patch. The second one - released later - fixes the issue.

* CVSS3.1: 8.8 (High) - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
* CVSS4.0: 8.6 (High) - CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N

### MCRPX (CVE-2024-24043)

MCRPX is a tool to extract resource pack files. It is exploitable when the user feeds a malicious zip file.

* CVSS3.1: 5.5(Medium) - CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N
* CVSS4.0: 6.7(Medium) - CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/AU:N/V:D/RE:L

### Reden (CVE-2024-29672)

Reden is a mod with multiple debugging features. If a client connects to a malicious server and uses certain keybinds (referred to as `DEBUG_RTC_REQUEST_SYNC_DATA` in the code), the server can then send a packet to the client that includes a malicious Zip file, triggering path traversal in `KeyCallbacks.kt` and file write on the client.

* CVSS3.1: 8.8 (High) - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
* CVSS4.0: 8.6 (High) - CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N

### Advanced Backups (CVE-2024-39118)

Advanced Backups is a multiplatform mod providing backup functionality. The vulnerability triggers when a local user restores a crafted backup file.

* CVSS3.1: 5.5 (Medium) - CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N
* CVSS4.0: 6.7 (Medium) - CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/AU:N/V:D

## Technical Background

Path traversal bugs - bugs that abuse the resolution of `..` paths, or in some contexts, absolute paths when unexpected - have been around for decades. When writing files to `./minecraft/temp` with the name `../mods/malware.jar`, the output path resolves to `./minecraft/mods/malware.jar` in most circumstances - convenient when you are writing paths (in, say, config files), incredinly dangerous if an attacker is providing paths. Unfortunately, ZIP file formats do not prohibit `..` as the directory name. Extracting a zip file without checking for those special paths, therefore, would lead to a disaster.

Example of vulnerable code:

```
// given bad zip and "./minecraft/temp"
public static void unzip(InputStream is, Path targetDir) throws IOException {
    try (ZipInputStream zip = new ZipInputSteram(is)) {
        ZipEntry e;
        while ((e = zip.getNextEntry()) != null) {
            // e.getName() could return: "../mods/malware.jar"
            // path would then be: "./minecraft/temp/../mods/malware.jar"
            // which resolves to: "./minecraft/mods/malware.jar"
            Path path = targetDir.resolve(e.getName());
            if (entry.isDirectory()) {
                Files.createDirectories(path);
            } else {
                Files.createDirectories(path.getParent());
                Files.copy(zip, path);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

To fix this, the absolute path could be checked:

```
if (!path.toRealPath().startsWith(targetDir.toRealPath())) {
    // continue is acceptable, however, at this point the Zip is likely malicious.
    break;
}
```
