## Description

# GitHub Security Lab (GHSL) Vulnerability Report, codeium-chrome: `GHSL-2024-027`

The [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com) team has identified potential security vulnerabilities in [codeium-chrome](https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium-chrome).

We are committed to working with you to help resolve these issues. In this report you will find everything you need to effectively coordinate a resolution of these issues with the GHSL team.

If at any point you have concerns or questions about this process, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at `securitylab@github.com` (please include `GHSL-2024-027` as a reference). See also [this blog post](https://github.blog/2022-04-22-removing-the-stigma-of-a-cve/) written by GitHub's Advisory Curation team which explains what CVEs and advisories are, why they are important to track vulnerabilities and keep downstream users informed, the CVE assigning process, and how they are used to keep open source software secure.

If you are *NOT* the correct point of contact for this report, please let us know!

## Summary

The service worker of the codeium-chrome extension doesn't check the sender when receiving an external message. This allows an attacker to host a website that will steal the user's Codeium api-key, and thus impersonate the user on the backend autocomplete server.

## Project

codeium-chrome

## Tested Version

[v1.2.52](https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium-chrome/releases/tag/1.2.52)

## Details

### Issue: Private information leakage in serviceWorker.ts (`GHSL-2024-027`)

The service worker of the codeium-chrome extension doesn't check the sender when receiving an external message. This allows any website to query the `onMessageExternal` listener and leak the user's `name`, `api_key` and other miscellaneous settings.

[serviceWorker.ts](https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium-chrome/blob/5cdb029110fe6987086fe41d6b64b98a070f9ab7/src/serviceWorker.ts#L68)

```
// The only external messages:
//  - website auth
//  - request for api key
//  - set icon and error message
chrome.runtime.onMessageExternal.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  if (message.type === 'user') {
    (async () => {
      const user = await getStorageItem('user');
      sendResponse(user);
      if (user?.apiKey === undefined) {
        await loggedOut();
      }
    })().catch((e) => {
      console.error(e);
    });
    return true;
  }
  if (message.type === 'clientSettings') {
    (async () => {
      const storageItems = await getStorageItems(['user', 'enterpriseDefaultModel']);
      const clientSettings: ClientSettings = {
        apiKey: storageItems.user?.apiKey,
        defaultModel: storageItems.enterpriseDefaultModel,
      };
      sendResponse(clientSettings);
    })().catch((e) => {
      console.error(e);
    });
    return true;
  }
  if (message.type === 'allowlist') {
    (async () => {
      const allowlist = await getStorageItem('allowlist');
      sendResponse(allowlist);
    })().catch((e) => {
      console.error(e);
    });
    return true;
  }
  if (message.type == 'error') {
    unhealthy(message.message).catch((e) => {
      console.error(e);
    });
    // No response needed.
    return;
  }
  if (message.type == 'success') {
    loggedIn().catch((e) => {
      console.error(e);
    });
    // No response needed.
    return;
  }
  if (typeof message.token !== 'string' || typeof message.state !== 'string') {
    console.log('Unexpected message:', message);
    return;
  }
  (async () => {
    const typedMessage = message as { token: string; state: string };
    const user = await getStorageItem('user');
    if (user?.apiKey === undefined) {
      await login(typedMessage.token);
    }
  })().catch((e) => {
    console.error(e);
  });
});
```

[manifest.json](https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium-chrome/blob/5cdb029110fe6987086fe41d6b64b98a070f9ab7/static/manifest.json#L47)

```
 "externally_connectable": {
    "matches": ["<all_urls>"]
  }
```
#### Impact

This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure`. An attacker can use the API key for the Codeium autocomplete server that is meant for another user. They can use this api key to make queries to the backend autocomplete server as the other user.

#### Remediation

1. Compare the sender of the message to the user-defined allowlist before returning private information. In order to do so, check the sender.origin or the sender.url first.
2. Limit access to the chrome extension in the manifest file by changing `<all_urls>` to a regex of domains manually.

#### Proof of Concept

```
 chrome.runtime.sendMessage(receiverExtensionID, {type: "user"},function (response) {
        if (response) alert(response);
    });
```

Host an html page with the above javascript code, which will send a message to the codeium-chrome extension and show the `api-key` and `username` in an alert.

## GitHub Security Advisories

We recommend you create a private [GitHub Security Advisory](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/creating-a-security-advisory) for these findings. This also allows you to invite the GHSL team to collaborate and further discuss these findings in private before they are [published](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/publishing-a-security-advisory).

## Credit

These issues were discovered and reported by GHSL team member [@Kwstubbs (Kevin Stubbings)](https://github.com/Kwstubbs).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
