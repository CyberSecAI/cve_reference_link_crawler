- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ImageRecycle pdf & image compression plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin allows injection of malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts that are executed when users visit the vulnerable website, potentially leading to redirects, serving of malicious advertisements, or other forms of malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the plugin itself, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts, potentially through input fields or other means of data interaction within the plugin's functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
