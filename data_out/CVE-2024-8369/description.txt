The EventPrime â€“ Events Calendar, Bookings and Tickets plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access to Private or Password-protected events due to missing authorization checks in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.4.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view private or password-protected events.
