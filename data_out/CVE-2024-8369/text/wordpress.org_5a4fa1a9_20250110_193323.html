Im always looking for something different from the usual, found EventPrime and installed it on a friend’s website. Everything works amazingly.Only crits i have is the site needs to be cusotmised via CSS, which for me is not a bad thing, but for someone less tech savy, its going to add a little stress to it. Maybe an idea for the next upgrade, in the settings area, give the user the ability to select fonts, sizes, colors, border radius, button colors and states. On the flip side, the tech support i have recieved from EventPrime, has been brilliant, prob some of the best tech support on a plugin i have received in ages.. 10/10 for that.Well done folks, keep up the good work

I tried quite a few calendar plugins before finding this one. It doesn’t seem very well known, but it should be! I was looking for something very specific and EventPrime was the only one out of the box that came with the features I required. I’m so thankful I found this plugin!
