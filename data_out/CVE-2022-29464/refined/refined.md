{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an unrestricted arbitrary file upload in the `/fileupload` endpoint. The `ToolsAnyFileUploadExecutor` class, used for handling 'toolsAny' action, allows an attacker to specify the filename during the upload, without proper sanitization. This leads to a path traversal vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted file upload",
      "Path traversal",
      "Lack of authentication/authorization on the `/fileupload` endpoint"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution (RCE) is possible by uploading malicious JSP files to locations accessible by the webserver. This is achieved by using path traversal to write files outside the intended directory.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP POST request to the `/fileupload` endpoint with a crafted filename and malicious JSP content.",
	"The vulnerable endpoint is `/fileupload`",
        "The 'toolsAny' action is used during the exploitation."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send HTTP requests to the WSO2 server.",
      "No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."
    ]
