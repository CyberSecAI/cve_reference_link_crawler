Subject: CVE-2022-29464 :: WSO2 Unrestricted arbitrary file upload, and remote
 code to execution vulnerability.

I have not seen this come across the oss-sec/CISA/DHS emails at this point, but anyone using WSO2 or a derivative needs to check this out right away.

[https://docs.wso2.com/display/Security/Security+Advisory+WSO2-2021-1738](https://docs.wso2.com/display/Security/Security%2BAdvisory%2BWSO2-2021-1738)

Good writeup and PoC code here: <https://github.com/hakivvi/CVE-2022-29464>
