Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-19788:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an integer handling issue within PolicyKit. Specifically, the software incorrectly processes user IDs (UIDs) that are larger than the maximum value of a signed integer (`INT_MAX`). This incorrect handling leads to an authentication bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Integer Overflow/Incorrect Handling:** The primary weakness lies in how PolicyKit handles UIDs. When a UID exceeds `INT_MAX`, it can be interpreted as a negative value due to the way signed integers work.
- **Authentication Bypass:**  The vulnerability allows a local attacker to bypass intended authentication checks when their UID is larger than `INT_MAX`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** An unprivileged user with a UID greater than `INT_MAX` can execute arbitrary `systemctl` commands, effectively gaining administrative privileges.
- **Arbitrary Systemctl Command Execution:**  The attacker can use the vulnerability to start, stop, enable, disable, or otherwise manipulate system services and units. This can lead to a range of impacts, including system instability, data loss, or denial of service.
- **Disclosure of Sensitive Information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).** (Per NetApp advisory)

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **Manipulated User ID:** The user must have a UID that is larger than the maximum value of a signed integer (INT_MAX).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Account:**  The attacker requires a user account on the system.
- **UID > INT_MAX:** The attacker's user account must be configured with a UID exceeding `INT_MAX`

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue was initially reported against `systemd`, but was later determined to be a `polkit` issue.
- The fix involves allowing negative uids/gids in PolkitUnixUser and Group objects.
- The vulnerability is considered "grave" and "high" severity.
- Patches were released for multiple distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable according to the Gentoo advisory.
