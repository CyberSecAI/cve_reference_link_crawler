Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute on a link that opens in a new tab. This allows the newly opened tab to potentially control the parent tab's location, leading to a "Reverse Tabnabbing" attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute on the `<a>` tag with `target="_blank"` attribute.
- The application opens external links in a new tab without proper security measures.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can redirect the parent tab to a malicious page, such as a phishing site.
- This can lead to credential theft, malware infection, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to control the content of the new tab opened by the vulnerable link (the `refworks_export_url`).
- User interaction is required to click the vulnerable link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to control the destination URL of the vulnerable link, or the linked page in the new tab.
- The attacker does not need to be in the same network or have any specific access to the server.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `app/views/bookmarks/_refworks.html.erb`.
- The fix involves adding `rel: 'noopener noreferrer'` to the `link_to` tag with `target: "_blank"`.
- The specific change in the code is:
```diff
-  <%= link_to t('blacklight.tools.refworks'), refworks_export_url(url: bookmarks_export_url(:refworks_marc_txt, search_state.params_for_search)), :class => "btn btn-default", :id => "refworksLink", :target => "_blank" %>
+  <%= link_to t('blacklight.tools.refworks'),
+      refworks_export_url(url: bookmarks_export_url(:refworks_marc_txt, search_state.params_for_search)),
+      class: "btn btn-default",
+      id: "refworksLink",
+      rel: 'noopener noreferrer',
+      target: "_blank" %>
```
This change ensures that the newly opened tab cannot access the opener (parent) window and thus prevents the reverse tabnabbing attack.
