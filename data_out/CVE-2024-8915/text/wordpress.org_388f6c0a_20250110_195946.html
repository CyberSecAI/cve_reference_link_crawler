## Description

A WordPress plugin to easily attach an icon to a category, tag or any other taxonomy term.

\*\* Now supports a category, tag or any other taxonomy image field, also.

Please note that this plugin will not automatically output the icon or the image on the frontend of our site.

It is up to you to query and output in your theme using the provided getter functions: `get_term_icon_id()`, `get_term_icon_url()`, `get_term_image_id()`, `get_term_image_url()`.

## Installation

1. Install Category Icon either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. After activating Category Icon go and edit any category or term to see the upload field.
3. Now you can add or edit category, tags or any other taxonomy terms icons.

### [No documentation](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/no-documentation-52/)

How would someone implement your plugin if
there is no documentation?
The idea is good but the delivery is poor taste.

It is causing errors for my other plugins without showing any errors on screen or in error\_log file or chrome console in latest wp update 5.4.2. so I removed it.

This plugin is absolutely useless without any instructions on how to actually fetch the icon after it has been assigned to a taxonomy term.
No support what’s so ever, support questions unanswered, figure out for your self kind of thing.
Well done guys!
