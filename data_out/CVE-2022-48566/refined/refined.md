```
{
  "CVE-2022-48566": {
    "Root cause": "Constant-time-defeating compiler optimisations were possible in the accumulator variable in hmac.compare_digest.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The compiler is allowed to short-circuit the comparison loop in `hmac.compare_digest` due to the accumulator variable `result` not being marked as volatile."
    ],
    "Impact": "The compiler's short-circuiting optimization could break constant-time guarantees, potentially leaking timing information about the compared data.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker with the ability to time operations using `hmac.compare_digest` could potentially exploit this timing difference to infer information about the compared data.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to measure the execution time of the `compare_digest` function. This could be achieved through local or remote timing attacks."
  }
