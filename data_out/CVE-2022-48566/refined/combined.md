Package        : python2.7
Version        : 2.7.16-2+deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-23336 CVE-2022-0391 CVE-2022-48560 CVE-2022-48565
                 CVE-2022-48566 CVE-2023-24329 CVE-2023-40217

This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities concerning the urlparse module as
well as vulnerabilities concerning the heapq, hmac, plistlib and ssl modules.

CVE-2021-23336

    Python was vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning via urlparse.parse_qsl and
    urlparse.parse_qs by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the
    attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can
    cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy
    (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in
    malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would
    usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not
    include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.

CVE-2022-0391

    The urlparse module helps break Uniform Resource Locator (URL) strings into
    components. The issue involves how the urlparse method does not sanitize
    input and allows characters like '\r' and '\n' in the URL path.  This flaw
    allows an attacker to input a crafted URL, leading to injection attacks.

CVE-2022-48560

    A use-after-free exists in Python via heappushpop in heapq.

CVE-2022-48565

    An XML External Entity (XXE) issue was discovered in Python.  The plistlib
    module no longer accepts entity declarations in XML plist files to avoid
    XML vulnerabilities.

CVE-2022-48566

    An issue was discovered in compare_digest in Lib/hmac.py in Python.
    Constant-time-defeating optimisations were possible in the accumulator
    variable in hmac.compare_digest.

CVE-2023-24329

    An issue in the urlparse component of Python allows attackers to bypass
    blocklisting methods by supplying a URL that starts with blank characters.

CVE-2023-40217

    The issue primarily affects servers written in Python (such as HTTP
    servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is
    created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly,
    there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket
    as "not connected" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will
    still be readable from the socket buffer.  This data will not be
    authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate
    authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data
    is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS
    connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the
    vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on
    initialization of the SSLSocket.)

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.7.16-2+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.

its security tracker page at:

| ``` `hmac.compare_digest` (via `_tscmp`) does not mark the accumulator variable `result` as volatile, which means that the compiler is allowed to short-circuit the comparison loop as long as it still reads from both strings.  In particular, when `result` is non-volatile, the compiler is allowed to change the loop from this:   ```c for (i=0; i < length; i++) {     result |= *left++ ^ *right++; } return (result == 0); ```  into (the moral equivalent of) this:   ```c for (i=0; i < length; i++) {     result |= *left++ ^ *right++;     if (result) {         for (; ++i < length;) {             *left++; *right++;         }         return 1;     } } return (result == 0); ```  (Code not tested.)  This might not seem like much, but it cuts out almost all of the data dependencies between `result`, `left`, and `right`, which in theory would free the CPU to race ahead using out of order execution -- it could execute code that depends on the result of `_tscmp`, even while `_tscmp` is still performing the volatile reads. (I have not actually benchmarked this. :)) In other words, this weird short circuiting could still actually improve performance. That, in turn, means that it would break constant-time guarantees.  (This is different from saying that it _would_ increase performance, but marking it volatile removes the worry.)  (Prior art/discussion: <https://github.com/google/tink/commit/335291c42eecf29fca3d85fed6179d11287d253e> )   I propose two changes, one trivial, and one that's more invasive:  1) Make `result` a `volatile unsigned char` instead of `unsigned char`.   2) When SSL is available, instead use `CRYPTO_memcmp` from OpenSSL/BoringSSL. We are, in effect, "rolling our own crypto". The SSL libraries are more strictly audited for timing issues, down to actually checking the generated machine code. As tools improve, those libraries will grow to use those tools. If we use their functions, we get the benefit of those audits and improvements. ``` | | | |

| ``` GPS, I got you covered :)  CRYPTO_memcmp() was on my TODO list for a while. Thanks for nagging me.  _operator is a built-in module. I don't want to add libcrypto dependency to libpython. I copied the code, made some adjustments and added it to _hashopenssl.c. ``` | | | |

| ``` Greg, is [GH-20456](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/20456 "GitHub PR 20456: [merged] bpo-40791: Use CRYPTO_memcmp() for compare_digest") a bug fix / security enhancement or a new feature? I'm hesitant to backport it to 3.7 and 3.8. 3.9 might be ok. ``` | | | |

| ``` I'd feel fine doing that for 3.9 given 3.9.0 is only in beta and this changes no public APIs.  For 3.8 and 3.7 i wouldn't.  Be sure to update the versionchanged in the docs if you choose to do it for 3.9. ``` | | | |

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3614-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : python3.7
Version        : 3.7.3-2+deb10u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-48560 CVE-2022-48564 CVE-2022-48565 CVE-2022-48566
                 CVE-2023-40217

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Python 3.7.

CVE-2022-48560

    A use-after-free problem was found in the heappushpop function in
    the heapq module.

CVE-2022-48564

    A potential denial-of-service vulnerability was discovered in the
    read_ints function used when processing certain malformed Apple
    Property List files in binary format.

CVE-2022-48565

    An XML External Entity (XXE) issue was discovered.  In order to
    avoid possible vulnerabilities, the plistlib module no longer
    accepts entity declarations in XML plist files.

CVE-2022-48566

    Possible constant-time-defeating compiler optimisations were
    discovered in the accumulator variable in hmac.compare_digest.

CVE-2023-40217

    It was discovered that it might be possible to bypass some of the
    protections implemented by the TLS handshake in the ssl.SSLSocket
    class.  For example, unauthenticated data might be read by a program
    expecting data authenticated by client certificates.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
3.7.3-2+deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your python3.7 packages.

For the detailed security status of python3.7 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python3.7>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
