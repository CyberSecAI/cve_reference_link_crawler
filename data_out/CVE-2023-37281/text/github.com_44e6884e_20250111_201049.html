# Out-of-bounds read during IPHC address decompression

Moderate

[nvt](/nvt)
published
GHSA-2v4c-9p48-g9pr
Sep 15, 2023

## Package

os/net/ipv6/sicslowpan.c

## Affected versions

<= 4.9

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

When processing the various IPv6 header fields during IPHC header decompression, Contiki-NG confirms the received packet buffer contains enough data as needed for that field. But no similar check is done before decompressing the IPv6

address. Therefore, up to 16 bytes can be read out of bounds on the line with the statement

`memcpy(&ipaddr->u8[16 - postcount], iphc_ptr, postcount);`.

The value of `postcount` depends on the address compression used in the received packet and can be controlled by the attacker. As a result, an attacker can inject a packet that causes an out-of-bound read.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG.

### Workarounds

One can apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request [#2509](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2509) to patch the system.
