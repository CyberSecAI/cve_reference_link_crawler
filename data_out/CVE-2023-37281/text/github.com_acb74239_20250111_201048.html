I think `ìf(!thing)` is the expectation for boolean checks. (Same for the other if-statements.)

| Hi!  This was my mistake, very sorry about it, re-opening this PR now.  What happened is the following: I was switching the base branch for this repository <https://github.com/wittra/contiki-ng> from develop to wittra. But accidentally, I made the change on the wrong repo (this repo) and instead of switching the base branch I renamed it. And somehow github deleted develop and closed all PRs...  Many apologies for this mishap 🙏; I haven't contributed in a while.. but now at least everybody got some notification from me :p |
