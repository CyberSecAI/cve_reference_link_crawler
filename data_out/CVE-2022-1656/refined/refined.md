- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient access control in the JupiterX Theme and JupiterX Core Plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Any logged-in user can access functions registered in `lib/api/api/ajax.php` within the JupiterX Theme.
    - This grants access to `jupiterx_api_ajax_` actions registered by the JupiterX Core Plugin.
    - This allows for arbitrary plugin deactivation.
    - It allows for modification of the theme's API key.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Reduction of site security
    - Damage to site functionality.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending an AJAX request to access vulnerable functions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Attacker must be a logged-in user, even a subscriber-level user.
    - No other special privileges are required.
