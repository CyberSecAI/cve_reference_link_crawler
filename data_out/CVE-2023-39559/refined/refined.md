Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The application, AudimexEE v.15.0, does not properly handle errors, leading to the exposure of full file paths in error messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The application reveals the server's internal file paths when an error occurs. This is present in multiple areas.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** Attackers can gain knowledge about the server's directory structure, which can be leveraged in future attacks or to gain a deeper understanding of the application's inner workings. While the severity is marked as "Medium" because no direct compromise is possible with this vulnerability only, this information can be used to chain more exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulating Input to Trigger Errors:**
    *   By requesting a non-existent file (e.g., replacing `.pl` files with non-existent names), the application outputs the full path of the requested resource in the error message.
    *   By inserting a single quote character in the `stateFilter` parameter, an SQL error is triggered, which includes the full path in its message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a normal, authenticated user of the AudimexEE v.15 portal.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP GET requests to the application, including requests with specific parameters such as the file name or `stateFilter`.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected URL:** `https://[AUDIMEX-HOST]/audimex/cgi-bin/wal.fcgi`
*   **Vulnerable Parameters:** `Payload` (via a non-existent file) and `stateFilter`
