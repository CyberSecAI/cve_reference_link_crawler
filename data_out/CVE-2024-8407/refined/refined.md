Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `cmd/akademy/handler/handlers.go` file, specifically within the `HandleLogin` function.
*   The code directly outputs the user-provided email address, obtained from the form values, to the web page without any sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS.  The application fails to sanitize user input, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts that will be executed in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the email field.
*   **Data Theft:** This code can be used to steal sensitive information, including cookies, session tokens, and personal details.
*   **Session Manipulation:** Attackers could manipulate user sessions.
*   **Malicious Actions:** The attacker can perform a variety of malicious actions within the user's browser context.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/login` endpoint.
*   **Malicious Payload:** The emailAddress field contains a malicious script within the `<script>` tags.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to forge HTTP POST requests.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `emailAddress` parameter is vulnerable to XSS.
*   **User Interaction (indirect):** The XSS is reflected, requiring a user to visit the page with the malicious script in the query.

**Technical Details (from the provided code):**

*   The vulnerable code snippet from `cmd/akademy/handler/handlers.go` is:
    ```go
    func (h pageHandler) HandleLogin(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    	fmt.Println("Handle Login")
    	r.ParseForm()
    	email := r.FormValue("emailAddress")
    	fmt.Println("Email", email)
    	w.Write([]byte(email))
    }
    ```
    This code retrieves the `emailAddress` from the form data and writes it directly to the HTTP response without any encoding.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates a successful attack using a payload like  `<script>alert(1)</script>`.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability report on vuldb.com is consistent with the github issue report and confirms the XSS vulnerability in the same location.
