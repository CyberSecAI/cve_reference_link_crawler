# Detection: Splunk Stored XSS via Specially Crafted Bulletin Message

Updated Date: 2024-10-17
ID: fd852b27-1882-4505-9f2c-64dfb96f4fc1
Author: Rod Soto
[Type: Hunting](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

The following hunting detection provides fields related to /service/messages endpoints where specially crafted bulletin message can exploit stored XSS.

### Search

```
1
2| rest /services/messages
3| search message="*http*"
4| table id author message title
5| `splunk_stored_xss_via_specially_crafted_bulletin_message_filter`

```
### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |

| splunk\_stored\_xss\_via\_specially\_crafted\_bulletin\_message\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_stored_xss_via_specially_crafted_bulletin_message_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

Need access to Splunk REST api data via search.

### Known False Positives

Must look at messages field and find malicious suspicious characters or hyperlinks. Not all requests to this endpoint will be malicious.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Please investigate $message for possible XSS attack in bulletin message $message$ | 5 | 10 | 50 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
