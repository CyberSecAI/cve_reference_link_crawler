**Published:** 2024-07-01

**Last Update:** 2024-07-01

**CVSSv3.1 Score:** 5.4, Medium

**CVSSv3.1 Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**CWE:** [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

**Bug ID:** VULN-15649

## Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10 and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.1.2312.200 and 9.1.2308.207, a low-privileged user that does not hold the “admin” or “power” Splunk roles could craft a malicious payload through a Splunk Web Bulletin Messages that could result in execution of unauthorized JavaScript code in the browser of a user.

Splunk Web Bulletin Messages would not sanitize the “data-toggle” and “data-remote” attributes which could lead to a Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) exploit.

## Solution

Upgrade Splunk Enterprise to versions 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10, or higher.

Splunk is performing upgrades on Splunk Cloud Platform instances as part of Routine Maintenance for customers, as described in the Splunk Cloud Platform Maintenance Policy. In the meantime, Splunk is actively monitoring for potential issues that could arise from this vulnerability.
