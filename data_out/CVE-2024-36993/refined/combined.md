# Detection: Splunk Stored XSS via Specially Crafted Bulletin Message

Updated Date: 2024-10-17
ID: fd852b27-1882-4505-9f2c-64dfb96f4fc1
Author: Rod Soto
[Type: Hunting](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

The following hunting detection provides fields related to /service/messages endpoints where specially crafted bulletin message can exploit stored XSS.

### Search

```
1
2| rest /services/messages
3| search message="*http*"
4| table id author message title
5| `splunk_stored_xss_via_specially_crafted_bulletin_message_filter`

```
### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |

| splunk\_stored\_xss\_via\_specially\_crafted\_bulletin\_message\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_stored_xss_via_specially_crafted_bulletin_message_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

Need access to Splunk REST api data via search.

### Known False Positives

Must look at messages field and find malicious suspicious characters or hyperlinks. Not all requests to this endpoint will be malicious.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Please investigate $message for possible XSS attack in bulletin message $message$ | 5 | 10 | 50 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.

# Persistent Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in Web Bulletin

**Advisory ID:** SVD-2024-0713

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2024-36993](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36993)

**Published:** 2024-07-01

**Last Update:** 2024-07-01

**CVSSv3.1 Score:** 5.4, Medium

**CVSSv3.1 Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**CWE:** [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

**Bug ID:** VULN-15649

## Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10 and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.1.2312.200 and 9.1.2308.207, a low-privileged user that does not hold the “admin” or “power” Splunk roles could craft a malicious payload through a Splunk Web Bulletin Messages that could result in execution of unauthorized JavaScript code in the browser of a user.

Splunk Web Bulletin Messages would not sanitize the “data-toggle” and “data-remote” attributes which could lead to a Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) exploit.

## Solution

Upgrade Splunk Enterprise to versions 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10, or higher.

Splunk is performing upgrades on Splunk Cloud Platform instances as part of Routine Maintenance for customers, as described in the Splunk Cloud Platform Maintenance Policy. In the meantime, Splunk is actively monitoring for potential issues that could arise from this vulnerability.

## Product Status

| Product | Version | Component | Affected Version | Fix Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.2 | Splunk Web | 9.2.0 to 9.2.1 | 9.2.2 |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.1 | Splunk Web | 9.1.0 to 9.1.4 | 9.1.5 |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.0 | Splunk Web | 9.0.0 to 9.0.9 | 9.0.10 |
| Splunk Cloud Platform | 9.1.2312 | Splunk Web | Below 9.1.2312.200 | 9.1.2312.200 |
| Splunk Cloud Platform | 9.1.2308 | Splunk Web | Below 9.1.2308.207 | 9.1.2308.207 |

## Mitigations and Workarounds

The vulnerability affects instances with [Splunk Web](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/DisableunnecessarySplunkcomponents) enabled, turning Splunk Web off is a possible workaround. See [Disable unnecessary Splunk Enterprise components](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/DisableunnecessarySplunkcomponents) and the [web.conf](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Webconf) configuration specification file for more information on disabling Splunk Web.

## Detections

* [Splunk stored xss via specially crafted bulletin message](https://research.splunk.com/application/fd852b27-1882-4505-9f2c-64dfb96f4fc1)

## Severity

Splunk rates this vulnerability as 5.4, Medium, with a CVSSv3.1 vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.

If the Splunk Enterprise instance does not run Splunk Web, there should be no impact and the severity would be informational.
