# > Release Notes

**Important:** [32-bit support](32bit.html).

## Milestone 35, x86

Among the normal list of updated packages, the main change is that
Python is now version 3.12. All the old Python 3.11 modules are
deprecated and will be removed.

The old closed /usr/bin/pax has been replaced by the heirloom pax.

## Milestone 34, x86

This release enforces a requirement for the CPU to support SSE2. As
all 64-bit capable CPUs should be SSE2-capable, this should have no impact.

The minimal ISO image has been reworked slightly and is now more of a
server image. Specifically, if you're SAN-connected, the minimal live
image includes more SAN drivers, whereas the regular ISO has no SAN
capability at all. (In previous releases, neither were terribly useful
on a SAN-connected host.)

The old closed /usr/xpg4/bin/more has been replaced by less.

The opportunity was taken to update some components with incompatible
changes, along with associated rebuilds.

## Milestone 33, x86

This release fixes the ZFS corruption bug (it's extremely hard to
trigger in normal use, but it was present).

The shipped sendmail is now the current standard version, rather than
the old version from illumos-gate.

The opportunity was taken to update some components with incompatible
changes, along with associated rebuilds.

## Milestone 32, x86

The key change here is that openssl has been upgraded from the now
unsupported 1.1.1 release to version 3.0, and applications rebuilt to
use this version.

Also, OpenSSH is now 9.4. Both python 3.7 and 3.9 have been removed.

## Milestone 31, x86

Some key application version changes this time. MATE updated to 1.26;
Default postgres is now v15; Default python is now 3.11; OpenSSH is now
8.9p1 and will go to 9.x in the next release.

## Milestone 30, x86

IMPORTANT: this contains a fix for CVE-2023-31284 Buffer Overflow in /dev/net

Otherwise, this is a minor release, with the usual range of updates.

## Milestone 29, x86

This is a minor release, just catching up on changes in illumos. One notable
update is that the illumos linker is now compatible with binutils 2.40.

## Milestone 28, x86

This is a minor release, the key change here is that the default compiler
is now gcc10 rather than gcc7. There's also a vioscsi driver, expanding
support for virtualized and cloud environments.

## Milestone 27, x86

This is a minor release, with some significant internal updates. GLib2 has
been updated to 2.62.6, pcre2 has been added, the default java is now
jdk11, and illumos is built against that java. This is a minor rather than
a micro release so that all dependencies get updated consistently.

This release also introduces 2 new overlays - desktop and server - in an
attempt to provide better default installations for those use cases. Note
that desktop doesn't yet enable the graphical login, for that you'll
need to

```

svcadm enable slim

```
## Milestone 26, x86

This is a minor release, with some significant changes. The default web
browser is now Pale Moon, rather than an ancient Firefox; default python
is now a 64-bit python 3.9; perl is now a 64-bit perl 5.34.

This update also incorporates
[IPD4](https://github.com/illumos/ipd/blob/master/ipd/0004/README.md)
so manual pages may be in different sections than you would traditionally
expect in a Solarish system.

## Milestone 25 update 3, x86

This is a micro release, updating the underlying illumos components.
Critically, it contains a security fix for tmpfs, CVE-2021-43395.

## Milestone 25 update 2, x86

This was an interim release, created to test the ena driver for AWS
nitro instance support. No LX variant or ISOs were made available.

## Milestone 25 update 1, x86

This is a micro release, updating the underlying illumos components.

## Milestone 25, x86

This is a minor release, with 2 significant changes. The system shell, ksh93,
is now shipped in a separate package. The default libpng is now from the
1.6 series (with 1.4 provided for compatibility), and most packages that
use libpng have been rebuilt to pick up the change.

Like m24.1 this is a hybrid iso. That will help it boot on a wider range of
systems, but it's also possible that there are systems that it won't boot on.

## Milestone 24 update 1, x86

This is a micro release, updating the underlying illumos components.

One major change; this is a hybrid iso. That will help it boot on a wider range
of systems, but it's also possible that there are systems that it won't boot on.

This release features an updated ksh and better bhyve integration.

## Milestone 24, x86

This is a minor release, updating the underlying illumos components and
having a new baseline for Tribblix packages. The 2 major features in this
release are that stack-smashing protection (SSP) is enabled in illumos
userland, and OpenSSL has been updated to 1.1.1.

Avoid using the OmniTribblix variant m24lx, as not all m24 software is binary
compatible with it. Use m24lx.1 instead.

## Milestone 23 update 3, x86

This is a micro release, updating the underlying illumos components. It
will be the last m23 update, and m24 will get the stack-smashing protection
fixes.

## Milestone 23 update 2, x86

This is a micro release, updating the underlying illumos components.

This update fixes a critical PAM security issue.

If the SLiM desktop manager refuses to start under VirtualBox or Vmware Fusion,
try removing the vmware or vbox drivers

```

zap uninstall TRIBxorg-driver-video-vbox
zap uninstall TRIBxorg-driver-video-vmware

```

If you get a cyclic smf dependency error at first boot, log in as root at the
system maintenance prompt and run these commands:

```

svccfg delete metainit
reboot

```

should clear it.

## Milestone 23 update 1, x86

This is a micro release, updating the underlying illumos components.

This update has slightly better bhyve integration, and fixes 2 bhyve
security issues.

Note: if you're upgrading, especially on omnitribblix, run the following
before the upgrade:

```

/usr/sbin/svccfg delete svc:/system/metainit:default

```

It may return an error which is fine, but if that smf service still exists
the upgraded version won't boot.

## Milestone 23, x86

This is a minor release, allowing me to update the baseline. The underlying
illumos system is now built with gcc7.

Bhyve is present in both tribblix and omnitribblix variants, but is not
integrated into zap at this time.

Work to migrate Python applications and modules from Python 2 to Python 3
is ongoing. A future release will be python3 by default.

This is planned to be a transitional release, allowing significant upgrades
of a number of key components, such as OpenSSL, Xfce, Xorg.

## Milestone 22, x86

This is a minor release, allowing me to update the baseline. The key
change here is that the default gcc, both compiler and runtime, is gcc7
rather than gcc4.

Work to migrate Python applications and modules from Python 2 to Python 3
is ongoing.

## Milestone 21, x86

This is a minor release, allowing me to start from a new baseline.

The new baseline allows me to introduce more 64-bit applications, work on
updating the compiler, start the transition to gtk3, and other significant
application changes.

On OmniTribblix, you'll need to apply an update to get LX zones working:

```

zap refresh
zap update TRIBsys-zones-brand-lx

```

You can install with EFI partitioning rather than the traditional Solaris
partitioned install by using -G rather than -B (this will in future become
the default behaviour).

There is no support for 32-bit hardware, you should continue to use Tribblix
m20 on such hardware.

## Milestone 20 update 6, x86

This is a micro release. It uses the same [upgrade](zap-upgrade.html)
mechanism as a regular upgrade, but is Milestone 20 with the illumos components
updated.

There are two changes to the installer. ZFS compression on the root pool is
always enabled. And you can install with EFI partitioning rather than the
traditional Solaris partitioned install by using -G rather than -B (this will
in future become the default behaviour).

If you're trying to use LX zones with m20lx.6, you'll need to do a couple of
things:

```

cd /etc/zones/
cp OMNIlx.xml SUNWlx.xml

```

as the name of the template has changed, and there's now an extra driver needed:

```

zap install TRIBdrv-inotify

```

(If you do the normal "zap refresh" and "zap update-overlay -a" this missing
package will get pulled in automatically.) If you're trying to automatically
download Ubuntu images, you should:

```

sed -i s:server-cloudimg-amd64:server-cloudimg-amd64-root: /usr/lib/zap/retrieve-image

```

The m20.6 update will be the last in the Milestone 20 series.

Note that the vanilla Tribblix ISO images were rereleased to fix a bug causing
a crash on older CPUs.

## Milestone 20 update 5, x86

This is a micro release. It uses the same [upgrade](zap-upgrade.html)
mechanism as a regular upgrade, but is Milestone 20 with the illumos components
updated.

New this release is a minimal ISO (for both regular and LX/omnitribblix
variants). This is just over one fifth the size of the regular iso image.
Ideal for server, custom builds, or if you're intending to use pkgsrc.

## Milestone 20 update 4, x86

This is a micro release. It uses the same [upgrade](zap-upgrade.html)
mechanism as a regular upgrade, but is Milestone 20 with the illumos components
updated.

Also available at this time is an LX variant, with the illumos components
being built from illumos-omnios (hence the nickname omnitribblix) rather than
vanilla illumos-gate.

As of m20.4, the 32-bit kernel is no longer supplied. Use the original m20
release if you need 32-bit hardware support.

## Milestone 20 update 3, x86

This is a micro release. It uses the same [upgrade](zap-upgrade.html)
mechanism as a regular upgrade, but is Milestone 20 with the illumos components
updated.

Also available at this time is an LX variant, with the illumos components
being built from illumos-omnios (hence the nickname omnitribblix) rather than
vanilla illumos-gate.

If you have problems with gcc being unable to find crt1.o, then doing a
`zap refresh` and updating the develop overlay should fix it;
or explicitly `zap install TRIBsys-lib-c-runtime`.

## Milestone 20 update 2, x86

This is a micro release. It uses the same [upgrade](zap-upgrade.html)
mechanism as a regular upgrade, but is Milestone 20 with the illumos components
updated.

Also available at this time is an LX variant, with the illumos components
being built from illumos-omnios (hence the nickname omnitribblix) rather than
vanilla illumos-gate.

## Milestone 20 update 1, x86

This is a micro release. It uses the same [upgrade](zap-upgrade.html)
mechanism as a regular upgrade, but is Milestone 20 with the illumos components
updated.

Also available at this time is an LX variant, with the illumos components
being built from illumos-omnios (hence the nickname omnitribblix) rather than
vanilla illumos-gate.

## Milestone 20, x86

You should be able to [upgrade](zap-upgrade.html) to the
m20 release from the m19 and m18 releases.

At this time, upgrading with zones is not supported. The upgrade will
work, but the zones won't. You should save any data, destroy any
zones, and recreate them after the upgrade.

The ISO is constructed slightly differently. This makes a number of
installation scenarios much easier, but may impact on the ability to
install on systems with little memory. (More on
[memory requirements](https://ptribble.blogspot.co.uk/2017/06/tribblix-memory-requirements.html).)

There is a new bootloader in illumos. New installations of m19
and later will use the new bootloader. Upgrades from older releases
will retain grub as the bootloader.
[[More](loader-activate.html)]

## Milestone 19, x86

You should be able to [upgrade](zap-upgrade.html) to the
m19 release from the m18 release. Upgrades from m17 and m16 might
work, but haven't been properly tested.

At this time, upgrading with zones is not supported. The upgrade will
work, but the zones won't. You should save any data, destroy any
zones, and recreate them after the upgrade.

There is a new bootloader in illumos. New installations of m19
and later will use the new bootloader. Upgrades from older releases
will retain grub as the bootloader.
[[More](loader-activate.html)]

Drive enumeration has changed because of changes to illumos. On
fresh installs, you will no longer see drives on controller 0. For
example, in VirtualBox the first drive will be `c1t0d0`
instead of `c0t0d0` as in the past.

If you do a fresh install of the kitchen-sink, the slim login
manager is now enabled by default. To enable slim on upgrades (or on
older releases) use '`svcadm enable slim`'.
## Milestone 18, x86

If installing from the iso, you should `zap update evince` to
fix a tiff dependency issue.

You should be able to [upgrade](zap-upgrade.html) to the
m18 release from the m17 release. Upgrades from m16 might work,
but haven't been properly tested.

At this time, upgrading with zones is not supported. The upgrade will
work, but the zones won't. You should save any data, destroy any
zones, and recreate them after the upgrade.

## Milestone 17, x86

You should be able to [upgrade](zap-upgrade.html) to the
m17 release from the m16 release. Upgrades from earlier releases are
not supported, although the new over\_install.sh script will allow you
to install a new version into an existing pool.

At this time, upgrading with zones is not supported. The upgrade will
work, but the zones won't. You should save any data, destroy any
zones, and recreate them after the upgrade.

## Milestone 16, x86

You should be able to [upgrade](zap-upgrade.html) to the
m16 release from the m15 release. Upgrades from earlier releases are
not supported.

At this time, upgrading with zones is not supported. The upgrade will
work, but the zones won't. You should save any data, destroy any
zones, and recreate them after the upgrade.

It is vital that you at least `zap refresh` followed by
`zap update TRIBlib-zlib` after installation. The zlib
package was incorrectly constructed and you will be unable to build
software against it.

## Milestone 31, SPARC

Among the normal list of updated packages, where application software here
roughly corresponds to m35 on x86 systems, the main change is that Python
is now version 3.12. All the old Python 3.11 modules are deprecated
and will be removed.

The old closed /usr/bin/pax has been replaced by the heirloom pax.

## Milestone 30, SPARC

The application software here roughly corresponds to m34 on x86 systems,
although the underlying illumos is still closer to
m25/m26. Note that there are no functional illumos changes from the
m28 sparc release - if that release didn't work on your system, this
one won't either.

## Milestone 29, SPARC

The application software here roughly corresponds to m33 on x86 systems,
although the underlying illumos is still closer to
m25/m26. Note that there are no functional illumos changes from the
m28 sparc release - if that release didn't work on your system, this
one won't either.

## Milestone 28, SPARC

The application software here roughly corresponds to m32 on x86 systems,
although the underlying illumos is still closer to
m25/m26. Specifically the openssl 3.x and openssh 9.x updates are included.

This update also incorporates the manual page renumbering from
[IPD4](https://github.com/illumos/ipd/blob/master/ipd/0004/README.md).

If upgrading, mesa may need to be fixed (if installed). To sort this out:

```

  zap uninstall SUNWxorg-mesa TRIBx11-lib-mesa \
    TRIBx11-header-x11-protocols TRIBsvc-opengl-ogl-select
  zap install TRIBx11-lib-mesa TRIBx11-header-x11-protocols \
    TRIBsvc-opengl-ogl-select

```

The m28 sparc ISO has a fix for the drmach module failing
to load on OPL (M-3000 and similar) systems. As I have no such
systems, I cannot test it, but the problem of the M-series failing
to boot still appears to be present.

## Milestone 27, SPARC

The application software here roughly corresponds to m31 on x86 systems,
although the underlying illumos is closer to m25/m26.

This SPARC ISO has only been tested in an LDOM so far, but works extremely
well there. Remember to use the -B flag when installing;

```

./live_install.sh -B c1d0

```
## Milestone 26, SPARC

This SPARC ISO has been tested in an LDOM on a T4-1 and the host on a T5140,
and works extremely well there. A Sun Blade 1500 works, but less well.
Reports indicate that M-series and the Ultra 25 do not work.

Remember to use the -B flag when installing;

```

./live_install.sh -B c1d0

```
## Milestone 25.1, SPARC

This SPARC ISO has been tested in an LDOM on a T4-1 and the host on a T5140,
and works extremely well there. A Sun Blade 1500 works, but less well.
Reports indicate that M-series and the Ultra 25 do not work.

**Important notes for upgrades:** If upgrading from a SPARC
release before m25.1 to m25.1 (or later) then you **must** follow
the steps laid out in
[this
article](https://ptribble.blogspot.com/2022/11/tribblix-for-sparc-m251.html). Subsequent upgrades are fine, it's just getting through
the m25.1 boundary that needs the extra manual step.

Remember to use the -B flag when installing;

```

./live_install.sh -B c1d0

```
## Milestone 22, SPARC

The m22 release on SPARC solves most of the problems of earlier ISO
images. After installation, run `zap install TRIBcompress-xz` as
the xz package file on the ISO is invalid.

To update m22 packages to current

```

zap refresh
zap update TRIBlib-security-openssl
zap update-overlay -a

```
## Milestone 20 update 6, SPARC

The m20.6 release on SPARC is built from the same illumos commit as the
x86 version, and this update is released much closer in time to the
matching x86 release. (The ISO has been pulled, as the installer is broken.
If you have problems, make sure you disable cpio boot archives.)

While the ISO is no longer useful, upgrades are available, and you should
upgrade any SPARC systems running m20 to m20.6.

## Milestone 20, SPARC

The m20 release on SPARC is built from the same illumos commit as the
x86 version, so matches at that level, despite being created many
months later.

Before installing additional software, run `zap refresh` to ensure the package catalog is up to date.

The m20 ISO for SPARC is known to boot properly. It has not yet been
extensively tested, as I don't have enough spare hardware that I can
afford to wipe clean.

You may see errors from mpt\_sas about misc/sata not being found. The mpt\_sas
driver on SPARC is currently broken.

There are issues with libidn2 compatibility affecting various releases
on SPARC. If you have a broken curl, uninstall it (zap uninstall TRIBcurl),
and zap should be able to use wget as an alternative, allowing you to
'zap refresh' and install a fixed curl for the repo. If you have a broken
wget, you may have to install libidn2 by hand. This problem also appears to
affect the m16-m18-m20 upgrade route.

## Milestone 18, SPARC

The m18 release on SPARC is built from the same illumos commit as the
x86 version, so matches at that level, despite being created many
months later.

There is currently no ISO image for this release, but you should be able to
upgrade. [More notes on this update](http://ptribble.blogspot.co.uk/2017/05/tribblix-sparc-progress.html).

## Milestone 16, SPARC

The m16 release on SPARC is built from the same illumos commit as the
x86 version, so matches at that level, despite being created many
months later.

Many fewer additional packages are available for SPARC.

I know of multiple problems with graphics cards, and have had trouble
with the bge driver (as used, for example, on the Sun Blade 1500).
