### A Gentle Reminder About illumos

A very bad security vulnerability in Solaris was patched-and-announced by Oracle earlier this week. Turns out, we in open-source-descendant [illumos](https://illumos.org) had something in the same neighborhood. We can’t confirm it’s the same bug because reverse-engineering Oracle Solaris is off the table.

In general if a vulnerability is an old one in Solaris, there’s a good chance it’s also in illumos. Alex Wilson said it best in this recent tweet:

> [@anthomsec](https://twitter.com/anthomsec?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Hi! re: 2020-14871 (Solaris PAM bug), do you know if this was in the OpenSolaris PAM that went into illumos (<https://t.co/Rxs5ct09xs>) by any chance? We don't get any info via Oracle, but we do inherit their bugs if they're old enough :(

If you want to see the full history, the first 11 minutes of my [talk from 2016’s FOSDEM](https://archive.fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/illumos_overview) contains WHY a sufficiently old vulnerability in Solaris 10 and even Solaris 11 may also be in illumos.

Remember folks, Solaris is closed-source under Oracle, even though it used to be open-source during the last years of Sun’s existence. illumos is open-source, related, but NOT the same as Solaris anymore. Another suggested talk covers this rather well, especially if you [start at the right part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc&t=33m).

### The Actual Request

Because of this history and shared heritage, if you’re a security researcher, PLEASE make sure you find [one](https://openindiana.org) [of](https://omniosce.org) [many](https://smartos.org) [illumos](https://illumos.org) distributions, install it, and try your proof-of-concept on that as well. If you find the same vulnerability in illumos, please report it to us via the security@illumos.org mailing alias. We have a [PGP key](https://illumos.org/docs/security) too!

Thank you, and please test your Solaris exploits on illumos too (and vice-versa).
