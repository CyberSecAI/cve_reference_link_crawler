Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-27215:

**CVE-2022-27215**

*   **Vulnerability:** Missing permission check in a form validation method.
*   **Affected Plugin:** Release Helper Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 1.3.3 and earlier
*  **Root Cause:** The Release Helper Plugin does not validate user permissions before allowing access to a form validation method. Additionally, the method does not require POST requests.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks on a form validation method.
    *   **CSRF:** The form validation method doesn't require POST requests, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL using an attacker-specified username and password.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs to lure a user with Overall/Read permissions to visit a malicious website or link. This can be achieved via phishing or other social engineering methods.
    *   The attacker exploits the vulnerable form validation method using a crafted request to connect to an arbitrary URL with attacker-supplied credentials.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have a user with "Overall/Read" permissions on the Jenkins instance to be logged in to the browser.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to inject a request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Summary:**
The Release Helper Plugin allows an attacker with Overall/Read permission to perform a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) by making the Jenkins server connect to an attacker-controlled URL using attacker-supplied credentials due to a missing permission check and lack of CSRF protection on a form validation method.
