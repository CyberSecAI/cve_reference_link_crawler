| IPAddress version: 5.1.0 I have these code that can't finished in time:  ```     public void equalsFuzzerTest() {         try {             long tempLong = 5979084832330744063L;             int tempInt = -1;             IPAddressBitsDivision iPAddressBitsDivision = new IPAddressBitsDivision(tempLong, tempLong, tempInt, tempInt);             boolean result = iPAddressBitsDivision.equals(new Object());         } catch (Exception e) {         }     } ```  Is it a potential bug? |

| That [IPAddressBitsDivision contructor](https://seancfoley.github.io/IPAddress/IPAddress/apidocs/inet/ipaddr/format/standard/IPAddressBitsDivision.html#IPAddressBitsDivision-long-long-int-int-) takes the arguments: long value, long upperValue, int bitCount, int defaultRadix  The bitCount indicates the size of the division. The defaultRadix indicates the radix to use when printing the division.  So yes, as you have shown here, supplying a radix of -1 results in an infinite loop.  That is because of the function AddressDivisionBase.getDigitCount which does not work with a radix of -1 or 1, it will have an infinite loop with those arguments.  Theoretically, a radix can be negative, but in practice radices are generally 2 or larger.  There is no check in this library for a radix less than 2, but a radix less than 2 is an invalid argument that makes no logical sense. In this library, a radix should be 2 or larger, not negative, and not 1. So you can certainly fix your code here by avoiding calling any function with such a radix.  In a future release I can add a check to ensure that an exception is thrown when a radix is supplied that is not 2 or larger. I can also add a check in the bitcount argument, which should also not be negative, since that makes no sense as well. |

| [@seancfoley](https://github.com/seancfoley) For awareness, it seems that <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-50570> has been raised for this issue (and of course as a result, the library is getting flagged). The issue, however, isn't very critical IMHO, and hasn't yet been a assigned a CVSS score. I think it's debatable if this should be raised as a CVE at all, instead of just a bug. |

| [@rturner-edjuster](https://github.com/rturner-edjuster) Not only that, I consider this bug very minor, something never encountered in production code anywhere.  That is because it makes no logical sense to pass in a radix less than 2 for an address division. It is simply not a valid argument, and nobody would see it as a valid argument. It doesn't strike me as a vulnerability at all, nor as a bug that needs any urgent attention.  Anyway, thanks for the notification. |

| [@seancfoley](https://github.com/seancfoley) I reached out to GitHub, and they suggest reaching out to Mitre to reject the CVE:  Ohhh, ya that does look like it shouldn't have been assigned. We can go ahead and withdraw this instead if you think that's more appropriate. If so, I would also like to ask that someone involved with the project reach out to mitre to get the CVE rejected as well <https://cveform.mitre.org/>  The <https://cveform.mitre.org/> form allows you to send a request to update a CVE, with rejection being one of the types of updates available.

| There was no update to the mitre request. However, I noticed that on mitre and nist the vuln is now listed as disputed. The NIST page says "It is awaiting reanalysis".  I will be doing a new release of IPAddress in the next two to three weeks. |
