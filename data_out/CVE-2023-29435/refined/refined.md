- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Cryptocurrency All-in-One plugin (versions <= 3.0.19) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can inject scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, other HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts will then execute when a user visits the site, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or exposure of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts into the website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the website, but the specific mechanism isn't detailed in this content. The required privilege is mentioned as "Contributor," suggesting that an authenticated user with limited privileges could potentially exploit this.
