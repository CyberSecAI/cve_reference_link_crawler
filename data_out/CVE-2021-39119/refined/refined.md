Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Broken Access Control in the issue notification feature of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Users who were watching an issue continued to receive updates even after their Jira account was revoked. This indicates a failure to properly check user permissions or status before sending notifications.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Unauthorized users who have had their access revoked may continue to receive information about Jira issues they were previously watching, which could potentially lead to information disclosure.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  A user must have watched a Jira issue. After their account is revoked, they will continue to receive notifications on the watched issue. This is not a traditional "attack" but rather a flaw in the access control mechanism.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have been a watcher on a Jira issue before their account was revoked. No special privileges or skills beyond this are mentioned.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of Jira Server and Data Center prior to 8.19.0.
*   The fix was implemented in version 8.19.0, which prevents notifications from being sent to users who no longer have application access.
*   A feature flag was introduced in later versions (8.20.6 and 8.13.19+) to allow reverting or enabling the new behavior.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a Low priority with a CVSS score of 3.1.
