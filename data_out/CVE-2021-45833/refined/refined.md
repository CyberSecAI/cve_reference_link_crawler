The provided content is related to CVE-2021-45833.

**Root Cause:**
A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `H5D__create_chunk_file_map_hyper` function within the `H5Dchunk.c` file of the HDF5 library.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The overflow could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service. The ASAN output shows the program aborting due to the overflow, indicating a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted HDF5 file using the `h5dump` tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to create or modify an HDF5 file.
- The attacker must be able to provide a malicious HDF5 file as input to the `h5dump` utility, or any application that uses the vulnerable HDF5 library.
