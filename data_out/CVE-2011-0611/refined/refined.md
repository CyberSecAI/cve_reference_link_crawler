Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2011-0611 from the provided content:

**CVE-2011-0611**
**Description:** A critical vulnerability exists in Adobe Flash Player 10.2.153.1 and earlier versions (and corresponding versions for Chrome and Android) and the Authplay.dll component within Adobe Reader and Acrobat X (10.0.2) and earlier 10.x and 9.x versions, that can lead to remote code execution. This vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by memory corruption due to an invalid use of an object type within the Adobe Flash Player. This leads to a pointer overwrite.
- An embedded SWF file is used to trigger this vulnerability

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Type Confusion:** The vulnerability stems from a type confusion issue when processing a malicious SWF file, which leads to memory corruption.
- **Memory Corruption:** The memory corruption occurs due to a pointer overwrite in memory, allowing arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- **System Crash:** A crash can occur as a direct consequence of the invalid type usage within Flash Player
- **Complete Control:** If the code execution is successful, the attacker can gain complete control over the affected system.
- **Bypass DEP/ASLR:** Some exploits for this CVE could bypass Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) in Adobe Reader X (but not the sandbox).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Embedded SWF:** Exploitation often involves embedding a malicious SWF file into a document format like DOC or XLS and sending as an e-mail attachment.
- **Web Pages:** A website serving a specially crafted SWF can also trigger the vulnerability upon visiting the site.
- **PDF Files:** An embedded SWF file in a PDF file can trigger the vulnerability
- **Other applications using Flash or its runtime**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need any credentials to perform this attack.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker often needs to trick the user into opening an attachment or visiting a malicious website.
- **Malicious SWF:** The attacker must craft a specific, malicious SWF file.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   **Heap Spray:**  Exploits often utilize heap spraying techniques to allocate memory with a NOP slide (e.g., 0x11111111) and load another SWF file, enabling shellcode execution.
*  **Bypass Hooked APIs:** Some exploits are capable of bypassing API hooks using techniques that analyze the first few instructions of the API being called and then jump after it.
* **Targeted attacks** Several sources indicate targeted attacks using this exploit were aimed at specific individuals or organizations via email. One attack seemed to be focused on South Korea, due to the use of a "taskkill /im hwp.exe" in the shellcode which relates to a Korean word processor.

**Mitigations (From various sources):**
*   **Update Flash Player:**  Upgrade to Adobe Flash Player 10.2.159.1 (10.2.154.27 for Chrome users), 10.2.157.51 for Android, or later versions.
*   **Update Adobe Reader and Acrobat:** Upgrade to Adobe Reader X 10.0.3, Reader 9.4.4, Acrobat X 10.0.3, or Acrobat 9.4.4, as appropriate.
*  **Disable Flash Plugin:** Disable the Flash plugin in the browser or use a browser plugin to selectively enable it.
*  **Disable Flash and 3D & Multimedia support in Adobe Reader:** Delete or rename authplay.dll and rt3d.dll in the Adobe Reader installation directory (or equivalent).
*   **Remove Flash:** Completely uninstall Flash using the Adobe removal tools.
*   **Disable JavaScript in Adobe Reader and Acrobat:** This may mitigate some attacks that use JavaScript within PDF files.
*   **Enable DEP:** Enable Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in Windows systems
*   **Configure Internet Explorer:** Prevent Internet Explorer from automatically opening PDF documents or display them within the browser.
*   **EMET:** Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit.
