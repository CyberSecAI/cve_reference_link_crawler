Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `${}` in the MyBatis mapper XML file (`UserMapper.xml`) to pass the `params.dataScope` parameter. This allows for direct inclusion of user-controlled input into the SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the query by manipulating the `dataScope` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** The attacker can modify or delete data in the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, an attacker might gain higher privileges within the database.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can discover information about the database structure.
- **Blind Injection:** The provided POC utilizes blind SQL injection, indicating the attacker might not receive direct output from the injected SQL, but instead relies on boolean conditions to extract data bit-by-bit.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the `params["dataScope"]` parameter in an HTTP request. Specifically, the `params` parameter of the `MyUser` object, which is a Map, allows setting arbitrary keys and their values.
- **Direct Parameter Injection:** By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/api/user` endpoint, the attacker injects malicious SQL into the `dataScope` parameter, which is then passed to the database through MyBatis.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the application.
- **Knowledge of the Application:** The attacker needs knowledge about the application's API and parameter structure. Specifically, they need to know that the `dataScope` parameter in the `params` map is vulnerable.
- **Ability to send crafted HTTP requests:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and send HTTP requests to the application with specific parameters.
- **Optional Cookie access:** The provided POC mentioned cookies might be required to exploit.

**Technical Details:**

1.  **Vulnerable Code:**
    *   `mybatis-mappers/UserMapper.xml:22`: `${}` used unsafely with `dataScope` parameter.
    *   `com/codermy/myspringsecurityplus/admin/dao/UserDao.java:23`: Declaration of `getFuzzyUserByPage` method.
    *   `com/codermy/myspringsecurityplus/admin/service/impl/UserServiceImpl.java:48`: Call to `getFuzzyUserByPage` in `getAllUsersByPage`.
    *   `com/codermy/myspringsecurityplus/admin/controller/UserController.java:48`: Controller endpoint accepting `MyUser` parameters including `params`.
2.  **Data Flow:**
    *   HTTP request to `/api/user` with `params[dataScope]` containing malicious SQL is received.
    *   The `dataScope` value is passed through the service and DAO layers to the `UserMapper.xml` file.
    *   The malicious SQL is inserted into the query via `${}` and sent to the database.
3. **POC**
   The provided POC confirms the vulnerability using a crafted HTTP GET request that includes the malicious SQL injection payload.  It shows the injection is blind, requiring techniques such as SQLMap to exfiltrate the data.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was found by Chaitin Security Research Lab.
- The issue is marked with a "Content Risk Flag" as containing sensitive information.
- The vulnerable code is within the `my-springsecurity-plus` project, with the vulnerable version before 2024.07.03.
- The repository is hosted on Gitee.
