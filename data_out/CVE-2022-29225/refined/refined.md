  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Decompressors accumulate decompressed data into an intermediate buffer before overwriting the body in the decode/encodeBody.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper checks on the ratio between compressed and decompressed data sizes, allowing for 'zip bomb' attacks."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker can cause excessive memory usage by providing a small, highly compressed payload that expands to a much larger size during decompression.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A specifically crafted HTTP body delivered by an untrusted downstream or upstream peer.",
       "The attack is performed remotely through the data plane."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a 'Content-Encoding' header specifying a compression algorithm (like brotli) and a malicious compressed payload. No special privileges are required.",
    "additional_details": "The fix introduces a check for excessive decompression ratio, limiting the output buffer size to a maximum of 100 times the input buffer size. This is implemented in Brotli, Gzip and Zstd decompressors."
  },
    "cve_id": "CVE-2022-29225"
