Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability in SourceCodester Cosmetics and Beauty Product Online Store - 1.0
:

```
Vendor: Sourcecodester
Product: Cosmetics and Beauty Product Online Store - 1.0
Product URL: Cosmetics and Beauty Product Online Store - 1.0

```

Executive Summary

Stored Cross-Site Scripting (SXSS) vulnerability in Cosmetics and Beauty Product Online Store - 1.0 and earlier allows attacker to inject the Malicious JavaScript Code in the "Product Name" input field. The malicious code can then be executed whenever the vulnerable web page is accessed by any user, staff or even admin and will remain persistent. It will eventually result in account takeover as the session cookies can be accessed by the malicious JavaScript Code.
Issue Details

```
Vulnerability Name: Stored XSS in Product Name
Severity: High
Affected URL: http://localhost/cbpos/classes/Master.php?f=save_product
Affected Parameter: Product Name
HTTP Method: POST

```

Issue Description

The web application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (SXSS) attacks in the "Product Name" input field. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by inputting the malicious JavaScript code in the HTTP POST request to create the user. In the provided example, the attacker modifies the "Product Name" parameter to insert a malicious JavaScript Code that can also access the authentication cookies.
Proof Of Concept

Configure a web proxy in your browser.

Navigate to the URL in the browser <http://localhost/cbpos/classes/Master.php?f=save_product>

Fill in the desired data in the input fields. Intercept the request in the web proxy. Modify the lname parameter as shown below and send the request to the server.
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="name"

```
 "><img src=xx onerror=alert(document.cookie)>
```

In the browser just create an product with malicious script and navigate to homepage

<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t29u20nWeS-dk8z-xNo5VJBecWtuM8V-/view?usp=drive_link>
Payload:

> Content-Disposition: form-data; name="name"

Impact:

Stored XSS attacks can have serious consequences, such as Account takeover by stealing cookies, stealing sensitive data, modifying the content of the web page, or redirecting users to a malicious sites.
Remediation:

Implement proper input validation and output encoding to prevent malicious code from being injected into the web application. Use server-side validation to ensure that user input is properly sanitized before being stored in a database or displayed on a web page. Use output encoding to ensure that any user input that is displayed on the web page is properly encoded to prevent malicious code from being executed.
