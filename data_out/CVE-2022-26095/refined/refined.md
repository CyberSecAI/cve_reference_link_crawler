*   **Impact:** This vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers to cause an out-of-bounds write, potentially leading to a denial of service or other unexpected behavior.
*  **Attack Vector**: Remote attackers can trigger the vulnerability by sending malformed input to the affected function of `libsimba` library.
*   **Attacker Capabilities**: Attackers need to be able to send malformed data to the vulnerable library through a network connection.

**3. Patch Information:**

*   The patch adds proper validation logic to the affected parser functions of the `libsimba` library to prevent the null pointer dereference.

**4. Affected Versions:**
