{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper handling of user-supplied input in the 'servDomain' parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow vulnerability in the 'servDomain' parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition, causing the router to become unresponsive and disrupting network services, leading to network outages.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafting malicious input for the 'servDomain' field.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable router to exploit the overflow through the 'servDomain' parameter."
