{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A refactor in libvirt's code for fetching interface lists introduced a corner case where allocating 0 bytes of memory would result in a NULL pointer on certain platforms.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A NULL-pointer dereference leads to a crash of the `virtinterfaced` daemon, causing a denial of service. Clients connected to the read-only socket could trigger the crash.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Calling `virConnectListInterfaces()` with a request to fill 0 networks."
     ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the libvirt daemon's read-only socket and trigger the vulnerable code path via the `virConnectListInterfaces()` API. No specific privileges are required for the attack itself as the crash occurs in the daemon.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability was introduced in libvirt version 10.4.0 and is triggered when memory allocation of 0 bytes returns NULL instead of a valid pointer, a behavior which is specific to some platforms.\nNetApp products are affected."
