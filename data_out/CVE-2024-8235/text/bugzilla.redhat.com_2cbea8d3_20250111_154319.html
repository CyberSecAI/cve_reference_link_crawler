| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2308680#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-08-30 13:15:59 UTC  ``` A refactor of the code fetching the list of interfaces for multiple APIs introduced a corner case on platforms where allocating 0 bytes of memory results in a NULL pointer.  This corner case would lead to a NULL-pointer dereference and subsequent crash of `virtinterfaced` if virConnectListInterfaces() is called requesting 0 networks to be filled.  The bug was introduced in libvirt-10.4.0 and reproduces only on platforms where allocation of 0-length memory returns NULL instead of a valid pointer.  Upstream fix: <https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/commit/8dfb12cb77996519901b8d52c754ab564ebd10e8>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2308680#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-12 08:53:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:9128 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9128](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A9128)   ``` |  |
