Package        : jetty9
Version        : 9.4.50-4+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2024-22201
Debian Bug     : 1064923

Jetty 9 is a Java based web server and servlet engine. It was discovered that
remote attackers may leave many HTTP/2 connections in ESTABLISHED state (not
closed), TCP congested and idle. Eventually the server will stop accepting new
connections from valid clients which can cause a denial of service.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
9.4.50-4+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your jetty9 packages.

For the detailed security status of jetty9 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/jetty9>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
