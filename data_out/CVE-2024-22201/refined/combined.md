Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3780-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                      Markus Koschany
April 06, 2024                                <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : jetty9
Version        : 9.4.50-4+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2024-22201
Debian Bug     : 1064923

Jetty 9 is a Java based web server and servlet engine. It was discovered that
remote attackers may leave many HTTP/2 connections in ESTABLISHED state (not
closed), TCP congested and idle. Eventually the server will stop accepting new
connections from valid clients which can cause a denial of service.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
9.4.50-4+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your jetty9 packages.

For the detailed security status of jetty9 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/jetty9>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

SECURITY-3379 / CVE-2024-22201
Jenkins bundles Winstone-Jetty, a wrapper around Jetty, to act as HTTP and
servlet server when started using `java -jar jenkins.war`. This is how
Jenkins is run when using any of the installers or packages, but not when
run using servlet containers such as Tomcat.

Jenkins 2.443 and earlier, LTS 2.440.1 and earlier bundles versions of
Jetty affected by the security vulnerability CVE-2024-22201. This
vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to cause a denial of
service.

NOTE: This only affects instances that enable HTTP/2, typically using the
`--http2Port` argument to `java -jar jenkins.war` or corresponding options
in service configuration files. It is disabled by default in all native
installers and the Docker images provided by the Jenkins project.

| We need hard evidence that this is not the case.  The server will idle timeout and will try to send the client a TLS close alert and a TCP FIN. The client is supposed to answer with a TCP FIN, and the server will close the connection.  If the client does not answer the TCP FIN, after another idle timeout the server will close the connection.  If you have hard evidence that this is not the case, please report the server's DEBUG logs. |

## Description

### Impact

If an HTTP/2 connection gets TCP congested, when an idle timeout occurs the HTTP/2 session is marked as closed, and then a GOAWAY frame is queued to be written.

However it is not written because the connection is TCP congested.

When another idle timeout period elapses, it is then supposed to hard close the connection, but it delegates to the HTTP/2 session which reports that it has already been closed so it does not attempt to hard close the connection.

This leaves the connection in ESTABLISHED state (i.e. not closed), TCP congested, and idle.

An attacker can cause many connections to end up in this state, and the server may run out of file descriptors, eventually causing the server to stop accepting new connections from valid clients.

The client may also be impacted (if the server does not read causing a TCP congestion), but the issue is more severe for servers.

### Patches

Patched versions:

* 9.4.54
* 10.0.20
* 11.0.20
* 12.0.6

### Workarounds

Disable HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support until you can upgrade to a patched version of Jetty.

HTTP/1.x is not affected.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
