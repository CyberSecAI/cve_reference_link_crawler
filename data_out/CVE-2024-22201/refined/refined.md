Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-22201:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Jetty handles idle timeouts in HTTP/2 connections when TCP congestion occurs. Specifically, when an idle timeout happens, the HTTP/2 session is marked as closed, and a GOAWAY frame is queued to be sent. However, if the connection is TCP congested, the GOAWAY frame is not written. Subsequently, another idle timeout occurs, the connection should be hard closed, but the HTTP/2 session reports that it's already closed, so the connection isn't terminated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Failure to properly close HTTP/2 connections during TCP congestion after an idle timeout.
- The connection remains in ESTABLISHED state even after an idle timeout.
- Incorrectly relying on the HTTP/2 session's closed status to avoid hard-closing connections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS).
- Attackers can cause many connections to be stuck in an ESTABLISHED state, leading to resource exhaustion on the server (e.g., running out of file descriptors).
- The server may stop accepting new connections from legitimate clients due to the resource exhaustion.
- Clients might also be affected if the server doesn't read and causes TCP congestion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending HTTP/2 requests to a vulnerable server and causing TCP congestion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish HTTP/2 connections with the target server.
- The attacker needs to be able to cause TCP congestion.
- No special privileges are needed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Jetty versions 9.3.x through 9.4.53, 10.0.x through 10.0.19, 11.0.x through 11.0.19 and 12.0.x through 12.0.5.
- The issue is triggered when a TCP connection becomes congested, and then the idle timeout occurs.
- HTTP/1.x is not affected.
- The issue is more severe for servers than clients.
- The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity with a CVSS score of 7.5.
- The issue can be mitigated by disabling HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 until the software can be upgraded.
