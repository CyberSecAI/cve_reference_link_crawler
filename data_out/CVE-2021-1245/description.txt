Cisco Finesse and Cisco Unified CVP OpenSocial Gadget Editor Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Finesse and Cisco Unified CVP could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.
The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
