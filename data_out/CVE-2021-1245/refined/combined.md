For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-multi-vuln-finesse-qp6gbUO2>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco Finesse releases earlier than Release 12.0(1) ES3 and Release 12.5(1).  At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco Virtualized Voice Browser releases earlier than Release 12.6(1).  At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco Unified CVP releases 12.6(2) ES4 through 12.6(2) ES17.  See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is required to exploit the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **Cisco Finesse, Cisco Virtualized Voice Browser, and Cisco Unified CVP OpenSocial Gadget Editor Unauthenticated Access Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco Finesse, Cisco Virtualized Voice Browser, and Cisco Unified CVP could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the OpenSocial Gadget Editor without providing valid user credentials.  The vulnerability is due to missing authentication for a specific section of the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a crafted URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain access to a section of the interface, which they could use to obtain potentially confidential information and create arbitrary XML files.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  CVE ID: CVE-2021-1246Bug ID(s): CSCvs52916, CSCvw27957, CSCwk05799Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 6.5CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N  **Cisco Finesse and Cisco Unified CVP OpenSocial Gadget Editor Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Finesse and Cisco Unified CVP could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.  The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  CVE ID: CVE-2021-1245Bug ID(s): CSCvs52916, CSCwk05799Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 6.1CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Fixed Releases At the time of publication, Cisco Finesse releases 12.0(1) ES3 and 12.5(1) and later contained the fix for these vulnerabilities.  At the time of publication, Cisco Virtualized Voice Browser releases 12.6(1) and later contained the fix for these vulnerabilities.  At the time of publication, Cisco Unified CVP releases 12.6(2) ES18 and later contained the fix for these vulnerabilities.  See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.
