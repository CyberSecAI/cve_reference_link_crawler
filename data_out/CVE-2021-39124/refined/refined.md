The content relates to CVE-2021-39124.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The CSRF failure retry feature in Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center before version 8.16.0 does not properly protect against replay attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) bypass vulnerability. The CSRF failure retry mechanism can be exploited to replay crafted requests, bypassing CSRF protection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote attacker can trick a user into retrying a crafted request, effectively bypassing CSRF protection and potentially performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
A remote attacker needs to trick a user into retrying a request. This could be achieved through social engineering or other methods to get the victim to interact with a malicious link or form.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into retrying a crafted request. They do not need direct access to the Jira instance, but must be able to influence a user who does.
