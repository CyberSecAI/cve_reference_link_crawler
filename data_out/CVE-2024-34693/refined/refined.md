{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper Input Validation",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authenticated attacker can create a MariaDB connection with local_infile enabled. If the MariaDB server and the local MySQL client on the web server both allow local infile, the attacker can execute a specific SQL command to read files from the server.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server and insert their content into a MariaDB database table.",
  "Attack vectors": "An authenticated attacker crafts a MariaDB connection with local_infile enabled and then executes a specific SQL command.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be authenticated to create MariaDB connections and must be able to interact with both the MariaDB server and the local MySQL client on the web server."
