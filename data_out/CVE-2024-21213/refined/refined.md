{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is in the MySQL server's InnoDB storage engine. Specifically, when a large number of queries against tables with large text/blob fields are run in parallel, a denial of service (DoS) can occur.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS)",
        "Resource exhaustion related to handling of text/blob fields"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful attack can cause a DoS condition, making the database unavailable. This is due to excessive memory or resource consumption when processing a large number of concurrent queries.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Network exploitation via MySQL protocol"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send MySQL queries to the target server. No authentication is mentioned as a requirement to exploit this vulnerability. It should be noted that the access required is 'local' but the attack vector is 'network'"
