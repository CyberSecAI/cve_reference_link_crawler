{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A server-side template injection vulnerability exists in the `@SelfValidating` feature of `dropwizard-validation`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Server-side template injection. The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided messages, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the host system with the privileges of the Dropwizard service account.",
  "Attack vectors": "By injecting arbitrary Java EL expressions within messages used by the `@SelfValidating` feature.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to control the messages that are added to the `ViolationCollector` when a self-validating bean is used."
