# Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in dropwizard-validation <2.0.2

High

[joschi](/joschi)
published
GHSA-3mcp-9wr4-cjqf
Feb 24, 2020

## Package

maven

dropwizard-validation
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<1.3.19, <2.0.2

## Patched versions

1.3.19, 2.0.2

## Description

### Summary

A server-side template injection was identified in the self-validating ([`@SelfValidating`](https://javadoc.io/static/io.dropwizard/dropwizard-project/2.0.2/io/dropwizard/validation/selfvalidating/SelfValidating.html)) feature of **dropwizard-validation** enabling attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability.

If you're using a self-validating bean (via [`@SelfValidating`](https://javadoc.io/static/io.dropwizard/dropwizard-project/2.0.2/io/dropwizard/validation/selfvalidating/SelfValidating.html)), an upgrade to Dropwizard 1.3.19 or 2.0.2 is strongly recommended.

### Impact

This issue may allow Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing to run arbitrary code on the host system (with the privileges of the Dropwizard service account privileges) by injecting arbitrary [Java Expression Language (EL)](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/validator/6.1/reference/en-US/html_single/#section-interpolation-with-message-expressions) expressions when using the self-validating feature ([`@SelfValidating`](https://javadoc.io/static/io.dropwizard/dropwizard-project/2.0.2/io/dropwizard/validation/selfvalidating/SelfValidating.html), [`@SelfValidation`](https://javadoc.io/static/io.dropwizard/dropwizard-project/2.0.2/io/dropwizard/validation/selfvalidating/SelfValidation.html)) in **dropwizard-validation**.

### Patches

The issue has been fixed in **dropwizard-validation** **1.3.19** and **2.0.2**. We strongly recommend upgrading to one of these versions.

### Workarounds

If you are not able to upgrade to one of the aforementioned versions of **dropwizard-validation** but still want to use the [`@SelfValidating`](https://javadoc.io/static/io.dropwizard/dropwizard-project/2.0.2/io/dropwizard/validation/selfvalidating/SelfValidating.html) feature, make sure to properly sanitize any message you're adding to the [`ViolationCollector`](https://javadoc.io/static/io.dropwizard/dropwizard-project/2.0.2/io/dropwizard/validation/selfvalidating/ViolationCollector.html) in the method annotated with [`@SelfValidation`](https://javadoc.io/static/io.dropwizard/dropwizard-project/2.0.2/io/dropwizard/validation/selfvalidating/SelfValidation.html).

Example:

```
@SelfValidation
public void validateFullName(ViolationCollector col) {
    if (fullName.contains("_")) {
        // Sanitize fullName variable by escaping relevant characters such as "$"
        col.addViolation("Full name contains invalid characters:  " + sanitizeJavaEl(fullName));
    }
}
```
