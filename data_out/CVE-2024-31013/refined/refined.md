Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `footer_info` parameter within the Emlog blogging system. Specifically, the `postStrVar()` function, intended to filter input, fails to prevent stored XSS attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the `footer_info` parameter and stored in the system's database. This payload is then executed whenever a user views the homepage, specifically when the footer information is rendered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they visit the affected website. This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to impersonate users.
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive data displayed on the page.
    - **Phishing:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the administrative interface of the Emlog system. An attacker with administrative privileges can modify the system settings, specifically the footer information, to inject the malicious XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative access to the Emlog system to modify the footer information. This usually means having valid login credentials with administrative privileges.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `footer_info` parameter is vulnerable to XSS.
