The provided content relates to CVE-2021-46923.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing cleanup of the `mount_kattr` structure in the `mount_setattr` syscall when the path lookup fails before `do_mount_setattr` is called. Specifically, `finish_mount_kattr` was not being called in this error condition which leads to a reference leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Reference leak in `mount_setattr` syscall when `user_path_at` fails.
- Missing cleanup of `mount_kattr` structure in the failure case.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory leak of an additional reference taken when building mount_kattr
- Resource exhaustion if the vulnerability is repeatedly triggered.

**Attack vectors:**
- Calling the `mount_setattr` syscall with an invalid path can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to call the `mount_setattr` system call.
- No specific privileges are required beyond the ability to invoke the system call, suggesting any local user could trigger this.
