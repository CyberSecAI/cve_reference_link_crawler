Contao is an Open Source CMS. In affected versions an untrusted user can inject insert tags into the canonical tag, which are then replaced on the web page (front end). Users are advised to update to Contao 4.13.49, 5.3.15 or 5.4.3. Users unable to upgrade should disable canonical tags in the root page settings.
