- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress WebwinkelKeur plugin, versions 3.24 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation is possible through a CSRF attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in, higher-privileged user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that performs actions on the vulnerable site. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target WordPress site, as the attack relies on the user's active session.
