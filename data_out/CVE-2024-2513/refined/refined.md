Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes, specifically the `imageAlt` block attribute in the WP Chat App plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided data for the `imageAlt` attribute.
*   **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin does not sufficiently escape the `imageAlt` attribute when rendering it on a page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious web scripts into pages.
*   **Code Execution:** When a user visits a page with the injected script, the script will execute in their browser. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    *   Stealing cookies or session data
    *   Redirecting to malicious sites
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Plugin Vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the WP Chat App plugin.
*   **Block Attribute:** The `imageAlt` attribute of the plugin's block is the entry point for the injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site.
*   **Contributor-Level Access or Higher:** The attacker needs at least contributor-level access to be able to inject the malicious code using the block functionality.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the WP Chat App plugin up to and including 3.6.2.
*   The vulnerable code is related to how the `imageAlt` attribute is handled in the plugin's block functionality.
*   The fix involves sanitizing the input and escaping the output of the `imageAlt` attribute.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content includes the patch details showing changes in the code, particularly in `blocks/src/init.php` where the escaping of `imageAlt` attribute is addressed.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a Medium severity issue.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Ngô Thiên An (ancorn\_) from VNPT-VCI.
*   The vendor has released version 3.6.3 which contains a fix for this vulnerability.
