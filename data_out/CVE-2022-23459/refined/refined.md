- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `Value` class in `jsonxx` uses the default assignment operator, which performs a shallow copy of pointer members. When a `Value` object is copied via assignment, the underlying pointers are copied, leading to multiple `Value` objects pointing to the same memory. When these objects are destructed, the pointed memory is freed multiple times, causing a double free.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Double free or use-after-free. The `Value` class lacks a proper copy constructor or assignment operator that performs deep copies for pointer members.

- **Impact of exploitation:** This issue may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code due to memory corruption.

- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating JSON objects in a way that involves assigning `Value` objects containing pointer members. Specifically, the provided PoC shows that the vulnerability can be triggered through assignment of the value of a key from one json object into another

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to control the input JSON data, or be able to manipulate objects in ways similar to the PoC provided.
