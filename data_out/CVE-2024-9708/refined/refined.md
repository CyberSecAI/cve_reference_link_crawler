Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the "Easy SVG Upload" WordPress plugin when handling SVG file uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize SVG file contents upon upload and when outputting/rendering the SVG content. This allows malicious SVG code containing JavaScript to be stored and executed within the application context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Web Script Injection:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which will be executed when a user accesses the SVG file. This can have various impacts like:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Malicious redirects
    *   Defacement of web pages
    *   Stealing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SVG File Upload:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript code via the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least "Author" level access or higher.
*   **Upload Permissions:** The attacker needs permissions that allow for uploading files through the plugin.
