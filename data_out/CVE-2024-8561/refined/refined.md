Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8561 (based on the prompt, but no CVE description is available in the provided content).

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The application fails to sanitize user input in the `person` parameter of the `/basic-crud/endpoint/delete.php` endpoint, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `person` GET parameter in `/basic-crud/endpoint/delete.php` is the vulnerable point of entry.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL query execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
  - **Data Breach:** Accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive data in the database.
  - **Data Manipulation:** Altering the integrity of stored information.
  - **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gaining higher privileges within the database if the database user has excessive rights.
  - **Denial of Service:** Making the application and database unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/basic-crud/endpoint/delete.php` endpoint.
- **Modified Parameter:** The `person` parameter is modified to inject SQL code instead of a simple integer ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker must have knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft effective payloads.
- **Proxy Tool:** The attacker may use tools like Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided report includes a specific SQL injection payload:
```
GET /basic-crud/endpoint/delete.php?person=1%27%20AND%20GTID\_SUBSET%28CONCAT%280x716b6a6a71%2C%28MID%28%28IFNULL%28CAST%28VERSION%28%29%20AS%20NCHAR%29%2C0x20%29%29%2C1%2C190%29%29%2C0x71787a6b71%29%2C3736%29--%20UXvx HTTP/1.1
```
- It also shows the output of sqlmap scans, indicating that the endpoint is vulnerable to multiple types of SQL injection, including:
    - Boolean-based blind SQL injection.
    - Error-based SQL injection.
    - Stacked queries SQL injection.
    - Time-based blind SQL injection.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable software is identified as "SourceCodester PHP CRUD using PDO Connection with Free Source Code 1.0".
- The vulnerability was reported on 09/06/2024 and accepted shortly after.
- VulDB assigned entry ID `276781` to this vulnerability.
