- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress plugin `postTabs` lacks CSRF protection when updating its settings, and also lacks sanitization and escaping of user-supplied data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Allows an attacker to make a logged-in administrator change plugin settings without their consent.
    - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Due to lack of sanitization and escaping, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into plugin settings, which will then execute in the browsers of other users.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - An attacker can modify plugin settings, which includes injecting malicious JavaScript. This could lead to various consequences, such as redirecting users to malicious websites, stealing session cookies, defacing the website, or performing other actions with the privileges of the victim user.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - CSRF: An attacker can craft a malicious HTML page with a form that, when submitted by a logged-in administrator, updates the plugin settings to include malicious JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious webpage or execute a crafted request.
    - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the vulnerable system itself.
