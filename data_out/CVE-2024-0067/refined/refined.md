- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The VAPIX API endpoint `ledlimit.cgi` is vulnerable to path traversal attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can list folder and file names on the local file system of the Axis device.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted request to the `ledlimit.cgi` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated with an operator- or administrator-privileged service account.
