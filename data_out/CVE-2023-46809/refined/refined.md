Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-46809:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `privateDecrypt()` API of the Node.js crypto library.
- It stems from a covert timing side-channel during PKCS#1 v1.5 padding error handling.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability reveals timing differences during decryption between valid and invalid ciphertexts.
- This creates a timing side-channel that can be exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can remotely exploit the timing differences to decrypt captured RSA ciphertexts or forge signatures.
- This is especially dangerous in scenarios involving API endpoints that process JSON Web Encryption (JWE) messages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation is possible by analyzing the timing differences when decrypting different ciphertexts.
- The attack targets the `privateDecrypt()` API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to be able to send ciphertexts to a vulnerable server using the privateDecrypt API.
- They must also be able to measure the time it takes for the server to process the requests.
