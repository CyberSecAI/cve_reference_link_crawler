- This can lead to the exposure of sensitive database information, including usernames, passwords, personal data, and other confidential data.
- The attacker could also modify or delete data, potentially causing a loss of integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not require any specific privileges or credentials to exploit this vulnerability, as the vulnerability is directly accessible via an exposed URL.
