Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL Injection vulnerability present in the `Establishment Billing Management System`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter in the `/ajax.php?action=delete_block` URI, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Escalation of privileges: Successful exploitation of this SQL injection vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or complete compromise of the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/ajax.php?action=delete_block`.
- Injection of malicious SQL code via the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application.
- The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable endpoint `/ajax.php?action=delete_block` and the vulnerable parameter `id`.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the "Establishment Billing Management System."
- The provided proof of concept (POC) includes a `sqlmap` command and a sample HTTP request to demonstrate the vulnerability
