Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5224

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling user-supplied attributes within the `cardoza_facebook_like_box` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin doesn't properly clean user-provided data before processing it.
- **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin fails to escape the data before outputting it into the HTML, allowing malicious code to be rendered as part of the webpage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into a page.
- **Compromised User Sessions:** When a user visits a page containing the malicious script, their browser will execute it, potentially leading to:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** An attacker can inject the malicious JavaScript through the attributes of the `cardoza_facebook_like_box` shortcode within a post or page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This means they can create or edit posts and pages where the shortcode can be inserted.
- **Knowledge of Shortcodes:** The attacker needs to be aware of how to use the vulnerable shortcode.
