{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to Firefox Focus for iOS allowing silent background navigation, combined with the ability to open the application externally using a custom Firefox scheme with a javascript URI.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Silent background navigation allows an attacker to change the context of the browser after the user has left the app.",
      "The `firefox-focus://open-url` scheme allows execution of javascript URIs.",
      "A timeout race condition allows the javascript to execute after a context change, leading to UXSS."
     ],
    "impact": "Full UXSS (Universal Cross-Site Scripting) allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a top origin site.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack involves navigating to a malicious page, then moving the application to the background. Subsequently, an attacker uses another application (such as Safari) to open a malicious URL using a custom `firefox-focus://open-url` scheme containing javascript. This forces a new page load, and due to a timeout race condition, the malicious javascript executes after the context change.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to: \n - Host a malicious webpage.\n - Craft a malicious URL using the `firefox-focus://open-url` scheme with a javascript URI.\n - Have the user navigate to the initial malicious page and move the application to the background.\n - Have the user open the crafted URL from a different application such as Safari or Mail."
