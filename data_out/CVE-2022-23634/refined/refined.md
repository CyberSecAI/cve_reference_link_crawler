  "CVE-2022-23634": {
    "description": "Multiple security vulnerabilities were discovered in Puma, a HTTP server for Ruby/Rack applications, which could result in HTTP request smuggling or information disclosure.\nPrior to `puma` version `5.6.2`, `puma` may not always call `close` on the response body. Rails, prior to version `7.0.2.2`, depended on the response body being closed in order for its `CurrentAttributes` implementation to work correctly.  The combination of these two behaviors (Puma not closing the body + Rails' Executor implementation) causes information leakage.",
    "root_cause": "Puma may not always call `close` on the response body, leading to thread local state not being reset by `ActionDispatch::Executor` in Rails.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information exposure"
    ],
    "impact": "Information leakage to subsequent requests, especially when interacting with ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Network"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any privileges, but may need some user interaction, and the attack complexity is considered high."
