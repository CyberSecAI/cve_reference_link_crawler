[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-rmj8-8hhh-gv5h/dependabot)

## Package

bundler

puma
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

>= 5.0.0, < 5.6.2
< 4.3.11

## Patched versions

5.6.2
4.3.11

## Description

### Impact

Prior to `puma` version `5.6.2`, `puma` may not always call `close` on the response body. Rails, prior to version `7.0.2.2`, depended on the response body being closed in order for its `CurrentAttributes` implementation to work correctly.

From Rails:

> Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be closed, for example a bug in a webserver[1] or a bug in a Rack middleware. In the event a response is not notified of a close, ActionDispatch::Executor will not know to reset thread local state for the next request. This can lead to data being leaked to subsequent requests, especially when interacting with ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes.

The combination of these two behaviors (Puma not closing the body + Rails' Executor implementation) causes information leakage.

### Patches

This problem is fixed in Puma versions 5.6.2 and 4.3.11.

This problem is fixed in Rails versions 7.02.2, 6.1.4.6, 6.0.4.6, and 5.2.6.2.

See:

[GHSA-wh98-p28r-vrc9](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wh98-p28r-vrc9 "GHSA-wh98-p28r-vrc9")

for details about the rails vulnerability

Upgrading to a patched Rails *or* Puma version fixes the vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Upgrade to Rails versions 7.02.2, 6.1.4.6, 6.0.4.6, and 5.2.6.2.

The [Rails CVE](https://groups.google.com/g/ruby-security-ann/c/FkTM-_7zSNA/m/K2RiMJBlBAAJ?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer&pli=1) includes a middleware that can be used instead.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
