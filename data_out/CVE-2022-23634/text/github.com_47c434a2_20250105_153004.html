This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Ensure `close` is called on the response body no matter what

```
Another fallout from [#2809](https://github.com/puma/puma/pull/2809) is that
in some cases the `res_body.close` wasn't called because some previous code
raised.

For Rails apps it means CurrentAttributes and a few other important
states aren't reset properly.

This is being improved on the Rails side too, but I believe it would
be good to harden this on the puma side as well.
