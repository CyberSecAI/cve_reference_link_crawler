Package        : puma
Version        : 3.6.0-1+deb9u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-16770 CVE-2020-5247 CVE-2022-23634
Debian Bug     : 946312 952766 1005391

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in puma, a web server for
Ruby/Rack applications. These flaws may lead to information leakage due to not
always closing response bodies, allowing untrusted input in a response header
(HTTP Response Splitting) and thus potentially facilitating several other
attacks like cross-site scripting. A poorly-behaved client could also use
keepalive requests to monopolize Puma's reactor and create a denial of service
attack.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
3.6.0-1+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your puma packages.

For the detailed security status of puma please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/puma>
