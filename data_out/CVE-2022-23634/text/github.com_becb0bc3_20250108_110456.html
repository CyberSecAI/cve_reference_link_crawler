## Package

bundler

actionpack
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

>= 5.0.0.0, <= 5.2.6.1
>= 6.0.0.0, <= 6.0.4.5
>= 6.1.0.0, <= 6.1.4.5
>= 7.0.0.0, <= 7.0.2.1

## Patched versions

5.2.6.2
6.0.4.6
6.1.4.6
7.0.2.2

## Description

### Impact

Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be closed, for example a [bug in a webserver](https://github.com/puma/puma/pull/2812) or a bug in a Rack middleware. In the event a response is *not* notified of a `close`, `ActionDispatch::Executor` will not know to reset thread local state for the next request. This can lead to data being leaked to subsequent requests, especially when interacting with `ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes`.

Upgrading to the FIXED versions of Rails will ensure mitigation of this issue even in the context of a buggy webserver or middleware implementation.

### Patches

This has been fixed in Rails 7.0.2.2, 6.1.4.6, 6.0.4.6, and 5.2.6.2.

### Workarounds

Upgrading is highly recommended, but to work around this problem the following middleware can be used:

```
class GuardedExecutor < ActionDispatch::Executor
  def call(env)
    ensure_completed!
    super
  end

  private

    def ensure_completed!
      @executor.new.complete! if @executor.active?
    end
end

# Ensure the guard is inserted before ActionDispatch::Executor
Rails.application.configure do
  config.middleware.swap ActionDispatch::Executor, GuardedExecutor, executor
end
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
