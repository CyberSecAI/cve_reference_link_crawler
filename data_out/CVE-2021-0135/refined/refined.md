- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the Intel(R) Ethernet Diagnostic Driver for Windows.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The driver fails to properly validate input, leading to a potential escalation of privilege.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow a privileged user to escalate their privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited via local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a privileged user with local access to the system.
