- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the `PreorderModel::getIdProductAttributesByIdAttributes()` method of the "Pre-Order" module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the `$id_attributes` array is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability (CWE-89).
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Obtain admin access.
    - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop installation.
    - Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to expose tokens and unlock admin's AJAX scripts.
    - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks through HTTP requests. The attacker can conceal the module controller's path during the exploit, making it difficult to identify in conventional frontend logs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability with a trivial HTTP call. No specific user interaction is required.
