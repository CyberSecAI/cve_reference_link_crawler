Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2026

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `content_protector` shortcode of the Passster WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize or escape user-provided attributes, allowing attackers to inject malicious web scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of other users who visit pages containing the injected shortcode. This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **`content_protector` Shortcode:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `content_protector` shortcode within WordPress posts or pages.
- **User-Supplied Attributes:** The vulnerability is exploitable by providing malicious values to the shortcode attributes such as `headline`, `instruction`, `placeholder`, `button`, `id` and `acf`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Contributor or Higher Access:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress website to be able to insert or modify posts/pages with the vulnerable shortcode.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Passster plugin versions up to and including 4.2.6.4.
- The fix is available in version 4.2.6.5.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting a crafted `content_protector` shortcode with malicious attributes.
- The `class-ps-public.php` file located in `/inc/` directory is responsible for processing shortcodes, this is where the vulnerable code resides.
- The `esc_html()` function is used on some attributes, but it's not used on all vulnerable attributes, leading to the vulnerability.
