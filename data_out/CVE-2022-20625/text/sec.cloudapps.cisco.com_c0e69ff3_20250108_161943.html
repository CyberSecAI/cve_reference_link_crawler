This vulnerability is due to improper handling of Cisco Discovery Protocol messages that are processed by the Cisco Discovery Protocol service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco Discovery Protocol service to fail and restart. In rare conditions, repeated failures of the process could occur, which could cause the entire device to restart.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cdp-dos-G8DPLWYG>  This advisory is part of the February 2022 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.

See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Determine the Status of Cisco Discovery Protocol for Cisco FXOS Software Cisco Discovery Protocol is always enabled on the management (mgmt0) port. In Cisco FXOS Software releases earlier than Release 2.1, Cisco Discovery Protocol is always enabled on all front-panel ports. Determine the Status of Cisco Discovery Protocol on Cisco Nexus Switches that are Running Cisco NX-OS Software To determine whether Cisco Discovery Protocol is enabled on a device, use the **show running-config cdp all | include "cdp enable"** command in the device CLI. If the command returns at least the following lines, Cisco Discovery Protocol is enabled globally and on at least one interface:  ```   nxos# show running-config cdp all | include "cdp enable"   cdp enable     cdp enable   ``` Determine the Status of Cisco Discovery Protocol on Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects Cisco Discovery Protocol is always enabled on Ethernet uplink ports (network interfaces that connect to upstream switches for network connectivity), Ethernet port channel members, Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) uplink ports, and management ports.  Cisco Discovery Protocol may also be enabled on server ports (interfaces that are presented to the servers in the Cisco UCS Manager domain) and appliance ports (interfaces that connect to directly attached Network File System (NFS) storage). To determine whether Cisco Discovery Protocol is enabled on server ports or appliance ports on a device, use the **show configuration | egrep "^ scope|enable cdp"** command in the device CLI. If the command returns the **enable cdp** command under the **org** scope, Cisco Discovery Protocol is enabled on server ports. If the command returns **enable cdp** under the **eth-storage** scope, Cisco Discovery Protocol is enabled on appliance ports. The following example shows the output for a device that has Cisco Discovery Protocol enabled on server ports and appliance ports:  ```   ucs-fi# show configuration | egrep "^ scope|enable cdp"   .   .   .    scope org            enable cdp   .   .   .    scope eth-storage            enable cdp   .   .   .   ```    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Firepower 1000 Series and Cisco Firepower 2100 Series.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  However, customers who do not use the Cisco Discovery Protocol feature can disable it either globally to fully close the attack vector or on individual interfaces to reduce the attack surface. Disable Cisco Discovery Protocol in Cisco FXOS Software Cisco Discovery Protocol is always enabled and cannot be disabled in Cisco FXOS Software. In Cisco FXOS Software releases 2.1 and later, Cisco Discovery Protocol is enabled on the management (mgmt0) port only. Disable Cisco Discovery Protocol Globally on Cisco Nexus Switches that are Running Cisco NX-OS Software To disable Cisco Discovery Protocol globally on Cisco Nexus Switches that are running Cisco NX-OS Software, use the **no cdp enable** command in global configuration mode, as shown in the following example:  ```   nxos# conf t   Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z.   nxos(config)# no cdp enable    nxos(config)# end   nxos# copy running-config startup-config    [########################################] 100%   Copy complete.   ``` Disable Cisco Discovery Protocol on an Interface on Cisco Nexus Switches that are Running Cisco NX-OS Software To disable Cisco Discovery Protocol on an interface on Cisco Nexus Switches that are running Cisco NX-OS Software, use the **no cdp enable** command in interface configuration mode, as shown in the following example:  ```   nxos# conf t   Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z.   nxos(config)# interface Ethernet1/1   nxos(config-if)# no cdp enable    nxos(config-if)# end   nxos# copy running-config startup-config   [########################################] 100%   Copy complete.   ``` Disable Cisco Discovery Protocol on Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects Cisco Discovery Protocol cannot be disabled completely on Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects.  Cisco Discovery Protocol can be disabled on server ports and appliance ports on Cisco CS Fabric Interconnects, but it cannot be disabled on Ethernet uplink ports, Ethernet port channel members, FCoE uplink ports, or management ports.  To disable Cisco Discovery Protocol on the server ports of a Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect, use the **disable cdp** command in the default **nw-ctrl-policy** in the **org** scope, as shown in the following example:  ```   ucs-fi# scope org   ucs-fi /org # enter nw-ctrl-policy default   ucs-fi /org/nw-ctrl-policy # disable cdp   ucs-fi /org/nw-ctrl-policy* # exit   ucs-fi /org* # exit   ucs-fi* # commit-buffer   ucs-fi#    ```  To disable Cisco Discovery Protocol on the appliance ports of a Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect, use the **disable cdp** command in the default **nw-ctrl-policy** in the **eth-storage** scope, as shown in the following example:  ```   ucs-fi* # scope eth-storage   ucs-fi /eth-storage* # enter nw-ctrl-policy default   ucs-fi /eth-storage/nw-ctrl-policy* # disable cdp   ucs-fi /eth-storage/nw-ctrl-policy* # exit   ucs-fi /eth-storage* # exit   ucs-fi* # commit-buffer   ucs-fi#    ```  While these mitigations have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
