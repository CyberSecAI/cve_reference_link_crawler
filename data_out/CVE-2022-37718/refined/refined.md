Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-37718:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Command injection vulnerability exists in the network management component of JetNexus/EdgeNexus ADC v4.2.8.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The application takes user-supplied input and executes it as a system command. Specifically, the `Adapter` parameter is vulnerable to command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the server.
- Escalation of privileges.
- Information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote authenticated attacker.
- Sending a specially crafted request to JetNexus troubleshooting tools.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the JetNexus/EdgeNexus management portal.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via a POST request to `/POST/23?iAction=4&iType=1`.
- The `Adapter` parameter within the JSON body of the POST request can be manipulated to inject arbitrary shell commands.
- Example payload: `{"CaptureHidden":"", "Adapter":"eth0`touch /tmp/pwn`", "Packets":"1", "Duration":"1", "CaptureAddress":"1.1.1.1"}`. This payload injects the command `touch /tmp/pwn` which will create an empty file in the /tmp directory.
