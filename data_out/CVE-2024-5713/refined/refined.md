Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The WordPress plugin "if-so" fails to properly escape the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` parameter before outputting it within an HTML attribute. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Weakness:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Stealing sensitive information, such as cookies or user data
*  **Attack Vector:** A crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code is sent to a logged-in administrator. When the admin visits this URL, the injected script executes in their browser, potentially giving the attacker access to their session and/or ability to make changes on their behalf.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript and then get a logged in admin to open this URL.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is present in versions of the "if-so" plugin prior to 1.8.0.4.
* The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates the vulnerability using a specific URL that includes a script tag.
* The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) and is listed under OWASP Top 10 A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
* The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 4.2 (Medium).
