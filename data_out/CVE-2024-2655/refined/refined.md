Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2655:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of author display names within the "Elementor Addons by Livemesh" plugin's Post widgets.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided author display names, allowing malicious scripts to be stored in the database. These scripts are then executed when a page displaying the author's name is accessed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary script execution: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the author's display name. When a user views a page containing a vulnerable post widget, the injected JavaScript is executed in their browser.
- Potential for malicious activities: This could lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, or other malicious actions depending on the injected script's purpose.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via the plugin's Post widgets.
- Specifically, the author's display name field is the point of injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated attacker: The attacker needs to have an account with at least "Contributor" level access.
- Ability to modify user profiles: The attacker needs to be able to change their own display name.

**Additional Details:**

- The Wordfence article provides detailed information about the affected versions (<=8.3.6) and the patched version (8.3.7).
- The vulnerability is located in the `author.php` template file, as confirmed by the WordPress.org Trac link
- The fix involved applying `esc_html()` function to sanitize the output of the author's display name, as seen in line 8 of `author.php` file from the `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` content, resolving the XSS vulnerability.
