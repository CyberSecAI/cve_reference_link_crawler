{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The PCP libpcp __pmDecodeValueSet routine mishandles size checks in the Result PDU.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap corruption due to insufficient size checks when processing a Result PDU.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can send specially crafted data to the system, which could cause the program to misbehave or crash. This flaw allows the pmcd metric store operation (if enabled) to corrupt the calling program's heap with a maliciously crafted PDU.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted data to the system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send specifically crafted data to the vulnerable system. This suggests a network based attack where the attacker sends a malformed PDU to a listening PCP process."
