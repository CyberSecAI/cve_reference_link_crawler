- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Media Library Helper by Codexin Plugin <= 1.2.0 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into executing it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious site or clicking on a malicious link. The attacker does not need to be authenticated but rather needs a victim to have an active session on the target website.
