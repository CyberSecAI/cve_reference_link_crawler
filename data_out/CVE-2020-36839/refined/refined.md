Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-36839, as well as related vulnerabilities in the WP Lead Plus X WordPress plugin:

**CVE-2020-36839: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

*   **Root Cause:** The plugin's functions lack proper nonce validation, which would normally prevent CSRF attacks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Missing or incorrect nonce validation on several plugin functions.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can trick an administrator into performing actions they didn't intend, such as creating/modifying pages or injecting malicious JavaScript, by having them click on a specially crafted link. This can lead to site defacement, redirection, or complete site takeover.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious link, usually sent via email, that when clicked by a logged-in administrator will trigger the vulnerable functions.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs no specific privileges, but must be able to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a crafted link.

**Other Vulnerabilities (Not directly related to CVE-2020-36839 but present in the same plugin):**

1.  **Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - CVE-2020-11508**
    *   **Root Cause:** Unprotected AJAX function used for saving and updating pages lacks capability and nonce checks.
    *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of authorization checks, allowing low-privileged users to modify site content.
    *   **Impact of Exploitation:** An authenticated user with minimal privileges can create or replace any page with malicious content, including JavaScript. This allows for redirection to malicious sites, stealing sensitive data, or turning a site into a spam site.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** A logged-in attacker with minimal permissions sends a POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` to save/update pages.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Authenticated user with minimal privileges (e.g., subscriber).

2.  **Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - CVE-2020-11509**
    *   **Root Cause:**  `admin_post` action for importing templates lacked nonce or capability checks.
    *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Unauthenticated users can upload malicious page templates.
    *   **Impact of Exploitation:** When a site administrator uses a maliciously crafted template, the embedded JavaScript will execute in the administrator's browser, potentially leading to site takeover.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**  An unauthenticated attacker sends a POST request to `wp-admin/admin-post.php` to upload malicious page templates.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Unauthenticated user.

**Additional Information:**

*   The plugin is vulnerable to CSRF in versions <= 0.99.
*   The XSS vulnerabilities were patched in version 0.99, but the CSRF vulnerability remained unpatched.
*   The plugin has been closed and is no longer available for download due to the security issues.
*   The Wordfence firewall provides protection against the XSS vulnerabilities but cannot protect against CSRF attacks.

**Summary of extracted information:**

*   **CVE-2020-36839**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to missing nonce validation.
*   **CVE-2020-11508**: Authenticated Stored XSS due to missing capability and nonce checks in an AJAX function.
*   **CVE-2020-11509**: Unauthenticated Stored XSS due to lack of nonce or capability checks in template import functionality.
*   **Impact**: Site takeover, defacement, redirection, malicious JavaScript injection, spam.
*   **Affected plugin**: WP Lead Plus X
*   **Affected versions**: <= 0.99
