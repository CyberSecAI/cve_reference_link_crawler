Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `getQueryRes` method of the `plm.config.settings` model within the `pdm` module for Odoo.
- The method takes a `select` parameter which is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or use of prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The main vulnerability is that the application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to lack of proper sanitization/parameterization of the `select` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, enabling them to read, modify or delete arbitrary data. The example given modifies the admin password.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with low-level access (e.g. portal user) can leverage the SQL injection to gain higher privileges by modifying user roles or password data.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can read sensitive data from the database.
- **Data Tampering:** The attacker can alter or delete sensitive data in the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted XML-RPC request to the `plm.config.settings` model, calling the `getQueryRes` method with a malicious `select` parameter.
- This method is accessible through the External API, making it exploitable by authenticated users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Odoo instance with the `pdm` module installed. This could be an internal user or a portal user.
- The attacker needs to be able to send XML-RPC requests to the Odoo API.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Didotech srl Engineering & Lifecycle Management (aka `pdm`) versions 14.0, 15.0, and 16.0.
- Patches have been released in versions pdm-14.0.1.0.0, pdm-15.0.1.0.0, and pdm-16.0.1.0.0
- The vulnerable component is `models/base_client.py:pml_config_settings::getQueryRes(tmp_file, select)`.
- The provided code contains a demonstration of how to exploit the vulnerability to change an admin password.
- The PoC can be triggered with an XML-RPC call such as `models.execute_kw(db, uid, password, 'plm.config.settings', 'getQueryRes', ['plm.config.settings', 'test', "SELECT * FROM res_users) TO '/dev/null'; UPDATE res_users SET password='whatever' WHERE login='admin'; -- "])`
