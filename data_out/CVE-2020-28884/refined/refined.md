Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in the lack of sufficient input validation and security checks within the Liferay Portal's Script Console and Gogo Shell modules. These modules allow administrators to execute arbitrary code, which can be exploited to run OS commands if proper restrictions are not in place. Specifically, the Groovy script execution functionality does not adequately prevent command injection, and the Gogo Shell allows execution of arbitrary commands outside of its defined scope.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The Groovy Script engine allows execution of arbitrary OS commands through the `execute()` method. This is achieved by crafting a script that uses this method, allowing execution of arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Unrestricted Gogo Shell Commands:** The Gogo Shell module does not properly restrict the commands that can be executed, allowing for OS command execution.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Both the Script Console and Gogo Shell fail to sanitize or validate user-supplied input, leading to the possibility of executing dangerous commands.
*   **Missing Permission Enforcement:** The document mentions that "Permissions checking is not enforced for local services" within the Script Console. This implies that even though the system is designed to be used by administrators, the Script Console does not limit access to potentially dangerous functionalities.
*   **Default Credentials:** The article also mentions an unrelated vulnerability of default credentials which allows to get admin access in the first place.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of either vulnerability results in the ability to execute arbitrary OS commands on the Liferay Portal server.
*   **System Compromise:** RCE can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Loss:** An attacker can gain control over the server and manipulate sensitive data, potentially causing significant business disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Script Console:** An authenticated administrator with access to the Script Console can inject malicious Groovy scripts to execute OS commands.
*  **Gogo Shell:** An authenticated administrator can use the Gogo Shell module to execute arbitrary commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges within the Liferay Portal to access and utilize the Script Console or Gogo Shell modules. This can be achieved through the default admin account or other means.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Liferay Portal instance to send the malicious scripts/commands to the server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided medium.com article describes the vulnerability in more detail than the official documentation.
*   The article mentions the vulnerability was tested on Liferay Portal CE 7.3.5 GA6 and Liferay Portal CE 7.2.0 GA1.
*   The article provides specific Groovy script code and Gogo Shell command examples to reproduce the vulnerability.
