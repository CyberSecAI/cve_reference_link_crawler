- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could inject malicious scripts (such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads) into the website, which would then be executed when other users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors:**  A malicious actor injects the malicious script through user input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide input that will be processed by the vulnerable plugin. The specific mechanism (e.g., form submission, URL parameter) is not detailed. The attacker must also be at least a contributor to the wordpress site.
