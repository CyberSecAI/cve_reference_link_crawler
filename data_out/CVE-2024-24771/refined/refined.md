Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-24771:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a misconfiguration in the Open Forms application's authentication process, specifically related to multi-factor authentication (MFA).
*   There was an additional login page at `/api/v2/api-authlogin/` which was not protected by MFA, and was intended to be used only when `settings.DEBUG = True`. However, it was misconfigured and could not be used for login.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **MFA Bypass (Potential):** Although the primary login at `/admin/login/` correctly enforces MFA, a misconfigured secondary login at `/api/v2/api-authlogin/` could have potentially been used to bypass MFA if it had been functional.
*   **Incorrect Permission Check**: The user hijacking flow did not properly check if the user had completed second-factor verification.
*   **Unrestricted API Endpoint:** The API authentication endpoints were available regardless of the debug settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** If an attacker successfully bypassed MFA for a superuser account, they could potentially view sensitive submission data.
*   **Account Impersonation:** The attacker could impersonate other staff accounts, gaining the ability to view and/or modify data.
*   **System Compromise:** Although not stated explicitly, the ability to modify data could lead to broader system compromise and disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Credentials:** The primary attack vector relies on the attacker having already compromised the username and password of a superuser account.
*   **Exploiting Misconfigured API Endpoint (Hypothetical):** If the misconfigured `/api/v2/api-authlogin/` endpoint was functioning, an attacker could potentially use it to bypass MFA after having compromised user credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Superuser Credentials:** The attacker must possess the valid username and password of a superuser account.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Open Forms application, as no local access or direct exploitation of the server seems to be described.
* **Ability to Hijack User Account**: The attacker must have the ability to perform user hijacking flow.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability is considered **low severity** due to the unlikelihood of exploitation.
* Patches have been applied by:
    * Moving API auth endpoints to only be enabled with `settings.DEBUG = True`
    * Applying a custom permission check to the hijack flow to only allow second-factor-verified superusers to perform user hijacking.
* Patched versions are 2.2.9, 2.3.7, 2.4.5 and 2.5.2.
* Older versions are end of life and do not receive (security) updates anymore.

**Relevant CWEs:**

*   CWE-284: Improper Access Control
*   CWE-287: Improper Authentication
*   CWE-654: Reliance on a Security-Relevant API or Policy Without an Effective Boundary
