Subject: Re: ISC has disclosed four vulnerabilities in BIND 9
 (CVE-2024-0760, CVE-2024-1737, CVE-2024-1975, CVE-2024-4076)

Note to anyone running 9.18 series (which means at least all Debian 12
installations) that the "fix" for this CVE in that branch is the complete
removal of SIG(0) dynamic DNS update support. Not just a disabled-by-default
config option, but the actual removal of the relevant code.

The actual mitigation for the issue is only available in the 9.20 series.

IMO this seems like a rather drastic way of doing things for a 0.0.1 patch
release to a purportedly stable branch. Anyway reverting
<https://github.com/isc-projects/bind9/commit/bef3d2cca3552100bbe44790c8c1a4f5bef06798>
restores SIG(0) support (along with the vulnerability) for those who prefer to
live dangerously.

Subject: ISC has disclosed four vulnerabilities in BIND 9 (CVE-2024-0760,
 CVE-2024-1737, CVE-2024-1975, CVE-2024-4076)

On 23 July 2024 we (Internet Systems Consortium) disclosed four vulnerabilities affecting our BIND 9 software:

- CVE-2024-0760:        A flood of DNS messages over TCP may make the server unstable <https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2024-0760>
- CVE-2024-1737:        BIND's database will be slow if a very large number of RRs exist at the same name <https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2024-1737>
- CVE-2024-1975:        SIG(0) can be used to exhaust CPU resources <https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2024-1975>
- CVE-2024-4076:        Assertion failure when serving both stale cache data and authoritative zone content <https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2024-4076>

New versions of BIND 9 are available from <https://www.isc.org/downloads>

Operators and package maintainers who prefer to apply patches selectively can find individual vulnerability-specific patches in the "patches" subdirectory of each published release directory:

- <https://downloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.18.28/patches/>

With the public announcement of these vulnerabilities, the embargo period is ended and any updated software packages that have been prepared may be released.
