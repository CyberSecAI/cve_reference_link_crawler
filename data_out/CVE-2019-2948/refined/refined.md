        "details": "The vulnerability is present in multiple NetApp products due to the inclusion of vulnerable versions of Oracle MySQL. Specifically, MySQL versions prior to 5.6.45, 5.7.27, and 8.0.17 are affected. Successful exploitation may lead to a denial of service (DoS), including hangs or crashes of the MySQL server. It could also lead to unauthorized takeover of MySQL server or unauthorized read/modification access to server data. The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 4.9, with an attack vector of Network, Low Attack Complexity, Privileges Required of High, and no User Interaction. The vulnerability can be exploited over the network by an attacker that has high privileges."
