The provided content is related to CVE-2021-44402.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper input validation in the `cgiserver.cgi` JSON command parser. Specifically, the code assumes that the "param" JSON element will always be an object, but this is not always the case. When a non-object value (e.g. an empty string) is provided for the param, the code attempts to access it as an object using the subscription operator, which leads to an assertion failure and process termination.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation: The `cgiserver.cgi` does not properly validate the type of the JSON element provided for the "param" key. It assumes that the "param" value is always an object.
- Denial of Service: The assertion failure caused by invalid JSON input leads to the termination of the `cgiserver.cgi` process and subsequent device reboot.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the camera, resulting in a reboot. This disrupts camera's functionality and availability.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is via sending a malicious HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint. The request includes a JSON body containing a command with an invalid "param" value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the camera's web interface.
- The attacker may need to be authenticated but in some cases it is possible to exploit this vulnerability without authentication by using a separate vulnerability TALOS-2021-1420 to perform these API calls without authentication.

**Specific to CVE-2021-44402:**
The vulnerability occurs when processing the `GetPtzSerial` command. The `param` field is expected to be an object, but if it is set to an empty string, the device will crash, which means, the request's body should be `[{"cmd": "GetPtzSerial","action": 0,"param":  ""}]`.
