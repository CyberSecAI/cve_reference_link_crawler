# http/byte-ranges: missing hashtable random seed leads to potential DoS

High

GHSA-qq5v-qcjx-f872
Oct 16, 2024

## Package

suricata

## Affected versions

< 7.0.7

## Patched versions

7.0.7

## Description

### Impact

Missing initialization of the random seed for "thash" leads to byte-range tracking having predictable hash table behavior. This can lead to an attacker forcing lots of data into a single hash bucket, leading to severe performance degradation.

### Patches

This issue has been addressed in 7.0.7.

### References

<https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/7289>

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
