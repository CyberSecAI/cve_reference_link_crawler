- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper buffer restrictions in the Intel NUC BIOS firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from inadequate buffer handling within the BIOS firmware. Specifically, the firmware fails to properly validate or enforce buffer size limitations, which could lead to a buffer overflow or similar memory corruption issues.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow a privileged user to escalate their privileges on the system. This could lead to a compromise of system integrity and confidentiality. The CVSS score indicates potential for loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is accessible via local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a privileged user on the affected system. The attacker does not need any user interaction for exploitation.
