|  |  | Security fixes |
|  |  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - Fix an XSS vulnerability in various confirmation prompts commonly used when deleting |
|  |  | things. Exploitation requires someone with at least submission privileges (such as a |
|  |  | speaker) and then rely on someone else to attempt to delete this content. However, |
|  |  | considering that event organizers may indeed delete suspicious-looking content when |
|  |  | encountering it, there is a non-negligible risk of such an attack to succeed. Because |
|  |  | of this it is strongly recommended to upgrade as soon as possible (:pr:`5862`, |
|  |  | :cve:`CVE-2023-37901`) |

# Cross-Site-Scripting via confirmation prompts

Moderate

[ThiefMaster](/ThiefMaster)
published
GHSA-fmqq-25x9-c6hm
Jul 20, 2023

## Package

pip

indico
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<3.2.6

## Patched versions

3.2.6

## Description

### Impact

There is a Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability in confirmation prompts commonly used when deleting content from Indico.

Exploitation requires someone with at least submission privileges (such as a speaker) and then someone else to attempt to delete this content.

Considering that event organizers may want to delete suspicious-looking content when spotting it, there is a non-negligible risk of such an attack to succeed. The risk of this could be further increased when combined with some some social engineering pointing the victim towards this content.

### Patches

You need to update to [Indico 3.2.6](https://github.com/indico/indico/releases/tag/v3.2.6) as soon as possible.

See [the docs](https://docs.getindico.io/en/stable/installation/upgrade/) for instructions on how to update.

### Workarounds

Only let trustworthy users manage categories, create events or upload materials ("submission" privileges on a contribution/event). This should already be the case in a properly-configured setup when it comes to category/event management.

Note that a conference doing a Call for Abstracts actively invites external speakers (who the organizers may not know and thus cannot fully trust) to submit content, hence the need to update to a a fixed version ASAP in particular when using such workflows.

# Upgrade[¶](#upgrade "Link to this heading")

It is important to keep your Indico instance up to date to have the
latest bug fixes and features. Upgrading can be done with almost no
user-facing downtime.

Warning

When upgrading a production system it is highly recommended to
create a database backup before starting.

Important

If you are upgrading from Indico v3.2.x or older to v3.3 or newer, make sure to
fully read and understand the [Upgrading from 3.x to 3.3](#upgrade-3-to-33)
guide before starting with any of the upgrade steps below.

## Upgrading between 3.x versions[¶](#upgrading-between-3-x-versions "Link to this heading")

First of all, stop the Celery worker. To do so, run this as *root*:

```
systemctl stop indico-celery.service

```

Now switch to the *indico* user and activate the virtualenv:

```
su - indico
source ~/.venv/bin/activate

```

If you use Alma/Rocky, update your PATH to avoid errors in case the new
Indico version needs to install an updated version of the PostgreSQL client
library (psycopg2). If you use a different Postgres version, you need to
adapt the command accordingly:

```
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/pgsql-16/bin"

```

You are now ready to install the latest version of Indico:

Hint

Are you upgrading from Indico v3.2.x or older to v3.3 or newer? Then you have
to jump to the [Upgrading from 3.x to 3.3](#upgrade-3-to-33) guide now!

```
pip install -U indico

```

If you installed the official plugins, update them too:

```
pip install -U indico-plugins

```

It is a good idea to ensure you are using the latest recommended Python version:

```
indico setup upgrade-python

```

Some versions may include database schema upgrades. Make sure to
perform them immediately after upgrading. If there are no schema
changes, the command will simply do nothing.

```
indico db upgrade
indico db --all-plugins upgrade

```

Note

Some database structure changes require an *exclusive lock* on
some tables in the database. Unless you have very high activity
on your instance, this lock can be acquired quickly, but if the
upgrade command seems to hang for more than a few seconds, you can
restart uWSGI by running `systemctl restart uwsgi.service` as
*root* (in a separate shell, i.e. don’t abort the upgrade command!)
which will ensure nothing is accessing Indico for a moment.

Unless you just restarted uWSGI, it is now time to reload it so the new
version is actually used:

```
touch ~/web/indico.wsgi

```

Also start the Celery worker again (once again, as *root*):

```
systemctl start indico-celery.service

```

## Upgrading from 3.x to 3.3[¶](#upgrading-from-3-x-to-3-3 "Link to this heading")

When updating to Indico v3.3 you need to perform some extra steps since the required Python
version has been raised from Python 3.9 to Python 3.12.

Attention

If you are still using **CentOS 7** (or 8), you are required to **update your operating
system** to version **9** - your system is not only too old, but also going end-of-life
in the middle of 2024. Since CentOS no longer exists in its original form, we recommend
using **AlmaLinux 9** or **Rocky Linux 9**. You can find guides on the internet on how
to do such an upgrade in-place (we never tried this!), but it is almost certainly easier
to just use a new VM and migrate your Indico installations to that one.

If you are using an older **Debian** (Buster or Bullseye) or **Ubuntu** (Focal) release,
switching to the latest one is also highly recommended - we no longer test on older releases,
and things may be broken. Upgrading in-place is possible, but our same advice applies here:
We never tried this and cannot help you with it; migrating to a new VM is almost certainly
the easier and safer option.

Please also read the [2.x to 3.x](#upgrade-2-to-3) guide below which explains how to
migrate your Indico data to a new system.

The general [upgrade guide between 3.x versions](#upgrade-3-to-3) above still applies,
you just need to perform some additional steps. Anything below assumes you are on a supported
Linux distribution (or know exactly what you’re doing).

Before the [Indico upgrade step](#upgrade-3-to-3-indico) (`pip install -U indico`),
you need to install the required Python version:

```
indico setup upgrade-python --force-version 3.12

```

Confirm both the warning about the requested version not being within the spec (which is based
on the previous Indico version) and the warning about having to re-install packages with `Y`.

Now you just need to install the *setuptools* package and then continue with installing the
new Indico version and updating the symlink for the static assets:

```
pip install setuptools
pip install -U indico
indico setup create-symlinks ~/web/

```

You can now resume the regular upgrade guide [right after the](#upgrade-3-to-3-plugins)
`pip install -U indico` step.

## Upgrading from 2.x to 3.x[¶](#upgrading-from-2-x-to-3-x "Link to this heading")

The upgrade from 2.x to 3.x is a major change since Indico now requires
Python 3. We also strongly recommend upgrading your database to PostgreSQL 16
or newer (PostgreSQL 13 is the minimum required version we still test with).

Note

As of Indico 3.2, the upgrade **will fail** on Postgres 10 and older.

Warning

If you are using any custom plugins they will most likely no longer work and
need to be updated. Contact the developers of these plugins to see whether they
already have a version compatible with Python 3 and Indico 3.

Due to the significant changes in the environment, we recommend using a **freshly
installed server/VM** with the latest long-term-supported version of your preferred
Linux distribution.

Note

In case you are using CentOS 7, please note that CentOS 7 is soon reaching its
end-of-life date (mid 2024), and Indico v3.3 is no longer compatible with this
very old distribution. Please use Alma/Rocky 9, or the latest Debian/Ubuntu LTS
release instead.

When following the [production installation guide](../production/#install-prod), there
are a few places where you need to do something differently:

* Instead of running `indico db prepare`, restore a dump of your old Postgres
  database
* You still need to run `indico setup wizard` to create some of the directories,
  but compare the generated config file with your old one and update any settings
  you may have changed manually (e.g. for LDAP or SSO authentication)
* You need to perform the database structure upgrades just like during any other
  Indico upgrade: `indico db upgrade` and `indico db --all-plugins upgrade`
* Copy the contents of the `/opt/indico/archive` folder from your old instance and
  ensure owner, group and permissions are correct. This step is critical as this folder
  contains all the files uploaded to Indico

If you need any help with the upgrade or encounter any issues, please open a thread
in [our forum](https://talk.getindico.io/).

### Upgrading from 2.x to 3.x in-place[¶](#upgrading-from-2-x-to-3-x-in-place "Link to this heading")

Warning

If you are not experienced with Linux system administration, we highly recommend
you to either ask someone from your IT department for assistance and/or follow our
recommendation of using a new server/VM to install Indico v3.

In case you prefer to perform the upgrade in place on your existing server, you will
need to compare the installation guides of 2.3 and 3.x and apply the differences
manually. This should be fairly easy for someone with Linux system administration
experience, but here are some important points:

* Create a backup of both your Postgres database and `/opt/indico/archive`
* Stop, disable and and uninstall uWSGI and delete the old config file. To support
  the latest Python version uWSGI is now installed into the Indico virtual environment
  using `pip`
* Delete the `~/.venv` folder of the Indico user and recreate it using the commands
  from the setup guide
* Make sure to update your webserver config to use the more modern TLS defaults

# ⚠️ Security fixes

* Fix an XSS vulnerability in various confirmation prompts commonly used when deleting things. Exploitation requires someone with at least submission privileges (such as a speaker) and then rely on someone else to attempt to delete this content. However, considering that event organizers may indeed delete suspicious-looking content when encountering it, there is a non-negligible risk of such an attack to succeed. Because of this it is strongly recommended to upgrade as soon as possible ([#5862](https://github.com/indico/indico/pull/5862), [CVE-2023-37901](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fmqq-25x9-c6hm "CVE-2023-37901"), [GHSA-fmqq-25x9-c6hm](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fmqq-25x9-c6hm "GHSA-fmqq-25x9-c6hm"))

* Add option to add "event cancelled" semantics for event labels, which will disable reminders for events having this label ([#5285](https://github.com/indico/indico/issues/5285), [#5861](https://github.com/indico/indico/pull/5861))
