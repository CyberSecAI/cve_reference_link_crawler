# Cross-Site-Scripting via confirmation prompts

Moderate

[ThiefMaster](/ThiefMaster)
published
GHSA-fmqq-25x9-c6hm
Jul 20, 2023

## Package

pip

indico
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<3.2.6

## Patched versions

3.2.6

## Description

### Impact

There is a Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability in confirmation prompts commonly used when deleting content from Indico.

Exploitation requires someone with at least submission privileges (such as a speaker) and then someone else to attempt to delete this content.

Considering that event organizers may want to delete suspicious-looking content when spotting it, there is a non-negligible risk of such an attack to succeed. The risk of this could be further increased when combined with some some social engineering pointing the victim towards this content.

### Patches

You need to update to [Indico 3.2.6](https://github.com/indico/indico/releases/tag/v3.2.6) as soon as possible.

See [the docs](https://docs.getindico.io/en/stable/installation/upgrade/) for instructions on how to update.

### Workarounds

Only let trustworthy users manage categories, create events or upload materials ("submission" privileges on a contribution/event). This should already be the case in a properly-configured setup when it comes to category/event management.

Note that a conference doing a Call for Abstracts actively invites external speakers (who the organizers may not know and thus cannot fully trust) to submit content, hence the need to update to a a fixed version ASAP in particular when using such workflows.
