|  |  | Security fixes |
|  |  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - Fix an XSS vulnerability in various confirmation prompts commonly used when deleting |
|  |  | things. Exploitation requires someone with at least submission privileges (such as a |
|  |  | speaker) and then rely on someone else to attempt to delete this content. However, |
|  |  | considering that event organizers may indeed delete suspicious-looking content when |
|  |  | encountering it, there is a non-negligible risk of such an attack to succeed. Because |
|  |  | of this it is strongly recommended to upgrade as soon as possible (:pr:`5862`, |
|  |  | :cve:`CVE-2023-37901`) |
