# ‚ö†Ô∏è Security fixes

* Fix an XSS vulnerability in various confirmation prompts commonly used when deleting things. Exploitation requires someone with at least submission privileges (such as a speaker) and then rely on someone else to attempt to delete this content. However, considering that event organizers may indeed delete suspicious-looking content when encountering it, there is a non-negligible risk of such an attack to succeed. Because of this it is strongly recommended to upgrade as soon as possible ([#5862](https://github.com/indico/indico/pull/5862), [CVE-2023-37901](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fmqq-25x9-c6hm "CVE-2023-37901"), [GHSA-fmqq-25x9-c6hm](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fmqq-25x9-c6hm "GHSA-fmqq-25x9-c6hm"))

# üéè Internationalization

* Add button to adapt columns widths on the reviewing area's abstracts list ([#5837](https://github.com/indico/indico/pull/5837))
* Allow cloning category-level badge/poster templates into another category ([#5775](https://github.com/indico/indico/pull/5775), thanks [@SegiNyn](https://github.com/SegiNyn))
* Allow using a custom link text in the `{event_link}` email placeholder, using the `{event_link:something-else-here}` syntax ([#5858](https://github.com/indico/indico/issues/5858), [#5860](https://github.com/indico/indico/pull/5860))
* Add option to add "event cancelled" semantics for event labels, which will disable reminders for events having this label ([#5285](https://github.com/indico/indico/issues/5285), [#5861](https://github.com/indico/indico/pull/5861))

# üêõ Bugfixes
