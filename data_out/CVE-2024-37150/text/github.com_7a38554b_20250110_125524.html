## Overview

This wiki contains a number of documents related to the processes, practices & overall operations of **npm**'s [**Community & Open Source** team](https://github.com/orgs/npm/teams/cli-team) (formerly known as & aliased as `@cli-team`).

## Documentation

The documentation for the current stable release of npm is available at: **[docs.npmjs.com](https://docs.npmjs.com/)**

The manual pages for npm itself are on the above site, but they can also be found in the [the docs folder](http://github.com/npm/cli/tree/master/doc/) in the npm repo. These get updated when their associated features get updated.

Start with [npm help npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) or [npm help install](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install).
