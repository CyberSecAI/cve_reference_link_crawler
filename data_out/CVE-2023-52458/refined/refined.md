Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-52458:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the Linux kernel's block layer regarding partition length alignment with the logical block size of the disk. Specifically, when adding or resizing a partition using the `BLKPG_ADD_PARTITION` or `BLKPG_RESIZE_PARTITION` ioctl, the kernel did not ensure the provided length was a multiple of the disk's logical block size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Input Validation:** The primary weakness was the lack of validation of the partition length against the logical block size. This allowed userspace to create partitions with lengths not aligned with the block size.
- **Potential I/O Error:** When a read operation is performed on the last sector of a misaligned partition, `bio_truncate()` adjusts the bio size. If the size of the read command is smaller than the logical block size, it results in an I/O error.
- **Potential Null Pointer Dereference:** If integrity data is supported, a null pointer dereference could occur when calling `bio_integrity_free`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **I/O Errors:** A primary impact of the vulnerability is I/O errors when accessing misaligned partitions. This can lead to data corruption or denial of service.
- **Potential Kernel Panic/Crash:** The possibility of a null pointer dereference when integrity data is supported could lead to a kernel panic or crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `BLKPG_ADD_PARTITION` and `BLKPG_RESIZE_PARTITION` ioctl calls on block devices.
- A user with `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capabilities can trigger the vulnerability by creating or resizing partitions with lengths not aligned to the logical block size.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability, which usually implies root or administrative privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with block devices to trigger the vulnerable ioctl calls.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided patches implement checks to validate that partition start and length are aligned to the block size, preventing the issues.
- The patches also include a check to ensure that p.start, p.length, and p.start + p.length are not negative, which is another vulnerability fix.
- The vulnerability is described in multiple commits across different kernel versions, but the fixes are essentially the same alignment check.
