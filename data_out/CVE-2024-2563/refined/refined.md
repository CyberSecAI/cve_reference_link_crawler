The provided content is related to CVE-2024-2563.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the file deletion functionality. The `fileName` parameter, passed via a query parameter, is directly used in constructing the path for file deletion without proper sanitization or checks, allowing path traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization of the `fileName` parameter which allows an attacker to provide a relative path to access and delete files outside the intended directory by using `../` sequences.
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The application uses the provided file name directly in the `os.Remove()` function, which can lead to the deletion of any file the application has permissions to, anywhere on the filesystem.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to data loss, system instability, or denial of service by removing critical files.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is via HTTP DELETE requests to the `/upload/delete` endpoint.
- The vulnerable parameter is `fileName`, passed as a query parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker needs to have some knowledge of the file system structure to construct the file path traversal string.
- The attacker needs to have a valid token `X-TOKEN` to authenticate and authorize the request.
