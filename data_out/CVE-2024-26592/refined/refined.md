{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in ksmbd_tcp_new_connection() between handling a new TCP connection and its disconnection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free (UAF)"
    ],
    "impact": "The race condition leads to a UAF on the `struct tcp_transport` object within the `ksmbd_tcp_new_connection()` function.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a race condition when establishing and tearing down TCP connections.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to establish and close TCP connections to the ksmbd server in a way that triggers the race condition."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The fix removes the `handler` field from the `ksmbd_transport` structure. Instead, the kthread is stored locally in the transport creation function. The return value of kthread_run is checked and the transport structure freed if there is an error creating the handler thread."
