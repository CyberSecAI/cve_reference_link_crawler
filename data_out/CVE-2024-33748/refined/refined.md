Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the XSS vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is improper handling of user input within the `XssHttpServletRequestWrapper.clean` method. This method processes input parameters before they reach the servlet, and if it encounters an issue, it directly returns exception information which contains unsanitized user-provided data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application echoes unsanitized user input back to the user's browser, enabling the execution of malicious scripts.
*   **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The `XssHttpServletRequestWrapper.clean` method lacks proper input sanitization or encoding, leading to the vulnerability. Instead of handling potentially harmful characters, the method's error handling directly exposes them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable web application.
*   **Data Theft:** An attacker can steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information by injecting malicious code.
*   **User Manipulation:** An attacker can potentially redirect users to malicious sites, deface the web page, or perform actions on behalf of the user, compromising the user's account and potentially gaining access to other resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Search Function:** The vulnerability exists in the search functionality of the application. The attacker injects malicious code into the search query.
*   **Error Messages:** The vulnerability is triggered when the server returns an error related to the input, revealing the unsanitized input within the error message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a specific search query containing malicious JavaScript code.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user to interact with the application (e.g. by performing the malicious search) to trigger the XSS vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in `ms basic <= 2.1.13.4`.
*   The application returns error messages containing `${code}` and `${msg}`. These placeholders are where the unsanitized input gets reflected.
*   The error is thrown by `XssHttpServletRequestWrapper.clean`.
*   The `XssHttpServletRequestWrapper` processes the input before it reaches the Servlet, which makes it susceptible to this vulnerability if not handled properly.
