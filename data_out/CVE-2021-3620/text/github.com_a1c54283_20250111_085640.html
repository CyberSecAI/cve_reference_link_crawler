```
Under certain conditions, sensitive connection parameters are shown in tracebacks when Ansible receives an unexpected response (in my case `None`) from `set_options` in ansible-connection. This patch creates a list of sensitive connection parameter names from `ansible.constants`, pulls a list of those values in the `params` that are about to be dumped to the screen and log file, and sends the `params` and list of `sensitive_values` to the `module_utils.common.parameters.remove_values` function for processing to hide them before being exposed.
