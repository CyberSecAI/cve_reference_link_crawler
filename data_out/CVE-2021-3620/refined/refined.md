  "cve": "CVE-2021-3620",
  "description": "A flaw was found in Ansible Engine's ansible-connection module, where sensitive information such as the Ansible user credentials is disclosed by default in the traceback error message. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Sensitive connection parameters are shown in tracebacks when Ansible receives an unexpected response from `set_options` in `ansible-connection`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Sensitive information such as user credentials being included in traceback error messages",
      "Lack of proper handling of sensitive data before being displayed or logged."
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of sensitive information, specifically Ansible user credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access or further compromise.",
     "attack_vectors": "An attacker could potentially trigger an error condition in the Ansible connection process, causing a traceback to be generated and logged. If the attacker has access to these logs, they could extract the exposed credentials." ,
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs access to the Ansible logs, which may be on the controller node, or on a managed node if the logs were written there. The attacker also has to trigger an error during the connection process."
  },
    "fixes": [
    "The issue was addressed by sanitizing the parameters before they are included in error messages and logs. The fix involves identifying sensitive parameters from `ansible.constants` and removing these values before they are logged or displayed in tracebacks. Specifically, the `module_utils.common.parameters.remove_values` function is used to hide sensitive parameters.",
    "Fixed in Ansible Engine 2.9.27"
