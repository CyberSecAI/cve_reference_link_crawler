- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `downfile.cgi` script in Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD routers uses `sprintf` to construct a file path without checking the size of the input `_filename` parameter, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A classic stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-120) due to the usage of `sprintf` without bounds checking.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain control of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/downfile.cgi` endpoint with an overly long `_filename` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device and have valid authentication credentials for the router's web interface.
