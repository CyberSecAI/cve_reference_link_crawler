Executive summary

•

In the second study of Project Memoria, Forescout
Research Labs discloses NUMBER:JACK, a set of 9
new vulnerabilities affecting embedded TCP/IP stacks.

•  The vulnerabilities are all related to the same problem:
weak Initial Sequence Number (ISN) generation, which
can be used to hijack or spoof TCP connections.
Ultimately, attackers may be able to leverage those
vulnerabilities to close ongoing connections, causing
limited denials of service, to inject malicious data on a
device or to bypass authentication.

•  Although NUMBER:JACK vulnerabilities are not as

critical as those of AMNESIA:33, they are even more
prevalent, affecting 9 of 11 stacks analyzed. This study
shows one more instance of historical vulnerabilities
considered eradicated in the IT world affecting large
numbers of IoT and OT devices.

•  Recommended mitigations include using encrypted
connections (for instance with IPsec), limiting the
network exposure of critical vulnerable devices, and
patching whenever device vendors release advisories.

1. Introduction

In 2020 Forescout Research Labs started Project
Memoria, an initiative that seeks to provide the
cybersecurity community with the largest study on
the security of TCP/IP stacks. The first outcome of the
project was AMNESIA:33 – a set of 33 vulnerabilities
affecting 4 open source TCP/IP stacks.

The AMNESIA:33 technical report discussed how
implementation flaws that have been well-known for
decades have resurfaced as vulnerabilities that affect
millions of IoT, OT and IT devices. While AMNESIA:33
was primarily focused on memory corruption bugs,
NUMBER:JACK focuses on a fundamental aspect of
TCP communication: Initial Sequence Number (ISN)
generation.

ISNs ensure that every TCP connection between two
devices is unique and that there are no collisions,
preventing third parties from interfering with an ongoing
connection. To guarantee these properties, ISNs must
be randomly generated so that an attacker cannot guess
an ISN and hijack an ongoing connection or spoof a new
one. As discussed below, in many of the TCP/IP stacks
that Forescout analyzed, ISNs are improperly generated,
thereby leaving TCP connections of a device open to
attacks.

2. New vulnerabilities found

In this second study of Project Memoria, Forescout
researchers analyzed 11 TCP/IP stacks: 7 are the
open source embedded TCP/IP stacks analyzed
in AMNESIA:33 (uIP, FNET, picoTCP, Nut/Net, lwIP,
cycloneTCP and uC/TCP-IP), while the remaining 4 are
Microchip’s MPLAB Net, Texas Instruments’ NDKTCPIP,
ARM’s Nanostack and Siemens’ Nucleus NET. Forescout
found vulnerabilities in 9 of the 11 analyzed stacks. Table
1 details our findings.

FORESCOUT RESEARCH LABSRESEARCH REPORT  |  NUMBER: JACK  |  New vulnerabilities found

These vulnerabilities were discovered and disclosed
to the vendors and maintainers of the affected TCP/IP
stacks in October 2020. While most vendors have
already issued patches and/or mitigation
recommendations to their users (shown in the Fix
column of Table 1), the developers of Nut/Net are still
working on a solution, and Forescout has not received
a response from the uIP developers.

The vulnerabilities found (except CVE-2020-28388)
have a common CVSSv3 score and vector of 7.5 and
AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N, respectively.
Siemens has assigned to CVE-2020-28388 a score of 6.5
with the vector AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L.
However, the actual severity on a particular device and
TCP connection may vary depending on, for example,
the use of encrypted sessions and the sensitivity of
data exchanged. The impact of these vulnerabilities is
discussed in the next section, and comments about
the stacks that were not found vulnerable (lwIP and
Nanostack) are in Section 5.4.

3. Impact

There are two basic ways to exploit a weak TCP ISN.

1.  By predicting the ISN of an existing TCP connection,
attackers can close it, thus achieving a Denial-of-
Service. Or, they can hijack it, thus injecting data
into a session. Data can be injected on sensitive
unencrypted traffic, such as Telnet sessions (to inject
commands), FTP file downloads (to serve malware)
or HTTP responses (to direct the victim to a malicious
page).

2.  By targeting new TCP connections, attackers may
successfully complete a three-way handshake
and spoof network packets intended for the victim
endpoint or bypass address-based authentication and
access control [1] [2] [3].

Although this type of vulnerability has been used
historically to break into general-purpose computers
(notoriously by Kevin Mitnick, which led it to be known
as the “Mitnick attack”), the stacks Forescout researched
are primarily used in embedded devices.

The popularity and some use cases of the vulnerable
stacks uIP, FNET, picoTCP and Nut/Net were discussed in
the AMNESIA:33 report. That report showed that these
stacks are used by millions of devices of several different
types, from IT file servers to IoT embedded components.

As for the new vulnerable stacks, Forescout believes
that CycloneTCP, uC/TCP-IP, NDKTCPIP, MPLAB Net and
Nucleus NET are no less popular than the previous ones.
For example, according to the 2019 Embedded Markets
Study [4], the Texas Instruments RTOS (which may
be used with NDKTCPIP) is used by 6% of embedded
projects, while Micrium’s uC/OS-II or uC/OS-III (which
may be used with uC/TCP-IP) are used by 7%. The
website of Nucleus RTOS mentions that it is deployed in
more than 3 billion devices. In all three cases, assuming
a sizeable chunk of these projects utilizes TCP/IP
connectivity, this certainly translates into other millions
of devices running this software.

In this research, Forescout has not tried to identify
affected devices or device manufacturers. Still, there
are several notable public use cases of some of the
stacks, such as medical devices, wind turbine monitoring
systems, remote terminal units (RTUs) and IT storage
systems.

4. Recommendations for
network operators

As is always the case with vulnerabilities affecting TCP/
IP stacks (such as AMNESIA:33 and Ripple20), identifying
and patching devices running the vulnerable stacks
is at the same time the best mitigation and the most
challenging one. This process is challenging because it is
often unknown which devices run a particular stack and

5

FORESCOUT RESEARCH LABSRESEARCH REPORT  |  NUMBER: JACK  |  Recommendations for network operators

because embedded devices are notoriously difficult to
manage and update, often being part of mission-critical
infrastructure.

next section). Therefore, Forescout recommends that
network operators focus on the preventive measures
described above.

For the reasons above, we recommend the following
mitigation strategy.

5. Technical dive-in

5.1. TCP connections and ISN generation

TCP is a connection-oriented networking protocol that
allows two endpoints to exchange data [5]. TCP is one
of the protocols used in the TCP/IP Transport Layer, and
it aims for ordered and error-checked delivery of data
between network endpoints.

The protocol relies on sequence numbers that are
transmitted with every packet over a TCP connection.
Since every transmitted byte is sequenced, each of them
can be accounted for during reception. A TCP connection
is uniquely defined by a pair of network sockets – a
combination of a network address and a network port.
Since there is a finite number of ports in an endpoint, new
connections may reuse the sockets utilized by already-
terminated connections, which becomes problematic if
connections are open and closed in quick succession.
The initial sequence number (ISN) mechanism [5] was
introduced to prevent connection collisions when sockets
are reused.

•  Discover and inventory devices that run a vulnerable
TCP/IP stack. Although it is challenging to identify the
TCP/IP stack running on a device, there are tools to
help. Forescout Research Labs has released an open
source script that uses active fingerprinting to detect
which stack a target device is running. The script is
updated constantly with new signatures. Besides
that, Nmap allows the  collection of ISN metrics and
performs statistical analyses to understand whether a
target device suffers from weak ISN generation.

•  Patch when possible. Monitor progressive patches
released by affected device vendors and devise a
remediation plan for your vulnerable asset inventory
balancing business risk and business continuity
requirements.

•  Segment to mitigate risk. For vulnerable IoT and OT
devices, use segmentation to minimize their network
exposure and the likelihood of compromise without
impacting mission-critical functions or business
operations. Segmentation and zoning also limit the
blast radius and business impact if a vulnerable
device becomes compromised.

•  Deploy IPsec. End-to-end cryptographic solutions
built on top of the Network layer (IPsec) do not
require any modifications to a TCP/IP stack in use
while allowing to defend against TCP spoofing and
connection reset attacks [1]. Unfortunately, this
comes at the cost of network bandwidth.

Monitoring the network to detect attempts to exploit
weak ISN generation vulnerabilities is impractical. These
vulnerabilities are related to cryptographic weaknesses,
so there is no obviously malicious packet to exploit them
(details of what an exploit looks like are shown in the

6

FORESCOUT RESEARCH LABSRESEARCH REPORT  |  NUMBER: JACK  |  Technical dive-in

An ISN generator is used at each endpoint to select a
32-bit sequence number that is supposed to be
unique for every connection so that both endpoints
can synchronize by exchanging their ISNs. The ISN
synchronization occurs at the beginning of a connection
with the three-way handshake mechanism [5] (illustrated
in Figure 1): a Client sends a SYN packet with its unique
ISNClient, the Server acknowledges its reception and
provides its own ISNServer within a SYN-ACK packet and
the Client acknowledges the reception of ISNServer with
an ACK packet. These three steps establish a TCP
connection, allowing endpoints to exchange data.

5.2. ISN generation vulnerability

The original TCP design document [5] mentions that the
32-bit counter in an ISN generator should be incremented
every 4 microseconds with the intention of being random,
thus preventing accidental connection collisions.

However, this does not prevent attackers from deliberately
forcing collisions to their advantage. As early as 1985,
Morris [6] showed that ISNs can be easily guessed
by attackers (because the ISN generator increments
are constant), allowing them to disrupt or hijack TCP
connections. TCP connection hijacking facilitates
the execution of other kinds of attacks, such as
unauthenticated access and Denial-of-Service, but this
depends on the use of IP-based authentication
protocols [1].

Figure 2 – ISN attack illustration

This attack [6] is illustrated in Figure 2. Attacker
impersonates a legitimate Client (see [2]) and opens
a connection to a Server (with a deterministic ISN
generator). Server, thinking that the SYN packet is
coming from Client, sends a SYN-ACK packet to Client,
which includes ISNServer. Attacker cannot see the SYN-
ACK packet sent to Client. However, if Attacker can guess
the value of ISNServer, they can still send an ACK packet
back to Server with the guessed ISNServer and complete
the three-way handshake. In this way, the Server will think
it has a legitimate connection with Client, when in fact it
will be communicating with Attacker.

While the best possible solution to prevent this issue is
strong cryptographic authentication [1, 2, 3], it may not be
feasible for all networking scenarios. Therefore,
RFC1948 [2] (updated by RFC6528 [3] after 16 years of
its initial release) has proposed to compute the ISN as
follows:

ISN = M + F (localip, localport, remoteip, remoteport, secretkey)

where M is the 4 microsecond timer, and F() is a pseudo-
random function of the connection id (defined by the tuple
<localip, localport, remoteip, remoteport>) and some secret
data secretkey. RFC6528 [3] requires that neither F() nor
secretkey are computable from the outside, otherwise
attackers can still guess arbitrary ISNs by observing

7

FORESCOUT RESEARCH LABSRESEARCH REPORT  |  NUMBER: JACK  |  Technical dive-in

enough ISNs from other connections. It is important to
note that the aforementioned attack is possible because
of a flaw in the original TCP design (RFC0793 [5]), and it
is the responsibility of the developers who implement a
TCP/IP stack for their device/platform to ensure that a
proper protection mechanism is put in place.

5.3. Historical vulnerabilities

The vulnerability described above was known as early
as 1985 [6], but the first exploitation attempts were
demonstrated only about 10 years later [7]. The first
publicly known vulnerability reports (as found in the
National Vulnerability Database) followed only from
1999 until 2001, affecting several individual operating
systems (namely Windows NT 4.0, FreeBSD, Cisco IOS,
WindowsCE and Livingston ComOS). It is difficult to
distill the real root cause from the vulnerability
descriptions, although the most likely root cause
was non-compliance with RFC1948 [2].

Later in 2001, the CERT released a large vulnerability
advisory [1] warning that even if RFC1948 [2] is followed,
the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used in
the ISN generator may rely on a known weak algorithm,
and it would be practical for attackers to predict its
outputs, as if constant increments to the ISN number
are being used. The corresponding vulnerability
(CVE-2001-0328) has been reported to affect many
vendors and projects: Cisco, Sun, IBM, HP, SGI, Fujitsu,
FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Linux. The root cause was that
all the affected parties relied on the same weak PRNG
algorithm.

These publications surmise that there are essentially
two possible root causes of weak ISN generation
vulnerability: (1) the RFC documents detailing the
countermeasures are being ignored; or (2) a known weak
or flawed PRNG is used when attempting to randomize
the ISN generator output.

From 2001 until 2019, there were 15 more weak ISN
generation vulnerabilities mostly reported for individual

devices, such as network switches, gateways and
smartphones. The vulnerability descriptions suggest that
some of the affected vendors could be non-compliant
with the RFCs (i.e., no PRNG has been used for ISN
generation whatsoever), which is very surprising given
that RFC1498 has been around for at least 16 years.
While this is still only Forescout’s hypothesis (based on
vulnerability descriptions alone), next section shows that
this still happens in 2021.

Out of these historical vulnerabilities, it is worth to single
out CVE-2014-7284 found in the Linux Kernel. This
vulnerability is more foundational than the rest. The
PRNG seeding mechanism used by the ISN generator
(and potentially other consumer APIs outside the
Linux Kernel) was found to be flawed. In 2020, Klein [8]
released a report arguing that the PRNG in the Linux
Kernel is weak and can be used to facilitate various
cross-layer attacks against its TCP/IP protocol suite,
such as DNS cache poisoning and UDP port prediction.
While the author does not mention the ISN flaw, it might
be among possible attacks.

5.4. New vulnerabilities and non-
vulnerable stacks

As shown in Table 1, the root causes for the newly found
vulnerabilities are conceptually very similar to the root
causes of the historical vulnerabilities discussed above.
For example, 5 of the stacks seem to ignore RFC1948
[2] /RFC6528 [3], as they did not use any kind of PRNG
to generate ISN values. At best, Nut/Net generated
ISNs based on the state of a system timer. Given that
ISN is only 32 bits wide, and attackers may have the
knowledge of the system uptime or be able to observe
previous ISN values as well as other leakages of the
system timer over the network, this value can be easily
inferred. On the other hand, uIP (also Contiki-OS and
Contiki-NG), FNET and NDKTCPIP initialized ISNs with a
constant value, which attackers may find by examining
the corresponding source or byte code, or by looking at a
short network capture.

8

FORESCOUT RESEARCH LABSRESEARCH REPORT  |  NUMBER: JACK  |  Technical dive-in

The remaining 4 issues listed in Table 1 were due to the
usage of a weak PRNG algorithm. Moreover, the PRNG
algorithm seeding was not implemented properly in all
cases, which would help the attackers to further reduce
the search space (which is already quite limited) for
predicting the output of the PRNG and guessing ISNs.
PicoTCP, PicoTCP-NG, CycloneTCP, uC/TCP-IP and MPLAB
Net all relied on a variation of a simple Linear Congruential
Generator (LCG) algorithm for generating ISNs, which
is known to be easily reversible from the observed
output streams [9] [10] (e.g., network communications).
Additionally, all these stacks used either a constant value
or a dynamic value derived from a system clock for
seeding the algorithm, which would defeat the purpose of
using a PRNG.

Moreover, it is also challenging to account for all possible
configurations in which an embedded TCP/IP stack will
be used. Therefore, to ensure flexibility of a protocol
suite, developers of TCP/IP stacks may implement
naïve ISN generation solutions (e.g., using weak PRNG
or no PRNG at all), expecting that system integrators
and product developers will override this functionality
according to their needs. The lwIP project handled this
issue by introducing the possibility for system integrators
and product developers to implement their own PRNG
for ISN generation, as well as documented this feature.
While Forescout cannot claim that lwIP is vulnerable to
the weak ISN generation vulnerability per se, Forescout
believes this kind of solution might still introduce
vulnerabilities if the system integrators and product
developers are not carefully reading the documentation.
However, if a project/vendor provides no documentation
that warns users about this, such implementations
must be considered vulnerable, which was the case for
the vulnerability Forescout reported to the PicoTCP-NG
project maintainers.

Finally, the developers of Nanostack have implemented the
ISN generation mechanism in accordance with FC6528
[3], which is the only stack (out of the 11 that Forescout
analyzed) that implements this functionality properly.

6. Conclusion

Forescout’s main conclusions from the NUMBER:JACK
research are:

•  As initially discussed in AMNESIA:33, misinterpretation

or mis-implementation of RFCs is a major cause
of vulnerabilities in TCP/IP stacks. In the case of
ISN generation, stacks completely ignoring RFC
recommendations are often seen.

•  Weak ISN generation is one more instance of historical
vulnerabilities discovered and fixed in the IT world
decades ago that today affects large numbers of IoT
and OT devices.

•  This type of vulnerability is much easier for researchers

to discover than the memory corruption issues
discussed in AMNESIA:33. Although they do not allow
for remote code execution directly, attackers can
quickly and easily analyze several TCP/IP stacks and
find similar issues that can be part of a larger attack
campaign in a heterogeneous network with many IoT/
OT devices.

•  Unfortunately, this type of vulnerability is also difficult

to fix permanently because of the resource constraints
of many embedded devices, and what is considered a
secure PRNG today may be considered insecure in the
future. Some stack developers opt to rely on system
integrators to implement their own ISN generation,
which is a fair decision, but which means not all devices
using a patched stack will be secure automatically.

•  This research again highlights the security challenges

of the IoT world and why it is fundamental for
network operators to employ cybersecurity tools that
ensure visibility and control of networked devices,
including granular classification to detect vulnerable
components, as well as the possibility of segmenting
and enforcing policies on the network.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.
* Utilize cryptographic protocols such as Transport Layer Security to protect transported data.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
