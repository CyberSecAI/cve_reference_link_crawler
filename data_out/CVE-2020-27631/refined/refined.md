{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The ISN (Initial Sequence Number) generator relies on a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG), which is reversible from observed output streams. The algorithm is seeded with a publicly observable CRC value.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of insufficiently random values",
      "Predictable ISN generation",
        "Reliance on weak LCG algorithm",
         "Publicly observable seed value"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of weak initial sequence numbers (ISN) can be used to hijack or spoof TCP connections, cause denial-of-service conditions, inject malicious data, or bypass authentication.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks",
      "Predicting ISNs by observing network traffic"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to observe network traffic to gather information about the ISN generation process, and send crafted packets."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "CycloneTCP, Version 1.9.6 and prior"
  ],
  "cve_id": "CVE-2020-27631"
