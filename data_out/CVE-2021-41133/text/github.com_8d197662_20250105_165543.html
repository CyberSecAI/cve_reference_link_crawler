If we don't allow pivot_root() then there seems no reason why we should
allow chroot().

Wouldn't that break Firefox and Chromium?

[igo95862/bubblejail@977f941](https://github.com/igo95862/bubblejail/commit/977f9417afcefa1b30e1307ae0fd5b2675a23a6d)

When I added syscall filter to my sandbox I discovered that Firefox and Chromium do not work without chroot.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Comments on commits are not very discoverable within the Github UI, so they are not a good way to handle issue reporting. If you believe there is a bug in Flatpak, please report it as an issue.

When Firefox and Chromium are run as Flatpak apps, I believe they use the subsandboxing interface (flatpak-spawn) instead of making their own sandbox from first principles.

Flatpak cannot safely allow sandboxed Flatpak apps to `chroot()`, because if they could do that, then they would be able to `chroot()` into a directory with their own crafted `/.flatpak-info`, leading to vulnerabilities similar to CVE-2021-41133.

In practice Flatpak apps will not have `CAP_SYS_CHROOT`, so they should not be able to `chroot()` anyway, even before this commit.

It is not a bug in Flatpak.

I am developing my own sandbox solution inspired by Flatpak.

I was reading Flatpak CVEs to find if my sandbox is also vulnerable to same issues and found this commit.

I recently added syscall filter and blocking `chroot` caused both Firefox and Chromium to fail.

I was wondering how Flatpak avoids same issue. I guess being a distribution platform on top of being a sandbox gives a privilege to patch software to better suit sandbox. My program has to settle with the distro provided binaries.

Sorry, something went wrong.
