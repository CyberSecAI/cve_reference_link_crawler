# CVE-2021-41133: Sandbox bypass via recent VFS-manipulating syscalls

High

[alexlarsson](/alexlarsson)
published
GHSA-67h7-w3jq-vh4q
Oct 8, 2021

## Package

Flatpak
(freedesktop.org)

## Affected versions

1.11.x, 1.10.x <= 1.10.3, all <= 1.8.2

## Patched versions

1.10.5, 1.12.1, also expected in 1.8.2

## Description

An anonymous reporter discovered that Flatpak apps with direct access to AF\_UNIX sockets such as those used by Wayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulse can trick portals and other host-OS services into treating the Flatpak app as though it was an ordinary, non-sandboxed host-OS process, by manipulating the VFS using recent mount-related syscalls that are not blocked by Flatpak's denylist seccomp filter, in order to substitute a crafted `/.flatpak-info` or make that file disappear entirely.

### Impact

Flatpak apps that act as clients for AF\_UNIX sockets such as those used by Wayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulse can escalate the privileges that the corresponding services will believe the Flatpak app has.

Mitigation: Note that protocols that operate entirely over the D-Bus session bus (user bus), system bus or accessibility bus are not affected by this. This is due to the use of a proxy process `xdg-dbus-proxy`, whose VFS cannot be manipulated by the Flatpak app, when interacting with these buses.

### Patches

The short-term solution is to expand the deny-list of syscalls in the seccomp filter:

* [1330662](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/1330662f33a55e88bfe18e76de28b7922d91a999)
* [462fca2](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/462fca2c666e0cd2b60d6d2593a7216a83047aaf)

These follow-up fixes address regressions in the initial version:

* [d419fa6](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/d419fa67038370e4f4c3ce8c3b5f672d4876cfc8) (included in 1.12.1 and 1.10.5)
* [3fc8c67](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/3fc8c672676ae016f8e7cc90481b2feecbad9861) (included in 1.12.2, should be included in 1.10.6)

The regression fixes are necessary for compatibility with Flatpak apps, runtimes and extensions that use the extra-data feature (such as openh264 and the proprietary NVIDIA drivers) or that use multiarch (such as Steam). However, they weaken the protection against unwanted system calls: system calls not known to the installed version of libseccomp will not be blocked. Using a version of libseccomp at least as new as the currently-running kernel is recommended. We are looking for better long-term solutions.

Follow-up hardening is likely to convert the deny-list into an allow-list, and/or block namespace transitions in some other way.

### Workarounds

None currently known.
