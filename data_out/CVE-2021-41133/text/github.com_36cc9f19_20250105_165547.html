```
At the moment, if we block a syscall we always make it fail with EPERM,
but this is risky: user-space libraries can start to use new replacements
for old syscalls at any time, and will often treat EPERM as a fatal error.
For new syscalls, we should make the syscall fail with ENOSYS, which is
indistinguishable from running on an older kernel and will cause fallback
to an older implementation, for example clone3() to clone().

In future we should probably move from EPERM to ENOSYS for some of the
syscalls we already block, but for now keep the status quo.

This is a prerequisite for fixing the vulnerability tracked as
[GHSA-67h7-w3jq-vh4q](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-67h7-w3jq-vh4q "GHSA-67h7-w3jq-vh4q").
