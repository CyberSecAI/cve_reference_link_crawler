    Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to
    arbitrary code execution. Description: Multiple memory corruption
    issues were addressed with improved memory handling.

CVE-2021-30851
    Versions affected: WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit before 2.34.0.

CVE-2021-30858
    Versions affected: WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit before 2.32.4.
    Credit to an anonymous researcher.
    Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to
    arbitrary code execution. Apple is aware of a report that this issue
    may have been actively exploited. Description: A use after free
    issue was addressed with improved memory management.

CVE-2021-42762
    Versions affected: WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit before 2.34.1.
    Credit to an anonymous reporter.
    BubblewrapLauncher.cpp allows a limited sandbox bypass that allows a
    sandboxed process to trick host processes into thinking the
    sandboxed process is not confined by the sandbox, by abusing VFS
    syscalls that manipulate its filesystem namespace. The impact is
    limited to host services that create UNIX sockets that WebKit mounts
    inside its sandbox, and the sandboxed process remains otherwise
    confined. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2021-41133.

We recommend updating to the latest stable versions of WebKitGTK and WPE
WebKit. It is the best way to ensure that you are running safe versions
of WebKit. Please check our websites for information about the latest
stable releases.

Wouldn't that break Firefox and Chromium?

[igo95862/bubblejail@977f941](https://github.com/igo95862/bubblejail/commit/977f9417afcefa1b30e1307ae0fd5b2675a23a6d)

When I added syscall filter to my sandbox I discovered that Firefox and Chromium do not work without chroot.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Comments on commits are not very discoverable within the Github UI, so they are not a good way to handle issue reporting. If you believe there is a bug in Flatpak, please report it as an issue.

When Firefox and Chromium are run as Flatpak apps, I believe they use the subsandboxing interface (flatpak-spawn) instead of making their own sandbox from first principles.

Flatpak cannot safely allow sandboxed Flatpak apps to `chroot()`, because if they could do that, then they would be able to `chroot()` into a directory with their own crafted `/.flatpak-info`, leading to vulnerabilities similar to CVE-2021-41133.

Sorry, something went wrong.

In practice Flatpak apps will not have `CAP_SYS_CHROOT`, so they should not be able to `chroot()` anyway, even before this commit.

It is not a bug in Flatpak.

I am developing my own sandbox solution inspired by Flatpak.

I was reading Flatpak CVEs to find if my sandbox is also vulnerable to same issues and found this commit.

I recently added syscall filter and blocking `chroot` caused both Firefox and Chromium to fail.

I was wondering how Flatpak avoids same issue. I guess being a distribution platform on top of being a sandbox gives a privilege to patch software to better suit sandbox. My program has to settle with the distro provided binaries.

Sorry, something went wrong.

At the moment, if we block a syscall we always make it fail with EPERM,
but this is risky: user-space libraries can start to use new replacements
for old syscalls at any time, and will often treat EPERM as a fatal error.
For new syscalls, we should make the syscall fail with ENOSYS, which is
indistinguishable from running on an older kernel and will cause fallback
to an older implementation, for example clone3() to clone().

In future we should probably move from EPERM to ENOSYS for some of the
syscalls we already block, but for now keep the status quo.

This is a prerequisite for fixing the vulnerability tracked as

run: Block clone3() in sandbox

```
clone3() can be used to implement clone() with CLONE_NEWUSER, allowing
a sandboxed process to get CAP_SYS_ADMIN in a new namespace and
manipulate its root directory. We need to block this so that AF_UNIX-based
socket servers (X11, Wayland, etc.) can rely on
/proc/PID/root/.flatpak-info existing for all Flatpak-sandboxed apps.

Blocking clone3 in Docker caused issues with glibc, not sure if will here as well. See [moby/moby#42680](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/42680)

Blocking clone3 in Docker caused issues with glibc because they block it with `EPERM`. We're blocking it with `ENOSYS`, which should be indistinguishable from running on an older kernel that doesn't know `clone3()`.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# CVE-2021-41133: Sandbox bypass via recent VFS-manipulating syscalls

High

[alexlarsson](/alexlarsson)
published
GHSA-67h7-w3jq-vh4q
Oct 8, 2021

## Package

Flatpak
(freedesktop.org)

## Affected versions

1.11.x, 1.10.x <= 1.10.3, all <= 1.8.2

## Patched versions

1.10.5, 1.12.1, also expected in 1.8.2

## Description

An anonymous reporter discovered that Flatpak apps with direct access to AF\_UNIX sockets such as those used by Wayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulse can trick portals and other host-OS services into treating the Flatpak app as though it was an ordinary, non-sandboxed host-OS process, by manipulating the VFS using recent mount-related syscalls that are not blocked by Flatpak's denylist seccomp filter, in order to substitute a crafted `/.flatpak-info` or make that file disappear entirely.

### Impact

Flatpak apps that act as clients for AF\_UNIX sockets such as those used by Wayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulse can escalate the privileges that the corresponding services will believe the Flatpak app has.

Mitigation: Note that protocols that operate entirely over the D-Bus session bus (user bus), system bus or accessibility bus are not affected by this. This is due to the use of a proxy process `xdg-dbus-proxy`, whose VFS cannot be manipulated by the Flatpak app, when interacting with these buses.

### Patches

The short-term solution is to expand the deny-list of syscalls in the seccomp filter:

* [462fca2](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/462fca2c666e0cd2b60d6d2593a7216a83047aaf)

These follow-up fixes address regressions in the initial version:

* [d419fa6](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/d419fa67038370e4f4c3ce8c3b5f672d4876cfc8) (included in 1.12.1 and 1.10.5)
* [3fc8c67](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/3fc8c672676ae016f8e7cc90481b2feecbad9861) (included in 1.12.2, should be included in 1.10.6)

The regression fixes are necessary for compatibility with Flatpak apps, runtimes and extensions that use the extra-data feature (such as openh264 and the proprietary NVIDIA drivers) or that use multiarch (such as Steam). However, they weaken the protection against unwanted system calls: system calls not known to the installed version of libseccomp will not be blocked. Using a version of libseccomp at least as new as the currently-running kernel is recommended. We are looking for better long-term solutions.

Follow-up hardening is likely to convert the deny-list into an allow-list, and/or block namespace transitions in some other way.

### Workarounds

None currently known.
