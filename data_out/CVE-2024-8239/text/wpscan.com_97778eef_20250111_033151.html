## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Starbox < 3.5.3 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not properly render social media profiles URLs in certain contexts, like the malicious user's profile or pages where the starbox shortcode is used, which may be abused by users with at least the contributor role to conduct Stored XSS attacks.

### Proof of Concept

1) Go to your profile
2) Change Twitter URL field to JS like -> 123" onmouseover=alert(1)// style=display:block;width:1000px;height:1000px;background-color:red;'
3) Refresh page and check recent posts in preview block. Hover the big red square.
4) Additionaly, you can check XSS with shortcode stabox and id paramert of your user with the following shortcode: [starbox id=$USER\_ID]
