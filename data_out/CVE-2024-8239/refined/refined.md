- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly sanitize social media profile URLs, particularly in contexts such as user profiles and pages using the starbox shortcode. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, and redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - A user with at least Contributor role can modify their social media profile URLs (e.g., Twitter URL) to contain malicious JavaScript code.
    - The injected code is then executed when a user views the attacker's profile or on pages using the starbox shortcode with the attacker's user ID.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs at least a Contributor role in the WordPress site to modify social media profile URLs.
