Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2024-38636.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
When the multi-device feature is enabled in F2FS, `f2fs_map_blocks()` can return a zero block address for the first block of a non-primary device. Although this is a valid address, `f2fs_iomap_begin()` incorrectly interprets it as an invalid address because it assumes `map->m_pblk` represents a physical address across all devices, which is not always the case when multi-device is active. This leads to incorrect iomap length calculations and triggers a warning.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of physical block addresses in `f2fs_iomap_begin()` when multiple devices are used.
- The assumption that `map->m_pblk` always represents a global physical address across all devices.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The immediate impact is a kernel warning being triggered during file system operations, specifically direct reads on the first block of the second device, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
-  The warning occurs due to an invalid `iomap->length`.
- It could cause instability in the file system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when F2FS is set up with multiple block devices and read requests are mapped to the beginning of a secondary device.
- The vulnerability can be triggered using a setup with non-zoned null block devices with direct I/O operations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create an F2FS file system across multiple devices.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger direct I/O operations to the file system, particularly reads.
