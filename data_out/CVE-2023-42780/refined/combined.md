| I thought about using IN (list of accessible dags), but after some search, it looks like IN has limits in the different engines:   1. **MySQL**:     * The maximum number of values in an `IN` list is determined by the value of the `max_allowed_packet` server variable. This variable specifies the maximum size of a single packet or any generated/intermediate string.    * In practical terms, you can typically have several thousand values in an `IN` list. 2. **PostgreSQL**:     * There is no strict limit on the number of values you can use in an `IN` list. However, very long lists may be subject to performance issues. 3. **SQLite**:     * The maximum number of parameters in an `IN` clause is determined by the maximum number of host parameters in a single SQL statement, which is typically limited to several hundred. 4. **SQL Server**:     * The maximum number of values in an `IN` list is determined by the maximum number of expressions that can be included in a list (which is 65,536). 5. **Oracle**:     * The maximum number of expressions in an `IN` list is 1,000.   I will try to find a way to join the table with the dag table. |

Filtering should happen before limit, otherwise this would show a weird number of entries if some of the warnings are not viewable by the current user, even possibly an empty list.

~~I feel we should have the DAG permission in the decorator instead of handling this by ourselves. My vote would go to just adding `(permissions.ACTION_CAN_READ, permissions.RESOURCE_DAG)` to the list of permissions.

That should solve this. Assuming it's dag\_ids instead of dag\_id, then we can do as you're doing now.~~

Oh, I see that if dag\_id is not provided, then it gets all dag warning, my bad.
