## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A0601)

## Topic

An update for bind is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced
Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of
Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives
a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE
link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain Name
System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver library
(routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and tools for
verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

Security Fix(es):

* A denial of service flaw was found in the way BIND parsed signature records

for DNAME records. By sending a specially crafted query, a remote attacker could
use this flaw to cause named to crash. (CVE-2016-1286)

* A denial of service flaw was found in the way BIND processed certain control

channel input. A remote attacker able to send a malformed packet to the control
channel could use this flaw to cause named to crash. (CVE-2016-1285)

Red Hat would like to thank ISC for reporting these issues.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in
this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing the update, the BIND daemon (named) will be restarted
automatically.
