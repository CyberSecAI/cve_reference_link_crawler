Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-31716

**Affected Product:** FUXA

**Affected Version:** <= 1.1.12

**Vulnerability:** Local File Inclusion (LFI)

**Root Cause:** The application is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion. Specifically, the vulnerability can be exploited through the `file` parameter, which is used to access the `fuxa.log` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Local File Inclusion:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the local filesystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can read sensitive local files on the server. This could include configuration files, source code, log files (as noted in the description), or any other file that the web server process has access to.
*   Exposure of sensitive information could lead to further attacks and compromise the application and potentially the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the `file` parameter in the application's URL or HTTP requests. 
*   By manipulating this parameter, an attacker can specify the path to a file on the server's filesystem, which will then be included in the application's output.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected FUXA server.
*   The attacker does not need to be an authenticated user. The ability to manipulate the `file` parameter in the requests is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided text indicates that the `file=fuxa.log` parameter is a specific example, and it's highly likely the vulnerability can be exploited to access other local files as well.
* The information is more detailed than a typical CVE description and identifies the vulnerable parameter and a specific vulnerable file.
* The description explicitly mentions the affected version range.
