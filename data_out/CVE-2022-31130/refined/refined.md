{
  "CVE-2022-31130": {
    "description": "Grafana data source and plugin proxy endpoints were found to be leaking authentication tokens to some destination plugins. The destination plugin could receive a Grafana authentication token of the user.",
    "affected_versions": "All installations for Grafana versions <=9.x, <=8.x, <=7.x",
     "patched_versions": "9.1.8, 8.5.14",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how Grafana handles authentication tokens when proxying requests to data sources and plugins. Under certain conditions, authentication tokens could be unintentionally forwarded to the destination plugin or data source.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Sensitive information disclosure",
        "Authentication token leakage"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious or compromised plugin could receive the Grafana authentication token of the user, potentially leading to unauthorized access or actions.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network-based attacks via a vulnerable Grafana instance where a malicious plugin or a compromised data source can receive the user's authentication tokens.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to exploit a vulnerable Grafana instance with a malicious or compromised plugin installed. High privileges are required to configure data sources and plugins."
