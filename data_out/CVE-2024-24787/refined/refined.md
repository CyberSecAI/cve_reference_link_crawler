Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-24787:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the usage of the `-lto_library` flag within a `#cgo LDFLAGS` directive when building Go modules that include CGO on Darwin (macOS). The Apple linker allows setting the LTO (Link Time Optimization) library using this flag.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsafe Linker Flags:** The `cmd/go` tool's check for safe linker flags did not properly prevent the use of `-lto_library`. It was overlooked because it was covered by the `-lx` flag, which is used for linking libraries.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By using a malicious LTO library path provided through `-lto_library`, an attacker can cause the linker to execute arbitrary code during the `go build` process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution during the build process on a vulnerable system.
*   **Security Breach:** This could lead to a complete system compromise, data breaches, malware deployment or any other malicious actions the attacker wishes to perform.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Go Module:** An attacker crafts a malicious Go module that includes a CGO directive with an unsafe `-lto_library` flag in its LDFLAGS.
*   **Build Process:** When a user builds a project using the crafted malicious go module via `go build` on a Darwin system, the vulnerability can be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Code Injection:**  The attacker needs to be able to influence the LDFLAGS used during the build process, typically through a malicious CGO directive within a go module.
*   **Target System:** The attack is specific to Darwin (macOS) systems where the Apple linker is used.
*   **User Interaction:** Requires a user to build the malicious go module using `go build`.

**Summary of information from the provided documents:**

*   **GitHub Issue #67119:** This is the primary issue that tracks the vulnerability, including the initial report, assignment of labels, backporting, and commit history. It also includes a detailed description of the root cause.
