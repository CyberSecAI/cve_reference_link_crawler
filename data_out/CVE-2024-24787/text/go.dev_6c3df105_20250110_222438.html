| On Darwin, building a Go module which contains CGO can trigger arbitrary code execution when using the Apple version of ld, due to usage of the -lto\_library flag in a "#cgo LDFLAGS" directive.  Thanks to Juho Forsén of Mattermost for reporting this issue.

`[[release-branch.go1.21] cmd/go: disallow -lto_library in LDFLAGS](/golang/go/commit/a79ea27e36a1c56ae48dc36ce48549c9787ca4b7 "[release-branch.go1.21] cmd/go: disallow -lto_library in LDFLAGS

The darwin linker allows setting the LTO library with the -lto_library
flag. This wasn't caught by our \"safe linker flags\" check because it
was covered by the -lx flag used for linking libraries. This change
adds a specific check for excluded flags which otherwise satisfy our
existing checks.

Loading a mallicious LTO library would allow an attacker to cause the
linker to execute abritrary code when \"go build\" was called.

Thanks to Juho Forsén of Mattermost for reporting this issue.
