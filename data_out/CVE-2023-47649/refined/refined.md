- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Best Restaurant Menu by PriceListo plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could force a higher-privileged user to perform unwanted actions on the website while authenticated. This could allow a malicious actor to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication, although the specific impact varies from case to case.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor could craft a request that, when triggered by an authenticated user (likely an administrator), would perform actions within the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in user, with sufficient privileges, to interact with a malicious link or website controlled by the attacker. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
