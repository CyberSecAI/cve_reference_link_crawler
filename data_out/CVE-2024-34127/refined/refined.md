- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software attempts to read data from a memory location outside the bounds of the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Memory leak. An attacker could potentially read sensitive information from the application's memory.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), and requires user interaction (UI:R). A malicious file would need to be opened by the user. The attacker does not need any special privileges to trigger the vulnerability (PR:N)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious file that when opened by the victim will trigger the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
