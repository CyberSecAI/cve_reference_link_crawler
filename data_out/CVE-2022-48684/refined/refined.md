- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Template injection vulnerability exists within the search template functionality of Logpoint due to the use of Jinja templating for dynamic data generation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Template injection (CWE-1336)
  - Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS Command (CWE-78). The Jinja template engine allows an attacker to inject code that is then executed on the system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain code execution on the system as the `loginspect` user.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by any user with the ability to create search templates.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have an account with the privilege to create search templates.
