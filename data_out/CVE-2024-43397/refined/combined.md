GHSA-c6c3-h4f7-3962
Aug 20, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<2.3.0

## Patched versions

2.3.0

## Description

### Impact

A vulnerability exists in the synchronization configuration feature that allows users to craft specific requests to bypass permission checks. This exploit enables them to modify a namespace without the necessary permissions.

### Patches

The issue was addressed with an input parameter check in [#5192](https://github.com/apolloconfig/apollo/pull/5192), which was released in version [2.3.0](https://github.com/apolloconfig/apollo/releases/tag/v2.3.0).

### Workarounds

To mitigate the issue without upgrading, follow the recommended practices to prevent Apollo from being exposed to the internet.

### Credits

The vulnerability was reported and reproduced by [Lakeswang](https://github.com/Lakes-bitgetsec).

### References

For any questions or comments regarding this advisory:

* Open an issue in [issue](https://github.com/apolloconfig/apollo/issues)
* Email us at apollo-config@googlegroups.com

### Severity

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Walkthrough The recent changes enhance the synchronization validation logic within the `ItemController` and `NamespaceSyncModel` classes. The `update` method now includes an additional validity check for synchronization to specific namespaces, improving error handling during update operations. A new method, `syncToNamespacesValid`, has been added to `NamespaceSyncModel`, ensuring synchronization criteria are thoroughly validated before proceeding. Changes  | File Path | Change Summary | | --- | --- | | `apollo-portal/src/main/java/com/ctrip/framework/apollo/portal/controller/ItemController.java` | Enhanced `update` method to include a check for synchronization validity using `model.syncToNamespacesValid(appId, namespaceName)`. | | `apollo-portal/src/main/java/com/ctrip/framework/apollo/portal/entity/model/NamespaceSyncModel.java` | Added `syncToNamespacesValid` method for validating synchronization against `NamespaceIdentifier` objects. |  Poem In the code where bunnies hop, Validations now won’t stop! Sync to namespaces, oh so bright, Ensures our changes feel just right. With every check, we leap and cheer, Robust and ready, never fear! 🐇✨   ---   Thank you for using CodeRabbit.

Example:   + `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`   + `Generate unit testing code for this file.`   + `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.` * Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:   + `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`   + `@coderabbitai modularize this function.` * PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:   + `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`   + `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`   + `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`   + `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`   + `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`   Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments. CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)  * `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR. * `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews. * `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository. * `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again. * `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR. * `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments. * `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository. * `@coderabbitai help` to get help.   Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed. CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)  * You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository. * Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information. * If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`  Documentation and Community  * Visit our [Documentation](https://coderabbit.ai/docs) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit. * Join our [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/GsXnASn26c) to get help, request features, and share feedback. * Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements. |

**LGTM! Add unit tests to verify the new validation logic.**

The code changes are approved. Ensure to add unit tests to verify the new validation logic in the `update` method.

Do you want me to generate the unit testing code or open a GitHub issue to track this task?

**Consider using `stream` and `allMatch` for better readability.**

The current implementation is functional but can be improved for readability and conciseness.

```
public boolean syncToNamespacesValid(String appId, String namespaceName) {
  return syncToNamespaces.stream()
    .allMatch(namespaceIdentifier -> appId.equals(namespaceIdentifier.getAppId()) && namespaceName.equals(namespaceIdentifier.getNamespaceName()));
}
```
