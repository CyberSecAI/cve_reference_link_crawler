# Paradox IP150 Internet Module Cross-Site Request Forgery

## Vulnerability Overview

The Paradox IP150 Internet Module in version 1.40.00 is vulnerable to
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks due to
a lack of countermeasures and the use of the HTTP method `GET` to introduce
changes in the system.

* **Identifier** : SBA-ADV-20240321-01
* **Type of Vulnerability** : Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* **Software/Product Name** : [IP150 Internet Module](https://www.paradox.com/Products/default.asp?CATID=3&SUBCATID=38&PRD=563)
* **Vendor** : [Paradox Security Systems (Bahamas) Ltd.](https://www.paradox.com/)
* **Affected Versions** : 1.40.00 (possibly others too)
* **Fixed in Version** : Not yet
* **CVE ID** : CVE-2024-5676
* **CVSS Vector** : CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
* **CVSS Base Score** : 6.8 (Medium)

## Vendor Description

## Impact

An attacker can coerce an administrator into clicking a link, which issues
a HTTP request that changes the state of the system.
Depending on the configuration, meaning which downstream component is
controlled by the affected component, the impact will be different.
As an example the *IP150 Internet Module* might control an alarm unit.
Thus an attacker can deactivate the alarm by performing a CSRF attack.

## Vulnerability Description

The server cannot verify whether a request was sent intentionally. This
makes it possible for an attacker to trick a client into making
unintentional requests to the web server which will be treated as an
authentic request. In combination with a social engineering attack,
this allows an attacker to perform server-side actions as the victim.

In addition, the functionality of activation and deactivation of the alarm
systems, is accessed via a HTTP `GET` request.
Changing the state of the server with `GET` is discouraged in the HTTP
standard, since it is defined to be a *safe* method [1].
This makes the exploitation of the vulnerability easier, as an attacker
can craft an URL.
If the victim opens this URL, the CSRF attack is carried out and an action
is performed.

## Proof of Concept

For example, the following HTTP request disables the alarm in area `00`:

```
GET /statuslive.html?area=00&value=d HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.0.2.1
```

It is vulnerable to CSRF, since it does not apply any CSRF countermeasures.
Therefore, it is possible to craft an URL that performs this action:

```
http://192.0.2.1/statuslive.html?area=00&value=d

```

## Recommended Countermeasures

We are not aware of a vendor fix yet. Please contact the vendor.

A generally valid solution against CSRF, which however requires a server-side
state, is the implementation of an unpredictable token that is unique for
each session.
The OWASP project gives further recommendations [2] [3].
