- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the Spokes Update Service of Poly Plantronics Hub. It is caused by the service's improper handling of symbolic links during file operations, specifically deletion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of symbolic links, leading to arbitrary file deletion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM level and execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must first have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. They then leverage this to create a symbolic link that the Spokes Update Service will then use to delete a file. This file deletion primitive is then used for privilege escalation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system and be able to execute low-privileged code.
