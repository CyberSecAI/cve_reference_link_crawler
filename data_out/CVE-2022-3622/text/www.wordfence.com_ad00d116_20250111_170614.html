### Description

The Blog2Social plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks in versions up to, and including, 6.9.11. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to change some plugin settings intended to be modifiable by admins only.
