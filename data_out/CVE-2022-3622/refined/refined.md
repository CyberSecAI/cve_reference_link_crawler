Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-3622:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2022-3622. The Wordfence article explicitly mentions "Blog2Social <= 6.9.11 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Settings Update" and links it to CVE-2022-3622. Additionally, the code diffs highlight changes related to capability checks, which is the core of the vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a **missing authorization check** in the Blog2Social plugin. Specifically, the plugin did not properly verify if a user had the necessary capabilities (administrator) to modify certain settings. This allowed users with lower privileges (subscriber and above) to potentially alter plugin settings that should only be accessible by administrators.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authorization Bypass:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper capability checks, leading to an authorization bypass.
*   **Insecure Direct Object References:** While not explicitly mentioned, the vulnerability implies that direct manipulation of POST parameters allowed bypassing permission controls, suggesting possible insecure direct object references.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** While sanitization is present, the vulnerability highlights a lack of validation for the context and permissions related to the incoming POST data, indicating missing validation.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Settings Tampering:** An attacker could modify plugin settings intended for administrators.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While not explicitly described in detail, changing settings could potentially be a stepping stone for more malicious actions depending on the plugin's functionality. For instance, an attacker may have been able to modify settings which would allow them to inject malicious Javascript or other undesirable content. 
*   **Limited Scope of Impact:**  The Wordfence analysis indicates the impact is limited to "change some plugin settings" and the CVSS score is 4.1 indicating a medium severity, without any confidentiality or availability impacts.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network.
*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted POST requests to the vulnerable plugin endpoints.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least subscriber-level permissions.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress User Account:** The attacker must have a valid WordPress user account with at least "subscriber" permissions.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target WordPress instance.
*   **Understanding of Plugin Functionality:** While not strictly necessary, understanding the plugin's settings structure would enable a more targeted attack.

**7. Technical Details & Code Changes**
The provided code changes show the fixes for this vulnerability. In `includes/Ajax/Post.php`, the following changes were made to restrict access to the `saveSocialMetaTags` and `resetSocialMetaTags` functions to `administrator` roles:
