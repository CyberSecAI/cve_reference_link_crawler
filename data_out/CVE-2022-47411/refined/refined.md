The provided content is related to CVE-2022-47411.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from multiple issues within the "Newsletter subscriber management" (fp_newsletter) TYPO3 extension:

1.  **Captcha Bypass:** The extension's captcha mechanism can be bypassed, leading to the automated creation of numerous newsletter subscribers.
2.  **Arbitrary Subscription UID Deletion:** The `deleteAction` allows for the submission of arbitrary subscription UIDs, leading to the possibility of unsubscribing all newsletter subscribers.
3.  **Insufficient Access Checks:** The `createAction` and `unsubscribeAction` lack sufficient access checks, potentially exposing data of existing newsletter subscribers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Information Disclosure: Due to insufficient access checks, sensitive data of existing newsletter subscribers can be obtained.
*   Broken Access Control: The ability to delete arbitrary subscribers via the `deleteAction` and the lack of proper access checks in `createAction` and `unsubscribeAction` allow unauthorized actions.
*   Captcha Bypass: The captcha mechanism is vulnerable, allowing automated subscriber creation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Automated creation of newsletter subscribers.
*   Mass unsubscription of all newsletter subscribers.
*   Exposure of existing newsletter subscriber data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Network: The vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need any specific privileges or user account.
*   The attacker needs to be able to make web requests to the vulnerable TYPO3 instance.
