# Excessive resource use in malformed ssh traffic parsing

High

[victorjulien](/victorjulien)
published
GHSA-mhhx-xw7r-r5c8
Apr 2, 2024

## Package

suricata

## Affected versions

<=6.0.16
>= 7.0.0, <= 7.0.3

## Patched versions

6.0.17
7.0.4

## Description

### Impact

When parsing an overly long SSH banner, Suricata can use excessive CPU resources, as well as cause excessive logging volume in alert records.

### Patches

Upgrade to 7.0.4 or 6.0.17.

### Workarounds

There are several possible workarounds.

Use a rule to bypass the flow when an overly long SSH banner arrives like :

`alert ssh any any -> any any (msg:"SURICATA SSH too long banner"; flow:established; app-layer-event:ssh.long_banner; classtype:protocol-command-decode; sid:2228001; rev:2; bypass;)`

Alternatively, there are several things that help avoid or reduce the issue:

* disable ssh parser (avoid)
* set a low `stream.reassembly.depth` value (reduce)
* disable EVE ssh logging (reduce)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
