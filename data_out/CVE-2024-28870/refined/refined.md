- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Parsing an overly long SSH banner causes excessive CPU resource usage and excessive logging volume in alert records.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies in the SSH banner parsing logic of Suricata, specifically its inability to handle overly long banners without excessive resource consumption. This can be classified as a resource consumption vulnerability, specifically a form of uncontrolled resource consumption related to the processing of a specially crafted SSH banner, leading to excessive CPU usage and logging.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Exploitation leads to excessive CPU usage on the Suricata system and generates a high volume of logs. This could lead to denial-of-service conditions for the Suricata instance.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack via malformed SSH traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted SSH traffic to a system running a vulnerable version of Suricata. No specific user interaction or privileges are required.
