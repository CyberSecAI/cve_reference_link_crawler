- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the handling of SMB2 messages. This results in an out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data in SMB2 message handling.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can disclose sensitive information by reading past the end of an allocated buffer. This could potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution as root.
- **Attack vectors:** A network-adjacent attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious SMB2 messages to the Sonos Era 100 smart speaker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the affected Sonos Era 100 device. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
