This repository contains all the research output about vulnerabilities in Smart Plug (IoT Haat), IP Camera (D3D, Ezviz IP Camera).

# IoT Haat Smart Plug IH-IN-16A-S

## Affected Product

IH-IN-16A-S - Application Software Version: 5.16.1

## Affected Vendor

IoT Haat Smart Plug IH-IN-16A-S.

## CVE Number

[CVE-2024-46040] (<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2024-46040>)

## Summary

IoT Haat Smart Plug IH-IN-16A-S IH-IN-16A-S v5.16.1 suffers from Insufficient Session Expiration. The lack of validation of the authentication token at the IoT Haat during the Access Point Pairing mode leads the attacker to replay the Wi-Fi packets and forcefully turn off the access point after the authentication token has expired

## Tested Versions

IH-IN-16A-S - Application Software Version: 5.16.1

## Product URLs

[Website] (<https://www.iothaat.com/>)

## CVSSv3 Score

TBA

## CWE

TBA

## Details

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker replays the Wi-Fi packets captured during the provisioning phase of the IoT Haat in the Access Point pairing mode.

# IoT Haat Smart Plug IH-IN-16A-S

## Affected Product

IH-IN-16A-S - Application Software Version: 5.16.1

## Affected Vendor

IoT Haat Smart Plug IH-IN-16A-S.

## CVE Number

[CVE-2024-46041] (<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2024-46041>)

## Summary

IoT Haat Smart Plug IH-IN-16A-S v5.16.1 is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay.

## Tested Versions

IH-IN-16A-S - Application Software Version: 5.16.1

## Product URLs

[Website] (<https://www.iothaat.com/>)

## CVSSv3 Score

TBA

## CWE

TBA

## Details

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker in the provisioning phase of IoT Haat, performs an authentication-token-based replay attack by replacing a legitimate authentication token with the attacker's token.
