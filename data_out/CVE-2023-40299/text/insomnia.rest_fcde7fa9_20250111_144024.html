## 8.0.0

After 12 months of hard work, we’re excited to announce the biggest release of Kong Insomnia that we have ever seen: Kong Insomnia 8.0, significantly rebuilt from the ground up and available today in GA. You can get started for free on [insomnia.rest](https://insomnia.rest/).

Announced today at [API Summit 2023](https://konghq.com/events/conferences/api-summit), Kong Insomnia 8.0 introduces hundreds of new improvements and features that will dramatically increase developer productivity when designing, testing, and debugging any API.

### Kong Insomnia 8.0 highlights

* **Sharing Projects**: We have entirely reinvented sharing and collaboration in Insomnia. It is now easy and quick to invite as many collaborators as we want to join our projects, collections or design documents.
* **Real time collaboration**: With the new real time collaboration features, you can be more productive, reduce team coordination and always know in real time who is working with you on the same collections or design documents.
* **Introducing Organizations**: Teams have been replaced with Organizations, you can now create as many as you need and invite people to collaborate with them.
* **Social and Enterprise SSO**: Organizations now support EE SSO via SAML and OIDC, while other accounts can login via social SSO providers like Google or GitHub, in addition to the traditional email login.
* **Server Side Events API Support**: Server Side Events APIs are now supported to give you even more ways to debug APIs with Insomnia, in addition to the previously supported REST, GraphQL, gRPC and WebSockets.
* **Insomnia AI**: With Insomnia Al you can auto-generate API tests based on an OpenAPI specification that you create. Build more reliable APIs and save on development time.
* **New cloud dashboard**: With an entirely redesigned cloud platform and dashboard at insomnia.rest managing all of your organizations and collaborators is a piece of cake.
* **Collaborators RBAC**: Inviting users to your personal workspace or organization just got more powerful and intuitive with powerful RBAC rules to determine the level of access.
* **Unlimited Projects**: We removed all limitations to the Insomnia application, you can now create as many projects as you want, with as many files as you want.

#### Fixes

* Fixed issue [#6465](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues/6465) where a render error would be through in some cases depending on the version format of an OpenAPI spec ([#6493](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/pull/6493))

## Introducing Projects!

Projects are a way to group your request collections and design documents. It builds on top of the existing Insomnia Sync functionality but also allows for local projects without sync enabled. On updating to this release any Request Collections you had previously pulled into Insomnia from Insomnia Sync, will be moved into the dashboard of that Project.

## UX improvements

Among several other UX improvements such as the visibility of the Send button and sorting cards on the dashboard, with this release we made it easier to select your light/dark theme when your Insomnia color scheme is synchronized with your OS color scheme.

## Hello, TypeScript! 🥳

The Insomnia codebase has been around for ~5 years now, and over time has gone through several iterations as JavaScript patterns evolved. In the most recent major iteration, we migrated a large majority of the codebase from Flow to TypeScript! There are countless benefits for having a codebase in TypeScript but the undertaking is huge, so the aim was to migrate like-for-like, to reduce the risk of introducing bugs.

This stable release of Insomnia marks the first release after the codebase was migrated to TypeScript, and contains several other improvements and fixes.

Please report any bugs you may find using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues/new/choose)! 🤗

## OpenAPI to Kong configuration

As users build APIOps pipelines using Insomnia, Inso and Kong, the need for improvements to the OpenAPI-2-Kong config generation became evident. As such, this release includes the following improvements (which are available within Insomnia, and also through the Insomnia CLI, Inso).

### Kong Declarative Configuration

* Added support to specify a `style` property for query parameters (preset depending on the parameter type) [#3327](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/pull/3327)
* Fixed the path parameter regex to only match one segment [#3298](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/pull/3298)
* Added support for the request validator plugin to respect user defined properties and generate missing ones [#3283](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/pull/3283)
* Added support for plugins defined at the document root, path, or operation levels [#3293](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/pull/3293)
* Added tags to generated targets, similar to services [#3320](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/pull/3320)
* Fixed a bug where generated operation ids could be illegal or have collisions [#3318](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/pull/3318)
* Improved the generated service to have the service URL broken down into its parts to allow for improved diff and sync efficiency [#3314](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/pull/3314)
* Fixed a bug where a server specified as a path only would result in an invalid upstream target [#3314](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/pull/3314)
* Fixed a bug where the service was using the actual hostname instead of the upstream name [#3314](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/pull/3314)
* Improved plugin generation logic to include tags from various sources [#3328](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/pull/3328)
* Added support for x-kong-{route, upstream, service}-defaults keys in the OpenAPI spec [#3273](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/pull/3273)
* Changed behavior such that strip\_path is set to false by default on generated routes [#3273](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/pull/3273)

## Notable Fixes

* Fixed analytics tracking to honor analytics preferences (and added a one-time prompt for users to revise this preference)

This patch addresses a [regression](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues/3234) found in 2021.2.0 where users were unable to make requests against localhost on certain platforms like Windows and through local DNS servers across all platforms.

Once discovered we removed 2021.2.0 from the auto-update list and began our investigation. Through investigation we found the source of the regression was an update made to node-libcurl and worked with the maintainer to get a new build that resolves the issue.

We would like to give huge thank you to [JCMais](https://github.com/JCMais) the maintainer of node-libcurl for being so helpful and working with us quickly to get out a build for this release. ❤️

## MaOS Big Sur Improvements

To address issues surrounding the recent macOS Big Sur release we have upgraded Electron to 9.3.5.

This change provides increased performance, reduction of graphical artifacts, properly rounded corners on macOS Big Sur and Partial support for M1 (running under Rosetta 2).

## Select theme based on System Preferences

## Single Application

Based on user feedback, usage observations, and internal discussion, we've merged Insomnia Designer and Insomnia Core. Following the Insomnia 2021.1 release there will no longer be an Insomnia Core or Insomnia Designer, only Insomnia.

When you start Insomnia users will be presented with the Dashboard, a new way to manage Design Documents and Request Collections (previously named workspaces).

![](https://images.prismic.io/cms-react-testing/d4acefbc-40d1-42a1-8c26-c1b88c01b46e_Screen+Shot+2021-03-03+at+10.15.12+PM.png?auto=compress,format)

Once inside a Request Collection, Insomnia users will feel very much at home, while there are some changes, we tried to keep them to a minimum to retain the simplicity of Insomnia that we all enjoy.

![](https://images.prismic.io/cms-react-testing/125e7f03-66da-4a53-a24f-4cce6ca9d037_Screen+Shot+2021-03-03+at+10.57.00+PM.png?auto=compress,format)

If you were a user of Insomnia Designer you will be presented with a data migration flow asking you what data you would like to migrate.

![](https://images.prismic.io/cms-react-testing/60be68fc-6ca1-4870-943c-156f97614ce2_Screen+Shot+2021-03-03+at+10.11.05+PM.png?auto=compress,format)

If you decide to skip the migration, you can always re-open the data migration flow through **Application Preferences > General >  Migrate from Designer**.

The Version Control Sync menu and button can now be found in the top right corner of the application header:

The remote pull menu has also been moved to the dashboard next to the create menu and is visible once logged in:

As a part of the merge, we have also bundled the Kong Plugin Bundle as a core plugin. Users familiar with Designer can now find their plugin actions under the document dropdown as seen below, this change was done to reduce header clutter and allow for future actions.

![](https://images.prismic.io/cms-react-testing/89a9ea66-d696-41f6-a4b5-91dc03298d4c_Screen+Shot+2021-03-04+at+12.10.08+AM.png?auto=compress,format)

## Improved protofile support

The Select Proto File dialog now supports **multi-file** and **directory import** for .proto files for GRPC requests.

![](https://images.prismic.io/cms-react-testing/5695669e-5fbf-4b46-ac0a-fe2aee41b916_b217e7a8-09b9-4a27-97d6-5935124711a8.png?auto=compress,format)

## Template tag support for gRPC

You can now use template tags for gRPC hosts and bodies.

![](https://images.prismic.io/cms-react-testing/40e552ad-8eea-48a4-badb-44ed8930c153_102173354-b473c280-3eff-11eb-9c00-c2b6523f2256.gif?auto=compress,format)

## Portable application support for Windows

Windows users now have the option to install Insomnia as a portable application, the portable binary can be found on the [Insomnia Github releases page](https://github.com/kong/insomnia/releases/latest).

## Automatic request collection generation improvements

We've made several updates to how we handle automatic generation of request collections to preserve user data while switching between the design and debug activities based on both user feedback and direct user input.

Now while switching between design and debug within a design document, changes from the specification to the request collection are now additive only, meaning that existing values and modifications to requests will not be overwritten.

In addition to preserving user data while switching between Design and Debug, the selected environment is also preserved.

**Note:** During QA, we identified a known issue where if you add an element in-between array elements inside of the specification and switch to the debug activity the element added will inherit the values of the array element that it took the place of. For now users can work around this issue by adding new elements to the end of the array.

## Breaking changes

This release also contains the following breaking changes.

**Legacy sync has been deprecated**

With the release of Insomnia 2021.1, Legacy Sync has been deprecated in favor of version control which has been promoted to stable. Read more here.

**Cloning repositories now requires a .git suffix**

With this release to better support other platforms and workflows such as Azure DevOps cloning repositories now requires explicitly having the .git suffix.

Existing settings and repositories should not be affected by this change.

**CLI - Default application directory has changed**

With the merge of Insomnia Core and Insomnia Designer, the Insomnia CLI now looks at the Insomnia application data directory by default.

## Notable Fixes

* Fixed an edge case where the auto-complete dropdown would not close
* Fixed issue where resizing gRPC requests would cause scaling issues
* Fixed issue where generating JSON from OpenAPI caused an infinite loop
* Fixed issue where GraphQL explorer text was not selectable
* Fixed issue where file inputs where not handled properly when copying multipart requests as cURL
