Impact of exploitation:
- Successful exploitation could lead to a complete takeover of the Java SE or Java SE Embedded environment.
- Unauthorized creation, deletion, or modification of critical data or all data accessible to the affected Java environment.

Attack vectors:
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via a network through multiple protocols.
- Attack requires human interaction (user interaction) from a person other than the attacker.
