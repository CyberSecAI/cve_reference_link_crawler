| <https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMH2DATABASE-31685> reports an RCE vulnerability <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10054> , which in turn is failing our builds. Has this been fixed, and if not is it likely to be? |

| That is an RCE is the same sense as leaving your front door open and unlocked and going on holiday is an RCE. |

| OK, but if it's only a vulnerability in that it lets you shoot yourself in the foot, how do you go about getting it cleared off automated scanning systems? Some of our users scan what we ship, they see the report linked, they say it's unacceptable. |

| This is largely a problem with whatever web framework you are using, because they are using H2 with insecure defaults.  So feel free to log the bug there. |
