Hello gophers,

We have just released Go 1.21.0.

To find out what has changed in Go 1.21, read the release notes:

<https://go.dev/doc/go1.21>

You can download binary and source distributions from our download page:

<https://go.dev/dl/#go1.21.0>

If you have Go installed already, an easy way to try go1.21.0

is by using the go command:

$ go install [golang.org/dl/go1.21.0@latest](http://golang.org/dl/go1.21.0%40latest)

$ go1.21.0 download

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.21.0` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the release!

Cheers,

David and Michael for the Go team

### **[neild](/neild)** commented [Feb 13, 2023](#issue-1583236426)

| `go env` is documented as outputting a shell script containing Go the environment:  ``` $ go help env By default env prints information as a shell script (on Windows, a batch file). If one or more variable names is given as arguments, env prints the value of each named variable on its own line.  ```  However, `go env` doesn't sanitize values, so executing its output as a shell script can cause various bad bahaviors, including executing arbitrary commands:  ``` $ CC='$(echo shell expansion 1>&2)' go env | source /dev/stdin shell expansion  ```  Or inserting new environment variables:  ``` $ CC=$(echo 'cc"'; echo 'OOPS="oops') go env ... CC="cc" OOPS="oops" ...  ```  In general, if an attacker can set arbitrary environment variables on a system, they have better attack vectors than making go env print them out, but we still should be sanitizing the output here. Treating this as a PUBLIC track vulnerability because the scenarios where this results in a vulnerability are fairly artificial, and the correct fix is not immediately obvious. (Properly quoting values seems like an obvious fix, but shell quoting is subtle.)  This is [CVE-2023-24531](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cwpg-qgc6-jxvq "CVE-2023-24531").  Thanks to Hunter Wittenborn (<https://hunterwittenborn.com/>) for reporting this issue. |

# Vulnerability Report: GO-2024-2962

standard library

* CVE-2023-24531
* Affects:
  cmd/go
* Published: Jul 02, 2024

Command go env is documented as outputting a shell script containing the Go environment. However, go env doesn't sanitize values, so executing its output as a shell script can cause various bad bahaviors, including executing arbitrary commands or inserting new environment variables.
This issue is relatively minor because, in general, if an attacker can set arbitrary environment variables on a system, they have better attack vectors than making "go env" print them out.

## Affected Packages
