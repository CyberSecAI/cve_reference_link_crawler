Hello gophers,

We have just released Go 1.21.0.

To find out what has changed in Go 1.21, read the release notes:

<https://go.dev/doc/go1.21>

You can download binary and source distributions from our download page:

<https://go.dev/dl/#go1.21.0>

If you have Go installed already, an easy way to try go1.21.0

is by using the go command:

$ go install [golang.org/dl/go1.21.0@latest](http://golang.org/dl/go1.21.0%40latest)

$ go1.21.0 download

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.21.0` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the release!

Cheers,

David and Michael for the Go team
