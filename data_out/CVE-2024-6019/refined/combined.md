## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Music Request Manager <= 1.3 - Unauthenticated Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape incoming music requests, which could allow unauthenticated users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks against administrators

### Proof of Concept

1. Add the `[music-requests]` shortcode to a post/page
2. View that page as an unauthenticated user and enter the payload `"><script>alert(1></script>` for either input
3. As an admin, view the page and see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
