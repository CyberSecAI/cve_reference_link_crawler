- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authentication for a critical function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authentication bypass due to lack of proper authentication mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can log in without knowing the password by crafting a modified HTTP GET request, gaining unauthorized access to the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable device, but does not require prior authentication or knowledge of valid credentials.
