{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly validate user passwords when exporting data. Specifically, it seems to ignore the 'loginPwd' parameter entirely if it is missing from the request, allowing an attacker to bypass password authentication.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Password bypass, improper input validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can export data from the ZKBio CVSecurity application without providing the correct password.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting an HTTP request to export data with the 'loginPwd' parameter missing.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the ZKBio CVSecurity application."
