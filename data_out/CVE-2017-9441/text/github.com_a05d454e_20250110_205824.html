| I wouldn't consider this XSS as there's no other site involved (and hence it can't be executed without the user uploading a malicious package). I have setup those fields to be escaped, though! |

| If you install a package or extension containing malicious content, then you will be xssed, so you have to filter the fields you need to display, Rather than displayed directly. for example:  ``` <h2> 	<?=htmlspecialchars($json["title"])?> <?=htmlspecialchars($json["version"])?> 	<small>by <?=htmlspecialchars($json["author"]["name"])?></small> </h2>  ``` |
