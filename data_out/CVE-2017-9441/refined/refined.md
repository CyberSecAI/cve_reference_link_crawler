Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided data within the BigTree CMS. Specifically, the `title`, `version`, and `author_name` fields extracted from a `manifest.json` file during the installation of extensions and packages are directly displayed in HTML without proper encoding.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The absence of `htmlspecialchars()` or similar encoding functions on the mentioned fields allows for the injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript code.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will execute in the context of the victim's browser when they install a malicious extension or package, which can lead to session hijacking, cookie stealing, defacement of the application, and other malicious activities.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious `manifest.json` file within a ZIP archive (extension/package), including malicious script in `title`, `version`, or `author_name`. This ZIP file is then uploaded via the BigTree CMS admin panel. The code then parses the JSON file, and the malicious payload is then rendered on the page.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to create a malicious extension/package in a ZIP archive.
    *   The attacker needs to have the ability to upload the crafted ZIP file through the BigTree CMS admin interface (via the "developer" section). This implies that the attacker must have valid credentials or compromise an account with sufficient privileges to upload extensions or packages.
    *   The attacker must have some understanding of how to make the payload render, likely through inspection of the `unpack.php` file in the CMS.
