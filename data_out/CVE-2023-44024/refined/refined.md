- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of SQL parameters within the `SupercheckoutSupercheckoutModuleFrontController::updateCheckoutBehaviour()` method. Specifically, the `$field_name` variable was not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Obtain admin access.
    - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop database.
    - Steal data from sensitive tables to expose tokens and unlock admin's ajax scripts.
    - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.
    - Deploy a webskimmer to steal credit card information.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks via a trivial HTTP call to the vulnerable front controller method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No privileges or user interaction required. The attacker can be anonymous. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application.
