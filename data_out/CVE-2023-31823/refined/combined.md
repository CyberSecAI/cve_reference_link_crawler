**Vulnerability name:** Exposure of secret in Marui Official app

##### 1. Vulnerability description

The mini-app **'Marui Official app'** on Line exposes the critical credential, the **'client secret'**, to the client-side, enabling remote attackers to obtain the secret. This client secret can then be utilized to **acquire the channel access token**, which **is responsible for securing the communication channel** within Line and can **be exploited to broadcast malicious messages**.

**Affected version:** Line 13.6.1

##### 2. Attack Vectors

The exploit only requires that the client simply has Line installed and open the mini-app 'Marui Official app' on Line. The response of the following request: <https://api/retailstudio.jp/api/v2/get_media_info>, contains the critical credential, the client secret. Then we verify the effectiveness of this secret using the tool supplied by Line.

Figure 1 Leakage of client secret

Figure 1 shows the response of request <https://api/retailstudio.jp/api/v2/get_media_info> leaks the client secret of Line which is strictly prohibited from being leaked. As shown in Figure 2, the client secret can be utilized to acquire the channel access token which is responsible for securing the communication channel within Line.

Figure 2 Exchange the channel access token with client secret

The official definition of channel access token is depicted in the following figure. It's obvious that keeping the channel access token secret is important. An attacker can utilize the channel to broadcast malicious messages if the channel access token is exposed.

#### 3.  Vulnerability affected
