Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Chirp Access mobile application contains a hard-coded password (`BEACON_PASSWORD`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Hard-coded password:** The use of a hard-coded password within the application allows unauthorized access to certain functionalities.
*   **Lack of proper access controls:** The application does not adequately protect the configuration settings of the Bluetooth beacons.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker within Bluetooth range can use the hard-coded password to change configuration settings within the Bluetooth beacon.
*   This could disable the application's ability to notify users when they are near a beacon-enabled access point.
*   This does *not* allow the attacker to change door reader or lockset configurations, or to unlock access points.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Proximity/Bluetooth range:** An attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the affected beacon.
*   **Knowledge of the hard-coded password:** The attacker must know the hard-coded password (`BEACON_PASSWORD`) to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the vulnerable beacon.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges or credentials to exploit the vulnerability besides the knowledge of the hard-coded password.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability only affects non-networked beacon deployments.
*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Chirp Access app (Android and iOS).
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2024-2197.
*   The vulnerability does *not* affect the ability of authorized users to lock or unlock access points.

The provided content gives more details than the initial CVE description by specifying the exact nature of the vulnerability (hard-coded password) and the scope of the impact (beacon configuration but not door lock access). It clarifies that the vulnerability is specific to non-networked beacon configurations and provides a CVSS score. It also points to the vendor's statement and contact information for mitigations.
