- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `ssi` binary of TRENDnet TEW-827DRU devices. This occurs due to the use of `strcpy` function without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Stack-based buffer overflow in the `ssi` binary
    - Unsafe use of `strcpy` function.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated user can execute arbitrary code on the device.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The vulnerability can be triggered by sending an HTTP POST request to `apply.cgi` with the `action` parameter set to `wizard_ipv6`.
    - The `reboot_type` parameter should contain a string with sufficient length to overflow the buffer
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.
    - The attacker needs network access to the device to send the malicious POST request.
