SSA-764417: Weak Encryption Vulnerability in RUGGEDCOM ROS
Devices

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 6.7

2022-03-08
2023-11-14
V1.8

SUMMARY

The SSH server on RUGGEDCOM ROS devices is configured to offer weak ciphers by default. This could
allow an unauthorized attacker in a man-in-the-middle position to read and modify any data passed over
the connection between legitimate clients and the affected device.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Configure the SSH clients to make use of the following strong key exchange ciphers, supported by

the ROS SSH server: ecdh-sha2-nistp256, ecdh-sha2-nistp384, or ecdh-sha2-nistp521

• Add only trusted SSH client public keys to ROS and allow access to those clients only

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

RUGGEDCOM ROS-based devices, typically switches and serial-to-Ethernet devices, are used to connect
devices that operate in harsh environments such as electric utility substations and traffic control cabinets.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.first.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37209

The SSH server on affected devices is configured to offer weak ciphers by default.

This could allow an unauthorized attacker in a man-in-the-middle position to read and modify any data
passed over the connection between legitimate clients and the affected device.
