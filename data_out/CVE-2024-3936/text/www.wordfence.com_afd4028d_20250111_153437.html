### Description

The The Post Grid – Shortcode, Gutenberg Blocks and Elementor Addon for Post Grid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the rtTPGSaveSettings function in all versions up to, and including, 7.6.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access or higher, to change the plugin's settings and invoke other functions hooked by AJAX actions.
