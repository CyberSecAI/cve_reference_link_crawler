The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the Best Courier Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `/edit_user.php` script before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The `id` parameter in `/edit_user.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
  - Data exfiltration (extracting sensitive information from the database)
  - Data modification (modifying or deleting data in the database)
  - Unauthorized access and privilege escalation (gaining control over the database)

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `/edit_user.php` script.
- The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in a GET request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application with a modified `id` parameter.
- No authentication or specific privileges are mentioned as prerequisites.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) using `sqlmap`, demonstrating the vulnerability.
- The PoC shows different types of SQL injection techniques (boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind and UNION query) being successful.
- The PoC shows that the attacker can obtain the database user, which in this case is `root@localhost`.
