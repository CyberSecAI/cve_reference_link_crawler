{
  "CVE-2024-47685": {
    "description": "The Linux kernel's `nf_reject_ip6_tcphdr_put` function in `net/ipv6/netfilter/nf_reject_ipv6.c` was found to be sending potentially uninitialized data in the reserved bits of the TCP header. This could lead to unexpected behavior or information disclosure due to the garbage bits.",
    "root_cause": "The `nf_reject_ip6_tcphdr_put` function was using `skb_put` to allocate space for the TCP header without initializing all the header fields, particularly the reserved bits (`th->res1`).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory usage",
      "Potential information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to a variety of issues, such as a denial-of-service, or information disclosure due to unexpected behavior when processing packets with garbage reserved bits set.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could trigger this code path by sending a specially crafted IPv6 TCP packet that is rejected by netfilter rules. This happens when the netfilter framework sends a reset packet in response, triggering the vulnerable function.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send IPv6 TCP packets and have them be processed by a netfilter rule that would cause a reset packet to be sent back. No special privilege is needed."
