{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because the `vmci_resource_remove()` function in the Linux kernel's VMCI (Virtual Machine Communication Interface) driver only checks the resource handle when removing a resource from the `vmci_resource_table`, without verifying the resource type. This allows for the creation of multiple resources with different types but the same handle. Consequently, when a resource is removed, the function may incorrectly remove a different resource with the same handle but a different type. The intended resource might still be freed elsewhere, leaving a dangling pointer in the `vmci_resource_table`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient check when removing resource from `vmci_resource_table`. The resource type is not verified, only handle is checked for equality."
    ],
    "impact": "A use-after-free vulnerability arises. If a resource is freed, and the table still holds a pointer to it due to the incorrect removal, a subsequent access to the freed resource leads to a use-after-free.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating multiple resources with the same handle but different types. Then, triggering the removal of one resource of one of the types. This action could free the resource while not removing the corresponding entry from the table. Subsequent operations on the resource in table leads to use after free condition.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create VMCI resources and trigger their removal. The attacker would need to have some level of access within a virtualized environment."
