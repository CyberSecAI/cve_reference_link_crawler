The provided content relates to a fix for a resource leak in the `ath12k` driver, specifically within the rfkill configuration error handling. This is not directly related to a known CVE, but rather a fix that addresses a potential resource leak within the kernel.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is a missing resource cleanup in the error handler of the `ath12k_core_rfkill_config` function. Specifically, when the rfkill configuration fails, the code jumps to `err_core_stop` label without freeing resources allocated during the core pdev creation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

The weakness is a resource leak in the error handling path. If `ath12k_core_rfkill_config` fails, the driver would not deallocate resources associated with the core pdev.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Repeated failures of the `ath12k_core_rfkill_config` function could lead to memory exhaustion and potential system instability.

**Attack vectors:**

The issue is not directly exploitable by an external attacker. The vulnerability lies within the driver's error handling. The issue could be triggered during normal operation if the rfkill configuration fails due to hardware or configuration problems. It is more of a bug that needs to be fixed to prevent a potential resource leak.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

Not applicable as the bug is not exploitable, it's a resource leak and not a vulnerability with an attacker model.

**Summary:**

The provided content describes a bug fix for a resource leak in the `ath12k` driver's rfkill configuration error handler. The fix introduces a new label, `err_core_pdev_destroy`, to ensure proper cleanup of core pdev resources when rfkill configuration fails, preventing a potential resource leak.
