- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not restrict which callback functions can be called by users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted callback function execution leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors:**  Sending a crafted HTTP request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `upg_datatable` action and specifying a malicious callback in the `field` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthenticated users can trigger the vulnerability, no special privileges or access is required.
