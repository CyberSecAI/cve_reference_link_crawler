- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP Prayer plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks in certain areas.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Absence of CSRF protection, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of logged-in users without their consent.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into deleting arbitrary prayers by crafting a malicious link.
- **Attack vectors:** By enticing a logged-in admin to visit a crafted URL, the attacker can trigger the deletion of a prayer via a GET request. The specific vulnerable URL is: `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpe_manage_prayer&doaction=delete&prayer_id=<PRAYER_ID>`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to lure a logged-in administrator to click on a malicious link.
