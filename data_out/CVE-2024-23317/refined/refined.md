- **Root cause of vulnerability:** External Control of File Name or Path (CWE-73)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to control the file name or path used by the application, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with local access to the Controller can execute arbitrary code. This could allow the attacker to take full control of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the Controller is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the Controller and "specialist knowledge or tools" to exploit the vulnerability.
