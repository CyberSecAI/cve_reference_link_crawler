- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The H5P plugin does not properly validate uploaded files, specifically SVG files within H5P archives.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input validation on file uploads.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute within the browsers of users accessing the affected content, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through uploading a malicious H5P archive containing a crafted SVG file with embedded XSS payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least Contributor level access to upload the malicious H5P archive, meaning they are authenticated users within the WordPress environment.
