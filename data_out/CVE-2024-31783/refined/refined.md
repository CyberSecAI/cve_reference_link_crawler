The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Typora, a Markdown editor.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from Typora's insufficient sanitization of user-supplied content when rendering Markdown files. Specifically, Typora fails to properly handle the `<iframe>` tag with a `data:` URI containing JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Stored XSS: The vulnerability is a stored XSS because the malicious payload is saved within a Markdown file and executed when the file is opened in Typora.
- Inadequate input sanitization: Typora does not adequately sanitize or escape special characters when rendering Markdown, allowing JavaScript code embedded in `<iframe>` tags to be executed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution within the context of the Typora application.
- An attacker could potentially gain access to local files, user credentials, or other sensitive information accessible by the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious user crafts a Markdown file containing the XSS payload.
- The victim opens the malicious Markdown file using Typora.
- The embedded JavaScript is then executed by the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to create or modify a Markdown file.
- The attacker must convince the victim to open the malicious Markdown file with a vulnerable version of Typora.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit uses the following payload:
```html
<iframe src="data:text/html,<script>alert(1)</script>"></iframe>
```
This `iframe` tag loads a `data:` URI containing HTML and JavaScript. The JavaScript `alert(1)` is executed when the `iframe` is rendered by Typora.

**Affected Versions:**
Typora versions between 0.9.93 and 1.6.7 are vulnerable.
