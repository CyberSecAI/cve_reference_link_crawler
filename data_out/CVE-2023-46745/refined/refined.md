```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses two login methods, one of which uses a GET request for authentication. There is no rate limiting implemented for GET requests, or the backend is not validating the requests correctly.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts",
    "CWE-523: Unprotected Credentials in Files"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can brute-force user accounts. Additionally, the use of GET requests for authentication can expose user credentials, as web servers often log all requests, including credentials, in logs.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited via the network by sending a GET request to the login page, with the username and password parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires network access to the application. No special privileges or user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability."
