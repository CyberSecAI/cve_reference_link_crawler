Upgrade urgency: SECURITY, contains fixes to security issues.

Security Fixes:

* (CVE-2022-24736) An attacker attempting to load a specially crafted Lua script

  can cause NULL pointer dereference which will result with a crash of the

  redis-server process. This issue affects all versions of Redis.

  [reported by Aviv Yahav].
* (CVE-2022-24735) By exploiting weaknesses in the Lua script execution

  environment, an attacker with access to Redis can inject Lua code that will

  execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis user.

  [reported by Aviv Yahav].

# New Features

* Keyspace event for new keys ([#10512](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10512))

## Command replies that have been extended

* COMMAND DOCS shows deprecated\_since field in command args ([#10545](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10545))
* COMMAND DOCS shows module name where applicable ([#10544](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10544))

# Potentially Breaking Changes

* Replicas panic when they fail writing persistence ([#10504](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10504))
* Prevent cross slot operations in functions and scripts with shebang ([#10615](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10615))

* Speed optimization in command execution pipeline ([#10502](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10502))
* Speed optimization in listpack encoded sorted ([#10486](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10486))
* Speed optimization in latency tracking at INFO (relevant for 7.0 RCs) ([#10606](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10606))
* Speed optimization when there are many replicas (relevant for 7.0 RCs) ([#10588](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10588))

# New configuration options

* Allow ignoring disk persistence errors on replicas ([#10504](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10504))
* Allow abort with panic when replica fails to execute a command sent by the master ([#10504](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10504))
* Allow configuring shutdown flags of SIGTERM and SIGINT ([#10594](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10594))
* Allow attaching an operating system-specific identifier to Redis sockets ([#10349](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10349))

# Module API changes

* Add argument specifying ACL reason for module log entry ([#10559](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10559))

  Breaking API compatibility with 7.0 RCs
* Add the deprecated\_since field in command args of COMMAND DOCS ([#10545](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10545))

  Breaking API/ABI compatibility with 7.0 RCs
* Add module API flag for using enum configs as bit flags ([#10643](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10643))
* Add RM\_PublishMessageShard ([#10543](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10543))
* Add RM\_MallocSizeString, RM\_MallocSizeDict ([#10542](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10542))
* Add RM\_TryAlloc ([#10541](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10541))

# Bug Fixes

* Replica report disk persistence errors in PING ([#10603](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10603))
* Fixes around rejecting commands on replicas and AOF when they must be respected ([#10603](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10603))
* Durability fixes for appendfsync=always policy ([#9678](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/9678))

* Fix auto-aof-rewrite-percentage based AOFRW trigger after restart ([#10550](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10550))
* Fix bugs when AOF enabled after startup, in case of failure before the first rewrite completes ([#10616](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10616))
* Fix RM\_Yield module API bug processing future commands of the current client ([#10573](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10573))
