# Lua scripts can be manipulated to overcome ACL rules

Low

[yossigo](/yossigo)
published
GHSA-647m-2wmq-qmvq
Apr 27, 2022

## Package

redis
(N/A)

## Affected versions

All

## Patched versions

7.0.0, 6.2.7

## Description

### Impact

By exploiting weaknesses in the Lua script execution environment, an attacker with access to Redis can inject Lua code that will execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis user.

The Lua script execution environment in Redis provides some measures that prevent a script from creating side effects that persist and can affect the execution of the same, or different script, at a later time. Several weaknesses of these measures have been publicly known for a long time, but they had no security impact as the Redis security model did not endorse the concept of users or privileges.

With the introduction of ACLs in Redis 6.0, these weaknesses can be exploited by a less privileged users to inject Lua code that will execute at a later time, when a privileged user executes a Lua script.

### Patches

The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0 and 6.2.7.

### Workarounds

An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being used, is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules.

### Credit

This problem has been reported by Aviv Yahav.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-6ed1ce2838
2022-05-07 04:08:14.318657
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : redis
Product : Fedora 36
Version : 6.2.7
Release : 1.fc36
URL : <https://redis.io>
Summary : A persistent key-value database
Description :
Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data
structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and
sorted sets.

You can run atomic operations on these types, like appending to a string;
incrementing the value in a hash; pushing to a list; computing set
intersection, union and difference; or getting the member with highest
ranking in a sorted set.

In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Redis works with an
in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either
by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending
each command to a log.

Redis also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave replication, with very
fast non-blocking first synchronization, auto-reconnection on net split
and so forth.

Other features include Transactions, Pub/Sub, Lua scripting, Keys with a
limited time-to-live, and configuration settings to make Redis behave like
a cache.

You can use Redis from most programming languages also.

# Lua readonly tables

The PR adds support for readonly tables on Lua to prevent security vulnerabilities:

* (CVE-2022-24736) An attacker attempting to load a specially crafted Lua script

  can cause NULL pointer dereference which will result with a crash of the

  redis-server process. This issue affects all versions of Redis.
* (CVE-2022-24735) By exploiting weaknesses in the Lua script execution

  environment, an attacker with access to Redis can inject Lua code that will

  execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis user.

The PR is spitted into 4 commits.

### Change Lua to support readonly tables

This PR modifies the Lua interpreter code to support a new flag on tables. The new flag indicating that the table is readonly and any attempt to perform any writes on such a table will result in an error. The new feature can be turned off and on using the new `lua_enablereadonlytable` Lua API. The new API can be used **only** from C code. Changes to support this feature was taken from <https://luau-lang.org/>

### Change eval script to set user code on Lua registry

Today, Redis wrap the user Lua code with a Lua function. For example, assuming the user code is:

```
return redis.call('ping')

```

The actual code that would have sent to the Lua interpreter was:

```
f_b3a02c833904802db9c34a3cf1292eee3246df3c() return redis.call('ping') end

```

The warped code would have been saved on the global dictionary with the following name: `f_<script sha>` (in our example `f_b3a02c833904802db9c34a3cf1292eee3246df3c`). This approach allows one user to easily override the implementation of another user code, example:

```
f_b3a02c833904802db9c34a3cf1292eee3246df3c = function() return 'hacked' end

```

Running the above code will cause `evalsha b3a02c833904802db9c34a3cf1292eee3246df3c 0` to return `hacked` although it should have returned `pong`. Another disadvantage is that Redis basically runs code on the loading (compiling) phase without been aware of it. User can do code injection like this:

```
return 1 end <run code on compling phase> function() return 1

```

The warped code will look like this and the entire `<run code on compiling phase>` block will run outside of eval or evalsha context:

```
f_<sha>() return 1 end <run code on compling phase> function() return 1 end

```

The commits puts the user code on a special Lua table called the registry. This table is not accessible to the user so it can not be manipulated by him. Also there is no longer a need to warp the user code so there is no risk in code injection which will cause running code in the wrong context.

### Use `lua_enablereadonlytable` to protect global tables on eval and function

The commit uses the new `lua_enablereadonlytable` Lua API to protect the global tables of both evals scripts and functions. For eval scripts, the implementation is easy, We simply call `lua_enablereadonlytable` on the global table to turn it into a readonly table.

On functions its more complected, we want to be able to switch globals between load run and function run. To achieve this, we create a new empty table that acts as the globals table for function, we control the actual globals using metatable manipulations. Notice that even if the user gets a pointer to the original tables, all the tables are set to be readonly (using `lua_enablereadonlytable` Lua API) so he can not change them. The following better explains the solution:

```
Global table {} <- global table metatable {.__index = __real_globals__}

```

The `__real_globals__` is depends on the run context (function load or function call).

Why is this solution needed and its not enough to simply switch globals? When we run in the context of function load and create our functions, our function gets the current globals that was set when they were created. Replacing the globals after the creation will not effect them. This is why this trick it mandatory.

### Protect the rest of the global API and add an allowed list to the provided API

The allowed list is done by setting a metatable on the global table before initialising any library. The metatable set the `__newindex` field to a function that check the allowed list before adding the field to the table. Fields which is not on the

allowed list are simply ignored.

After initialisation phase is done we protect the global table and each table that might be reachable from the global table. For each table we also protect the table metatable if exists.

### Performance

Performance tests was done on a private computer and its only purpose is to show that this fix is not causing any performance regression.

case 1: `return redis.call('ping')`

case 2: `for i=1,10000000 do redis.call('ping') end`

|  | Unstable eval | Unstable function | lua\_readonly\_tables eval | lua\_readonly\_tables function |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| case1 ops/sec | 235904.70 | 236406.62 | 232180.16 | 230574.14 |
| case1 avg latency ms | 0.175 | 0.164 | 0.178 | 0.149 |
| case2 total time in seconds | 3.373 | 3.444s | 3.268 | 3.278 |

### Breaking changes

* `print` function was removed from Lua because it can potentially cause the Redis processes to get stuck (if no one reads from stdout). Users should use redis.log. An alternative is to override the `print` implementation and print the message to the log file.

todo:

* Add commit message about where we took the code from
* Remember its not going to be squashed
* check performance
* check debugger
* Remove print from white list

`[Move user eval function to be located on Lua registry.](/redis/redis/pull/10651/commits/992f9e23c7ee819ad0dfac0bd6224d8330366960 "Move user eval function to be located on Lua registry.

Today, Redis wrap the user Lua code with a Lua function.
For example, assuming the user code is:

```
return redis.call('ping')
```

The actual code that would have sent to the Lua interpreter was:

```
f_b3a02c833904802db9c34a3cf1292eee3246df3c() return redis.call('ping') end
```

The wraped code would have been saved on the global dictionary with the
following name: `f_<script sha>` (in our example `f_b3a02c833904802db9c34a3cf1292eee3246df3c`).

This approach allows one user to easily override the implementation a another user code, example:

```
f_b3a02c833904802db9c34a3cf1292eee3246df3c = function() return 'hacked' end
```

Running the above code will cause `evalsha b3a02c833904802db9c34a3cf1292eee3246df3c 0` to return
hacked although it should have returned `pong`.

Another disadventage is that Redis basically runs code on the loading (compiling) phase without been
aware of it. User can do code injection like this:

```
return 1 end <run code on compling phase> function() return 1
```

The wraped code will look like this and the entire `<run code on compling phase>` block will run outside
of eval or evalsha context:

```
f_<sha>() return 1 end <run code on compling phase> function() return 1 end
```")`

We simply call `lua_enablereadonlytable` on the global table to turn it into
a readonly table.

On functions its more complecated, we want to be able to switch globals between
load run and function run. To achieve this, we create a new empty table that
acts as the globals table for function, we control the actual globals using metatable
manipulation. Notice that even if the user gets a pointer to the original tables, all
the tables are set to be readonly (using `lua_enablereadonlytable` Lua API) so he can
not change them. The following inlustration better explain the solution:

```
Global table {} <- global table metatable {.__index = __real_globals__}

The `__real_globals__` is set depends on the run context (function load or function call).

| I was running a website using OpenResty and suddenly error messages started to loop due to qless. It took me a couple hours to figure out what was happening here. This is the fix in my case: [ledgetech/lua-resty-qless#14](https://github.com/ledgetech/lua-resty-qless/pull/14)  This PR seems like a good change, however it might make some devs lose a lot of time because their scripts will break.  Maybe improve the error message? As "Attempt to modify a readonly table" didnt help much. I didnt even know that this was related to Redis at the start. Something like: "Attempt to modify a readonly table. Since Redis 7.0.1 lua scripts can't modify global tables. Change your script or use an older version of Redis." |

| The error I see quoted in [ledgetech/lua-resty-qless#14](https://github.com/ledgetech/lua-resty-qless/pull/14) seems already indicating the problem is in a read only table in a Lua script. And including a redis version number in the error message doesn't seem right. Maybe we can say that "new versions of Redis have a restriction", although... Wasn't it clear since it happened after upgrade?  Anyway, just for the record, looking at the PR you made, I understand that this script used to create a method in the table, and then call that method. But there was actually no need for that method to be part of the table (the change was to make it a stand alone method).. |

| "Wasn't it clear since it happened after upgrade?"  Not really, I upgraded my archlinux ~2 weeks ago. Yesterday I had to deploy a new feature on my website and then it wasn't working. To be honest I had no idea that Redis could run lua scripts. So first i thought the problem was inside lua-resty-qless. Luckly there wasn't any updates there, so I didnt waste much time looking at their commits. I've tried to google "Attempt to modify a read only table script", but that lead me nowhere.  This seems ok enough: ""new versions of Redis have a restriction". It leads people to redis and might guide them on how to fix |

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-a0a4c7eb31
2022-05-08 02:01:08.297479
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : redis
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 6.2.7
Release : 1.fc34
URL : <https://redis.io>
Summary : A persistent key-value database
Description :
Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data
structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and
sorted sets.

You can run atomic operations on these types, like appending to a string;
incrementing the value in a hash; pushing to a list; computing set
intersection, union and difference; or getting the member with highest
ranking in a sorted set.

In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Redis works with an
in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either
by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending
each command to a log.

Redis also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave replication, with very
fast non-blocking first synchronization, auto-reconnection on net split
and so forth.

Other features include Transactions, Pub/Sub, Lua scripting, Keys with a
limited time-to-live, and configuration settings to make Redis behave like
a cache.

You can use Redis from most programming languages also.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

\*\*Redis 6.2.7\*\* - Released Wed Apr 27 12:00:00 IDT 2022 Upgrade urgency:
\*\*SECURITY\*\*, contains fixes to security issues. Security Fixes: \*
(CVE-2022-24736) An attacker attempting to load a specially crafted Lua script
can cause NULL pointer dereference which will result with a crash of the
redis-server process. This issue affects all versions of Redis. [reported by
Aviv Yahav]. \* (CVE-2022-24735) By exploiting weaknesses in the Lua script
execution environment, an attacker with access to Redis can inject Lua code
that will execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis
user. [reported by Aviv Yahav]. Potentially Breaking Fixes \* LPOP/RPOP with
count against non-existing list return null array (#10095) \* LPOP/RPOP used to
produce wrong replies when count is 0 (#9692) Performance and resource
utilization improvements \* Speed optimization in command execution pipeline
(#10502) \* Fix regression in Z[REV]RANGE commands (by-rank) introduced in Redis
6.2 (#10337) Platform / toolchain support related improvements \* Fix RSS
metrics on NetBSD and OpenBSD (#10116, #10149) \* Fix OpenSSL 3.0.x related
issues (#10291) Bug Fixes \* Lua: Add checks for min-slave-\* configs when
evaluating Lua scripts (#10160) \* Lua: fix crash on a script call with many
arguments, a regression in v6.2.6 (#9809) \* Tracking: Make invalidation messages
always after command's reply (#9422) \* Fix excessive stream trimming due to an
overflow (#10068) \* Add missed error counting for INFO errorstats (#9646) \* Fix
geo search bounding box check causing missing results (#10018) \* Improve EXPIRE
TTL overflow detection (#9839) \* Modules: Fix thread safety violation when a
module thread adds an error reply, broken in 6.2 (#10278) \* Modules: Fix missing
and duplicate error stats (#10278) \* Module APIs: release clients blocked on
module commands in cluster resharding and down state (#9483) \* Sentinel: Fix
memory leak with TLS (#9753) \* Sentinel: Fix issues with hostname support
(#10146) \* Sentinel: Fix election failures on certain container environments
(#10197)

Upgrade urgency: SECURITY, contains fixes to security issues.

Security Fixes:

* (CVE-2022-24736) An attacker attempting to load a specially crafted Lua script

  can cause NULL pointer dereference which will result with a crash of the

  redis-server process. This issue affects all versions of Redis.

  [reported by Aviv Yahav].
* (CVE-2022-24735) By exploiting weaknesses in the Lua script execution

  environment, an attacker with access to Redis can inject Lua code that will

  execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis user.

  [reported by Aviv Yahav].

# New Features

* Keyspace event for new keys ([#10512](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10512))

## Command replies that have been extended

* COMMAND DOCS shows deprecated\_since field in command args ([#10545](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10545))
* COMMAND DOCS shows module name where applicable ([#10544](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10544))

# Potentially Breaking Changes

* Replicas panic when they fail writing persistence ([#10504](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10504))

* Speed optimization when there are many replicas (relevant for 7.0 RCs) ([#10588](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10588))

# New configuration options

* Allow ignoring disk persistence errors on replicas ([#10504](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10504))
* Allow abort with panic when replica fails to execute a command sent by the master ([#10504](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10504))
* Allow configuring shutdown flags of SIGTERM and SIGINT ([#10594](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10594))
* Allow attaching an operating system-specific identifier to Redis sockets ([#10349](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10349))

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 349 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2880220.1).

**Please note that since the release of the April 2022 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle E-Business Suite [CVE-2022-21500 (May 19, 2022)](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2022-21500.html). Customers are strongly advised to apply the July 2022 Critical Patch Update for Oracle E-Business Suite, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches.**

A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-44373f6778
2022-05-08 01:45:04.718401
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : redis
Product : Fedora 35
Version : 6.2.7
Release : 1.fc35
URL : <https://redis.io>
Summary : A persistent key-value database
Description :
Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data
structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and
sorted sets.

You can run atomic operations on these types, like appending to a string;
incrementing the value in a hash; pushing to a list; computing set
intersection, union and difference; or getting the member with highest
ranking in a sorted set.

In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Redis works with an
in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either
by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending
each command to a log.

Redis also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave replication, with very
fast non-blocking first synchronization, auto-reconnection on net split
and so forth.

Other features include Transactions, Pub/Sub, Lua scripting, Keys with a
limited time-to-live, and configuration settings to make Redis behave like
a cache.

You can use Redis from most programming languages also.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

\*\*Redis 6.2.7\*\* - Released Wed Apr 27 12:00:00 IDT 2022 Upgrade urgency:

Aviv Yahav]. \* (CVE-2022-24735) By exploiting weaknesses in the Lua script
execution environment, an attacker with access to Redis can inject Lua code
that will execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis
user. [reported by Aviv Yahav]. Potentially Breaking Fixes \* LPOP/RPOP with
count against non-existing list return null array (#10095) \* LPOP/RPOP used to
produce wrong replies when count is 0 (#9692) Performance and resource
utilization improvements \* Speed optimization in command execution pipeline
