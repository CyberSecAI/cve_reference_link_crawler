- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper protection of the alternate path within the Kiosk Mode of HiMed Cockpit devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A restricted desktop environment escape vulnerability exists.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can escape the restricted Kiosk Mode environment and gain access to the underlying operating system. This can lead to potential unauthorized access to sensitive data, system manipulation, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the device is required for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have local, unauthenticated access to the HiMed Cockpit device.
