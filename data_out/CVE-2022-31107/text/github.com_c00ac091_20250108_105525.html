## Grafana account takeover via OAuth vulnerability ([CVE-2022-31107](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-31107))

### Summary

On June 27 the HTTPVoid team contacted Grafana Labs to disclose a Grafana account takeover via an OAuth vulnerability.

We believe that this vulnerability is rated at CVSS 7.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L).

### Impact

It is possible for a malicious user who has authorization to log into a Grafana instance via a configured OAuth IdP to take over an existing Grafana account under some conditions.

### Affected versions with HIGH severity

All Grafana >=5.3 versions are affected by this vulnerability.

### Solutions and mitigations

All installations after Grafana v5.3 should be upgraded as soon as possible.

As a workaround it is possible to [disable any OAuth login](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-authentication/generic-oauth/) or ensure that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding user account in Grafana linked to their email address.

Appropriate patches have been applied to [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud) and as always, we closely coordinated with all cloud providers licensed to offer Grafana Pro. They have received early notification under embargo and confirmed that their offerings are secure at the time of this announcement. This is applicable to Amazon Managed Grafana.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
