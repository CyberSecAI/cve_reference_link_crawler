The provided content is related to CVE-2017-10246.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaw in the iHelp component of Oracle E-Business Suite. The application does not properly validate user-supplied URLs, allowing an attacker to make the server send requests to arbitrary internal or external resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Lack of proper input validation of URLs

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Internal information gathering: An attacker can use the vulnerable server to conduct port scans and gather information about internal assets.
- Access to internal resources: An attacker can access resources that are normally not accessible from outside the internal network.
- Query internal server information otherwise not available publicly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By manipulating the `topic` parameter in the `help` URL of the Oracle E-Business Suite application. Specifically, crafting a URL like `http://<EBS_Application>/OA_HTML/help?locale=en_AE&group=per:br_prod_HR:US&topic=http://<Internal_IP:Port>` to make the server issue requests to an arbitrary internal IP address and port

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable Oracle E-Business Suite application. No authentication is specifically required, as stated "remotely exploitable without authentication"
- They need to be able to craft specific URLs, including a target address and port to scan.
