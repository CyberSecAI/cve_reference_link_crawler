Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-26574:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from the GitHub repository `Alaatk/CVE-2024-26574` directly addresses the described CVE. The repository and its README file describe a vulnerability in Wondershare Filmora v.13.0.51 related to insecure file permissions, which allows for privilege escalation.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insecure file/folder permissions assigned during the installation of Wondershare Filmora. Specifically, the folder `C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Wondershare\Wondershare NativePush` has insecure permissions.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Permissions:** The `Wondershare NativePush` folder grants "Full control" (`(F)`) to all users (`BUILTIN\Users`), which should not be the case. This allows any local user to modify files within this directory.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** A service called `WsNativePushService.exe` located in the aforementioned directory, runs with SYSTEM privileges and it can be modified by a local unprivileged user due to the aforementioned insecure permissions.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can gain SYSTEM level privileges.
    *   Arbitrary code execution.
    *   Full control of the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Access:** An attacker must have local access to the target machine.
    *   **File Manipulation:** The attacker replaces the legitimate `WsNativePushService.exe` file with a malicious executable within the insecure folder.
    *   **Service Restart:** The attacker reboots the system to ensure the modified service runs on startup with SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
    *   **File Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to write to the insecure directory (due to the incorrect permissions).
    *   **Reboot System:** Ability to restart the machine

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The GitHub repository provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including the specific ACL permissions that are insecure.
*   It specifies that the vulnerability impacts Wondershare Filmora v.13.0.51 and potentially earlier versions.
*   The exploit involves replacing the `WsNativePushService.exe` with a malicious executable.

**Summary**

The provided content clearly relates to CVE-2024-26574. It details a privilege escalation vulnerability in Wondershare Filmora v.13.0.51 resulting from insecure folder permissions that allow a local attacker to gain SYSTEM privileges by replacing a legitimate service executable.
