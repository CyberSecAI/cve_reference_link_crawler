# CVE-2020-26732

SKYWORTH GN542VF Hardware Version 2.0 and Software Version 2.0.0.16 does not set the Secure flag for the session cookie in an HTTPS session

## Description

SKYWORTH GN542VF Hardware Version 2.0 and Software Version 2.0.0.16 does not set the Secure flag for the session cookie in an HTTPS session, which makes it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie by intercepting its transmission within an HTTP session.

## Additional Information

Each cookie should be carefully reviewed to determine if it contains sensitive data or is relied upon for a security decision. If possible, ensure all communication occurs over an encrypted channel and add the secure attribute to all session cookies or any cookies containing sensitive data.

## VulnerabilityType Other

Web Application Cookies Not Marked Secure

## Vendor of Product

SKYWORTH

## Affected Product Code Base

SKYWORTH GN542VF - Hardware Version 2.0 and Software Version 2.0.0.16

## Affected Component

Web Application Cookies of SKYWORTH GN542VF.

## Attack Type

Local

## Impact Information Disclosure

true

## Attack Vectors

## Discoverer

Jiraput Thamsongkrah
