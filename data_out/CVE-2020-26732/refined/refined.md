Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The SKYWORTH GN542VF device (Hardware Version 2.0 and Software Version 2.0.0.16) fails to set the "Secure" flag for session cookies when using HTTPS.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Secure Flag:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of the "Secure" flag on session cookies. This flag is essential because it instructs browsers to only send the cookie over encrypted (HTTPS) connections. Without this flag, the cookie can be sent over an insecure HTTP connection.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially intercept the session cookie if the userâ€™s connection is downgraded from HTTPS to HTTP (e.g., through a man-in-the-middle attack) or if the cookie is transmitted over a non-encrypted channel.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Once the attacker gains access to the session cookie, they could potentially impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to the user's account or system.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker positioned between the user and the server can intercept network traffic. If the user's browser is tricked into using HTTP instead of HTTPS or if there is an insecure connection, the session cookie can be captured.
    *   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker on the same network as the user could passively monitor network traffic and capture the cookie if it is transmitted over HTTP.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the user and the server. This could be achieved through a MitM attack or by being on the same local network.
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the target device itself. They just need to intercept the traffic, and this could be from a remote position relative to the user.

* **Additional Information**
  * The vulnerability exists within the web application cookies of the SKYWORTH GN542VF.
  * The affected product is SKYWORTH GN542VF - Hardware Version 2.0 and Software Version 2.0.0.16

This information aligns with the description of a missing secure flag on cookies over HTTPS, leading to potential information disclosure.
