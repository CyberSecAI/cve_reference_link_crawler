- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement. This occurs within an AJAX action accessible to unauthenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database or modify it.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` file with the `action` parameter set to `stickybar_display` and a malicious `banner_id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. They can send an unauthenticated POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
