#### Supported Versions

In accordance with our End-User License Agreement (EULA), we provide full support for the two most recent major versions: **Axigen 10.6.x** and **Axigen 10.5.x**.

#### Important Notes & Upgrade Information

**What to expect when upgrading to X6.** When upgrading to X6, some lightweight upgrade jobs will be performed in order to migrate the 2-Step Verification and Account Recovery data to their new home within the Axigen storage. This ensures greater flexibility and room to grow. These updates are designed to run efficiently and should have minimal impact on your service during the upgrade process.

**Discontinuing Standard WebMail.** Our Standard WebMail, maintained for legacy browsers and poor internet connections, has seen a steady decline in usage over the years. As a result, we’ve decided to discontinue it with the release of Axigen X6. Starting with this version, **Standard WebMail will no longer be available.**

**Please note that mailing lists, including their moderation, are not supported in the Ajax WebMail and will only be available via IMAP.**

**Supported versions.** With the X6 release, we’re returning to our standard support policy, which means **the latest two major versions will be supported: X6 (10.6.x) and X5 (10.5.x).**

**No longer supported platforms.** The following platforms are no longer supported: CentOS Stream 8, Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS, Windows 10.

Here you can find instructions on [how to upgrade to Axigen X6](/knowledgebase/How-to-Upgrade-to-Axigen-X6_404.html).
