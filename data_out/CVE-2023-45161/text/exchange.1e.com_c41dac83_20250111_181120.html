## Description

This product pack has a set of instructions that help to get the details around how the Network related settings and peripherals are behaving on the device. Users will have the option to check the settings and view the changes as and when done to the settings.

### Key Features

* The admin can utilize this product pack to check if the website in picture is blocked by a GPO. If required, the admin can add a host file entry onto the end userâ€™s machine without getting hold of his machine and check if the issue is taken care of.
* There is a requirement for the admin to identify machines which utilize Wi-Fi as the default network and then put those machines in a separate collection to have content deployed on them. Admin can utilize this product pack and the instructions to find out those devices and export the results into .csv format.

### Setup

* This Product Pack contains instructions.
* Upload the Product pack either with the help of Tachyon Product Pack Deployment Tool or directly by clicking on Upload button from Instruction set in 1E Platform.
* Create an Instruction Set named **Network** and move all the instructions from Unassigned Set to this set, unless you use Product Pack Deployment Tool which creates it automatically.
