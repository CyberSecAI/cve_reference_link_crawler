##### DESCRIPTION

1E Client installer can perform arbitrary file deletion on protected files. A non-privileged user could provide a symbolic link or Windows junction to point to a protected directory in the installer that the 1E Client would then clear on service startup.

A hotfix is available from the 1E support portal that forces the 1E Client to check for a symbolic link or junction and if it finds one refuses to use that path and instead creates a path involving a random GUID.

for v8.1 use hotfix Q23097

for v8.4 use hotfix Q23105

##### DESCRIPTION

The MSI installer in 1E Client 4.1.0.267 and 5.0.0.745 allows remote authenticated users and local users to gain elevated privileges via the repair option. This applies to installations that have a TRANSFORM (MST) with the option to disable the installation of the Nomad module. An attacker may craft a .reg file in a specific location that will be able to write to any registry key as an elevated user.

##### DESCRIPTION

The %PROGRAMDATA%\1E\Client directory in 1E Client 5.0.0.745 and 4.1.0.267 allows remote authenticated users and local users to create and modify files in protected directories (where they would not normally have access to create or modify files) via the creation of a junction point to a system directory. This leads to partial privilege escalation. This vulnerability can be mitigated by changing the permission of the ProgramData\1E\Client directory so that a standard user does not have the ability to create and modify files.

## Description

This product pack has a set of instructions that help to get the details around how the Network related settings and peripherals are behaving on the device. Users will have the option to check the settings and view the changes as and when done to the settings.

### Key Features

* The admin can utilize this product pack to check if the website in picture is blocked by a GPO. If required, the admin can add a host file entry onto the end user’s machine without getting hold of his machine and check if the issue is taken care of.
* There is a requirement for the admin to identify machines which utilize Wi-Fi as the default network and then put those machines in a separate collection to have content deployed on them. Admin can utilize this product pack and the instructions to find out those devices and export the results into .csv format.

### Setup

* This Product Pack contains instructions.
* Upload the Product pack either with the help of Tachyon Product Pack Deployment Tool or directly by clicking on Upload button from Instruction set in 1E Platform.
* Create an Instruction Set named **Network** and move all the instructions from Unassigned Set to this set, unless you use Product Pack Deployment Tool which creates it automatically.

### Usage

1. Go to Explorer and search for any instruction in this pack, For Example *List IP Addresses with subnet, gateway, network adapter details, etc.*
2. Click **Ask this question**.
3. This retrieves IPv4 and IPv6 details including NIC information, MAC address, etc.
