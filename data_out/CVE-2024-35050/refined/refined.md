Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the GitHub issue:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that user sessions are not invalidated or terminated when an administrator deletes a user account. This allows a deleted user's session to remain active.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Management Issue:** The application fails to properly invalidate active sessions upon user deletion.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A deleted user's session can be used to gain unauthorized access to resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who has a deleted user's session ID can continue to access the application and potentially sensitive information, even though the user's account is no longer active.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By using a deleted user's active session, an attacker can potentially perform actions associated with that user's roles and permissions which they should no longer have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Session ID Acquisition:** The attacker must first obtain a valid session ID of a user.
2.  **User Deletion:** The admin must delete that user's account.
3.  **Session Replay:** The attacker can then use the original session ID to continue interacting with the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Session ID:** The attacker needs to have somehow obtained a valid session ID of a user prior to deletion.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the application with the captured session ID.
*   **No Admin Access Required** The attacker does not need administrator access for the initial compromise.
