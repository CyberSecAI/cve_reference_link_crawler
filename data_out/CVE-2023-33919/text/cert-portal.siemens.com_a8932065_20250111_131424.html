SUMMARY

The CPCI85 ﬁrmware of SICAM A8000 CP-8031 and CP-8050 is affected by multiple vulnerabilities
such as authenticated remote command injection, exposure of serial UART interface, and hard coded
credentials (for UART login).

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations
to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes.
It is therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures
are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue
of the grid design. Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the
corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by
the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may
be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied,
and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment. As a general security
measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g.
ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to our operational
guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SICAM A8000 RTUs (Remote Terminal Units) series is a modular device range for telecontrol and
automation applications in all areas of energy supply.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-33919

The web interface of affected devices is vulnerable to command injection due to missing server side
input sanitation. This could allow an authenticated privileged remote attacker to execute arbitrary code
with root privileges.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-33920

The affected devices contain the hash of the root password in a hard-coded form, which could be
exploited for UART console login to the device. An attacker with direct physical access could exploit
this vulnerability.
