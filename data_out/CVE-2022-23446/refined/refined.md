- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper control of a resource through its lifetime [CWE-664]
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the FortiEDR Collector's handling of resource control, specifically related to folder access permissions. The application does not properly manage access permissions to its root directory, allowing a privileged attacker to manipulate these permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A privileged attacker can render the FortiEDR Collector application unresponsive by changing the access permissions of its root directory, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a privileged attacker changing the access permissions of the application's root directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires high privileges on the system where the FortiEDR Collector is installed to modify the directory permissions.
