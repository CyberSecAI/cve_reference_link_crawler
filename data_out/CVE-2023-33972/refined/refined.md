- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Authenticated users with `CREATE` privileges on a keyspace can escalate their privileges to access a table in the same keyspace, even if they lack direct permissions for that table.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Privilege escalation. Users with the ability to create tables can bypass table-level permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access to tables within the keyspace. Attackers can potentially read, modify, or delete data in tables they shouldn't have access to.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Authenticated user with `CREATE` privileges on a keyspace.
