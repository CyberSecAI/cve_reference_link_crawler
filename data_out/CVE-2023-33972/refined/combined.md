# Privilege escalation from having CREATE access on a keyspace to full permission on a table in that keyspace

High

[avikivity](/avikivity)
published
GHSA-ww5v-p45p-3vhq
Sep 27, 2023

## Package

ScyllaDB

## Affected versions

ALL

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

This is a privilege escalation vulnerabilty. Authenticated users who are authorized to create tables in a keyspace can escalate their privileges to access a table in the same keyspace, even if they don't have permissions for that table.

### Patches

Patches are yet to be posted.

### Workarounds

A workaround is to disable CREATE privileges on a keyspace, and create new tables on behalf of other users.

### References

N/A

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
