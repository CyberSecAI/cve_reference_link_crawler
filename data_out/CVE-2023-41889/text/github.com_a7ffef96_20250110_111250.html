# Late-Unicode normalization vulnerability in shirasagi/shirasagi

Low

[sunny4381](/sunny4381)
published
GHSA-xr45-c2jv-2v9r
Sep 12, 2023

## Package

bundler

shirasagi
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< v1.18.0-RC

## Patched versions

v1.18.0

## Description

### Summary

The snippet code located at [/app/models/concerns/rdf/object.rb#L68-L72](https://github.com/shirasagi/shirasagi/blob/f249ce3f06f6bfbc0017b38f5c13de424334c3ea/app/models/concerns/rdf/object.rb#L68-L72) is vulnerable to a Post-Unicode normalization issue (CWE-176). Such a vulnerability happens when a logical validation or a security check is performed before a Unicode normalization. The Unicode character equivalent of a character would resurface after the normalization.

### Details

Please check the reference for further details on how this vulnerability happens.

### PoC

In a little adapted excerpt of the code snippet. Please run the following PoC.

```
require "unf"
require "active_support/all"

def normalize_name(name)
  return if name.blank?
  # name must be NFKC
  name = UNF::Normalizer.normalize(name.strip, :nfkc)
end

# Case 1: valid
name = "\t\n\v\f\r s \x00\ "
puts "BEFORE: [#{name}]"
name = normalize_name(name)
puts "AFTER: [#{name}] #{name.include? " "}"

# Case 2: not valid
name = "    s   " # surround s with some Unicode whitespace characters.
puts "BEFORE: [#{name}]"
name = normalize_name(name)
puts "AFTER: [#{name}] #{name.include? " "}"

# Case 3: not valid
name = "       "
puts "BEFORE: [#{name}]"
name = normalize_name(name)
puts "AFTER: [#{name}] #{name.nil?}"
```

You can notice that in case:

1. Case 1: the stripping of the whitespaces was successful.
2. Case 2: surrounding the character `s` with one of the Unicode characters: `U+00A0 U+2000 U+2001 U+2002 U+2003 U+2004 U+2005 U+2006 U+2007 U+2008 U+2009 U+200A U+202F U+205F U+3000` would results in the name containing a regular space `U+0020`.
3. Case 3: If ever the `name` holds only the previous Unicode characters, it would become `nil` after the check of `return if name.blank?`.

### Impact

There is two possible impacts. After the call to `normalize_name()`, the `name` either results in a `nil` thus bypassing the check `return if name.blank?` or the `name` contains none-stripped whitespaces.

### Mitigation

The fix is initially performing the Unicode normalization and then strip for all whitespaces and finally check for a blank string if ever.
