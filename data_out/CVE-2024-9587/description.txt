The Linkz.ai plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'ajax_linkz' function in versions up to, and including, 1.1.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level privileges or above, to update plugin settings.
