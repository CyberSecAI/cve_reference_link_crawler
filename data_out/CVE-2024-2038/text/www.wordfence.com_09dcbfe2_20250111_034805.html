### Description

The Visual Website Collaboration, Feedback & Project Management – Atarim plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access in all versions up to, and including, 3.22.6. This is due to the use of hardcoded credentials to authenticate all the incoming API requests. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings, delete posts, modify post titles, and upload images.
