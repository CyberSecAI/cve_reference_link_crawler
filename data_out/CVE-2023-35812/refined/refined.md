Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-35812:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a bypass of a previous fix (for CVE-2019-6111) in OpenSSH's `scp` command. The original fix only addressed cases where an absolute path was used. When a relative path is used, the client does not verify if the name of a file received matches the requested file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Path Verification:** The core weakness is the lack of proper verification of file names when using relative paths with `scp`. This allows a malicious server to send a file with a different name than requested by the client.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File Substitution/Manipulation:** An attacker controlling the server can send a different file than the client expects, leading to potential file overwrite/substitution or introduction of malicious files on the client system.
*   **Integrity Compromise:** This can lead to a compromise of the client system's integrity by replacing legitimate files with malicious ones.
    
**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** A malicious actor could intercept the connection between the `scp` client and server, but the scenario implies control of the server.
*   **Compromised Server:** The primary attack vector involves a malicious or compromised server that can respond to `scp` requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control of the Server:** The attacker needs control of the server that is responding to the client's `scp` requests to send a modified file and bypass the checks.
*   **Client Initiated Connection:** The user needs to initiate a connection using the `scp` command, and request a file via relative path.

**Additional Notes:**
* The content states that the vulnerability is present in OpenSSH 7.4 on Amazon Linux 2 and Amazon Linux 1.
* The CVSS v3 base score is 5.3 which is rated as Medium severity.
* The fix for CVE-2019-6111 was incomplete.
