- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of user-controllable input within the `product_name` argument in the `query` function of the `food.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to compromised user accounts, data theft, or other malicious actions. Impact on integrity is mentioned.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote and requires user interaction to trigger the vulnerability. An attacker injects malicious code into the `product_name` parameter of the `food.php` page. When a user accesses this page, the injected script will execute in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious input into the `product_name` parameter of the application. The attacker does not need to be in the same network as the victim to perform this attack, since its remote.
