Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `login.php` file of the "Courier Management System In PHP With Source Code" project.
- The vulnerability arises because the application does not properly sanitize or validate user input, specifically the "txtusername" parameter, before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application lacks proper input sanitization and validation for the `txtusername` parameter, making it susceptible to SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Sensitive data can be accessed and leaked.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Comprehensive System Control:** The SQL injection may lead to complete control over the system.
- **Service Interruption:** The vulnerability could lead to denial of service (DoS) scenarios.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `login.php` file, by manipulating the `txtusername` parameter in an HTTP POST request.
- The attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `txtusername` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `login.php` file of the vulnerable application.
- No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, as it occurs in the login process itself.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques is required to craft the malicious payloads.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the "Courier Management System In PHP With Source Code".
- The vulnerability can be exploited through time-based blind, boolean-based blind, and error-based SQL injection techniques.
- Proof of concept (POC) is provided, demonstrating the vulnerability and showing examples of payloads to use.
- The vulnerability is located within the `txtusername` parameter
- Remediation steps include using prepared statements with parameter binding, input validation and filtering, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.
