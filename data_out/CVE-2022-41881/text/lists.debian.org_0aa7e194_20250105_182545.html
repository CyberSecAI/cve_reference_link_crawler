Package        : netty
Version        : 1:4.1.33-1+deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-37136 CVE-2021-37137 CVE-2021-43797 CVE-2022-41881
                 CVE-2022-41915
Debian Bug     : 1027180 1014769 1001437

Several out-of-memory, stack overflow or HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities
have been discovered in Netty, a Java NIO client/server socket framework, which
may allow attackers to cause a denial of service or bypass restrictions when
used as a proxy.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:4.1.33-1+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your netty packages.

For the detailed security status of netty please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/netty>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
