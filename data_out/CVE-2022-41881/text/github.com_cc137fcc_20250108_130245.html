# HAProxyMessageDecoder Stack Exhaustion DoS

High

[normanmaurer](/normanmaurer)
published
GHSA-fx2c-96vj-985v
Dec 12, 2022

## Package

maven

io.netty.codec:codec-haproxy
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 4.1.86.Final

## Patched versions

4.1.86.Final

## Description

### Impact

A StackOverflowError can be raised when parsing a malformed crafted message due to an

infinite recursion.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to 4.1.86.Final

### Workarounds

There is no workaround, except using a custom HaProxyMessageDecoder.

### References

When parsing a TLV with type = PP2\_TYPE\_SSL, the value can be again a TLV with type =

PP2\_TYPE\_SSL and so on.

The only limitation of the recursion is that the TLV length cannot be bigger than 0xffff because it

is encoded in an unsigned short type.

Providing a TLV with a nesting level that is large enough will lead to raising of a

StackOverflowError.

The StackOverflowError will be caught if HAProxyMessageDecoder is used as part of Netty’s

ChannelPipeline, but using it directly without the ChannelPipeline will lead to a thrown exception

/ crash.

### Severity

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-41881

No CWEs
