Package        : netty
Version        : 1:4.1.33-1+deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-37136 CVE-2021-37137 CVE-2021-43797 CVE-2022-41881
                 CVE-2022-41915
Debian Bug     : 1027180 1014769 1001437

Several out-of-memory, stack overflow or HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities
have been discovered in Netty, a Java NIO client/server socket framework, which
may allow attackers to cause a denial of service or bypass restrictions when
used as a proxy.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:4.1.33-1+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your netty packages.

For the detailed security status of netty please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/netty>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# HAProxyMessageDecoder Stack Exhaustion DoS

High

[normanmaurer](/normanmaurer)
published
GHSA-fx2c-96vj-985v
Dec 12, 2022

## Package

maven

io.netty.codec:codec-haproxy
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 4.1.86.Final

## Patched versions

4.1.86.Final

## Description

### Impact

A StackOverflowError can be raised when parsing a malformed crafted message due to an

infinite recursion.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to 4.1.86.Final

### Workarounds

There is no workaround, except using a custom HaProxyMessageDecoder.

### References

When parsing a TLV with type = PP2\_TYPE\_SSL, the value can be again a TLV with type =

PP2\_TYPE\_SSL and so on.

The only limitation of the recursion is that the TLV length cannot be bigger than 0xffff because it

is encoded in an unsigned short type.

Providing a TLV with a nesting level that is large enough will lead to raising of a

StackOverflowError.

The StackOverflowError will be caught if HAProxyMessageDecoder is used as part of Nettyâ€™s

ChannelPipeline, but using it directly without the ChannelPipeline will lead to a thrown exception

/ crash.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [netty](https://github.com/netty/netty)

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-41881

### Weaknesses

                 CVE-2022-41915
Debian Bug     : 1027180 1014769 1001437

Several out-of-memory, stack overflow or HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities
have been discovered in Netty, a Java NIO client/server socket framework, which
may allow attackers to cause a denial of service or bypass restrictions when
used as a proxy.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.1.48-4+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your netty packages.

For the detailed security status of netty please refer to
