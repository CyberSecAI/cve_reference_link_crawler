Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4246 (although this is a placeholder, the provided content seems to be related to a specific vulnerability)

**Root Cause:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formQosManageDouble_auto` function of the Tenda i21 firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Overflow:** The `sprintf` function is used to construct a string and store it in `mib_prefix_wl2g` buffer. The `index` variable, which is derived from the user-controlled `ssidIndex` parameter, is not validated, leading to the possibility of writing beyond the bounds of the `mib_prefix_wl2g` buffer.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The firmware does not properly validate the length of the `ssidIndex` parameter before using it in the `sprintf` operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** An attacker can cause a buffer overflow in the stack by providing a crafted, long `ssidIndex` value.
- **Potential for Remote Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, a stack overflow could lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker carefully crafts the overflow data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP POST request to the device's web interface, which includes a vulnerable parameter.
- **`ssidIndex` Parameter:** The attacker controls the `ssidIndex` parameter in the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the device's web interface.
- No specific authentication requirement is mentioned, implying that this may be exploitable without authentication or with default credentials.

**Technical Details:**

- The `formQosManageDouble_auto` function uses the user-provided `ssidIndex` parameter.
- The `ssidIndex` is used to construct a string via `sprintf(mib_prefix_wl2g, "wl2g.ssid%s.", index);`.
- The lack of input validation allows an attacker to provide a long `ssidIndex`, causing a buffer overflow in `mib_prefix_wl2g`.
- The vulnerable firmware version is `i21 V1.0.0.14(4656)`.
- The reported Proof-of-Concept (POC) demonstrates that an attacker can send a POST request with a crafted payload for the `ssidIndex` parameter.
