  "CVE-2024-32663": {
    "description": "The vulnerability is related to improper handling of compressed headers in HTTP/2, which can lead to excessive memory allocation and resource exhaustion.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is the lack of proper handling of HTTP/2 header compression, where a single byte can represent a previously seen arbitrary-size header block. The vulnerability stems from copying the header data instead of using references, which can lead to quadratic complexity in memory usage when processing multiple compressed headers, or when logging duplicate headers.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Resource exhaustion due to excessive memory allocation",
      "Denial of Service (DoS)",
      "Inefficient logging of duplicate headers"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending specially crafted HTTP/2 traffic that leads to Suricata allocating excessive memory, potentially up to 4GB with only 128KB of traffic. Additionally, logging duplicate headers also exacerbates the resource consumption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attack via malicious HTTP/2 traffic"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability, and can perform the attack remotely."
