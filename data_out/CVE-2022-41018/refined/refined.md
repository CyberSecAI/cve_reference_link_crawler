```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses `sprintf` to format command parameters into a stack buffer without checking the size of the parameters against the buffer size, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-120)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted network packet with a vulnerable command to the `DetranCLI` interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device. The attacker needs to know the commands that are vulnerable and their format. A high level of privilege is required to exploit this vulnerability."
