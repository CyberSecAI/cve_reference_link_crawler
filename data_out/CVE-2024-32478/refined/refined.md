The provided content is related to CVE-2024-32478.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Debian package for Git Credential Manager (GCM) incorrectly sets the ownership of installed files and directories to a non-root user (1001:998) instead of root:root.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect file ownership: Files and directories under `/usr/local/share/gcm-core/` were owned by user 1001 instead of root.
- Non-compliance with Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS): The installation path `/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/local/share/gcm-core` are not compliant with FHS, where the application should be installed under `/usr/bin` and `/usr/share/gcm-core` respectively.
- Lack of secure upgrades due to not being in an official repository.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A local user (with uid 1001, which is not root) could replace the `git-credential-manager` binary in `/usr/local/share/gcm-core/` with malicious code. This malicious code could then be executed by any other user on the system, leading to privilege escalation and full compromise of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
Local access is required. An attacker must have the same uid (1001) as the owner of the vulnerable installation files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be a local user on the multi-user Linux system where the vulnerable Debian package is installed
- Attacker needs the same uid that owns the vulnerable files installed by the package.

**Additional Details**
- The fix includes a change to the `pack.sh` script to ensure all files and directories within the Debian package have root ownership.
- The vulnerability is specific to the Debian package and doesn't affect macOS or Windows users.
- This vulnerability affects GCM versions prior to 2.5.0, and is fixed in version 2.5.0 and later.
- The vulnerability was reported by jim-minter.
