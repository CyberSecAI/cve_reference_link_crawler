The provided content is related to **CVE-2024-39825**, not CVE-2024-39818. Therefore, the analysis will be based on the provided information for CVE-2024-39825.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in some Zoom Workplace Apps and Rooms Clients.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The vulnerability is explicitly identified as a buffer overflow, which occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Escalation of privilege: A successful exploit allows an authenticated user to escalate their privileges.
- Remote Code Execution: Due to the nature of buffer overflows, this could potentially lead to remote code execution.
- System compromise: Exploitation could result in a complete compromise of the affected system, leading to data breaches, denial of service, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access: The vulnerability can be exploited through network access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Zoom service.
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Zoom client.

**Affected Products:**
- Zoom Workplace Desktop App for Linux before version 6.0.0
- Zoom Workplace Desktop App for Windows before version 6.0.0
- Zoom Workplace Desktop App for macOS before version 6.0.0
- Zoom Workplace VDI Client for Windows before version 5.17.13
- Zoom Workplace App for iOS before version 6.0.0
- Zoom Workplace App for Android before version 6.0.0
- Zoom Rooms App for Windows before version 6.0.0
- Zoom Rooms App for Mac before version 6.0.0
- Zoom Rooms App for iPad before version 6.0.0

**CVSS Metrics:**
- CVSS Severity: High
- CVSS Score: 8.5
- CVSS Vector String: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
     - AV:N (Network): The attack vector is network-based.
     - AC:H (High): The attack complexity is high, meaning the conditions for a successful exploit are not readily achievable.
     - PR:L (Low): The attacker needs low privileges (i.e., an authenticated user).
     - UI:N (None): User interaction is not required for the exploit to occur.
     - S:C (Changed): A successful exploit changes the security scope.
     - C:H (High): High impact on confidentiality.
     - I:H (High): High impact on integrity.
     - A:H (High): High impact on availability.
