- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user could execute higher privileged actions. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: An unprivileged user would need to call a vulnerable function without proper authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber (an unprivileged user) on the WordPress site.
