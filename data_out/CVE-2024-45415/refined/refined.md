- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `check_data_integrity` function in the HTTPD binary of ZTE routers does not validate the length of the decrypted checksum before storing it on the stack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated attackers can achieve remote code execution (RCE) as root.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted POST request to the router's HTTP server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to the router's HTTP server. The attacker does not require authentication.
