    "Out-of-bounds memory access due to a malformed OID in a SET request to SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB::vacmAccessTable."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted SET request with a malformed OID to the vulnerable SNMP agent.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker with read-write credentials to the SNMP agent can trigger the vulnerability by sending a malformed OID in a SET request."
