## Report

##### Summary

Hello,

As per this documentation `https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html`, only Maintainers and Owners are allowed to view group runners. However, it is also possible for Group developers to view group runners using this access control issue.

[![Screenshot_2024-07-02_at_12.19.10_PM.png](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/7b260cee040dd74d1b7197cbd1f4532ef6e51832/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f65343531386632352d343133382d346530392d623531662d3865616131343062383733332f53637265656e73686f745f323032342d30372d30325f61745f31322e31392e31305f504d2e706e67)

##### Steps to reproduce

1.Create a group and project underneath.

2.Create a group runner here at `https://gitlab.com/groups/<GroupName>/-/runners`.

3.Add a `Developer` user at `https://gitlab.com/groups/<GroupName>/-/group_members`.

4.Login as Developer user.

5.You wont see `https://gitlab.com/groups/<GroupName>/-/runners` as you do not have access to runners as per documentation and is working as intended.

6. Now run following graphQL query.

```
POST /api/graphql HTTP/2

{"operationName":"getRunnerForRegistration","variables":{"id":"gid://gitlab/Ci::Runner/39635406"},"query":"query getRunnerForRegistration($id: CiRunnerID!) {\n  runner(id: $id) {\n    id\n    description\n    ephemeralAuthenticationToken\n    runnerType\n    __typename\n shortSha\n }\n}\n"}
```

7.You need to guess/brute force the runner ID in `variables` parameter above.

8.In response you should see the runner details like description, shortsha, runnertype etc.

##### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Developer users are able to view group runner details if they can guesss/bruteforce runner ID which is against their documentation

##### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Only Group Maintainer/Owners should see the group runner details

##### Output of checks

This bug happens on GitLab.com `GitLab Enterprise Edition 17.2.0-pre a257a0aca54`

Regards,

Ashish
