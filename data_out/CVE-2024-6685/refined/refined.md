{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The GraphQL API allows group developers to view runner details if they know the runner ID, which violates the intended access control where only maintainers and owners should have access.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper access control, Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Group developers can view details of group runners, including description, short SHA, and runner type, which they are not supposed to access according to documentation.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted GraphQL query to the `/api/graphql` endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a group developer and must be able to guess or brute-force the runner ID."
