- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Geo Controller plugin unserializes user input via some of its AJAX actions and REST API routes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** PHP Object Injection vulnerability due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated users can potentially achieve remote code execution by crafting malicious serialized payloads if a suitable gadget is present in the blog.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through AJAX actions or REST API routes of the plugin by sending a malicious serialized PHP object in the `options` parameter of the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=cf_geoplugin_shortcode_cache` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
