{
  "cveId": "CVE-2024-32459",
  "description": "Out-of-bounds read in ncrush_decompress function in FreeRDP. An attacker can cause an out-of-bounds read by providing a crafted RDP stream.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The `ncrush_decompress` function in FreeRDP reads 4 bytes from the input data without checking if the input size is at least 4 bytes. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read when the input data size is less than 4.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering the out-of-bounds read. The impact is limited to a crash due to the read, rather than full compromise.",
    "attackVector": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious RDP server sending a crafted RDP stream to a vulnerable FreeRDP client, or by an attacker-controlled RDP client connecting to a vulnerable FreeRDP server.",
      "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send a crafted RDP stream to a vulnerable FreeRDP instance. This can be achieved by controlling an RDP server or by having an RDP client that can connect to a vulnerable server."
