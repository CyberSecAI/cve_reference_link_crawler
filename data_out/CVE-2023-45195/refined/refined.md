Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability and the fix:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the server input in the Adminer application, specifically within the `SERVER` parameter used for database connection. The application previously allowed arbitrary URLs in the server field, which could be exploited to connect to malicious servers or perform unintended actions. The vulnerability was present in the way Adminer parsed and used the server address, particularly when constructing the connection URL for database drivers such as Elasticsearch and ClickHouse.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application failed to properly sanitize or validate the `SERVER` input, allowing users to specify URLs with arbitrary schemes, hosts, paths, usernames, passwords, queries, fragments, and ports.
2.  **Insecure URL Construction:** The `build_http_url` function was susceptible to injection of unwanted characters by manipulating the server input parameters. This could lead to the construction of malicious URLs that could be used by HTTP drivers.
3. **Missing Validation of URL Parts:** The application was not validating the parts of a given URL. The scheme was not properly validated (only `http://` and `https://` should be allowed), and username, password, query and fragment parameters should not be used.
4. **Missing Validation of Privileged Ports:** The application was not properly validating the ports the user was trying to connect to, allowing the user to attempt connections to privileged ports.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could potentially:

1.  **Connect to Malicious Servers:** By providing a crafted URL, an attacker could redirect the Adminer application to connect to a malicious server instead of the intended database server.
2.  **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation:** If the malicious server mimics the legitimate database server, the attacker could potentially intercept, modify, or exfiltrate data transmitted between the Adminer application and the server.
3. **Bypass security controls:** By providing a crafted URL, the attacker could bypass intended security controls, potentially leading to further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

The primary attack vector is through the `SERVER` parameter in the Adminer application's login form. An attacker would need to manipulate this field to inject a malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the Adminer login form.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable input field, and be able to manipulate it.

**Fix:**

The provided commits implement the following mitigations:

1.  **Input Validation:** The `validate_server_input()` function now parses the SERVER URL using `parse_url()`, and checks for unwanted parts: username, password, query, fragment. Additionally, it validates the scheme to ensure it is either `http` or `https`, and checks for slashes in the host and port parts, preventing unexpected paths and ensuring no port is used under 1024 or above 65535.
2.  **Secure URL Construction:** The `build_http_url()` function is updated to validate the server input and construct the URL by using provided values, and uses default port values for Elasticsearch (9200) and ClickHouse (8123). It uses a regular expression to extract the scheme, host, and port from the server parameter, then constructs the final URL safely.
3. **Default Host/Port:** Default host and port were added for ElasticSearch and ClickHouse drivers.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit message `Validate server input` gives a clear explanation of the changes, preventing arbitrary URLs in the server parameter.
