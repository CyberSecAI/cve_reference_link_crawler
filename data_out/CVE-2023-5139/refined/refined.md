Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5139

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `copy_reverse_words` function within the Zephyr STM32 Crypto driver.
- The function has an ineffective assertion check (`__ASSERT_NO_MSG(dst_len >= src_len)`) which can be bypassed when `src_len` is attacker controlled. This leads to a buffer overflow in the `memcpy` call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in the `memcpy` operation of the `copy_reverse_words` function.
- Ineffective assertion check that doesn't prevent the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Potential impacts range from denial of service (DoS) to arbitrary code execution.
-  Specifically, the provided advisory mentions: "If the unchecked length above is confirmed to be attacker-controlled and if input crosses a security boundary, the impact of the buffer overflow vulnerability could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution."
-  The CVSS base metrics include low confidentiality, no integrity impact, and low availability impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable locally.
- `src_len` in `copy_reverse_words` is the key input that, if attacker-controlled, can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs low privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
- No user interaction is required.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `copy_reverse_words` function is called from: `crypto_stm32_ctr_encrypt()`, `crypto_stm32_ctr_decrypt()`, or `crypto_stm32_session_setup()`,  if `src_len` is attacker-controlled.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Zephyr RTOS versions <= 3.4.0.
- A patch has been implemented in the main branch of the project: [#61839](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/pull/61839)
- The CVSS score is 4.4, indicating a moderate severity.
- The affected code is located in `drivers/crypto/crypto_stm32.c`
