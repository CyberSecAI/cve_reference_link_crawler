[WEB APPLICATION VULNERABILITIES](/vulnerabilities/)

[Standard & Premium](/vulnerabilities/web/)
# HTML Injection

## Description

HTML Injection is an attack that is similar to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). While in the XSS vulnerability the attacker can inject and execute Javascript code, the HTML injection attack only allows the injection of certain HTML tags. When an application does not properly handle user supplied data, an attacker can supply valid HTML code, typically via a parameter value, and inject their own content into the page. This attack is typically used in conjunction with some form of social engineering, as the attack is exploiting a code-based vulnerability and a user's trust.

Attack scenario (OWASP)

A possible attack scenario is demonstrated below:

* Attacker discovers injection vulnerability and decides to use an HTML injection attack
* Attacker crafts malicious link, including his injected HTML content, and sends it to a user via email
* The user visits the page due to the page being located within a trusted domain
* The attacker's injected HTML is rendered and presented to the user asking for a username and password
* The user enters a username and password, which are both sent to the attackers server

## Remediation

Your script should filter metacharacters from user input.

# HTML Injection in extended search error message

Low

[NicolasCARPi](/NicolasCARPi)
published
GHSA-cjww-pr9f-4c4w
Oct 14, 2024

## Package

elabftw
(elabftw)

## Affected versions

<5.1.5

## Patched versions

5.1.5

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML tags in the pages: "experiments.php" (show mode), "database.php" (show mode) or "search.php". It works by providing HTML code in the extended search string, which will then be displayed back to the user in the error message.

This means that injected HTML will appear in a red "alert/danger" box, and be part of an error message. Due to some other security measures, it is not possible to execute arbitrary javascript from this attack.

As such, this attack is deemed low impact.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to at least version 5.1.5.

### Workarounds

No workarounds, only upgrade.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
