Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-47826

**Root Cause:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the extended search functionality, specifically within the error message display.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **HTML Injection:** The application allows users to inject arbitrary HTML tags into the error message displayed in response to an invalid search query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious HTML into the error message.
*   The injected HTML is rendered in the context of the application, but is limited to HTML elements, not Javascript execution due to other security measures. 
*   This can be used for phishing, defacement, or social engineering attacks by manipulating the error message content.
*   The impact is rated as low because Javascript execution is not possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** An attacker can send a crafted request to the application.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The user must trigger the error message by performing a search with injected HTML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to send requests to the server.
*   The attacker must know how the search functionality works to craft the input with HTML injection.
*   The attacker needs high privileges to perform a search, although this might refer to access to search functionality, and not necessarily administrative privileges.

**Additional Information:**

* The vulnerability is present in `experiments.php`, `database.php` and `search.php` when using extended search.
*   The injected HTML will be displayed within a red "alert/danger" box, as part of an error message.
*  The vulnerability was found by Harinder Singh and reported through a bug bounty program.
*   The vulnerability is classified under CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) and CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')).
*   The CVSS v3 score is 3.5 (Low) due to the limitation of not being able to execute javascript and is a CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L
