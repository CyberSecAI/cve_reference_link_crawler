- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Activity Log plugin is vulnerable to CSV injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize data when exporting to a CSV file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious formulas into the CSV file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: When the crafted CSV file is opened in a spreadsheet program, the injected formulas can be executed, potentially leading to:
    - Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the spreadsheet software.
    - Execution of commands on the victim's PC, granting access or enabling further malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could inject malicious formulas into the data exported by the plugin to CSV format.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
