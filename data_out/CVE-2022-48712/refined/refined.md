The provided content relates to CVE-2022-48712.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper error handling within the `ext4_fc_record_modified_inode()` function in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem implementation. Specifically, the code did not fully account for the possibility of `krealloc()` failing during the resizing of the `fc_modified_inodes` array.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** If `krealloc()` fails, the code does not handle the error correctly, potentially leading to memory corruption due to the use of an invalid pointer.
- **Kernel Bug:** The failure to handle the `krealloc()` error could also trigger a kernel bug.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in:
- Silent memory corruption
- Kernel bugs/crashes

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered during fast commit replay operations in the ext4 filesystem, particularly when the number of modified inodes exceeds the initially allocated size of the `fc_modified_inodes` array.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the ability to trigger fast commit replay operations within the ext4 filesystem. This would likely require local access to the system with the ability to mount and interact with ext4 file systems. No information on the specific privileges required is available in the provided text.

**Additional details:**
The fix involves adding error handling after the `krealloc()` call in `ext4_fc_record_modified_inode()` and cleaning up duplicated error handling logic in other functions within the `fast_commit.c` file by adding `goto out;` statements in several other functions, and adding a cleanup routine before `return 0;`.
