The provided content is related to CVE-2022-25201.

**CVE-2022-25201** is associated with a missing permission check vulnerability in the Checkmarx Plugin for Jenkins.

**Root Cause:** The Checkmarx Plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

**Vulnerability:** Missing permission check, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information. Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests, leading to a CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2022-25200).

**Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified webserver using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, thus capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

**Attack Vectors:** Network access to the Jenkins instance is required. The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permissions and must be able to get a hold of credentials IDs through other means to use them in this attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have Overall/Read permission in the Jenkins instance. They also need to be able to connect to the Jenkins instance over the network and have prior access to credential IDs.
