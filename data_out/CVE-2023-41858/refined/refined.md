- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Order Delivery Date for WP e-Commerce plugin <= 1.2 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into triggering it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to perform an action via a crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
