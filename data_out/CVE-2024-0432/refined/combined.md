I published a 42-page PDF as a flipbook. Works great when viewed in Firefox, but in Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Internet Explorer all I get is a “Loading” indicator that spins forever.

I am testing this plugin for a client. It took a while to find the [X] to close the display because I am logged in and the tool bar obscures it. That said, it seems to work reasonably well on a laptop computer, but it is not responsive. The first page is only half visible and the second page is only half visible (the other half).
So — while it looks promising for a desktop/laptop it seems hopeless for mobile users.

This beats majority of other plugins out there. Works as expected without any issues. Keep up the good work author!

Seems like a great plugin but the ability to not edit the page layout renders it useless as it just takes over the page default and doesn’t always work with the theme you choose.

### Description

The Gestpay for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 20221130. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'ajax\_delete\_card' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete the default card token for a user via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
