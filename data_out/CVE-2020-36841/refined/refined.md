Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check in the `woocommerce_coupon_admin_init` function of the WooCommerce Smart Coupons plugin. This function is hooked to the `admin_init` action, which is accessible to any site visitor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Authorization:** The plugin fails to verify if the user has the necessary privileges to access the coupon creation functionality. Specifically, it does not check if the user has the `manage_woocommerce` capability before processing the coupon creation request.
*   **Insecure use of `admin_init` hook:** The plugin hooks the coupon creation logic to the `admin_init` action without proper capability checks, making it accessible to unauthenticated users.
*   **Direct access to GET parameters:** The plugin relies on `$_GET` parameters `action=sent_gift_certificate` and `page=wc-smart-coupons` to determine whether to send a gift certificate. These parameters are not validated for user privileges, which allows unauthenticated users to trigger the gift certificate sending logic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthenticated Coupon Creation:** Attackers can create gift certificates of any value without needing to log in or have any special permissions.
*   **Financial Loss:** These gift certificates can be used to purchase products on the victim's storefront, resulting in financial loss for the store owner.
*  **Fraudulent Store Credit**: Attackers can generate fraudulent store credit, which are treated as coupons in the system, and use them for purchases

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Request:** Attackers can send a crafted request to `/wp-admin/admin-post.php` or `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the necessary parameters ( `page=wc-smart-coupons&action=sent_gift_certificate`) and coupon details to generate gift certificates.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need any user account or special privileges on the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional details:**

*   The `admin_init` hook is accessible to any site visitor, including unauthenticated users, allowing them to trigger the vulnerable function.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 4.6.5 of the plugin.
*   The generated store credit/coupons cannot be automatically invalidated and must be manually deleted to prevent misuse.
*   The content provides details on how to identify potentially fraudulent coupons by analyzing access logs and database entries.
