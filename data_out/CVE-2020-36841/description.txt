The WooCommerce Smart Coupons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the woocommerce_coupon_admin_init function in versions up to, and including, 4.6.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send themselves gift certificates of any value, which could be redeemed for products sold on the victimâ€™s storefront.
