Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `config_ISCGroupNoCache.php` file of the Netentsec NS-ASG application security gateway.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (specifically the `GroupId` parameter) before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Server Harm:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to cause harm to the server, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or denial of service.
- **Database Information Disclosure:** The provided exploit example demonstrates the ability to extract sensitive information from the database, including admin usernames and the database name itself.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint: `/admin/config_ISCGroupNoCache.php`.
- **Manipulated `GroupId` Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code via the `GroupId` parameter in the query string.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application's admin interface to send the malicious HTTP request.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payload.

**Additional details:**
- The affected software is the Netentsec NS-ASG application security gateway version 6.3.
- The vulnerable file is `/admin/config_ISCGroupNoCache.php`.
- An example exploit URL is provided: `<https://1.85.53.53/admin/config_ISCGroupNoCache.php?GroupId=1%20and%20extractvalue(0x1,%20concat(0x1,%20(select%20concat(adminname,%200x7e,%20database())%20from%20Admin%20limit%201)))>`
