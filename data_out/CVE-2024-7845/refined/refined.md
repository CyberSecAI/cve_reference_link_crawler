Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an unrestricted SQL injection vulnerability in the `fetch_it.php` file of the Online Graduate Tracer System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to a lack of proper input sanitization or parameterized queries. Specifically, the `request` parameter is directly used in a SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can obtain sensitive server information by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability. This could include database structure, usernames, passwords, and other potentially critical data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `fetch_it.php` file, where the `request` parameter is manipulated to include SQL injection payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `fetch_it.php` endpoint. No special authentication or privileges are mentioned as necessary, implying that it might be exploitable by an unauthenticated user.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is named "request".
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) shows how an attacker can inject SQL code using the `updatexml` function to extract information, specifically the database name.
- The vulnerable code is located in `/tracking/admin/fetch_it.php`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content includes images showcasing the code and the impact of the exploit, providing more visual detail on the exploit process.
- The provided POC demonstrates a successful injection and the resulting information disclosure.
- The issue has been identified and reported by a user named "zhangMingMing".
