Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromSetWirelessRepeat` function of the Tenda AC18 router's firmware.

**Vulnerability:**
- The function copies user-provided data from the `wpapsk_crypto` parameter into a stack-based buffer (`victim_buf`) using `strcpy`.
- There is no length check on the input, allowing an attacker to overflow the buffer `vuln_buf` which is located on the stack.

**Impact:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, likely crashing the router.

**Attack Vector:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP GET request to `/goform/WifiExtraSet`.
- The attacker needs to provide an overly long string for the `wpapsk_crypto` parameter in the HTTP GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface, typically requiring being on the same LAN or having remote access through port forwarding.
- The attacker doesn't require authentication to exploit this vulnerability because the vulnerable code is reachable without authentication.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code is reachable through the `/goform/WifiExtraSet` endpoint, which is likely part of the router's web-based management interface.
- The PoC provided demonstrates how to send an HTTP GET request with an oversized `wpapsk_crypto` parameter to trigger the overflow.
- The vulnerability affects the latest version of the Tenda AC18 router at the time of reporting ([AC18\_V15.03.05.19(6318)](https://www.tenda.com.cn/download/detail-2683.html)).
