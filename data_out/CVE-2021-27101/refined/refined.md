Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-27101:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The core issue is a SQL injection vulnerability in the Accellion FTA (File Transfer Appliance) software. This allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries executed by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The provided information doesn't specify the exact impact. However, SQL injection vulnerabilities can lead to severe consequences, including:
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database.
    *   Data modification or deletion.
    *   Potential compromise of the underlying system if the database server is misconfigured or vulnerable itself.
    *   In some cases, complete system takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP request to an unspecified endpoint within the Accellion FTA software.
*   The crafted request uses a malicious "Host" header to inject SQL code into the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable FTA server.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and the method to inject SQL via the Host header.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable versions are FTA 9\_12\_370 and earlier.
*   The fixed version is FTA\_9\_12\_380 and later.
