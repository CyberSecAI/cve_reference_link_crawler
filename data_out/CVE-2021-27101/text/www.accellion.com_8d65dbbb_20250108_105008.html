# Security Update

## Accellion Announces End of Life (EOL) for its Legacy FTA Product

### FTA End of Life Effective April 30, 2021

February 25, 2021

Accellion USA, LLC is announcing End of Life for its legacy FTA software effective April 30, 2021. Accellion will continue to provide support and honor its FTA contracts for the duration of its existing License Terms.

If your renewal date for your FTA software is after April 30, 2021, you will not be allowed to renew and your FTA license will end.

The FTA software is Accellion’s 20 year old legacy product. For the past three years, Accellion has been attempting to move its existing FTA customers over to our modern and more secure platform, Kiteworks®.

Accellion would be honored to keep the terms at renewal time (or earlier) if you would like to upgrade to our flagship Kiteworks Content Firewall platform. Accellion would assist, at no additional cost, in the migration process to Kiteworks and will work with you on the time period to achieve this transition.

## About Accellion

The Kiteworks platform provides customers with a Private Content Network that delivers content governance, compliance, and protection. The platform unifies, tracks, controls, and secures sensitive content moving within, into, and out of their organization, significantly improving risk management and ensuring regulatory compliance on all sensitive content communications.
