ASUS router RT-AX88U has a vulnerability of using externally controllable format strings within its Advanced Open VPN function. An authenticated remote attacker can exploit the exported OpenVPN configuration to execute an externally-controlled format string attack, resulting in sensitivity information leakage, or forcing the device to reset and permanent denial of service.
