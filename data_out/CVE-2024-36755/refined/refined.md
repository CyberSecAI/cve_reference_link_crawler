- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The device does not properly validate the SSL certificate during over-the-web firmware updates from D-Link download servers. This allows for a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where a malicious actor could spoof the update server and provide a compromised firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient SSL certificate validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious firmware onto the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Over-the-web firmware update process, specifically targeting the download server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to perform a MITM attack and spoof the official D-Link update servers, redirecting device's firmware update requests to malicious servers.
