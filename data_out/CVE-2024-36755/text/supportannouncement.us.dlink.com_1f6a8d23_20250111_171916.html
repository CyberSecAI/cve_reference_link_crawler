DIR-1950 :: All Models :: End-of-Life (EoL) / End-of-Service (EoS) :: Reported Vulnerability

**Publication ID:** SAP10401

**Resolved Status:** Yes

**Published on:** 24 June 2024 11:52 GMT

**Last updated on:** 27 June 2024 10:18 GMT

**Overview**

The DIR-1950 legacy devices (All Models / All Hardware Revisions / All Firmware) are listed below, with details in the table. All Models and all hardware revisions have reached their End of Life ("EOL") /End of Service Life ("EOS”) Cycle.  D-Link North America recommends that D-Link devices that have reached EOL/EOS are to be retired and replaced. If you are outside North America, please get in touch with your regional office for recommendations ([LINK](https://us.dlink.com/en/change-region)).

Additional protection is built into the hardware, so the firmware update mechanism of D-Link products verifies the legitimacy and authenticity of the downloaded firmware to ensure it is the official version.

As a general policy, when products reach EOS/EOL, they can no longer be supported, and all firmware development for these products ceases.  Please read the information and recommendations **below**.

                             **Reported:** 06/13/2024

                             CVE-2024-36755 : [Here](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36755)

                             **Link to Disclosure:** [Here](https://github.com/YjjNJUPT/AsiaCCS2024_vul_report)

            **Summary:** When performing an over-the-web update from D-Link download servers, the device must correctly validate the provided SSL certificate. If the service were spoofed maliciously to download software not from the official servers, this would lead to an attack vector.

**Affected Models**

| **Model** | **Region** | Hardware Revision | End of Support | **Legacy Website** | **Last Updated** |

| DIR-1950 | Worldwide | All Series H/W Revisions | 03/29/2024 | Yes([Link](https://legacy.us.dlink.com/)) | 06/27/2024 |

**Recommendation for End-of-Support/End-of-Life Products**

From time to time, D-Link will decide that some of its products have reached the End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life (“EOL”). D-Link may choose to EOS/EOL a product due to technological evolution, market demands, innovations, product efficiencies based on the latest technologies, or the product maturing over time and should be replaced by functionally superior technology.

**For US Consumer**

If a product has reached the End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life ("EOL"), it usually does not receive further extended support or development.  Typically, D-Link cannot resolve device or firmware issues for these products since all development and customer support have ceased.

D-Link strongly advises against using end-of-support products, as their continued use may pose significant risks to the devices connected to them. Suppose US consumers choose to disregard this advice. In that case, it is crucial to ensure the device has the most recent firmware, frequently update its unique password for web-configuration access, and continuously enable WIFI encryption with a unique password.

**Regarding the Security Update for Your D-Link Device**

Installing firmware updates is critical in addressing security vulnerabilities in your D-Link devices. D-Link strongly urges all users to install the relevant updates and regularly check for further updates. After downloading the firmware update, it is essential to ALWAYS validate its success by comparing the firmware version on your product interface to the firmware update version.

Please note that beta software, beta firmware, or a hot-fix release is still undergoing rigorous testing before its official release. This ensures that the software is of the highest quality and meets our stringent standards. However, it is essential to understand that the user assumes all risk and liability for its use. D-Link does not provide express or implied warranties regarding the suitability or usability of the beta software, beta firmware, or hot-fix release. D-Link will not be liable for any direct, indirect, special, or consequential loss suffered by any party due to their use of the beta firmware, beta software, or hit-fix release.

**NOTE:** Our products have different hardware revisions, so please check your device’s hardware revision before downloading the corresponding firmware update. The hardware revision can be found on the product label next to the serial number or on the device's web interface.
