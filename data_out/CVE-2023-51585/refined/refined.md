- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call within the shutdown method.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely. It requires user interaction to trigger the shutdown operation. An attacker would need to provide a malicious string that is then used in a system call.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to interact with the application in a manner that will trigger a shutdown operation, although the vulnerability can be exploited remotely. The interaction is triggered by an administrator.
