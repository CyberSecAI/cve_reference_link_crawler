# GRUB: Authentication bypass — GLSA **201512-03**

GRUB's authentication prompt can be bypassed by entering a sequence
of backspace characters.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-boot/grub** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.02\_beta2-r8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.02\_beta2-r8**revision >= **0.97** |

### Background

GNU GRUB is a multiboot boot loader used by most Linux systems.

### Description

An integer underflow in GRUB’s username/password authentication code
has been discovered.

### Impact

An attacker with access to the system console may bypass the username
prompt by entering a sequence of backspace characters, allowing them e.g.
to get full access to GRUB’s console or to load a customized kernel.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GRUB 2.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-boot/grub-2.02_beta2-r8"

```

After upgrading, make sure to run the grub2-install command with options
appropriate for your system. See the GRUB2 Quick Start guide in the
references below for examples. Your system will be vulnerable until this
action is performed.
