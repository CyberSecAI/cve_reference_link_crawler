Debian Bug     : 807614

Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll, from Cybersecurity UPV Research Group,
found an integer underflow vulnerability in Grub2, a popular bootloader.
A local attacker can bypass the Grub2 authentication by inserting a
crafted input as username or password.

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory [http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin](//linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin)

## Description

A vulnerability in **Grub2** has been found. Versions from
1.98 (December, 2009) to 2.02 (December, 2015) are affected.
The vulnerability can be exploited under certain circumstances,
allowing local attackers to bypass any kind of authentication
(plain or hashed passwords). And so, the attacker may take
control of the computer.

Grub2 is the bootloader used by most Linux systems including
some embedded systems. This results in an incalculable number
of affected devices.

As shown in the picture, we successfully exploited this
vulnerability in a Debian 7.5 under Qemu getting a **Grub
rescue shell**.

### Am I vulnerable ?

To quickly check if your system is vulnerable, when the Grub
ask you the username, press the *Backspace* 28 times. If
your machine reboots or you get a **rescue shell** then your
Grub is affected.

## Impact

An attacker which successfully exploits this vulnerability will
obtain a Grub rescue shell. Grub rescue is a very powerful shell
allowing to:

* **Elevation of privilege:** The attacker is authenticated
  without knowing a valid username nor the password. The
  attacker has full access to the grub's console (grub
  rescue).
* **Information disclosure:** The attacker can load a
  customized kernel and initramfs (for example from a USB) and
  then from a more comfortable environment, copy the full disk
  or install a rootkit.
* **Denial of service:** The attacker is able to destroy
  any data including the grub itself. Even in the case that the
  disk is ciphered the attacker can overwrite it, causing a
  DoS.

## The Vulnerability

The fault (bug) is in the code of Grub since version 1.98
(December, 2009). The commit which introduced the fault was
b391bdb2f2c5ccf29da66cecdbfb7566656a704d, affecting
the grub\_password\_get() function.

There are two functions which suffer the same integer
underflow fault. The grub\_username\_get()
and grub\_password\_get() located in
grub-core/normal/auth.c and lib/crypto.c
respectively. Both functions are equal except for a call
to printf() in the grub\_username\_get(). The PoC
described here is based only on exploiting
the grub\_username\_get() to obtain a **Grub rescue
shell**.

Below is the vulnerable grub\_username\_get() function:

| ``` static int grub_username_get (char buf[], unsigned buf_size) {   unsigned cur_len = 0;   int key;    while (1)     {       key = grub_getkey ();       if (key == '\n' || key == '\r')         break;        if (key == '\e')         {           cur_len = 0;           break;         }        if (key == '\b')  // Does not checks underflows !!         {           cur_len--; // Integer underflow !!           grub_printf ("\b");           continue;         }        if (!grub_isprint (key))         continue;        if (cur_len + 2 < buf_size)         {           buf[cur_len++] = key; // Off-by-two !!           grub_printf ("%c", key);         }     }    grub_memset( buf + cur_len, 0, buf_size - cur_len); // Out of bounds overwrite    grub_xputs ("\n");   grub_refresh ();    return (key != '\e'); }  ``` |
| --- |
| Function grub\_username\_get() at grub-core/normal/auth.c  --- |

The fault is caused by decrementing the cur\_len variable
without checking the range.

## The Exploit (PoC)

Exploiting the integer underflow can be used to cause an
**Off-by-two** or an **Out of bounds overwrite** memory
errors. The former error, overwrites up to two bytes right
under the username buffer (local variable
called login at
function grub\_auth\_check\_authentication()), but this
area does not contain any usable information to build an
attack; actually, it is padding.

The latter error, the **Out of bounds overwrite**, is more
interesting because it allows to overwrite with zeros the
zone below to the username buffer. This is because
the **grub\_memset()** function tries to set to
zero all unused bytes of the username buffer. To do that, the
code calculates the address of the first unused byte and how
many bytes have to be zeroed in the buffer. The results of
these calculations are passed as arguments to
the grub\_memset() function:

    grub\_memset (buf + cur\_len, 0, buf\_size - cur\_len);

For example, typing "root" as usermane,
cur\_len is 5, and the grub\_memset()
function will clear (set to zero) bytes form 5
to 1024-5 (the username and password buffers are
1024 bytes) of the username buffer. This way of programming
is quite robust. For example, if the typed username is stored
in a clean 1024-byte array, then we can compare the whole
1024-bytes with the valid username, rather than comparing
both strings. This protects against some short of
side-channels attacks, like timing attacks.

To abuse the **out of bound overwrite**, the attacker
can press the *backspace* key to underflow
the cur\_len variable, producing a very high value.
This value is later used to calculate the starting address to clear.

    **memset destination address =**
buf + cur\_len

At this point, **a second overflow occurs** because
the addition of this big value with the base address where
the username buffer resides can not be hold in a 32-bit
variable. Hence, we need to manage the first underflow and
this second overflow to calculate the destination address
where the grub\_memset() function will start to set
to zeros the buffer:

    cur\_len--; // Integer Underflow

    grub\_memset (buf + cur\_len, 0, buf\_size - cur\_len); // Integer Overflow

The following example helps to understand how we can exploit this.
Assuming that the username buffer resides in the address
0x7f674 and the attacker press the
*backspace* key only once (producing an underflow to 0xFFFFFFFF)
the resulting memset will be:

    grub\_memset (0x7f673, 0, 1025);

The first argument is: (buf+cur\_len) =
(0x7f674+0xFFFFFFFF) = (0x7f674-1) = **0x7f673**, the second argument:
is the constant value used to overwrite the area, in this case **0**, and the third argument is the number of bytes
to overwrite: (buf\_size-cur\_len) = (1024-(-1)) =
**1025**. Therefore, the whole username buffer (1024) plus the very
first byte under the buffer will be set to zero.

Therefore, the number *backspace* keystrokes (without
introducing any username), is the number of bytes below the
username that are zeroed.

Now, we are able to overwrite an arbitrary number of bytes
below the username, we need to find out an interesting memory address
that we can overwrite with zeros. A quick look to the current stack
frame reveals that we were able to **overwrite the return
address of the grub\_memset() function**. The following
picture sketches the stack memory layout:

|  |
| --- |
| Grub2: Redirecting the control flow.  --- |

As shown in the above picture, the return address of the
grub\_memset() function is at a distance of 16-bytes from the
username buffer. In other words, if we press the *backspace* key
17 times, we will overwrite the highest byte of the return address.
So, instead of returning to the caller function at 0x07eb53e8 we will jump to
0x00eb53e8.
When the grub\_memset() ends, control flow is redirected to the
the 0x00eb53e8
address causing a reboot. The same occurs if we press the *backspace* key
18, 19 or 20 times, in all cases the system reboots.

At this point, **we are able to redirect the control
flow**.

We will skip the detailed analysis of the code at:
0x00eb53e8, 0x000053e8 and 0x000000e8, because they jump
to code that reboots the computer and there is no way to
control the execution flow.

Although it seems quite difficult to build a successful
attack just jumping to 0x0, we will show how to do it.

### Is there life after jumping to 0x0 ?

At address 0x0 resides the IVT (Interrupt Vector Table) of
the processor. It contains a variety of pointers in the form
of segment:offset.

|  |
| --- |
| The lowest part of the IVT interpreted as code.  --- |

At this early stage of the boot sequence, the processor and
the execution framework is not fully functional. Next are
the main differences with respect to the execution
environment of a regular process:

* The processor is in "protected mode". Grub2 enables this mode at the very beginning.
* Virtual memory is not enabled.
* No memory protection. The memory is readable/writable/executable. That is, no NX/DEP.
* The processor executes the 32-bit instruction set, even in 64-bit architectures.
* Self modifying code is automatically handled by the processor: "*If
  the write affects a prefetched instruction, the prefetch queue is
  invalidated.*"
* No Stack Smashing Protector (SSP).
* No Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).

Therefore, jumping to 0x0 does not cause a trap by itself, but we
need to control the execution flow to reach the target
function **grub\_rescue\_run()** which contains the
main loop of the **Grub2 Rescue Shell**.
### What do we control when jumping to 0x0

| The main "while" loop of the grub\_username\_get() ends when the user hits either the [Enter] or the [Esc] key. The register **%ebx** contains the value of the last typed key (0xd or 0x8, Enter or Esc ascii codes respectively). The register **%esi** holds the value of the **cur\_len** variable. The instruction pointer points to the 0x0 address. The **%esi** register contains the value **-28** (the exploit works by pressing 28 times the backspace), and then hitting [Enter] (**%ebx == 0xb**). | ```  eax       0x7f658 ecx       0x0		(0) edx       0x0		(0) ebx       0xd		(13) esp       0x7f664 ebp       0x0		(0) esi       0xffff ffe4	(-28) edi       0x0		(0) eip       0x0		(0) esp       0x7f664 eflags    0x200046[ PF ZF ID ] ``` Relevant CPU registers. |
| --- | --- |

### Reverse engineering of the IVT

If the state of the processor is the one summarized in the
previous table, the code at IVT implements something like a
memcpy(), which copies from the address pointed by
%esi to 0x0 (to itself). Therefore, **IVT is a self modifying
code**, and we can select the block of code that we want to copy
from.

The following sequence shows the sequence of code actually executed
the register  %esi has the value **-28**
(**0xffffffe4**):

|  |
| --- |
| First iteration.  --- |
|  |
| Second iteration.  --- |

In the third iteration, the resulting code contains
a **retw** instruction at **0x0007**. The value pointer
by %esp is **0xe00c**. And so, when the retw
instruction is executed, the execution flow jumps
into **0xe00c**. This address belongs to the
function  **grub\_rescue\_run()**:

| ```  <grub_rescue_run>:   0xdfef:    push   %ebp   0xdff0:    mov    %esp,%ebp   0xdff2:    sub    $0x24,%esp   0xdff5:    push   $0xe90a   0xdffa:    call   0xd53b   #     0xdfff:    add    $0x10,%esp   0xe002:    call   0xbfd2   #       0xe007:    xor    %edx,%edx   0xe009:    lea    -0xc(%ebp),%eax ->0xe00c:    movl   $0x0,0x16ce0-->   0xe016:    call   0xdf28     ...        ...    ...  ``` | ```  void __attribute__ ((noreturn)) grub_rescue_run (void){    . . .    while (1)     {       char *line;        /* Print an error, if any.  */       grub_print_error (); ----->grub_errno = GRUB_ERR_NONE;        grub_rescue_read_line (&line, 0, NULL);       if (! line || line[0] == '\0')         continue;        grub_rescue_parse_line (line, grub_rescue_read_line,                               NULL);       grub_free (line);     } } ``` |
| --- | --- |
| Assembly code. | Corresponding C function. |
| --- | |

At this point, GRUB2 is in the grub rescue function, which is a
powerful shell.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Right after 28 [Backspace] and [Enter]. | We've got a fully operative rescue shell. |

Fortunately, the content of the memory has suffered minor
modifications, and it is possible to use all the functionality of
GRUB. Only, the first interrupt vector of the IVT has been modified,
and since the processor is now in protected mode, the IVT is no longer
used.

### One step ahead

Although we reached the GRUB2 rescue function, we are not actually
authenticated. If we return to the "normal" mode, that is the grub menu and
with full editing capabilities, GRUB will ask for a valid user and password.
So, we can directly start to type GRUB2 commands, or even including new modules
to add new GRUB functionalities, to deploy the malware into the system or launch a
much more comfortable environment by running a complete bash shell from a
Linux. To run bash in Linux, we can use the GRUB2 commands like *linux*,
*initrd* or *insmod*.

Although to use GRUB2 commands to run a Linux kernel to deploy the malware is
perfectly possible, we found that, a simpler solution is to patch the code of
GRUB2 in RAM to be always authenticated and then return to the "normal" mode.
The idea to do that, is to modify the condition which checkes whether the user
has been authenticated or not. This function is
**is\_authenticated()** in the file **grub-core/normal/auth.c**.

|  |
| --- |
| The goal is to overwrite the condition with **nop** instructions. |

This modification is done using the GRUB2 rescue command
**write\_word**. And then, everything is ready to return
back to GRUB2's normal mode. In other words, we can enter in the "edit mode"
and GRUB2 will not ask for users or passwords.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` grub rescue> write_word 0x7eb514e 0x90909090 grub rescue> normal  ``` | We've got a fully operative GRUB2. |

## How an APT could use this 0-Day

Physical access is an "advanced" feature attributed to APTs (or
insiders). One of the main goals of an APT is the theft of
sensitive information or Cyberspying. The following is just
a *very simple example* of how an APT could infect a system
and obtain persistence to posteriorly steal data of a user.
The following summarizes the system configuration:

* BIOS/UEFI is protected with password.
* GRUB2 edit mode is protected with password.
* External boots disabled: CDROM, DVD, USB, Netboot, PXE ...
* The user data (HOME) is ciphered.

|  |
| --- |
| Boot system Overview.  --- |

As pointed before, our goal is to steal data of an user. Since the
data is ciphered, the strategy we will use is to infect the system
and wait until the user decrypts the data (by login into the
system) and then access to the information in plain.

### Preparing the environment to deploy the malware

By patching the GRUB2 as shown before, we can easily edit the
*linux* entry to load a Linux kernel and get a root shell. This
is an old but still usable trick, just by
adding **init=/bin/bash** to the *linux* entry, we
will get a **root Linux shell**, which is a much more comfortable
environment for deploying our malware.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Adding */bin/bash* to the *linux* GRUB2 command. | Bash root shell in Linux. |

Note that since /bin/bash is the first process to run, the
syslog daemon is not running, and so, logs are not recorded. That
is, this access will not be detected using normal Linux monitoring.

### Deploying the malware and obtaining persistence

In order to show how far you could go by exploiting this 0-Day
Grub2 vulnerability, we have developed a simple PoC. This PoC is a
modified Firefox library which creates a new process and run a
reverse shell to a controlled server at port 53. Obviously, this is
a simple example, and a real malware will exfiltrate the
information much more stealthily.

The modified library was uploaded
to [virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com) reporting 0 infections/virus out
of 55 tools. Firefox is a web browser that uses Internet, and
makes requests to HTTP and DNS ports, so, it not appears to be
suspicious that our malware talk with these ports.

To infect the system we simply put our modified libplc4.so
library into a USB and then replace the original one. We have to
mount with write permissions the system and mount the USB as shown
in the following picture:

|  |
| --- |
| Infecting the system.  --- |

When any user executes the Firefox, a reverse shell will be
invoked. At this time all data of the user is deciphered, allowing
us to steal any kind of information of the user. The following
picture, shows how the user Bob (the target) is using the Firefox
and how the user Alice (the attacker) has full access to Bob's data.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| The **victim** browsing the web. | The **attacker** with a reverse shell. |
| --- | |

To finish the persistence part, it worth to mention that by a
simple Kernel modification that resides in the */boot*
partition, which by default is not ciphered, we can elevate
privileges to deploy a more persistent malware. The imagination is
the limit.

## The Fix

The bug can be easily fixed just by preventing that cur\_len
overflows. The main vendors are already aware of this vulnerability.
By the way, we have created the following "emergency patch" from the
main GRUB2 git repository:

```
## Discussion

The successfully exploitation of the vulnerability has been
possible because we made a very deep analysis of all
components involved in this bug. As can be seen, the
successful exploitation depends on many things: the BIOS
version, the GRUB version, the amount of RAM, and whatever
that modifies the memory layout. And each system requires
a deep analysis to build the specific exploit.

Just to mention something that we have not used here:
the grub\_memset() function can be abused so that it
sets to zero chunks of memory without jumping to 0x0, and the
user and password buffers can be used to store payloads.

Also, in the case of more complex attacks (those which
require a large underflow or payload), it would be useful
to use a keyboard emulation device, as for example
the [Teensy device](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/). We can record the attack
sequence of pressed keys, and replay it on the target
system.

Fortunately, the method presented here to exploit the
GRUB2 vulnerability is not generic, but there are other
alternatives that could work for you. Here we are only
presenting one that works for us.

# GRUB: Authentication bypass — GLSA **201512-03**

GRUB's authentication prompt can be bypassed by entering a sequence
of backspace characters.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-boot/grub** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.02\_beta2-r8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.02\_beta2-r8**revision >= **0.97** |

### Background

GNU GRUB is a multiboot boot loader used by most Linux systems.

### Description

An integer underflow in GRUB’s username/password authentication code
has been discovered.

### Impact

An attacker with access to the system console may bypass the username
prompt by entering a sequence of backspace characters, allowing them e.g.
to get full access to GRUB’s console or to load a customized kernel.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GRUB 2.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-boot/grub-2.02_beta2-r8"

```

After upgrading, make sure to run the grub2-install command with options
appropriate for your system. See the GRUB2 Quick Start guide in the
references below for examples. Your system will be vulnerable until this
action is performed.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2016

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2016

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 248 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

**Please note that on November 10, 2015, Oracle released [Security Alert for CVE-2015-4852](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2015-4852.html). Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2015-4852.**

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2016verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2016 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2074802.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2074802.1 ).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 33 new security fixes for Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control. 23 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. None of these fixes are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2016verbose.html#EM).

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2016 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update January 2016 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2074802.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2074802.1)

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 8 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 7 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2016verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

Subject: CVE-2023-4001: a password bypass vulnerability in the downstream GRUB
 boot manager

References:

<https://dfir.ru/2024/01/15/cve-2023-4001-a-vulnerability-in-the-downstream-grub-boot-manager/>
<https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-4001>

Plain-text details taken from the first reference:

One can set a password to protect the boot menu entries and the
command-line shell of the GRUB boot manager (see the official manual and
the Red Hat manual). This is an additional security measure to be used
along with a BIOS/UEFI password (e.g., to protect corporate computers
from unprivileged users trying to leverage their physical access to boot
another operating system or to escalate the privileges in an installed
operating system).

Under the hood, this feature is implemented as two GRUB commands:
“password” and “password_pbkdf2“. When one of these commands is issued
with a proper set of arguments, a user with a specified password (or its
hash) is created. And only those users listed in the “superusers”
environment variable (when it’s set by issuing the “set” command) are
allowed to edit boot menu entries and execute commands in the GRUB
shell. (A physically-present user is required to authenticate as a
superuser when trying to edit a menu entry or trying to enter the GRUB
shell.)

In most cases, commands to set the “superusers” variable and to create
corresponding users are stored in the GRUB configuration file,
“grub.cfg” (which is more like a script, not a pure configuration file).

There were some vulnerabilities affecting the GRUB password protection
feature, like weak permissions for the GRUB configuration file that
allowed unprivileged users to obtain plain-text passwords and/or
password hashes (for example: CVE-2012-2314, CVE-2013-4577, and
CVE-2021-3981), an integer underflow (CVE-2015-8370), and even an
improper string comparison (CVE-2009-4128).

Now, there is one more: CVE-2023-4001.

This vulnerability allows unprivileged users with physical access to a
computer to bypass the password protection feature of the GRUB boot
manager on many (but not all) UEFI-based computers. In some uncommon
setups, no unprivileged access is required (so, physical access without
an ability to log in into an operating system is enough).

In theory, commands required to properly enable the password protection
feature (i.e., to create a user and to set a list of superusers) of the
GRUB boot manager can be stored in two locations: in the configuration
file embedded in the GRUB image (which is an EFI executable) and in the
“external” configuration file (which is most likely named “grub.cfg“).

In the UEFI Secure Boot world, GRUB images are signed, so they can’t
contain anything other than a hard-coded (vendor-defined) password or
its hash (and, hopefully, there are none). So, the corresponding
commands have to be stored in the “external” configuration file, “grub.cfg“.

Originally, on BIOS-based systems, this configuration was stored as a
single file in the same directory with the GRUB files.

But on UEFI computers this configuration became split between two files:
the first one in the EFI System Partition volume
(“/boot/efi/EFI/<vendor>/grub.cfg“; it’s usually a FAT12/16/32 file
system) and the second one in the “/boot” volume (“/boot/grub/grub.cfg”
or “/boot/grub2/grub.cfg“; it’s usually a file system not supported by
the UEFI firmware: e.g., Ext2/4 or XFS). The latter will called “the
main configuration file” here.

A thorough explanation of this new scheme can be found here:
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/UnifyGrubConfig>.

When the GRUB password is set (e.g., using the “grub2-set-password”
tool), it’s written to the main configuration file. And the first
configuration file is just a simple script to locate and execute the
main configuration file (as shown on the screenshot below).

<screenshot>

A configuration file found in the EFI System Partition (CentOS Stream 9)

If the password-related commands were stored in the first configuration
file, there would be no issue described in this post. But they are
stored in the main configuration file, which is found and then executed
by the first configuration file.

What if the main configuration file isn’t found? The GRUB boot manager
will spawn its shell.

Interestingly, we can force the main configuration file to “disappear”
(at least on some systems) when the first configuration file is
executed. So, there would be no password prompt (because no
password-related commands are ever executed after the power-on event)
and the GRUB shell will be immediately available to a physically-present
user.

The UUID is the key! The main configuration file is located using a
predefined path: “<device>/grub2/grub.cfg” (as shown on the screenshot
above). Here, “<device>” is a volume found by its file system UUID using
the “search” command.

And duplicate file system UUIDs pose a security problem…

If there are two file systems sharing the same UUID, one of them is the
real “/boot” volume and another one is an empty volume, the GRUB boot
manager could, under some circumstances, pick a wrong device as
containing the main configuration file. And if there is no main
configuration file stored (that empty volume case), the GRUB shell is
spawned.

Internally, the “search” command tries every partition on every block
device until a specified signature (a file system UUID in this case, but
the command also supports searching by a volume label and by a file) is
found.

All block devices are tried in the same order as returned when
enumerating their EFI handles (“hd0”, “hd1”, “hd2” and so on, “hd0”
corresponds to the first EFI handle returned when enumerating EFI block
devices). Some UEFI implementations enumerate non-removable drives
before removable ones, while others do exactly the opposite (e.g., my
Lenovo laptop exposed this behavior; the UEFI implementation of
VirtualBox with USB3 support enabled enumerates USB sticks before
internal drives too).

So, if an attached removable drive (like a USB stick) becomes “hd0” in
the GRUB boot manager (and the computer’s internal drive is “hd1” in
that case), it’s possible to bypass the GRUB password protection feature
by placing an empty file system with the same UUID as the real “/boot”
volume onto that removable drive and attaching it to the computer before
the boot. During the boot, the GRUB boot manager will simply spawn its
shell, without even asking for a password (and without changing the boot
order, of course).

Unprivileged users can learn the UUID value of the “/boot” volume using
the “lsblk” tool (because file system UUIDs are exposed to unprivileged
users).

Here is a video demonstrating the attack:
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mMlEIgfnUKIgaOEBNmtWuRo7RUAqjDrT/view?usp=sharing>.

It should be noted that some Linux distributions provide enough debug
output in a separate console, so a necessary UUID can be obtained from
there (and no unprivileged access to the operating system is required in
this case).

Timeline

  2023-04-03: the vulnerability was discovered by me.
  2023-07-17: the vulnerability was reported by me to Red Hat.
  2023-10-17: an initial fix is available for testing.
  2023-10-18: an issue was discovered by me in that fix (an attacker
could bypass an additional check implemented by the patch by attaching
10 removable drives to the computer, if that number of removable drives
is supported by the firmware).
  2023-10-30: a new fix is available for testing.
  2023-10-31: two issues were discovered in that fix (one issue is a
“huge” heap overflow introduced when working with strings in the patched
code, another issue is a minor out-of-bounds write of a null byte).
  2023-10-31: a final fix is available.
  2023-11-23: the disclosure date is agreed upon — 2024-01-15.
  2024-01-12: the vulnerability is disclosed by Red Hat.
  2024-01-15: this post has arrived.

Fix

A fix proposed by Red Hat implements a new argument to the “search”
command, which restricts the UUID scan to the block device used to
launch the GRUB boot manager. This means that the “/boot” volume must
reside on the same drive as the EFI System Partition.

An alternative (but not implemented) approach would be to use something
that isn’t exposed to unprivileged users as a signature to locate the
“/boot” volume. This could be a file with a random name residing in a
directory with restricted permissions.

## Synopsis

Moderate: grub2 security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A2623)

## Topic

Updated grub2 packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

[Updated 27 January 2016]
This advisory has been updated to document additional steps that need to be
performed on BIOS-based systems after installing this update. No changes
were made to the packages included in the advisory.

## Description

The grub2 packages provide version 2 of the Grand Unified Bootloader
(GRUB), a highly configurable and customizable bootloader with modular
architecture. The packages support a variety of kernel formats, file
systems, computer architectures, and hardware devices.

A flaw was found in the way the grub2 handled backspace characters entered
in username and password prompts. An attacker with access to the system
console could use this flaw to bypass grub2 password protection and gain
administrative access to the system. (CVE-2015-8370)

This update also fixes the following bug:

* When upgrading from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 and earlier, a

configured boot password was not correctly migrated to the newly introduced
user.cfg configuration files. This could possibly prevent system
administrators from changing grub2 configuration during system boot even if
they provided the correct password. This update corrects the password
migration script and the incorrectly generated user.cfg file. (BZ#1290089)

All grub2 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. For this update to take
effect on BIOS-based machines, grub2 needs to be reinstalled as documented
in the "Reinstalling GRUB 2 on BIOS-Based Machines" section of the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 7 System Administrator's Guide linked to in the References
section. No manual action is needed on UEFI-based machines.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

Subject: Back to 28: Grub2 Authentication Bypass 0-Day [CVE-2015-8370]

Hi everyone,

A vulnerability in Grub2 (Back to 28) has been found. Versions from 1.98
(December, 2009) to 2.02 (December, 2015) are affected. The vulnerability can be
exploited under certain circumstances, allowing local attackers to bypass any
kind of authentication (plain or hashed passwords). And so, the attacker may
take control of the computer.

More details at:
<http://hmarco.org/bugs/CVE-2015-8370-Grub2-authentication-bypass.html>

Regards,
Hector Marco & Ismael Ripoll.
