Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-8370:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an **integer underflow** vulnerability in the `grub_username_get()` and `grub_password_get()` functions within Grub2's authentication code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Underflow:** The `cur_len` variable, which tracks the current length of the entered username or password, is decremented when the backspace key is pressed, without proper range checks. This allows `cur_len` to underflow into a large positive value.
*   **Out-of-bounds Write:** Due to the underflow, the subsequent `grub_memset` function uses the manipulated `cur_len` value to write zeros outside the intended buffer. This overwrite can corrupt adjacent memory areas, including the return address on the stack, which leads to control flow hijacking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass Grub2's authentication mechanism, gaining access to the bootloader without providing a valid username or password.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By gaining access to the GRUB rescue shell, the attacker can execute arbitrary GRUB commands. This can lead to:
    *   Loading a custom kernel and initramfs (e.g., from a USB drive), allowing control over the booted system.
    *   Access to the filesystem allowing data theft or rootkit installation
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can corrupt or overwrite the GRUB configuration or even the encrypted disk leading to a DoS.
*   **Control Flow Hijacking:** By overflowing the username/password buffer, the return address on the stack can be overwritten redirecting the control flow to an attacker specified address.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker requires physical access to the system's console.
*   **Keyboard Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by entering a specific number of backspace characters (28 times) at the username or password prompt, followed by an Enter key.
*   **Removable media (USB):** An attacker can load a custom kernel, initramfs or payload by using USB media

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** An attacker must have direct physical access to the system's console to interact with the GRUB menu.
*   **Basic Understanding of Grub:** Knowledge on how Grub2 operates and its shell is helpful, although the exploit itself is simple.
* **Unprivileged user:** Unprivileged user access to system to discover boot partition UUID can facilitate the attack
* **Manipulation of a bootable medium:** An attacker could use a USB medium with a file system with a duplicated UUID of the boot volume to manipulate how Grub2 locates it's configuration file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in GRUB2 versions 1.98 (December, 2009) to 2.02 (December, 2015).
*   The exploit is not generic and can be influenced by BIOS version, Grub version, RAM etc.
*   The vulnerability can be fixed by checking for underflows in cur_len variable before decrementing.
*   An attacker can patch GRUB2 in memory by modifying the `is_authenticated()` function to always authenticate the user.

**In summary**, CVE-2015-8370 is an integer underflow vulnerability in Grub2 that allows local attackers to bypass authentication and gain control of the boot process by providing a specific input. This can lead to privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution, and denial of service on the vulnerable machine.
