Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the use of a weak and uniform authentication mechanism. The application, YMS VIS Pro, uses a 4-6 digit combination as both the username and password for all users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authentication:** The core vulnerability lies in the flawed authentication process, where user credentials are weak, predictable, and uniformly applied across all accounts.
*   **Brute-Force Susceptibility:** The use of short, numeric passwords makes the application highly vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
*   **Publicly Available Identifiers:** The 4-6 digit combination also serves as the veterinary license identifier, which is often publicly available, further increasing the risk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can easily gain unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Successful exploitation allows access to sensitive data managed by the application, including veterinary management, food quality administration, farm management, and invoice processing.
*   **Potential for Further Malicious Activity:** With access, attackers can potentially manipulate the data or use the system for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Brute-Force Attack:** The primary attack vector is a brute-force attack, where attackers systematically try different combinations of 4-6 digits to guess the credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Technical Skills:** Attackers need only basic technical skills to perform a brute-force attack.
*   **Network Access:** The application must be accessible over the network for the attack to be viable.
*   **Knowledge of the Weak Authentication:** The attacker needs to know that the application uses a 4-6 digit numeric username/password combination. Publicly available veterinary license identifiers could be used as a starting point.

**Additional Details:**

*   The application affected is YMS VIS Pro version 3.3.0.6, and potentially earlier versions.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating critical severity.
*   The vulnerability was reported to SK-CERT, who then notified the developer and system operator.
*   The vulnerability has been mitigated by implementing robust authentication mechanisms, adding an extra layer of authentication, and introducing strict password policies.
