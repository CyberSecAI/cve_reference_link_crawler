# Authenticated Variable Manipulation leading to SQL Injection

High

[WillyXJ](/WillyXJ)
published
GHSA-xw34-8pj6-75gc
Jan 31, 2024

## Package

composer

server/fm-modules/facileManager/pages/admin-logs.php
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<=4.5.0

## Patched versions

4.5.1

## Description

### Summary

The $\_REQUEST global array was unsafely called inside an extract() function in admin-logs.php.

The PHP file fm-init.php prevents arbitrary manipulation of $\_SESSION via the GET/POST parameters. However, it does not prevent manipulation of any other sensitive variables such as $search\_sql.

Knowing this, an authenticated user with privileges to view site logs can manipulate the search\_sql

variable by appending a GET parameter search\_sql in the URL.

<http://localhost/facileManager/server/admin-logs.php?search_sql=>

The information above means that the checks and SQL injection prevention attempts were rendered unusable.

The search\_sql variable were then concatenated into an SQL query and executed on lines 57 to 58.

### Patches

facileManager-v4.5.1

### PoC

Login as an administrator and visit the URL below:

<http://localhost/facileManager/server/adminlogs.php?search_sql=and%200%20union%20select%201,2,3,concat(%27%3Ch3%3ESQL%20Injection%20>
