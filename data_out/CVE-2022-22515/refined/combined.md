2  Vulnerability overview

2.1  Type

CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere [7]

2.2  Management Summary

The control program could utilize this vulnerability to read and modify the configuration file(s) of the affected
products via IEC code libraries for file access.

2.3  References

CVE: CVE-2022-22515 [6]

CODESYS JIRA: CDS-75073, CDS-81849, CDS-81868

2.4  Severity Rating

CODESYS GmbH has rated this vulnerability as high.

The CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.1 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is
(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N). [8]

3  Vulnerability details

3.1  Detailed Description

The CODESYS Control runtime system enables embedded or PC-based devices to be a programmable
industrial controller. Control programs can access local or remote IOs, communication interfaces such as serial
ports or sockets, and local system functions such as the file system, the real-time clock and other OS functions.
The control program could utilize this vulnerability to read and modify the configuration file(s) of the affected
products via CAA File, SysFile, SysFileAsync, or other IEC code libraries for file access.

4/6

Advisory 2022-02

Programming the controller is only possible, if the online user management is deactivated/not active or if the
attacker has previously successfully authenticated himself at the controller.

3.2  Exploitability

This vulnerability could be exploited by the IEC code executed by the PLC.

3.3  Difficulty

An attacker with low skills would be able to exploit this vulnerability.

3.4  Existence of exploit

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability in CODESYS products.

4  Available software updates

CODESYS GmbH has released version V3.5.18.30 to solve the identified security vulnerability for the following
products:
• CODESYS Control RTE (SL)
• CODESYS Control RTE (for Beckhoff CX) SL
• CODESYS Control Win (SL)
• CODESYS HMI (SL)
• CODESYS Development System V3
• CODESYS Control Runtime System Toolkit
• CODESYS Embedded Target Visu Toolkit
• CODESYS Remote Target Visu Toolkit

For the below listed products, CODESYS GmbH has released version V4.6.0.0 based on the CODESYS
Control V3 Runtime System Toolkit V3.5.18.30:
• CODESYS Control for BeagleBone SL
• CODESYS Control for emPC-A/iMX6 SL
• CODESYS Control for IOT2000 SL
• CODESYS Control for Linux SL
• CODESYS Control for PFC100 SL
• CODESYS Control for PFC200 SL
• CODESYS Control for PLCnext SL
• CODESYS Control for Raspberry Pi SL
• CODESYS Control for WAGO Touch Panels 600 SL

The CODESYS Development System and the products available as CODESYS AddOns can be downloaded
and installed directly with the CODESYS Installer, which is part of the CODESYS Development System as of
version V3.5.17.0.

Alternatively, as well as for all other products, you will find further information on obtaining the software update
in the CODESYS Update area [3].

After applying the fix, CODESYS Control runtime configuration files can no longer be accessed through CAA
File, SysFile, SysFileAsync, or other file access libraries.

Note: It turned out that the previous fix in versions V3.5.17.40 and V3.5.18.0 was incomplete. Therefore, we
recommend an update to V3.5.18.30 / V4.6.0.0 to close the vulnerability, regardless of the version used so far.

5  Mitigation

CODESYS GmbH recommends using the available software update to fix the vulnerabilities.

To exploit these vulnerabilities, a successful login to the affected product is required to download and execute
the malicious application code to the PLC. The online user management of the affected products therefore
protects from exploiting these security vulnerabilities, even in the case that the software update is not applied.

5/6

Advisory 2022-02

CODESYS GmbH strongly recommends using the online user management. This not only prevents an attacker
from downloading and execute malicious code, but also suppresses start, stop, debug, or other actions on a
known working application that could potentially disrupt a machine or system. As of version V3.5.17.0, the
online user management is enforced by default.

As part of a security strategy, CODESYS GmbH recommends the following general defense measures to
reduce the risk of exploits:
• Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that
they are not accessible from outside
• Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks
• Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
• Activate and apply user management and password features
• Use encrypted communication links
• Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
• Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions
For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the
CODESYS Security Whitepaper [1].
