Moderate

[wanghe-fit2cloud](/wanghe-fit2cloud)

Aug 10, 2023

## Package

backend
(1Panel)

## Affected versions

v1.4.3

## Patched versions

v1.5.0

## Description

### Summary

Arbitrary file reads allow an attacker to read arbitrary important configuration files on the server.

### Details

In the api/v1/file.go file, there is a function called LoadFromFile, which directly reads the file by obtaining the requested path parameter[path]. The request parameters are not filtered, resulting in a background arbitrary file reading vulnerability
