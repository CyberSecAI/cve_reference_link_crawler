# [slurm-announce] Slurm version 24.05.4 is now available (CVE-2024-48936)

Slurm version 24.05.4 is now available and includes a fix for a recently
discovered security issue with the new stepmgr subsystem.

SchedMD customers were informed on October 9th and provided a patch on
request; this process is documented in our security policy. [1]

A mistake in authentication handling in stepmgr could permit an attacker
to execute processes under other users' jobs. This is limited to jobs
explicitly running with --stepmgr, or on systems that have globally
enabled stepmgr through "SlurmctldParameters=enable\_stepmgr" in their
configuration. CVE-2024-48936.

Downloads are available at <https://www.schedmd.com/downloads.php> .

Release notes follow below.

> \* Changes in Slurm 24.05.4
> ==========================
> -- Fix generic int sort functions.
> -- Fix user look up using possible unrealized uid in the dbd.
> -- Fix FreeBSD compile issue with tls/none plugin.
> -- slurmrestd - Fix regressions that allowed slurmrestd to be run as SlurmUser
> when SlurmUser was not root.
> -- mpi/pmix fix race conditions with het jobs at step start/end which could
> make srun to hang.
> -- Fix not showing some SelectTypeParameters in scontrol show config.
> -- Avoid assert when dumping removed certain fields in JSON/YAML.
> -- Improve how shards are scheduled with affinity in mind.
> -- Fix MaxJobsAccruePU not being respected when MaxJobsAccruePA is set
> in the same QOS.
> -- Prevent backfill from planning jobs that use overlapping resources for the
> same time slot if the job's time limit is less than bf\_resolution.
> -- Fix memory leak when requesting typed gres and --[cpus|mem]-per-gpu.
> -- Prevent backfill from breaking out due to "system state changed" every 30
> seconds if reservations use REPLACE or REPLACE\_DOWN flags.
> -- slurmrestd - Make sure that scheduler\_unset parameter defaults to true even
> when the following flags are also set: show\_duplicates, skip\_steps,
> disable\_truncate\_usage\_time, run\_away\_jobs, whole\_hetjob,
> disable\_whole\_hetjob, disable\_wait\_for\_result, usage\_time\_as\_submit\_time,
> show\_batch\_script, and or show\_job\_environment. Additionaly, always make
> sure show\_duplicates and disable\_truncate\_usage\_time default to true when
> the following flags are also set: scheduler\_unset, scheduled\_on\_submit,
> scheduled\_by\_main, scheduled\_by\_backfill, and or job\_started. This effects
> the following endpoints:
> 'GET /slurmdb/v0.0.40/jobs'
> 'GET /slurmdb/v0.0.41/jobs'
> -- Ignore --json and --yaml options for scontrol show config to prevent mixing
> output types.
> -- Fix not considering nodes in reservations with Maintenance or Overlap flags
> when creating new reservations with nodecnt or when they replace down nodes.
> -- Fix suspending/resuming steps running under a 23.02 slurmstepd process.
> -- Fix options like sprio --me and squeue --me for users with a uid greater
> than 2147483647.
> -- fatal() if BlockSizes=0. This value is invalid and would otherwise cause the
> slurmctld to crash.
> -- sacctmgr - Fix issue where clearing out a preemption list using
> preempt='' would cause the given qos to no longer be preempt-able until set
> again.
> -- Fix stepmgr creating job steps concurrently.
> -- data\_parser/v0.0.40 - Avoid dumping "Infinity" for NO\_VAL tagged "number"
> fields.
> -- data\_parser/v0.0.41 - Avoid dumping "Infinity" for NO\_VAL tagged "number"
> fields.
> -- slurmctld - Fix a potential leak while updating a reservation.
> -- slurmctld - Fix state save with reservation flags when a update fails.
> -- Fix reservation update issues with parameters Accounts and Users, when
> using +/- signs.
> -- slurmrestd - Don't dump warning on empty wckeys in:
> 'GET /slurmdb/v0.0.40/config'
> 'GET /slurmdb/v0.0.41/config'
> -- Fix slurmd possibly leaving zombie processes on start up in configless when
> the initial attempt to fetch the config fails.
> -- Fix crash when trying to drain a non-existing node (possibly deleted
> before).
> -- slurmctld - fix segfault when calculating limit decay for jobs with an
> invalid association.
> -- Fix IPMI energy gathering with multiple sensors.
> -- data\_parser/v0.0.39 - Remove xassert requiring errors and warnings to have a
> source string.
> -- slurmrestd - Prevent potential segfault when there is an error parsing an
> array field which could lead to a double xfree. This applies to several
> endpoints in data\_parser v0.0.39, v0.0.40 and v0.0.41.
> -- scancel - Fix a regression from 23.11.6 where using both the --ctld and
> --sibling options would cancel the federated job on all clusters instead of
> only the cluster(s) specified by --sibling.
> -- accounting\_storage/mysql - Fix bug when removing an association
> specified with an empty partition.
> -- Fix setting multiple partition state restore on a job correctly.
> -- Fix difference in behavior when swapping partition order in job submission.
> -- Fix security issue in stepmgr that could permit an attacker to execute
> processes under other users' jobs. CVE-2024-48936.

# Security Policy

### SchedMD Slurm Security Response Process

SchedMD takes security seriously. We follow a coordinated disclosure process which is outlined below.

While we strongly encourage discoverers to report potential security issues to us and follow our disclosure process, we will respect their wishes and work with them in cases where their preferred process may vary.

[View Past Security Disclosures](/security-archive/)
#### Contact: security@schedmd.com

If required, please contact us for GPG keys.

#### Scope:

This process covers the Slurm workload manager itself. Issues with closely related components â€” such as MUNGE or third-party SPANK plugins â€” may be raised with us and we will work with the reporter to identify the appropriate contacts and coordinate disclosure.

#### Slurm Vulnerability Disclosure Process:

1. Problem identification and triage.
   1. The issue is identified, and the code base reviewed for similar and related issues.
   2. Potential mitigations and related configuration options identified.
   3. Fix is developed and tested internally.
   4. A CVE number is requested, identifying the original problem reporter. Details are not released until the end of the embargo period.
2. Pre-advisory embargo period and SchedMD customer notification
   1. Pre-advisory announcement is made to the private SchedMD customer mailing list, and any mitigations and patches are made available upon further request.
   2. Customers requesting fixes and further details on the issue are required to adhere to the embargo period, and not disclose the issue outside of their operational staff and management.
   3. If maintenance outages are required and require notification of system users, we request that customers do not identify the specific issue that is leading to that maintenance outage.
   4. Any fixes prepared in response will not be applied to the main SchedMD/slurm Git distribution until the embargo period has expired.
   5. SchedMD may, at its discretion, notify external Slurm package maintainers (e.g., Debian, EPEL, FreeBSD) during this embargo period that a security fix will be published on the established end of the embargo period. Such notification will not include specifics of the issue, only that a security issue will be leading to the publication of new releases.
   6. In most circumstances, the embargo expiration will be set for two weeks after customer notification.
   7. If, in SchedMDâ€™s opinion, details of the issue have been made publically available, the embargo period may end earlier than the scheduled date.
3. Advisory public release:
   1. Public release is generally made in conjunction with publication of the next maintenance release of all supported branches. (Currently, this is the major releases made within the past 18 months, which corresponds to the last two major releases.)
   2. Notification is made to the slurm-announce and slurm-users lists of the immediate availability of the fixed releases, alongside disclosure of the security issue they address.
   3. All vulnerable releases will be removed from public download on SchedMDâ€™s website.
