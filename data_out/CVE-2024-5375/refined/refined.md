Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `address` parameter of the `submit_student.php` file within the Kashipara College Management System.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in the output.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into the web page. This could lead to various attacks such as:
    *   Displaying inappropriate content.
    *   Downloading malware onto the user's system without their knowledge.
    *   Stealing user session cookies or other sensitive information.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the website.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the `address` parameter in the `submit_student.php` file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted request to the `submit_student.php` file with a malicious payload in the `address` parameter.
    *   No special privileges or position is mentioned as required for successful exploitation

**Technical Details:**
The provided payload is:
`address=555'"()&%<zzz><ScRiPt >alert(9937)</ScRiPt>`

This payload demonstrates how an attacker can inject a `<script>` tag that executes JavaScript code (`alert(9937)`) within the context of the web page, confirming the XSS vulnerability.
