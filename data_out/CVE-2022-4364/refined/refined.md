The provided content details a command injection vulnerability in the FLIR AX8 thermal camera.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `palette.php` script within the FLIR AX8 web service concatenates the value of the `palette` POST parameter with a predefined string and executes it as a system command. This is done without proper sanitization or input validation, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the injection of arbitrary commands via the `palette` parameter.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the input provided through the POST parameter before using it in a system call.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication, making it remotely exploitable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target device with root privileges.
- **Full System Compromise:** This could lead to complete control over the device, potentially allowing for data exfiltration, device manipulation, or further attacks on the network.
- **Denial of Service:** Attackers could cause the device to malfunction, potentially impacting the systems or infrastructure the device is monitoring.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP POST requests to the `/palette.php` endpoint.
- The `palette` parameter within the POST request is used to inject commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the target FLIR AX8 device.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests.
