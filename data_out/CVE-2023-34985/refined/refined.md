- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of HTTP GET request parameters before they are used in OS commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection (CWE-78). The application fails to neutralize or sanitize special characters in user-supplied input, allowing for arbitrary command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute unauthorized code or commands on the underlying operating system of the FortiWLM appliance.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote exploitation via crafted HTTP GET request parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be authenticated with low privilege to exploit this vulnerability.
