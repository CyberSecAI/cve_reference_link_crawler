Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-40174:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an insufficient session expiration mechanism within the `fobybus/social-media-skeleton` application. Specifically, the application does not properly manage the lifecycle of a user's session, potentially allowing it to remain active indefinitely.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Session Timeout:** The application lacks a proper session timeout mechanism. This means that a user's session will not automatically expire after a period of inactivity, potentially leaving it vulnerable for hijacking.
- **Missing logout after password change:** While the text mentions that users should be logged out after a password change, there is no explicit mention of a specific code change related to this.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can potentially hijack a user's session and gain unauthorized access to the application. This allows the attacker to perform actions as the compromised user.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Through session hijacking, the attacker can gain access to sensitive information or functionalities that they are not authorized to use, depending on the application's functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker can perform this attack remotely over the network.
- **Session Capture:** The attacker needs a way to capture a valid user session id, such as through network sniffing, cross-site scripting (XSS), or other methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.
- **Session ID Acquisition:** The attacker needs the ability to acquire a valid session ID from a legitimate user.
- **Low privilege user:** The attacker can be a low-privilege user or external user who doesn't require initial high level access.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 1.0.5 and is patched in version 1.0.5.
- The vulnerability is located in `login.php` at line 37 and `admin/login.php` at line 30.

- The provided code diffs show the implementation of session expiration mechanism with a hardcoded timeout of 10 seconds (`$_SESSION["exp_time"]=time()+(10);`). This short timeout does not seem to address the insufficient session expiration issue in a real-world scenario.
- The `sexpired()` function checks if the current time exceeds the stored expiration time in the session.

-The code changes add the `sexpired()` check in multiple PHP files to enforce the session expiration, redirecting the user to a logout page upon expiration.
