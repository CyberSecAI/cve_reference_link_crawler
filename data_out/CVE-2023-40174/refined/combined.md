# Insufficient Session Expiration in fobybus/social-media-skeleton

Moderate

published
GHSA-cr5c-ggwq-g4hq
Aug 18, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 1.0.5

## Patched versions

1.0.5

## Description

Insufficient session expiration is a web application security vulnerability that occurs when a web application does not properly manage the lifecycle of a user's session. This can allow an attacker to hijack the user's session and gain unauthorized access to the application. The web application may not have a session timeout set. This means that a user's session will never expire, even if the user is inactive for a long period of time.

Even so, the User is required to log out of the system once the Password Changed event has been processed and completed.

### Impact

Session hijacking

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
