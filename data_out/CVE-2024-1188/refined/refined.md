- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow occurs when encrypting a file with a user-supplied passphrase, specifically when a passphrase exceeding a certain length (256 bytes) is provided.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of Service (DoS) of the Notepad3 application.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by using a specially crafted, excessively long passphrase to encrypt a file using the "Set Encryption Passphrase" feature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the Notepad3 application. The attacker must use the "Set Encryption Passphrase" feature.
