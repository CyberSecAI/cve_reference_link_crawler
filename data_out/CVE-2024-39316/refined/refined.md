{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the `Rack::Request::Helpers` module when parsing HTTP Accept headers.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "ReDoS vulnerability due to inefficient regular expression usage when parsing `Accept-Encoding` or `Accept-Language` headers.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by sending specially crafted `Accept-Encoding` or `Accept-Language` headers, leading the server to spend excessive time processing the request.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted `Accept-Encoding` or `Accept-Language` HTTP headers.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server."
