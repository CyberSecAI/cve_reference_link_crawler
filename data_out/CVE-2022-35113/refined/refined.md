The provided content is related to CVE-2022-35113. It describes two separate crashes, a heap buffer overflow and a segmentation fault, in `swfrender` when processing specially crafted SWF files. The crashes occur in the `swftools` project.

**Heap buffer overflow:**
- **Root cause:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `swf_DefineLosslessBitsTagToImage` function when processing a specific SWF file.
- **Vulnerability:** Heap buffer overflow due to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Crash/denial of service.
- **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted SWF file processed by `swfrender`.
- **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to provide a malicious SWF file as input to `swfrender`.

**Segmentation fault:**
- **Root cause:** A segmentation fault occurs in the `extractFrame` function when processing a specific SWF file.
- **Vulnerability:** Likely a null pointer dereference or access to invalid memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Crash/denial of service.
- **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted SWF file processed by `swfrender`.
- **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to provide a malicious SWF file as input to `swfrender`.
