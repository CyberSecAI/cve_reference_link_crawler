The provided content relates to CVE-2024-33103.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a misconfiguration in the web server setup for DokuWiki, where the data directory containing uploaded media files is directly accessible via the web. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended access control and Content Security Policy (CSP) provided by `fetch.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** An attacker can upload a malicious SVG file containing embedded JavaScript code. When a user directly accesses this file through the web server (bypassing `fetch.php`), the malicious JavaScript executes within the user's browser session, allowing for actions like stealing cookies.
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** The default configuration of DokuWiki allows for direct access to the `data/media` directory, where uploaded files are stored, which should be protected from public access through proper web server configuration or an access control mechanism.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** While DokuWiki attempts to filter HTML code through `fetch.php`, this mechanism is bypassed if files are directly accessed without the intervention of `fetch.php`. The file upload mechanism allows the upload of SVG files, which are capable of executing JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Theft:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute JavaScript within a user's browser, potentially stealing session cookies.
- **Account Takeover:** Stolen cookies can be used to impersonate the victim and gain access to their DokuWiki account, potentially causing further damage like data manipulation or system compromises.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (browser-based):** The attacker can potentially execute any JavaScript code in the context of the userâ€™s session, potentially leading to further malicious actions on the client side.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **File Upload:** An attacker uploads a malicious SVG file through the DokuWiki media manager.
2.  **Direct File Access:** The attacker lures a victim into directly accessing the uploaded SVG file via a URL that points directly to the file within the `data/media` directory (e.g., http://your-ip/data/media/alert.svg). This circumvents DokuWiki's intended sanitization and access control mechanisms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **DokuWiki Access:** The attacker needs to be able to log in and access the Media Manager to upload the malicious SVG file.
- **Knowledge of File Storage Path:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the path where uploaded media files are stored to create the direct access URL.
- **Social Engineering:** To execute the attack, the attacker must induce a victim to open the crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**

- The DokuWiki developers consider this a configuration issue rather than a software vulnerability. They state that the `data` directory should be protected using web server configuration or `.htaccess` files, as described in the DokuWiki installation documentation.
- The reported vulnerability occurs when the webserver is misconfigured, and the files are accessed directly without going through `fetch.php`.
- The developers also note that DokuWiki includes mechanisms to warn administrators when the installation is not secured.
