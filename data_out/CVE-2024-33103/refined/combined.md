| Summary DokuWiki 2024-02-06a has a storage XSS vulnerability, an attacker can upload a malicious svg file to obtain other users' cookies. Details We found that in the `Media Manager`, it is allowed to include svg in the file extension list. svg files can execute html code.

| Your data directory should never be directly accessible. This is a misconfiguration of your webserver and the admin interface should warn you about it. All access to media files has to go through the fetch.php dispatcher which will add a CSP header to prevent attacks like these (and will also check ACLs). |

| (note just relaying the information): apparently a CVE was assigned referring to this issue in <https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-33103> .  [@splitbrain](https://github.com/splitbrain) with your upstream hat on, could you ask the assigning CNA to reject the CVE? (in MITREs case this can be done via <https://cveform.mitre.org>) |

| Obviously, by default, douwiki is still at risk of XSS attacks, which can be recognized by the general public, and the CVE helps to emphasize that everyone should changes the directory save address of the file.  If you feel that the allocation is not reasonable(Views like [@carnil](https://github.com/carnil) or [@xrat](https://github.com/xrat) : As a vendor, I don't have to monitor users for secure configurations, and I don't care if they get hacked), you can report back to the CVE agency that the vulnerability is disputed. |

| [@splitbrain](https://github.com/splitbrain) If the open source maintainer believes that all security vulnerabilities should be resolved by the user, then there is no need to continue maintaining the project.  Files are uploaded by default in the site's public directory itself, which is always a bad security practice. |

| [@splitbrain](https://github.com/splitbrain) I understand your position, the maintenance of open source projects takes a lot of time and effort, and I salute your contributions. However, I want to stress that we all want this project to be safe for everyone to use. But [@Hebing123](https://github.com/Hebing123) was just trying to help make our community safer. Thank you for your understanding. |

| [@vsuppor](https://github.com/vsuppor) and everybody else who finds this: please read <https://www.dokuwiki.org/security> which is linked as second step on <https://www.dokuwiki.org/install>. It very clearly states that if you're not using Apache or your Apache doesn't use .htaccess, you need to make sure that a list of directories, among them the data directory, aren't accessible from the web.  I therefore agree with [@splitbrain](https://github.com/splitbrain) that what [@Hebing123](https://github.com/Hebing123) reports is not a security vulnerability but a setup problem. Claiming that an improper setup needs to be fixed in the software itself is not helping anybody but just causing more work for open source maintainers.  There is nothing DokuWiki can do to make the setup safer by default, DokuWiki already includes .htaccess files to secure the installation by default with Apache, other web servers don't support such configuration files, and DokuWiki already displays a warning in the admin area when the installation is not secured. |

| [@michitux](https://github.com/michitux) You're absolutely right. It's apparent that the vendor anticipated this issue, but instead of addressing it, they've placed the responsibility on the users who installed the system. Interestingly, dokuwiki seems to be one of the few exceptions.  Is it the case that all systems which store user-uploaded files, handle potentially harmful files in default directories like dokuwiki does? Take RoundCube, for instance, it can randomize file names. Or consider a typical CMS that can set files as plaintext to prevent direct execution. I find your viewpoint doesn't withstand close scrutiny. It seems like you are trying to defend the manufacturer.  It's entirely feasible for the vendor to convert user-uploaded files to a plaintext format, requiring the user to access the file via the filtering measures in the fetch.php script. Or they could simply assign a random number to the file name upon saving, so the user wouldn't know the full path.  He did so, deciding that alerting the user in the installation guide would suffice. He didn't need to amend the code to fix the vulnerability, even though it would be a simple fix that would only require a few lines of code.  A robust product wouldn't necessitate its users to enhance their security policies. It's evident that the project maintainer has no intention of accepting public feedback and even perceives user feedback as a burden, increasing his workload. Therefore, there's no need for further discussion, and the issue should be closed.  [@splitbrain](https://github.com/splitbrain) He's done his best. We can't alter a developer's technical abilities, and if the project maintainers believe that this can only be manually fixed by users, then we need to accept it. |

| There are a number of issues here:   * [@Hebing123](https://github.com/Hebing123) was rude in immediately filing a CVE for a configuration mistake that is clearly documented as something you should not do. * Preventing client access to a directory within the webserver document root can only be accomplished using options of the webserver and/or the underlying OS. PHP code can not help there. Obscuring the file names is not a solution as they would still be accessible. * Instead of discussing responsibilities and theoretical improvements, how about providing PRs to implement those ideas? That would be much more constructive than blaming the project authors for your own inability to read instructions. |

| [@fiwswe](https://github.com/fiwswe) You're criticizing the individual who reported the vulnerability, without even being certain if the CVE request was made after the maintainer's response? Also, I believe that the maintainer's attitude is questionable at best.  According to the comments, the project maintainers have blocked the vulnerability submitter and [@Hebing123](https://github.com/Hebing123) is unable to speak.  Additionally, your comments suggest a lack of understanding regarding secure development strategies, as if you consider yourself an impartial observer. |

| [@fiwswe](https://github.com/fiwswe) It's clear that the maintainer doesn't need any issues, so who's going to submit a PR about this things?  As far as I know, the disputed vulnerability can also apply for CVE, and the application of CVE number is only for security improvement. |

| [@vsuppor](https://github.com/vsuppor)  You're criticizing the individual who reported the vulnerability, without even being certain if the CVE request was made after the maintainer's response?  Issue opened and responded to: 2 weeks ago, CVE published: 2024-04-30  Also, I believe that the maintainer's attitude is questionable at best.  I respectfully disagree.  According to the comments, the project maintainers have blocked the vulnerability submitter and [@Hebing123](https://github.com/Hebing123) is unable to speak.  Yes, but that is the project owners decision. I understand why it was done, though I agree it is not ideal.  Additionally, your comments suggest a lack of understanding regarding secure development strategies, as if you consider yourself an impartial observer.  Please explain. Is my comment about access to the document root incorrect? Or is my redirection to PRs as a more constructive way to deal with this discussion somehow out-of-line for an Open Source project?  BTW: I am not an impartial observer. I use DokuWiki and I occasionally contribute to the project.  [@HisBestgift](https://github.com/HisBestgift)  It's clear that the maintainer doesn't need any issues,  That does not match my experience.  so who's going to submit a PR about this things?  Anyone willing to improve this project instead of just complaining. |
