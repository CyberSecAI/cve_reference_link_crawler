# There is a DoS vulnerability in the latest version 2.1.2 of jakartaee/jsonp-api

## Basic information

**Project name:** jakartaee/jsonp-api

**Project id:** <https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jsonp>

## What are the affected versions?

Not specified

## Details of the issue

This issues has been reported to the security@ mailing list

I have discovered a DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerability in the latest version 2.1.2 of jakartaee/jsonp-api([https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jsonp、https://github.com/jakartaee/jsonp-api).The](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jsonp%E3%80%81https%3A//github.com/jakartaee/jsonp-api%29.The) demo test code is as follows:

```

import jakarta.json.Json;
import jakarta.json.JsonArray;
import java.math.BigDecimal;

xxxxx

JsonArray array = Json.createArrayBuilder()
        .add(new BigDecimal("1e99999999"))
        .build();
array.getJsonNumber(0).bigIntegerValue();

```

The cause is that when processing BigDecimal, passing in a number that is too large (such as 1e99999999) will cause a lot of additional resources to be used for processing. If the user can control the input content data, for example, by calling Json.createArrayBuilder().add(data), it can cause a DoS issue.

## Do you know any mitigations of the issue?

Not known
