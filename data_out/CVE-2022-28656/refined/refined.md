- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Apport did not limit the amount of memory being consumed during D-Bus connections.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient resource management, specifically memory allocation during D-Bus communication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause Apport to consume excessive memory, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attacker leveraging D-Bus connections.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where Apport is running and be able to interact with D-Bus.
