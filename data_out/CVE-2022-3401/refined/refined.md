Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2022-3401:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Bricks theme for WordPress allows site editors to include executable code blocks in website content. This functionality, combined with a missing authorization vulnerability (CVE-2022-3400), allows for remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unrestricted inclusion of executable code blocks within website content.
- Missing authorization checks on the `bricks_save_post` AJAX action (CVE-2022-3400), allowing unauthorized users to edit site content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution on the server. This could lead to complete compromise of the website, allowing attackers to perform actions like data theft, malware deployment, or defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker exploits the missing authorization vulnerability (CVE-2022-3400) to gain the ability to edit arbitrary page, post, or template content. Then, the attacker injects a code execution block into the content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, who can then exploit the missing authorization and code execution vulnerabilities to modify page content.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content provides more detail than the basic CVE description by explaining the combination of two vulnerabilities that lead to the exploit, also it specifies which user roles are needed to perform the attack.
