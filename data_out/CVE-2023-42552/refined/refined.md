- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Implicit intent hijacking
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The Firewall application uses implicit intents for communication, allowing a malicious 3rd party application to intercept and tamper with the application's database.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious third-party application can tamper with the database of the Firewall application.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious third-party application installed on the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target device.
