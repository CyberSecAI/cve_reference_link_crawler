**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1320

**Description:** The EventPrime – Events Calendar, Bookings and Tickets plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'offline_status' parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `offline_status` parameter, before storing it in the database.
- The plugin fails to properly escape the stored data when rendering it on a webpage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts will execute when a user accesses the affected pages.
- This could lead to:
    - Malicious redirects
    - Stealing of user session cookies
    - Defacement of the website
    - Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by the `offline_status` parameter
- Unauthenticated users can inject malicious scripts into the parameter, which is then stored in the database.
- The malicious script executes when the data is displayed on a webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated attacker.
- No special user privileges or access is needed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 3.4.4 of the plugin.

- The vulnerability was discovered by Lucio Sá.
- The plugin version 3.4.3 and below are vulnerable to the XSS.
