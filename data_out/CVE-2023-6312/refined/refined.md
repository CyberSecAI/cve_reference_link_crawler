Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the SQL injection vulnerability lies in the fact that the `deleteUser.php` script does not properly sanitize the `user_id` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `user_id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically within the `deleteUser.php` script where user-supplied input for the `user_id` parameter is directly incorporated into a database query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data exposure:** The attacker can extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Data modification:**  The attacker could potentially modify or delete database records.
- **Privilege escalation:** The attacker may be able to elevate privileges by adding or modifying administrative accounts.
- **Database server compromise:**  In severe cases, it could lead to the compromise of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through manipulating the `user_id` parameter in an HTTP GET request to the `deleteUser.php` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable web application.
- **Knowledge of web application:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameter (`user_id`) and the endpoint (`deleteUser.php`).
- **Basic SQL knowledge:** The attacker needs basic SQL syntax knowledge to craft the injection payload.

**Details:**
- The vulnerability is in the `deleteUser.php` file, which handles user deletion in the Loan Management System.
- The application fails to validate and filter user-supplied input, specifically the `user_id` parameter, which is passed via the URL.
- The provided example payload is: `GET /deleteUser.php?user_id='%20AND%20GTID_SUBSET(CONCAT("data:",database()),8194)--%20GZSp&user= HTTP/1.1`
- The attacker uses the payload to extract the database name
- The vulnerability can be detected using automated tools like `sqlmap`
