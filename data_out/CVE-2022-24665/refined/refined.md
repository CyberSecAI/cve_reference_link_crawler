{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The PHP Everywhere plugin allows execution of PHP code snippets via Gutenberg blocks, and by default, all users with the 'edit_posts' capability could use this functionality.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The plugin did not properly restrict access to the Gutenberg block functionality, allowing users with the 'edit_posts' capability (e.g., Contributor-level users) to insert and execute arbitrary PHP code.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the target server, potentially leading to complete site takeover.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit this by creating a post, adding a PHP Everywhere Gutenberg block, inserting malicious code into it, and then previewing the post.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a Contributor-level account (or higher) on the WordPress site, which provides the 'edit_posts' capability."
