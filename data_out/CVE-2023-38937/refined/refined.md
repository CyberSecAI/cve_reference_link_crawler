```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `formSetVirtualSer` function reads user-provided parameter `list` into a buffer, which is then passed to the `save_virtualser_data` function. Within `save_virtualser_data`, the `sscanf` function is used without proper length checks when parsing the input into stack-based buffers `lan_ip` and `protocol`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the `formSetVirtualSer` function due to missing length checks when parsing the `list` parameter using `sscanf` into `lan_ip` and `protocol` buffers.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) or achieve remote code execution (RCE) by exploiting the buffer overflow.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/SetVirtualServerCfg` endpoint, an attacker can set an overly long value for the `list` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the `/SetVirtualServerCfg` endpoint of the affected Tenda router."
