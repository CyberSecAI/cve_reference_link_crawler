Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the `servername` parameter of the `MultiServerAjax` interface in ESAFENET CDG V5.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input (`servername`) before it's used in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the `MultiServerAjax` interface, specifically the `servername` parameter. An attacker would need to send a request to this interface containing malicious SQL code in this parameter.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    *   Read sensitive data from the database.
    *   Modify or delete data within the database.
    *   Potentially gain further access to the system or execute arbitrary code, depending on database permissions.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to send requests to the `MultiServerAjax` interface and manipulate the `servername` parameter, suggesting this is a web-based attack and that the attacker has access to network/application.

**Summary:**

ESAFENET CDG V5 is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `servername` parameter in its `MultiServerAjax` interface, which could lead to data theft, manipulation, or further compromise of the system.
