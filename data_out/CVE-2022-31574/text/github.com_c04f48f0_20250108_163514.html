# Simple-RAT

**A simple Remote Acces Trojan written in Python.**

Simple Remote Access Trojan I wrote in college to show the principles of such program.
It consists of client and server sides. Besides serving as a C&C, server side provides a web application to interact with infected computers.

**Written for Windows OS & tested only on Win7**. It is not perfect and has some problems, you can experiment with it and change it in any way you want.

Available interactions are browsing and downloading files, browsing through keylogs, and screenshots of user's screen.

# Getting Started

**It's easy to get it running! Just follow these simple steps.**

#### Installing Prerequisites

1. **Installing and configuring FileZilla**
   To get it running on your system, you will have to install and configure a FTP server.

   I used the [**FileZilla Server**](https://filezilla-project.org/) and recommend it for usage.

   You will need this because file upload implemented with FTP protocol.

   Make sure to configure FileZilla Server in the following way: [FileZilla Config](/sergeKashkin/Simple-RAT/blob/master/FileZilla-Config.md).
2. **Installing required packages**

   In order to make it work, install the modules listed in **requirements.txt** with **pip**:

   ```
   pip install  -r <path to requirements.txt>
   ```
3. **Installing PyInstaller**

   This step is not mandatory, but if you'll want to compile the programm to a single executable,

   I recommend using **PyInstaller**:

   ```
   pip install PyInstaller
   ```

   or a GUI version called **Auto PY to EXE**:

   ```
   pip install auto-py-to-exe
   ```

#### Configuring

**After installing all prerequisites and configuring your ftp client, you should configure the client and the server side of the app.**

1. **Configuring the server.**

   Open **server\RAT\_server.py** with your editor and edit the following lines(lines no. 23-24).

   Change HOST and PORT to your address(on this address the server will await incoming connections).
   ```
   23. HOST = ''
   24. PORT = 0
   ```

   Then go to the last line, and change the host and port to ones you want to(on this address the web application for interaction with clients will be served).

   The default option is to listen on all adresses and port **443**.
   ```
   287. https_server = WSGIServer(('0.0.0.0',443), app)
   ```
2. **Configuring the client.**

   Open **client\ftp\_uploader.py** with your editor and edit the following lines(lines no. 6-8).
   Change **host** to address of your FTP server, **user** and **pswd** to the ones you've configured on your FTP server.
   ```
   6. host = # ftp address
   7. user = # username
   8. pswd = # password
   ```

   Open **client\rat.py** with your editor and edit the following lines(39-40).

   Change **HOST** and **PORT** to the address of your server, which you configured in step 1.(On this address the client - infected comp. will make a connection to the server)
   ```
   39. HOST = ''
   40. PORT = 65432
   ```

#### Running

**Running the server.**

1. Run **server\RAT\_server.py** The app will prompt you to register, you will need this in order to access it from the browser.

   [![new user.](/sergeKashkin/Simple-RAT/raw/master/screenshots/server-register.JPG)](/sergeKashkin/Simple-RAT/blob/master/screenshots/server-register.JPG)

   After entering your credentials(remember them), you will be notified that the app is running.
2. Access the app with a browser. Enter the address of the server(You've entered in step 2 of **Configuring the server**).

   Login with credentials from previous step.

**Running the client**

1. Copy the contents of the configured **client** folder to virtual machine(or other computer) and run **client\RAT\_client.py** file.

   It is better to compile it to binary executable and run it instead of python script(for proper work, compile it with **--uac-admin** flag).
2. After running the client, it will copy itself to **appdata** folder and make a new task in **Task Scheduler** to run on start.

After completing these steps, you will be able to interact with computers connected to your server.

These interactions are made with the web app interface and include browsing through user files, downloading them, making screenshots,
 browsing through keylogs and screenshots of user's screen.
