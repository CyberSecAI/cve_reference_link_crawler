Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-7063

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within the `render_raw` function of the ElementsKit Pro plugin. This function does not properly check user permissions, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The `render_raw` function fails to properly enforce access controls, allowing users with lower-level permissions (Contributor+) to access information they shouldn't have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Exposure of Private Content:** Attackers with Contributor-level access can extract sensitive data, including private, future, and draft posts. This could lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential or proprietary information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely via network requests (AV:N).
*   **Authenticated Exploitation:** Exploitation requires an attacker to have an account on the WordPress site with at least Contributor-level permissions (PR:L).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **WordPress Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the target WordPress site.
*   **Contributor+ Permissions:** The account must have at least Contributor-level permissions.

**Additional Notes:**
* The Wordfence article explicitly mentions the vulnerable function as `render_raw`.
* The vulnerability is present in versions <= 3.6.6 of the ElementsKit Pro plugin.
* The fix is to update to version 3.6.7 or later, which presumably patches the access control issue in the `render_raw` function.
