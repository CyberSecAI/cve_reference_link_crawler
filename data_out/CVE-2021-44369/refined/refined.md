- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `cgiserver.cgi` process, which manages API requests, improperly parses JSON commands. Specifically, the code assumes that the "param" field within a JSON command is always a JSON object and accesses it using a subscription operator. However, when a string or other non-object type is provided for "param", it triggers an assertion failure causing the `cgiserver.cgi` process to terminate, which ultimately leads to a device reboot.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20). The code does not properly validate the type of the "param" field before attempting to access it as a JSON object. This lack of validation allows for a type mismatch leading to the process crash.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploitation leads to a denial of service. The `cgiserver.cgi` process crashes, causing the device to reboot. This can disrupt the camera's operation.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is an HTTP POST request with a JSON payload containing a specific command, action, and a "param" field which is not a JSON object, sent to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the camera's API endpoint. In some cases, this vulnerability can be exploited without authentication by leveraging a related vulnerability (TALOS-2021-1420), allowing an unauthenticated attacker to trigger the reboot.
- **Details specific to CVE-2021-44369:** This specific CVE relates to the `SetNtp` command. When a crafted request is sent to the device using the `SetNtp` command with the `param` field as a string, the device will reboot.
```
[
    {
        "cmd": "SetNtp",
        "action": 0,
        "param":  ""
    }
]
```
