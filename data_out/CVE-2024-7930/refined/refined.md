Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of sanitization or validation of the `medicine_id` parameter in the `get_packings.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The application directly uses the user-supplied `medicine_id` parameter in a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive data stored in the database, such as user credentials, patient information, or other confidential data.
*  **Potential Data Modification/Deletion:** Depending on the database permissions, the attacker might be able to modify or delete data, leading to further impact on the application's functionality and data integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `get_packings.php` file, with the malicious SQL code embedded in the `medicine_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft malicious payloads that will be successfully injected into the database query.
*   **No prior authentication:** The provided proof of concept indicates that no prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable file is located at `/pms/ajax/get_packings.php`.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `medicine_id`.
*   The database name is `pms_db`.
*   The provided proof of concept shows how to use SQL injection to retrieve the database name.
