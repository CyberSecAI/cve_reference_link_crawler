Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-7286

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control in the `ACF Quick Edit Fields` plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not adequately restrict access to user metadata created by the Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin. This allows users without the `edit_users` capability to retrieve other users' custom metadata.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The plugin directly uses user-supplied input (`object_id` and `acf_field_keys`) to fetch user metadata without sufficient authorization checks.
*   **Broken Access Control:** The plugin fails to enforce proper authorization, allowing users with lower privileges (e.g., Contributor+) to access sensitive user metadata that should be restricted to administrators or users with `edit_users` capability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive user metadata, such as profile information, contact details, or other custom fields defined by ACF. This can lead to privacy breaches and potentially aid in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct AJAX Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious AJAX request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint. This request includes specific parameters:
    *   `action=get_acf_post_meta`: Triggers the vulnerable functionality.
    *   `_ajax_nonce`: A security nonce, which the attacker needs to acquire first, which is easily accessible to authenticated users.
    *   `object_id=user_{USER_ID}`: Specifies the ID of the user whose metadata is to be leaked.
    *   `acf_field_keys={FIELD_KEY}`: Specifies the key(s) of the ACF field(s) to be leaked.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site with at least Contributor level privileges.
*   **Access to Admin AJAX:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   **Knowledge of Target IDs/Keys:** The attacker needs to know the target user ID (`user_123` in the PoC) and the ACF field keys of the metadata they want to leak.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.2.3 of the `ACF Quick Edit Fields` plugin.
*   The Wordfence Intelligence data indicates that 90 attacks targeting this vulnerability were blocked in the past 24 hours.
*   The vulnerability is classified as an IDOR and falls under OWASP's A5: Broken Access Control category.
*   The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key).
*   The CVSS score is 6.5 (Medium), indicating moderate severity.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability in the ACF Quick Edit Fields plugin allows authenticated users with Contributor-level or higher privileges to retrieve sensitive metadata of other users through an AJAX request. This is due to a missing access control check, which allows attackers to use arbitrary object IDs and field keys, leading to an information disclosure.

**Mitigation:**
Update the `ACF Quick Edit Fields` plugin to version 3.2.3 or later to remediate this vulnerability.
