The ElementInvader Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.9 via the Page Loader widget. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to view private/draft/password protected posts, pages, and Elementor templates that they should not have access to.
