Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9889:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The provided content directly mentions CVE-2024-9889 and describes a vulnerability in the "ElementInvader Addons for Elementor" plugin, which aligns with the CVE ID. Therefore, the content is relevant to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
   - The root cause is a lack of proper access control checks in the Page Loader widget of the ElementInvader Addons for Elementor plugin.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
   - The plugin is vulnerable to **Sensitive Information Exposure**.
   - Specifically, the Page Loader widget does not verify if the logged-in user has the necessary permissions to view the content being loaded.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
   - **Impact:** Authenticated attackers with "Contributor" level access or higher can view private, draft, or password-protected posts, pages, and Elementor templates. This is sensitive information that these users should not have access to.
   - **Confidentiality:** Unauthorized disclosure of content intended to be private.

**5. Attack Vectors**
   - **Network:** Exploitation occurs over the network.
   - **Widget:** Attackers leverage the vulnerable Page Loader widget.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
   - **Authentication:** Attackers must be authenticated WordPress users.
   - **Access Level:** Attackers need at least "Contributor" level access on the WordPress site.
   - **Plugin Installation:** The vulnerable "ElementInvader Addons for Elementor" plugin must be installed and active on the WordPress site.
   - **Exploitation:** The attacker needs to use the Page Loader widget functionality to load content they should not have access to.

**Additional Notes from the provided Content:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions <= 1.2.9 of the plugin.
- The issue was fixed in version 1.3.0.
- The patch included checks to ensure that the user has the appropriate permissions before loading content using the pageloader widget.
- The fix also includes a check to prevent access to private, draft, and password-protected posts when using the `shortcode-post_content.php` shortcode, and similar checks when using the `widgets/pageloader.php` widget.
- The `ajax-handler.php` file was also modified to not include the `g-recaptcha-response` value in the message body. Additionally, the function used to handle mail subject templates, was modified to properly lowercase keys used for value replacement.

In summary, this vulnerability allows low-level authenticated users to bypass WordPress's access controls and view private content by using a vulnerable plugin widget.
