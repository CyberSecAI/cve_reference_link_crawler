- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The OpenCTI platform's user profile update API lacks sufficient security controls, allowing authenticated users to modify fields beyond those intended for self-modification.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient input validation/authorization on the GraphQL mutation for profile editing. Specifically, the API does not properly check which fields can be updated by a low-privileged user, allowing modification of fields which should be restricted to administrators. This is described as a lack of security controls on the profile edition API.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker with low privileges can escalate their privileges to administrator, leading to a full compromise of data integrity and confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based, via the GraphQL API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have an account on the OpenCTI platform with low privileges, and be able to send GraphQL requests.
