# OpenCTI Authenticated Privilege Escalation - Lack of security controls on profile edition API

High

[SamuelHassine](/SamuelHassine)
published
GHSA-qx4j-f4f2-vjw9
May 22, 2024

## Package

OpenCTI
(OpenCTI)

## Affected versions

<= 5.12.31

## Patched versions

>= 5.12.31

## Description

## Summary

A bug in the OpenCTI platform introduces a lack of security controls in the user profile update feature, allowing an authenticated user with low privileges to gain administrative privileges within the web application.

## Details

In the GraphQL mutation of the profile edition, the API allows an authenticated user to update fields of its profile such as language, firstname, lastname, etc. The application does not perform enough check on which field can be updated using this API endpoint, which leads to unwanted / forbidden modification to be executed.

This issue affects both the Standard and Enterprise version of the application.

## Impact

By exploiting this vulnerability an authenticated attacker with low privileges can gain administrative privileges on the web application, resulting in a total compromise of integrity and confidentiality.

## Acknowledgement

Filigran would like to thank the reporter ([walterone](https://github.com/walterone)) for his security review.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
