The provided content contains multiple patches for the same vulnerability in the Linux kernel. All patches address a missing check for the return value of `mtk_alloc_clk_data()` in the `drivers/clk/mediatek/clk-mt6765.c` file. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if memory allocation fails.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The code was missing checks on the return value of `mtk_alloc_clk_data()`. This function is responsible for allocating memory for clock data structures. If the allocation fails, it returns NULL. Without a check, the code would proceed to dereference the NULL pointer, causing a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for a NULL pointer dereference. If `mtk_alloc_clk_data()` fails to allocate memory, it returns NULL. The subsequent code uses this potentially NULL pointer without checking its validity, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of this vulnerability would result in a kernel crash, effectively leading to a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the probe functions of the clk driver. It can be triggered during device initialization when the platform driver attempts to register the clock.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be in a position to trigger the loading of the affected MediaTek clock driver, which means they must be able to initiate the device initialization sequence. This typically requires control over the boot process or privileged access to the system to load/unload modules, or by triggering a device hotplug event.

**Patch Details**
The patches add a simple check for the return value of `mtk_alloc_clk_data()`. If the function returns NULL, the code now returns `-ENOMEM`, which is the standard error code for out-of-memory conditions. This prevents the NULL pointer dereference and subsequent crash. The following three functions are affected:
- `clk_mt6765_apmixed_probe`
- `clk_mt6765_top_probe`
- `clk_mt6765_ifr_probe`
Each patch applies the same fix to these three functions, adding an `if (!clk_data) return -ENOMEM;` check after the `clk_data = mtk_alloc_clk_data(...)` call.
