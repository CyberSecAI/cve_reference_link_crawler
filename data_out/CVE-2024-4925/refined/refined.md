Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (the `id` parameter) from the URL into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unrestricted SQL injection vulnerability in `manage_course.php` via the `id` parameter.
- Lack of input validation or sanitization on the `id` parameter before using it in the SQL query.
- Direct execution of user-provided input in a SQL statement.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the server database.
- Potential for data exfiltration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to `/intrams_sams/manage_course.php`
- The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter within the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as a requirement for exploitation.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable File: `/intrams_sams/manage_course.php`
- Vulnerable Parameter: `id`
- The provided proof of concept (POC) shows how an attacker can inject SQL code through the id parameter (e.g. `id=1*`).
- An image is provided that illustrates the vulnerable code in `manage_course.php` as well as the result of an `sqlmap` command used to test the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability exists in `School Intramurals - Student Attendance Management System - 1.0` which is a PHP application.

The provided information gives a clear picture of a SQL Injection vulnerability, including the affected file, vulnerable parameter, and how to trigger it. This aligns with a typical SQL injection scenario, where user-supplied data is directly used in database queries without any checks.
