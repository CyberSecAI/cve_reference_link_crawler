# Minder trusts client-provided mapping from repo name to upstream ID

Moderate

[evankanderson](/evankanderson)
published
GHSA-q6h8-4j2v-pjg4
Feb 26, 2024

## Package

gomod

github.com/stacklok/minder
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 0.20240226.1425+ref.53868a8

## Patched versions

0.20240226.1425+ref.53868a8

## Description

### Summary

When using a modified client or the grpc interface directly, the `RegisterRepository` call accepts *both* the repository owner / repo **and** the repo\_id. Furthermore, these two are not checked for matching before registering webhooks and data in the database.

### Details

It is possible for an attacker to register a repository with a invalid or differing upstream ID, which causes Minder to report the repository as registered, but not remediate any future changes which conflict with policy (because the webhooks for the repo do not match any known repository in the database). When attempting to register a repo with a different repo ID, the registered provider must have admin on the named repo, or a 404 error will result. Similarly, if the stored provider token does not have repo access, then the remediations will not apply successfully. Lastly, it appears that reconciliation actions do not execute against repos with this type of mismatch.

### PoC

With an RPC like the following text proto:

```
context {
  ...
}
repository {
  owner: "Stacklok-Demo-Org"
  repo: "python-app"
  # repo_id is defaulted to 0
}

```

I was able to produce the following `minder` output:

```
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+----------+-------------+-------------------+------------+
|                  ID                  |               PROJECT                | PROVIDER | UPSTREAM ID |       OWNER       |    NAME    |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+----------+-------------+-------------------+------------+
| da3acba4-ef66-4d9b-b41e-250869107fd5 | f9f4aef0-74af-4909-a0c3-0e8ac7fbc38d | github   |           0 | Stacklok-Demo-Org | python-app |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+----------+-------------+-------------------+------------+
| 7cf8f7b8-b19b-40dd-a96b-b88bb1ef5563 | f9f4aef0-74af-4909-a0c3-0e8ac7fbc38d | github   |   762029128 | evankanderson     | bad-python |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+----------+-------------+-------------------+------------+

```

```
$ gh api repos/Stacklok-Demo-Org/python-app | jq .id
762029128

```

I've registered bad-python with the ID of python-app, and python-app with an ID of 0.

### Impact

This appears to primarily be a potential denial-of-service vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
