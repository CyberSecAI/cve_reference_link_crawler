Based on the provided content, this vulnerability relates to a race condition in the F2FS filesystem that can cause data corruption.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a race condition that occurs during garbage collection (GC) in the F2FS filesystem. The `invalidate_mapping_pages()` function, used to invalidate meta-inode pages, does not properly handle pages that are locked, dirty, or in writeback status. This can lead to inconsistent data being written.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Race condition during garbage collection.
- Failure of `invalidate_mapping_pages()` to invalidate meta-inode pages under certain conditions (locked, dirty, writeback status).
- Potential for writing old data to new block addresses.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data corruption in the F2FS filesystem.
- Potentially inconsistent filesystem state.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering garbage collection while meta-inode pages are locked, dirty, or in writeback status. This could be achieved through normal filesystem operations which trigger GC.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to perform operations that trigger F2FS garbage collection.
- No special privileges are explicitly required; a normal user with write access to the filesystem can potentially trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical details**
The vulnerability occurs because, during garbage collection (GC), a thread (Thread A) might attempt to move a data block. This involves:
1. Reading a meta_inode page that is used to locate the data.
2. Inplace writing the data, which should invalidate the original dataâ€™s metadata using `invalidate_mapping_pages()`.
3. Loading data from the meta_inode page.
4. Writing the old data to a new block address.

The issue is that `invalidate_mapping_pages()` might fail to invalidate the meta_inode page if the page is locked, dirty, or undergoing writeback. This results in writing stale data, leading to data corruption.

The fix replaces `invalidate_mapping_pages()` with `truncate_inode_pages_range()`, which ensures that the meta_inode page will be dropped. This fix also includes a new helper function `f2fs_truncate_meta_inode_pages()` which handles finding pages and submitting writes of dirty pages to ensure consistency before invalidating the page.
