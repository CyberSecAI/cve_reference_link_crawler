Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:**
- The `/admin-api/upload_image` endpoint in Owl Admin System v3.5.7 allows file uploads without proper sanitization or validation of the file contents.
- The system does not prevent the upload of files containing malicious code, such as JavaScript.
- The system serves the uploaded file without proper sanitization, allowing the malicious code to execute when the file is accessed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure File Upload:** The system lacks sufficient checks to validate the content of uploaded files.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The system does not sanitize the content of the uploaded files to prevent the execution of malicious code.
- **Lack of Output Encoding:** The system does not encode output when serving the uploaded files, which is necessary to prevent the execution of malicious code by the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application.
- This can lead to:
  - Stealing sensitive information from users, such as session tokens, cookies, or personal data.
  - Account takeover (e.g., administrator account takeover)
  - Other malicious actions, such as redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker uploads a file containing malicious JavaScript code to the `/admin-api/upload_image` endpoint.
- The uploaded file is then served by the system (e.g., at `http://demo.owladmin.com/storage/images/[response_value].html`), allowing the malicious code to execute in a user's browser when they access the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to access the `/admin-api/upload_image` endpoint, likely requiring authentication, as it's part of the admin panel.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a file that contains malicious JavaScript code.
- No special network position is mentioned, implying a standard network access would be sufficient.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker uploads a seemingly legitimate image, intercepts the upload request and modifies the file content.
- The attacker changes the file content to include an XSS payload such as:
    ```
    <img src=1 onerror=alert(console.log)>
    <ImG sRc=x onerRor=alert(1);>
    <svg><script>alert(1)</script>
    ```
- The server saves the file and provides a url to access it.
- When the crafted url `http://demo.owladmin.com/storage/images/[response_value].html` is accessed by an user, the XSS payload will be executed.

**Mitigation:**
- The provided mitigation steps include:
  - **Encoding Data on Output:** Encoding data to ensure it's treated as data, not executable code.
  - **Validating and Sanitizing Input:** Validating user-supplied data and sanitizing it to remove potentially harmful characters.
  - **Using Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implementing CSP to specify trusted sources for executable scripts.
