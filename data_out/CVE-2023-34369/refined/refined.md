- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Login Configurator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website, which will be executed when guests visit the site.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor could inject malicious scripts through the plugin's input fields/parameters, which are then displayed on the website without proper sanitization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings, which generally requires administrator-level access.
