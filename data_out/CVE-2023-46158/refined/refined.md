- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the way IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty handles security when the appSecurity-1.0, appSecurity-2.0, appSecurity-3.0, appSecurity-4.0, or appSecurity-5.0 features are enabled, resulting in weaker than expected security.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application security features in specific versions of IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty are not providing the expected level of security.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact is that the application might have weaker security than intended.
- **Attack vectors:** The specific attack vectors are not detailed but it involves exploiting the weakness in the security implementation of the named features within the application server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The document does not specify the attacker capabilities/position to exploit the vulnerability. It can be inferred that some form of network access is likely required.
