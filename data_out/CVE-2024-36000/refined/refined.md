Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2024-36000**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing `hugetlb_lock` when uncharging hugepage reservations in the `hugetlb_cgroup_uncharge_folio_rsvd()` function. This function updates the cgroup pointer and requires the lock to be held to prevent race conditions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Race condition:** Multiple threads can concurrently modify the reservation map, leading to data corruption or other undefined behavior.
- **Missing lock:** The `hugetlb_lock` was not acquired before calling `hugetlb_cgroup_uncharge_folio_rsvd()` in the unlikely path when two threads are modifying the reservation map together.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data corruption:** Concurrent modifications to the reservation map without proper locking can lead to inconsistent data and accounting.
- **Undefined behavior:** The lack of synchronization can lead to various unpredictable issues, potentially causing system instability or crashes.
- The commit message mentions a lockdep assertion failure, which is a strong indication of an issue that can lead to system instability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the unlikely path where two threads modify the resv map together, which is possible through UFFDIO\_COPY over hugetlb.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to trigger a scenario involving UFFDIO\_COPY over hugetlb, causing the unlikely path to be reached and leading to a race condition.
- The attacker must have the ability to trigger operations that involve hugetlb and userfaultfd with UFFDIO\_COPY operations to exploit this condition.
