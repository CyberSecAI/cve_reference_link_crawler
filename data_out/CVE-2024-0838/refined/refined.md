Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-0838:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `side_img` URL parameter within the "Age Gate" widget of the Happy Addons for Elementor plugin. This allows for the injection of malicious web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided input, leading to the storage of malicious JavaScript code in the database which is then executed in the browsers of site visitors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary web scripts can be injected into pages.
- When a user accesses the affected page, the injected script will execute within their browser.
- This can potentially lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Stealing of sensitive information
    - Other attacks on site users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `side image URL` parameter within the Age Gate widget.
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload and inserts it into this URL field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with "contributor" level access or higher on the WordPress site.
- This implies that they need to have some level of authorized access to modify content on the website.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 3.10.1
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.10.2
- CVE-2024-29108 is likely a duplicate of this issue.
- The vulnerable code is located in the `widgets/age-gate/widget.php` file, specifically around line 458 where the `side_img` parameter is handled.
