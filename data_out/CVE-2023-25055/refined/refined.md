{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to induce unintended actions by authenticated users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, performs unintended actions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into triggering a crafted malicious request. No prior authentication is required for the attacker but the victim user needs to be logged in."
