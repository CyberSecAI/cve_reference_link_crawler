```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow that occurs due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a heap-based buffer during the processing of Data Node jobs in MySQL Cluster.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Heap-based buffer overflow
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the service account, leading to potential unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, unauthorized read or modification access to data, or denial of service due to a crash.
- Attack vectors: Network
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable MySQL Cluster data node. Authentication is not required.
