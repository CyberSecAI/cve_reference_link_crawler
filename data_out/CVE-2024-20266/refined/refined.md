- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because certain DHCPv4 messages are improperly validated when they are processed by an affected device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper validation of DHCPv4 messages leads to a crash of the `dhcpd` process. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-476, which is a NULL pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit causes the `dhcpd` process to crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. DHCPv4 server services become unavailable while the `dhcpd` process is restarting (approximately two minutes). This can prevent network access for clients joining the network during that time. The router does not reload, only the `dhcpd` process crashes.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a malformed DHCPv4 message to an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the target device. No prior authentication is needed.
