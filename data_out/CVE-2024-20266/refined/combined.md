| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS XR Software DHCP Version 4 Server Denial of Service Vulnerability Medium   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-iosxr-dhcp-dos-3tgPKRdm  First Published: 2024 March 13 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCwf83090](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf83090)     CVE-2024-20266     CWE-476       CVSS Score: [Base 5.3](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2024-20266     CWE-476       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxr-dhcp-dos-3tgPKRdm/csaf/cisco-sa-iosxr-dhcp-dos-3tgPKRdm.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the DHCP version 4 (DHCPv4) server feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a crash of the *dhcpd* process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  This vulnerability exists because certain DHCPv4 messages are improperly validated when they are processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed DHCPv4 message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash of the *dhcpd* process. While the *dhcpd* process is restarting, which may take approximately two minutes, DHCPv4 server services are unavailable on the affected device. This could temporarily prevent network access to clients that join the network during that time period and rely on the DHCPv4 server of the affected device.  **Notes:**    + Only the *dhcpd* process crashes and eventually restarts automatically. The router does not reload.   + This vulnerability only applies to DHCPv4. DHCP version 6 (DHCPv6) is not affected. Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxr-dhcp-dos-3tgPKRdm>  This advisory is part of the March 2024 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: March 2024 Semiannual Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75299).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco IOS XR Software if it had the DHCPv4 server feature or the DHCPv4 proxy feature enabled.  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Determine the DHCPv4 Configuration To determine whether the DHCPv4 server feature or the DHCPv4 proxy feature is enabled on a device, run the **show running-config dhcp ipv4** command in privileged EXEC mode on the device CLI and check for a server profile that is either directly or indirectly (through a base profile) bound to at least one interface.  The following example shows the output of the **show running-config dhcp ipv4** command on a device that has the DHCPv4 server profile *TEST* directly bound to interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0:  ```   dhcp ipv4 profile TEST server  .  .  . ! interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0 server profile TEST   ```  The following example shows the output of the **show running-config dhcp ipv4** command on a device that has the DHCPv4 server profiles *DHCP\_SERVER* and *DEFAULT\_PROFILE* indirectly bound to interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0 through base profile *DHCP\_BASE*:  ```   dhcp ipv4 profile DHCP_BASE base  match option 60 41424355 profile DHCP_SERVER server  default profile DEFAULT_PROFILE server  .  .  . ! profile DHCP_SERVER server  .  .  . ! profile DEFAULT_PROFILE server  .  .  . ! interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0 base profile DHCP_BASE   ```  The following example shows the output of the **show running-config dhcp ipv4** command on a device that has the DHCPv4 proxy profile *PROXY* directly bound to interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0:  ```   dhcp ipv4 profile PROXY proxy  helper-address vrf default 192.168.23.7 giaddr 192.168.23.11 ! interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0 proxy profile PROXY   ```    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + IOS Software   + IOS XE Software   + NX-OS Software  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
