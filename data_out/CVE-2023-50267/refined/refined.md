- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Authenticated users can access resources within a project scope that do not belong to them, provided they know the resource ID.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Horizontal privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to resources within a project scope, potentially leading to unauthorized viewing or modification of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Network based.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with knowledge of the resource ID they wish to access.
