**UPDATE 4.00** [ 11/02/2017 ]

**Major update:** A new admin has been introduced. This is designed from the ground up, based on feedback we received over the years for the old one. It is ajax enabled and changes are updated nearly instantly. Because the legacy admin and the new one are not compatible ( are based on different principles ), the change will not be done automatically. But, exported sliders from the old one are converted on import to the new one.

With that in mind, new install will upgrade the new admin directly. And current install will keep legacy admin, until administrators are ready to upgrade. If you want to import your legacy galleries, just export them from the legacy admin, switch to the new one ( from ZoomSounds > Settings > Playlists Mode ) , and import them into the new one.

#### How to replicate some Client Showcase examples

These are nice customisations made by clients for their site. We try to bring as many different example into the One click importer but it takes time. Some might ressemble some examples there. So you can quick start your customization based on a template.
##### Grid Player

This is a woocommerce theme’s shop, ZoomSounds complements it by having the setting in ZoomSounds > WC Loops set to Loop -> Overlay

You just have to press this button above every post / page to add a single mp3 -

If you want a gallery – you can press the other button. And galleries are configured inside the ZoomSounds wp menu.

#### s there anyway to disable autoplay for a playlist? This is the shortcode I am using: [playlist artists=”false” images=”false” ids=”1230,1235,1238,1237,1239,1236”] .

yes, in ZoomSounds admin, create a new slider named **playlist\_gallery**

Then in that, set **autoplay** to OFF

top:0!important;

##### Can there be multiple instances of this player per page

Yes, there can be unlimited instances on each page / post.
#### I am looking for an audio player for my WP site that will play songs continuos / without interruption or starting the song over when a visitor browses different pages,

For this, you need a ajax enable theme. Or a plugin that enables continuos navigating between pages without browser refresh ( like – [https://codecanyon.net/item/ajaxer-ajaxify-your-wordpress-site-and-comments/15813677?ref=ZoomIt](https://codecanyon.net/item/ajaxer-ajaxify-your-wordpress-site-and-comments/15813677) )
#### does this allow continuos playback?

Only if your theme supports that ( it does not depend on zoomsounds )

If you have a theme like this -> <https://themeforest.net/item/qu-the-creative-multipurpose-wordpress-theme/17759297>

( no page refresh between page change )

For music to continue playing while changing page

We also made a free plugin for any theme

- [http://preview.codecanyon.net/item/ajaxer-ajaxify-your-wordpress-site-and-comments/full\_screen\_preview/15813677?ref=ZoomIt](http://preview.codecanyon.net/item/ajaxer-ajaxify-your-wordpress-site-and-comments/full_screen_preview/15813677)

for this purpose

##### is this plug in programmed to stop playing when another player starts playing on the same page

Sure, when another ZoomSounds player is clicked, the current playing one will be stopped.
##### Can you use this audio player with short codes? Does it have a shortcode function?

A simple shortcode is required for the plugin to work – [zoomsounds] – and you do not even have to remember that because there are shortcode generators for both audio file and audio gallery

##### How can I get the social networks icons centered in lightbox ?

Go to ZoomSounds > Settings > **appearence**

and in **Extra CSS** enter

```
.social-networks-con{ text-align: center; }
```
##### How can I change the color of the svg icon on top left, the cross to close the sharing possibilities.

Go to ZoomSounds > Settings > **appearence**

and in **Extra CSS** enter

```
.dzsap-main-con .box-main .close-btn-con svg path{ fill: #fff;  }
```
##### Can you use this audio player with short codes? Does it have a shortcode function?

A simple shortcode is required for the plugin to work – [zoomsounds] – and you do not even have to remember that because there are shortcode generators for both audio file and audio gallery

##### Hi, Can i use it as standalone script without wordpress?

This is stand alone html5 version – [http://codecanyon.net/item/zoomsounds-neat-html5-audio-player/4525354](https://codecanyon.net/item/zoomsounds-neat-html5-audio-player/4525354)
##### How to place additional links to track amazon / itunes ?

You can place them in the **extra html** field of the item :

This is the code:

```
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/justin-bieber/id320569549" class="btn-zoomsounds btn-zoomsounds-download"><span class="the-icon"><i class="fa fa-apple" /></span><span class="the-label">iTunes</span></a>
```
#### how to change colors of the **skin-default** menu

Go to zoomsoudns > settings > **appearence** and in extra css enter –
```

body .zoomsounds-nav.skin-default .menu-item{background-color: #fff;
color: #444;
}
body .zoomsounds-nav.skin-default .menu-item:nth-child(odd){
background-color: #efefef;
}
```

any color is custom

#### How to enable zoomsounds player in woocommerce shop

The idea is to go to ZoomSounds > Settings > **WooCommerce** and enable Configuration for Loop Products to a player configuration you need.

Then ZoomSounds it will appear in any shop page / product cateegory

PS: The Products need the mp3 track uploaded in the ZoomSounds tab in any WooCommerce product

Default is that only one zoomsounds player on the page plays. The other ones pause.

##### Also can it play MP3’s self-hosted?

Sure, it’s the main source. It can also play shoutcast radio…

##### And another idea would be a buy link for the EP! Could it be possible?

You can insert that in the artist or song name spaces

##### My mp3s show infinity for length

You might need to reencode your mp3. Test the mp3 directly on th browser ( just input the link to the mp3 in the browser ) – if the browser does not have support for it then ZoomSounds cannot play it of course

###### I’m looking for an mp3 player plugin that allows download of the mp3s. The mp3 artwork (image) provides the title and then the play and download buttons overlay it. On the archive page we have the same but nicely arranged in grid layout.

Generally, yes

But

What do you mean by archive ?

If this is a custom page you set – then zoomsounds has shortcodes for this

If this is theme archive page, then your theme must have support for this grid

\_\_

OR

\_\_

This file – plugins/dzs-zoomsounds/soundcloudretriever.php

may returns access denied and we need this php in order to return the sound

Try to chmod this file 755 from your Filezilla or FTP app.

If it does not work please contact your host and ask them to allow access for this file – plugins/dzs-zoomsounds/soundcloudretriever.php
