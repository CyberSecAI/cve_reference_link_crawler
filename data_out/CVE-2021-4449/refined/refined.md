Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-4449:

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **Affected Software:** ZoomSounds WordPress plugin
*   **Versions Affected:**  Versions prior to 6.05 (Confirmed to be vulnerable up to v5.96)
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin's `savepng.php` file lacks proper file type validation. This allows an attacker to bypass intended restrictions on file uploads.
*   **Weakness:** Missing file type validation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can upload arbitrary files to the web server.
    *   The attacker can potentially achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by uploading and executing malicious code (e.g., a PHP file)
    *   Website defacement by uploading a malicious file such as a defacement page.
*   **Attack Vector:** HTTP POST request to `/wp-content/plugins/dzs-zoomsounds/savepng.php`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.

**Technical Details**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `savepng.php` file within the plugin directory.
*   The file accepts a `location` parameter via a GET request, which specifies the destination path for the uploaded file, and the file content is provided via a POST request with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8`

**Exploit Example (from sploitus.com)**

```
POST /wp-content/plugins/dzs-zoomsounds/savepng.php?location=a.php HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01
Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Content-Length: 23
Connection: close

<?php echo 'Failed'; ?>
```

*   This POST request sends the PHP code `<?php echo 'Failed'; ?>` to be saved in a file named `a.php` within the plugins directory `dzs-zoomsounds`. The `location` parameter in the request determines the name and location of the uploaded file, enabling the attacker to specify the destination.

**Mitigation**

*   **Update:** The vulnerability is patched in version 6.05 and later. It is crucial to update to this version or later.
*   **Removal:** If an update is not possible, remove the plugin.

**Additional Notes**

*   The identified files with malware/defacement content `xxtest.php`, `wp-fixer.php`, `opa.php`, `defacer.php`, `wp-cn.php` and `atx.php`, and the `/wp-includes/atx.php` path indicate real-world exploitation is likely happening.

*   The various sources (Wordfence, WPScan, Github, iThemes) all point to the same vulnerability information, confirming its existence and severity.

This information aligns with the vulnerability description provided by the CVE.

**Summary**

The ZoomSounds plugin had a critical vulnerability that allowed unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files due to a lack of file type validation, potentially leading to remote code execution. This vulnerability was addressed in version 6.05 of the plugin.
