## A Note on Responsible Disclosure

You might be wondering why a vulnerability would be disclosed if it gives hackers an exploit to attack. Well, it is very common for a security researcher to find and privately report the vulnerability to the software developer.

With **responsible disclosure**, the researcher’s initial report is made privately to the developers of the company that owns the software, but with an agreement that the full details will be published once a patch has been made available. For significant security vulnerabilities, there may be a slight delay in disclosing the vulnerability to give more people time to patch.

The security researcher may provide a deadline for the software developer to respond to the report or to provide a patch. If this deadline is not met, then the researcher may publicly disclose the vulnerability to put pressure on the developer to issue a patch.

Publicly disclosing a vulnerability and seemingly introducing a Zero-Day vulnerability–a type of vulnerability that has no patch and is being exploited in the wild– may seem counterproductive. But, it is the only leverage that a researcher has to pressure the developer to patch the vulnerability.

If a hacker were to discover the vulnerability, they could quietly use the Exploit and cause damage to the end-user(this is you), while the software developer remains content on leaving the vulnerability unpatched. Google’s [Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/01/policy-and-disclosure-2020-edition.html) has similar guidelines when it comes to disclosing vulnerabilities. They publish the full details of the vulnerability after 90 days whether or not the vulnerability has been patched.

## How to Protect Your WordPress Website From Vulnerable Plugins and Themes

As you can see from this report, lots of new WordPress plugin and theme vulnerabilities are disclosed each week. We know it can be difficult to stay on top of every reported vulnerability disclosure, so the iThemes Security Pro plugin makes it easy to make sure your site isn’t running a theme, plugin or WordPress core version with a known vulnerability.

### 1. Turn on the iThemes Security Pro Site Scanner

The [iThemes Security Pro plugin’s Site Scanner](https://solidwp.com/ithemes-security-pro-feature-spotlight-site-scan/) scans for the #1 reason WordPress sites get hacked: outdated plugins and themes with known vulnerabilities. The Site Scanner checks your site for known vulnerabilities and automatically applies a patch if one is available.

To enable the Site Scan on new installs, navigate to the Site Check tab on the Features menu inside the plugin and click the toggle to enable the **Site Scan**.

![](https://solidwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/enable-site-scan-1-1024x519.png)

To trigger a manual Site Scan, click the **Scan Now** button on the Site Scan Security Dashboard card.

![](https://solidwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Site-Scans-Security-Card.png)

If the Site Scan detects a vulnerability, click the vulnerability link to view the details page.

![](https://solidwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/vulnerabilities-details-page-1024x580.png)

On the Site Scan vulnerability page, you will see if there is a fix available for the vulnerability. If there is a patch available, you can click the **Update Plugin** button to apply the fix on your website.

### 2. Turn on Version Management

The Version Management feature in iThemes Security Pro integrates with the Site Scan to protect your site when outdated software is not updated quickly enough. Even the strongest security measures will fail if you are running vulnerable software on your website. These settings help protect your site with options to update to new versions automatically if a known vulnerability exists and a patch is available.

From the Settings page in iThemes Security Pro, navigate to the Features screen. Click the Site Check tab. From here, use the toggle to enable Version Management. Using the settings gear, you can configure even more settings, including how you want iThemes Security Pro to handle updates to WordPress, plugins, themes, and additional protection.

Make sure to select **Auto Update if Fixes a Vulnerability** box so that iThemes Security Pro will automatically update a plugin or theme if it fixes a vulnerability that was found by the Site Scanner.

### 3. Get an Email Alert When iThemes Security Pro Finds a Known Vulnerability On Your Site

Once you’ve enabled Site Scan Scheduling, head to the **Notification Center** settings of the plugin. On this screen, scroll to the **Site Scan Results** section.

![](https://solidwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/site-scan-results-1024x550.jpg)

**Click the box to enable the notification email** and then click the **Save Settings button**.

Now, during any scheduled site scans, you’ll get an email if iThemes Security Pro discovers any known vulnerabilities. The email will look something like this.

**UPDATE 4.00** [ 11/02/2017 ]

**Major update:** A new admin has been introduced. This is designed from the ground up, based on feedback we received over the years for the old one. It is ajax enabled and changes are updated nearly instantly. Because the legacy admin and the new one are not compatible ( are based on different principles ), the change will not be done automatically. But, exported sliders from the old one are converted on import to the new one.

With that in mind, new install will upgrade the new admin directly. And current install will keep legacy admin, until administrators are ready to upgrade. If you want to import your legacy galleries, just export them from the legacy admin, switch to the new one ( from ZoomSounds > Settings > Playlists Mode ) , and import them into the new one.

##### Do I have to create a gallery for every song if I’m trying to load individual songs to individual blog posts? Seems like I’m missing the shortcode for the single player vs. the play list gallery.

You just have to press this button above every post / page to add a single mp3 -

If you want a gallery – you can press the other button. And galleries are configured inside the ZoomSounds wp menu.

#### s there anyway to disable autoplay for a playlist? This is the shortcode I am using: [playlist artists=”false” images=”false” ids=”1230,1235,1238,1237,1239,1236”] .

yes, in ZoomSounds admin, create a new slider named **playlist\_gallery**

Then in that, set **autoplay** to OFF

#### How to change from single woocommerce product overlay to player underneath thumbnail.

Go to zoomsounds > settings > **appearance** and in extra css enter
```

.center-ap-inside>.audioplayer{
position:relative!important;
top:0!important;
left:0!important;
transform: scale(1)!important;
}

.center-ap-inside{
position:relative!important;
top:0!important;
left:0!important;
transform: scale(1)!important;
}

```
##### Can there be multiple instances of this player per page

Yes, there can be unlimited instances on each page / post.
#### I am looking for an audio player for my WP site that will play songs continuos / without interruption or starting the song over when a visitor browses different pages,

For this, you need a ajax enable theme. Or a plugin that enables continuos navigating between pages without browser refresh ( like – [https://codecanyon.net/item/ajaxer-ajaxify-your-wordpress-site-and-comments/15813677?ref=ZoomIt](https://codecanyon.net/item/ajaxer-ajaxify-your-wordpress-site-and-comments/15813677) )
#### does this allow continuos playback?

Only if your theme supports that ( it does not depend on zoomsounds )

If you have a theme like this -> <https://themeforest.net/item/qu-the-creative-multipurpose-wordpress-theme/17759297>

( no page refresh between page change )

For music to continue playing while changing page

We also made a free plugin for any theme

- [http://preview.codecanyon.net/item/ajaxer-ajaxify-your-wordpress-site-and-comments/full\_screen\_preview/15813677?ref=ZoomIt](http://preview.codecanyon.net/item/ajaxer-ajaxify-your-wordpress-site-and-comments/full_screen_preview/15813677)

for this purpose

##### is this plug in programmed to stop playing when another player starts playing on the same page

Sure, when another ZoomSounds player is clicked, the current playing one will be stopped.
##### Can you use this audio player with short codes? Does it have a shortcode function?

A simple shortcode is required for the plugin to work – [zoomsounds] – and you do not even have to remember that because there are shortcode generators for both audio file and audio gallery

##### How can I get the social networks icons centered in lightbox ?

Go to ZoomSounds > Settings > **appearence**

and in **Extra CSS** enter

```
.social-networks-con{ text-align: center; }
```
##### How can I change the color of the svg icon on top left, the cross to close the sharing possibilities.

Go to ZoomSounds > Settings > **appearence**

and in **Extra CSS** enter

```
.dzsap-main-con .box-main .close-btn-con svg path{ fill: #fff;  }
```
##### Can you use this audio player with short codes? Does it have a shortcode function?

A simple shortcode is required for the plugin to work – [zoomsounds] – and you do not even have to remember that because there are shortcode generators for both audio file and audio gallery

##### Hi, Can i use it as standalone script without wordpress?

This is stand alone html5 version – [http://codecanyon.net/item/zoomsounds-neat-html5-audio-player/4525354](https://codecanyon.net/item/zoomsounds-neat-html5-audio-player/4525354)
##### How to place additional links to track amazon / itunes ?

You can place them in the **extra html** field of the item :

This is the code:

```
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/justin-bieber/id320569549" class="btn-zoomsounds btn-zoomsounds-download"><span class="the-icon"><i class="fa fa-apple" /></span><span class="the-label">iTunes</span></a>
```
#### how to change colors of the **skin-default** menu

Go to zoomsoudns > settings > **appearence** and in extra css enter –
```

body .zoomsounds-nav.skin-default .menu-item{background-color: #fff;
color: #444;
}
body .zoomsounds-nav.skin-default .menu-item:nth-child(odd){
background-color: #efefef;
}
```

any color is custom

#### How to enable zoomsounds player in woocommerce shop

The idea is to go to ZoomSounds > Settings > **WooCommerce** and enable Configuration for Loop Products to a player configuration you need.

Then ZoomSounds it will appear in any shop page / product cateegory

PS: The Products need the mp3 track uploaded in the ZoomSounds tab in any WooCommerce product

Default is that only one zoomsounds player on the page plays. The other ones pause.

##### Also can it play MP3’s self-hosted?

Sure, it’s the main source. It can also play shoutcast radio…

##### And another idea would be a buy link for the EP! Could it be possible?

You can insert that in the artist or song name spaces

##### My mp3s show infinity for length

You might need to reencode your mp3. Test the mp3 directly on th browser ( just input the link to the mp3 in the browser ) – if the browser does not have support for it then ZoomSounds cannot play it of course

###### I’m looking for an mp3 player plugin that allows download of the mp3s. The mp3 artwork (image) provides the title and then the play and download buttons overlay it. On the archive page we have the same but nicely arranged in grid layout.

Generally, yes

But

What do you mean by archive ?

If this is a custom page you set – then zoomsounds has shortcodes for this

If this is theme archive page, then your theme must have support for this grid

\_\_

OR

\_\_

This file – plugins/dzs-zoomsounds/soundcloudretriever.php

may returns access denied and we need this php in order to return the sound

Try to chmod this file 755 from your Filezilla or FTP app.

If it does not work please contact your host and ask them to allow access for this file – plugins/dzs-zoomsounds/soundcloudretriever.php

### Description

The ZoomSounds plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'savepng.php' file in versions up to, and including, 5.96. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

Wordfence blocked **1 attacks** targeting this vulnerability in the past 24 hours.

## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# ZoomSounds < 6.05 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload

### Description

The plugin contained a PHP file, allowing unauthenticated users to upload an arbitrary file anywhere on the web server.

Note (WPScanTeam): It's unclear which version fixed the issue exactly, however we were able to confirm the issue on version as high as v5.96 and that the related file has been removed at least since v6.05
