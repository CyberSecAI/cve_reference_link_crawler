# Attack and IE 0day Informations Used Against Council on Foreign Relations

**Council on Foreign Relations** ([CFR.org](http://www.cfr.org/)), a foreign policy web group, has been victim of a targeted attack who seem to be linked to computer hackers traced to China.

Regarding information’s posted on the [**Washington Free Beacon**](http://freebeacon.com/chinese-hackers-suspected-in-cyber-attack-on-council-on-foreign-relations/), infected CFR.org website was used to attack visitors in order to extract valuable information’s. The “*drive-by*” attack was detected around 2:00 pm on Wednesday 26 December and CFR members who visited the website between Wednesday and Thursday could have been infected and their data compromised, the specialists said.

Through Washington Free Beacon news we know that only Internet Explorer 8 and higher versions have been targeted. A possible Internet Explorer 0day was used to infect visitors computers. We also know that the attack was limited to CFR members and website visitors who used browsers configured for Chinese language characters.

As always, I was curious and tried to have more information’s regarding this attack and potential 0day.

**urlQuery.net investigations**

On [**urlQuery.net**](http://www.urlquery.net/search.php?q=cfr.org&type=string&start=2012-11-01&end=2012-12-28&max=200), we can see that the first submission was done, the 20 December. More interesting is the [submission of 21 December](http://www.urlquery.net/report.php?id=465113) on URL “*/js/js/news\_123432476.html*“. “*/js/js/*” directory seem to be a strange behavior. We can see that a “*deployJava.js*” was involved by loading this page.

Other URLs are interesting like “*/js/js/robots.txt*“, “*/js/js/today.swf*“, “*/js/js/news\_435435s.html*” but all these URLs have been submitted the 27 December and after, and the file are no more available.

**jsunpack investigations**

On jsunpack we can observe that the “[*deployJava.js*](http://jsunpack.jeek.org/dec/go?report=fcf13971f648f6171ee669a2813a89749218d9be)” was submitted the 26 December. All other files have been submitted the 27 December and after, and the file are no more available.

**CLEAN MX realtime database investigations**

On CLEAN MX we can observe [an analysis the 20 December](http://support.clean-mx.de/clean-mx/viruses.php?id=8724375).

Why so many parallel submission ? Ok guys, the infection has started since minimum the 20 December, so not since Wednesday 26 December. Now, if you have some skill in researching information’s and if you are still curious, you will find part of the “*drive-by*” attack source code. By doing some additional researches I found the source code of the “drive-by” attack, and I can confirm you that this attack has started since minimum the 7 December !

[![Capture d’écran 2012-12-28 à 22.25.31](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/Capture-d’écran-2012-12-28-à-22.25.31-300x29.png)](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/Capture-d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran-2012-12-28-%C3%A0-22.25.31.png)

**Let analyze this source code.**

I can confirm that only visitors with Internet Explorer 8 and higher versions have been targeted.

[![cfr-ie8](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/cfr-ie8.png)](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/cfr-ie8.png)

But, a fact who was not pointed is if the visitor don’t has Adobe Flash, he will not be part of the party, Flash free Internet Explorer are not targeted.

[![cfr-flash](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/cfr-flash.png)](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/cfr-flash.png)

I can also confirm that visitors who used browsers configured for Chinese language characters were targeted, but also Taiwanese and American visitors…

[![cfr-language](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/cfr-language.png)](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/cfr-language.png)

If you load the malicious page for the first time, a “*visit*” named cookie is create with a lifetime of 7 days through the “*DisplayInfo()*” function. If you have already a cookie, you will no more be exploited until the expiration of the cookie.

[![cfr-cookie](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/cfr-cookie.png)](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/cfr-cookie.png)

Then the page is loading the “*download*” Javascript function. This function is trying a XML HTTP request to a “*xsainfo.jpg*” file. After some discussion with [@binjo](https://twitter.com/binjo), it could be that “*xsainfo.jpg*” maybe just a clean file, ajax trick to call the “*callback*” function.

[![cfr-download](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/cfr-download.png)](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/cfr-download.png)

[![cfr-xmlhttp-xsainfo](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/cfr-xmlhttp-xsainfo.png)](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/cfr-xmlhttp-xsainfo.png)

“*xsainfo.jpg*” file is maybe “*320e0729e1a50fd6a2aebf277cfcad66*” found on [VirScan](http://r.virscan.org/7985b346f75a60148ace03b31f1a37fe) and [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/file/e4b7b8dd6a4f9dc93b14205ef7d41647ce5c6b18a1194bd88d3205deb7bf26fa/analysis/). This file was submitted the 13 December.

The “*callback*” function verifies if the “*xsainfo.jpg*” has been loaded and that a “*200*” HTTP status code has been returned.

[![cfr-callback-xmlhttp](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/cfr-callback-xmlhttp.png)](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/cfr-callback-xmlhttp.png)

If the visitor operating system is Windows 7 or Windows 2008 R2, an Office document is opened through the “*SharePoint.OpenDocuments*” ActiveX control. Depending the way the document is opened the “*key*” variable is initiated with funny values “*boy*” or “*girl*“. I’m not specialist in this domain, maybe one of the blog post reader could provide some more information’s.

[![cfr-callback-opendocuments](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/cfr-callback-opendocuments.png)](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/cfr-callback-opendocuments.png)

Depending if you are “*girl*” or a “*boy*“, the “*test*” division of the HTML document will be manipulated, a “*today.swf*” flash object will be loaded plus a “*news.html*” iframe.

![cfr-callback-boy-girl](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/cfr-callback-boy-girl.png)

If you are not a “*girl*” or a “*boy*“, you will need to have Java SE 6, but not JSE 7, in order to load the two same files as previously mentioned. If the visitor operating system is Windows XP, the “*test*” division of the HTML document will be also manipulated, and the two same files are loaded.

[![cfr-callback-java-xp-2](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/cfr-callback-java-xp-2-300x62.png)](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/cfr-callback-java-xp-2.png)

Unfortunately, actually I didn’t find these two files, but after more discussions with [@binjo](https://twitter.com/binjo) it could be that the swf is used to setup payload, “*news.html*” used to trigger the vulnerability.

So if 0day exist, this 0day is surely in “*news.html*” file, and it is also sure that this targeted attack has not begin on Wednesday, not only targeted visitors who used browsers configured for Chinese language characters.

I keep you in touch if I have additional information’s regarding this potential new Internet Explorer 0day.

**Update 1 – 12/29 2am:**

FireEye has post some [additional information’s](http://blog.fireeye.com/research/2012/12/council-foreign-relations-water-hole-attack-details.html) regarding the attack. It seem that “*today.swf*” trigger a heap spray in Internet Explorer in order to complete the compromise. Once the browser is exploited, it appears to download “xsainfo.jpg,” which is the dropper encoded using single-byte XOR (key: 0x83, ignoring null bytes).

What is also new regarding FireEye blog post is that their version is targeting English (U.S.), Chinese (China), Chinese (Taiwan), Japanese, Korean, or Russian. My version of 7 December was only targeting English (U.S.), Chinese (China), Chinese (Taiwan), so the guys had time to release new version of they’re code during this elapse of time. Also they didn’t mention the news.html file.

**Update 2 – 12/29 11am:**

[@binjo](https://twitter.com/binjo) has release further information’s regarding “[*new IE 0day coming-mshtml!CDwnBindInfo object use after free vulnerability”*](http://blog.vulnhunt.com/index.php/2012/12/29/new-ie-0day-coming-mshtmlcdwnbindinfo-object-use-afte).

Also, I can observe that a certain number of people have samples of the 0day, I could not imagine that an active exploit will not be out before the end of the year.

**Update 3 – 12/29 6pm:**

AlienVault has publish more [detailed information’s](http://labs.alienvault.com/labs/index.php/2012/just-another-water-hole-campaign-using-an-internet-explorer-0day/) regarding the attack and the 0day.

**Update 4 – 12/29 10pm:**

@\_sinn3r is on the way to deliver a Metasploit module for the CFR.org 0day exploit.

**Update 5 – 12/30 00am:**

Microsoft has release MSA-2794220 and confirm the vulnerability targeting Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8. Internet Explorer 9 and Internet Explorer 10 are not affected by the vulnerability. [CVE-2012-4792](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-4792) has been assigned to this vulnerability.

**Update 6 – 12/30 2am:**

Metasploit team has release the Microsoft Internet Explorer 0day.

## Microsoft Internet Explorer CButton use-after-free vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#154201

Original Release Date: 2012-12-29 | Last Revised: 2013-01-14

---

### Overview

Microsoft Internet Explorer contains a use-after-free vulnerability in the CButton object, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Microsoft Internet Explorer contains a use-after-free vulnerability in the mshtml CButton object. Specially-crafted JavaScript can cause Internet Explorer to free the CButton object without removing a pointer, resulting in a state where Internet Explorer may attempt to call an invalid memory address. This memory address may be under the control of the attacker.  This vulnerability is currently being exploited in the wild, using Adobe Flash to achieve a heap spray and Java to provide Return Oriented Programming (ROP) gadgets. Other proof-of-concept exploits are publicly available that do not use heap spraying. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message or attachment), Microsoft Office document, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**Microsoft has released [MS13-008](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms13-008) to address this vulnerability. Users should run Windows Update to receive the patch. If a user is unable to update, please consider the following workarounds: |
| --- |

| **Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit**The [Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2458544) (EMET) can be used to help prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. CERT/CC has created a [video tutorial for setting up EMET 3.0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_LUs_g0u4) on Windows 7. Note that platforms that do not support ASLR, such as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, will not receive the same level of protection that modern Windows platforms will.**Apply the Microsoft Fix It**Microsoft has provided a "Fix it" patch that causes Internet Explorer to safely crash if this vulnerability is attempted to be exploited, rather than resulting in code execution. Please see the [Microsoft SRD blog entry](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2012/12/31/microsoft-quot-fix-it-quot-available-for-internet-explorer-6-7-and-8.aspx) for more details. Note that Windows must be fully-patched for the Fix it to be effective. There is also a report that the Fix it [is insufficient](http://blog.exodusintel.com/2013/01/04/bypassing-microsofts-internet-explorer-0day-fix-it-patch-for-cve-2012-4792/) to completely address the vulnerability.**Disable the Flash ActiveX control in Internet Explorer**While it does not address the underlying vulnerability in Internet Explorer, disabling Flash may break some exploits. The Flash ActiveX control can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSID:   {D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000} More information about how to set the kill bit is available in [Microsoft Support Document 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control:  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400 **Disable Java in Internet Explorer**While it does not address the underlying vulnerability in Internet Explorer, disabling Java may break some exploits. Starting with Java 7 Update 10, it is possible to disable Java content in web browsers through the Java control panel applet. Please see the [Java documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/client-security.html#disable) for more details. |

Security Bulletin

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-008 - Critical

## Security Update for Internet Explorer (2799329)

Published: January 14, 2013

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8 on Windows clients and Moderate for Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8 on Windows servers. Internet Explorer 9 and Internet Explorer 10 are not affected. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2794220](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2794220).

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

## Internet Explorer Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-4792

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object in memory that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. The vulnerability may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-4792](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-4792).

#### Mitigating Factors for Internet Explorer Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-4792

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2012 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for Internet Explorer Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-4792

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Apply the Microsoft Fix it solution, "MSHTML Shim Workaround", that prevents exploitation of this issue**

  See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2799329](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2799329) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround.
* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click **Internet**.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  4. Click **Local intranet**.
  5. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  6. Click **OK** to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

#### FAQ for Internet Explorer Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-4792

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability in the context of the current user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Internet Explorer attempts to access an object in memory that has not been initialized or has been deleted, it may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the** **vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visiting a website for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Does EMET help mitigate attacks that try to exploit this vulnerability?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) helps mitigate the exploitation of this vulnerability by adding additional protection layers that make the vulnerability harder to exploit. EMET is a utility that helps prevent vulnerabilities in software from being successfully exploited for code execution, by applying the latest security mitigation technologies. At this time, EMET is provided with limited support and is only available in the English language.

**What is the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit v3.0 (EMET)?**

The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) is a utility that helps prevent vulnerabilities in software from being successfully exploited. EMET achieves this by using security mitigation technologies. These technologies function as special protections and obstacles that an exploit author must defeat in order to exploit software vulnerabilities. These security mitigation technologies do not guarantee that vulnerabilities cannot be exploited, but work to make exploitation as difficult to accomplish as possible. In many instances, a fully functional exploit that can bypass EMET may never be developed. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2458544](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2458544).

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| **Setup Modes** |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| **Restart Options** |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| **Special Options** |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.
