Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31624:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improper locking mechanism in the `server_audit` plugin of MariaDB. Specifically, a lock (`lock_bigbuffer`) related to a large buffer (`big_buffer`) used for logging queries, is not being released correctly.
- The code changes in the provided github commit remove the global `big_buffer` and allocate it locally within the `log_statement_ex` function to avoid the locking issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Locking:** The core issue is the failure to release the `lock_bigbuffer` lock in certain code paths, leading to a potential deadlock if multiple threads attempt to log queries concurrently.
- **Resource Exhaustion:**  While not explicitly stated, a deadlock could lead to a denial-of-service by preventing other database operations from completing and potentially exhausting resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service. This could render the MariaDB server unresponsive.
- **Resource Starvation:** The unreleased lock can potentially hold resources indefinitely, leading to resource starvation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The CVSS vector for this CVE (AV:L) indicates that the attack vector is local. This likely means the attacker needs to have some form of local access to the MariaDB server.
- **Concurrent Queries:** The vulnerability is triggered by multiple threads attempting to log queries concurrently. This indicates an attack can be initiated via sending a sufficient number of queries that will cause the logging mechanism to trigger the deadlock condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the MariaDB server. This could be an attacker with shell access or the ability to connect and execute queries.
- **Ability to Generate Queries:** The attacker needs to be able to send a large number of queries, or specific types of queries, that would trigger the logging mechanism to cause a deadlock condition by not releasing the lock
- **Low Privilege:** The attacker can have low privileges (PR:L) to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The NetApp advisory mentions that MariaDB versions prior to 10.7 are susceptible to the vulnerability. This implies that the vulnerability was fixed in version 10.7 or a later release.
- The Github commit, MDEV-26556, provides the patch that addresses this issue by removing the global big_buffer and performing allocation locally, removing the need for the global lock in the `log_statement_ex` function.
