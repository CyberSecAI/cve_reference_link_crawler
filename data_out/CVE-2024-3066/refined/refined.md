*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied tag attributes before storing them, allowing attackers to inject malicious code.
*   **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape the stored attributes when rendering pages, causing the injected code to execute in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session.
*   **Potential for Malicious Actions:** This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, data theft, defacement of the site, and redirection to malicious sites.
