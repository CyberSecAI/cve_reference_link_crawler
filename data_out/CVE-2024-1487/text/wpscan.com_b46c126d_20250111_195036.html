## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Photos and Files Contest Gallery < 21.3.1 - Author+ Stored Cross Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape some parameters, which could allow users with a role as low as author to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

1. Add a New gallery, and click on the "Add files" button to add content.
2. Now add a description for this content with the XSS payload and save the changes: <script>alert('XSS');</script>
3. Click on the "cg\_gallery\_no\_voting" that redirects to the page to display the content. It will appear in the pop-up alert.

### Affects Plugins
