# Unauthorized gem replacement for full names ending in numbers

## Package

bundler

RubyGems.org Service
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 2023-08-14

## Patched versions

>= 2023-08-14

## Description

### Summary

Insufficient input validation allowed malicious actors to replace any uploaded gem version that had a platform, version number, or gem name matching `/-\d/`, permanently replacing the legitimate upload in the canonical gem storage bucket, and triggering an immediate CDN purge so that the malicious gem would be served immediately.

### Impact

We have checked all gems matching the `/-\d/` pattern and can confirm that no unexpected `.gem`s were found. As a result, we believe this vulnerability was *not* exploited.

### Verification

The easiest way to ensure that your applications were not exploited by this vulnerability is to check that all of your downloaded .gems have a checksum that matches the checksum recorded in the RubyGems.org database.

RubyGems contributor Maciej Mensfeld wrote a tool to automatically check that all downloaded .gem files match the checksums recorded in the RubyGems.org database. You can use it by running:

```
bundle add bundler-integrity
bundle exec bundler-integrity

```

Neither this tool nor anything else can prove you were not exploited, but the can assist your investigation by quickly comparing RubyGems API-provided checksums with the checksums of files on your disk.

### Patches

The issue has been patched with improved input validation.

### Details

This is similar to [GHSA-2jmx-8mh8-pm8w](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/security/advisories/GHSA-2jmx-8mh8-pm8w "GHSA-2jmx-8mh8-pm8w"), but did not require advanced upload of the gem.

This vulnerability was limited to platform-specific gems ending in a number, for example `sorbet-static`, version `0.5.9995` , platform `universal-darwin-20`.

An attacker could craft a `gem` file for upload with a hand-crafted YAML-format gem spec in the `.gem`'s metadata section.

For example, to overwrite `sorbet-static-0.5.9995-universal-darwin-20`, the attacker would send the following gemspec:

```
--- !ruby/hash-with-ivars:Gem::Specification
ivars:
  '@name': sorbet-static-0.5.9995-universal-darwin
  '@version': 20
  '@original_platform': something
  '@new_platform': ruby
```

RubyGems.org would create a version record for the gem `sorbet-static-0.5.9995-universal-darwin` with version `20` and platform `something`. RubyGems.org would treat that version as having a `full_name` of `sorbet-static-0.5.9995-universal-darwin-20-something`, which would be accepted, as it was unique from the `full_name` of the legitimate gem.

When uploading the `.gem` and `.gemspec.rz` for the new version, however, RubyGems.org used the `original_name` method from the uploaded specification to determine the file names to store. The `original_name` method would return `sorbet-static-0.5.9995-universal-darwin-20`, and RubyGems.org would upload `sorbet-static-0.5.9995-universal-darwin-20.gem`, overwriting the legitimate version and immediately purging the CDN cache to ensure the newly uploaded malicious version would be served from the CDN.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
