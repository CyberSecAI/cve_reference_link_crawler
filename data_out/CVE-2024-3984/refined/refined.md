Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3984

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `embedsocial_reviews` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code within the shortcode attributes. This code is then stored in the database and executed when a user views the page containing the shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session when a user views a page containing the vulnerable shortcode. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Stealing sensitive information
    - Other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `embedsocial_reviews` shortcode.
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code via the `id`, `tags` or `lazyload` attributes of this shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
- The attacker must be able to create or edit posts/pages that support shortcodes.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious `embedsocial_reviews` shortcode containing the malicious javascript and embed it in a page.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is within the `embedsocial_reviews_album_shortcode` function, specifically when handling the `id`, `tags` and `lazyload` attributes. While the code attempts to sanitize the input using `sanitize_text_field` and `sanitize_key`, this sanitization is insufficient to prevent XSS.
- The vulnerability is present in all versions up to and including 1.1.29.
- The patched version is 1.2.1.
