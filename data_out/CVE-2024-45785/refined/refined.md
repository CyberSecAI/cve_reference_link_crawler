- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The MUSASI version 3 e-learning system performs authentication on the client-side instead of the server-side. Specifically, the client retrieves credential information from the server after a user ID is entered, but prior to proper authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Client-side authentication, which allows access to credential information without proper authorization (CWE-603: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can retrieve another user's credentials and other sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by interacting with the client-side application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special privileges are required (PR:N). The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application via the network. No user interaction is required (UI:N).
