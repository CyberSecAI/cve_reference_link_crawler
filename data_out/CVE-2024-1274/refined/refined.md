- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape certain input parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website, which can be executed when other users (including administrators) view the affected content. This can lead to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with the ability to add events (which can be a user with subscriber role, if administrator allows) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Excerpt" and "Registration Information" fields. When an administrator edits the event or when a user browses the event on the front end, the injected script will execute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have an account with the ability to add events. This could be a low privileged user like a "Subscriber" depending on the administrator's settings.
