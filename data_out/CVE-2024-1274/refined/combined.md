## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# My Calendar < 3.4.24 - Authenticated Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some parameters, which could allow users with a role as low as Subscriber to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks (depending on the permissions set by the admin)

### Proof of Concept

1. Use any type of role (as long as you permit it the action to Add Events).
2. Add a new event, and insert the following in the Excerpt field and in the Registration Information field: <script>alert(111)</script>
3. Edit the event using an Admin account, or browse it on the front end and the alert will trigger.
