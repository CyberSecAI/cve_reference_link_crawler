The content describes a vulnerability related to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in GitLab's PlantUML integration.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way GitLab handles PlantUML diagrams. When PlantUML integration is enabled, GitLab redirects requests to a local PlantUML server. The PlantUML server returns SVG diagrams. The issue is that the URL in the rendered SVG is not properly sanitized. By injecting javascript into the URL, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the user's browser when the SVG diagram is rendered.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Reflected XSS:**  The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS in the rendering of PlantUML diagrams, specifically in the `/-/plantuml` endpoint. The content of the PlantUML diagram is rendered unsanitized.
*   **Insecure HTTP protocol for PlantUML server:** The PlantUML server is configured to use HTTP, which can cause mixed content issues when GitLab is served over HTTPS. This is circumvented by proxying requests to the PlantUML server through the GitLab instance. However, this approach is susceptible to the XSS vulnerability.
*  **CSP bypass**: The Content Security Policy is not being applied to the `/-/plantuml/*` endpoints

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript through a crafted PlantUML diagram. This script can be used to steal personal access tokens, create new admin users, and perform other unauthorized actions on the GitLab instance.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** The injected JavaScript is executed within the context of the victim's browser, allowing the attacker to perform various actions on the client side.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Malicious PlantUML diagram:** An attacker crafts a PlantUML diagram containing malicious JavaScript embedded in the URL of a node.
*   **Clicking on the diagram:** A user viewing a page containing the malicious diagram and clicks on the diagram, the JavaScript will be executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Ability to create malicious PlantUML diagrams:** The attacker must be able to craft PlantUML diagrams with embedded malicious JavaScript.
*  **Access to a Gitlab instance where PlantUML integration is enabled**: The attacker needs to target a Gitlab instance where PlantUML integration is enabled and improperly configured.

This vulnerability allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to gain full control of the Gitlab instance.
