Based on the provided content, the vulnerability and its fix are related to the alignment of `riscv_kernel_entry` within the RISC-V purgatory code.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `riscv_kernel_entry` was not properly aligned in the purgatory code. When the kernel delegates alignment handling, the purgatory must ensure all data accesses are word-aligned because the trap handler is then set to the kexec one. If an unaligned access exception occurs in this state, and alignment is not guaranteed, it will cause a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper alignment for `riscv_kernel_entry` in the RISC-V purgatory code.
- Reliance on the kernel's handler to deal with unaligned access exceptions, but when kernel is not yet setup, the exception is not handled properly.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- System crash if an unaligned access occurs in purgatory when alignment handling is delegated to the kernel.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can trigger the loading of a kernel via kexec that causes unaligned memory access in the RISC-V purgatory code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to trigger a kexec load on a RISC-V system where unaligned access exceptions are delegated to the kernel.

The provided commits fix this issue by adding `.align LGREG` before the declaration of `riscv_kernel_entry`, guaranteeing that the `riscv_kernel_entry` is properly aligned to a word boundary, resolving the potential crash.
