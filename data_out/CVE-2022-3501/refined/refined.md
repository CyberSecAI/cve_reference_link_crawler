Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-3501:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check within the OTRS software. Specifically, article template content containing sensitive information could be accessed by agents who do not possess the necessary permissions to view it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Exposure:** The core weakness is the exposure of potentially sensitive data within article templates to unauthorized users.
- **Missing Access Control:** The system fails to properly enforce access controls when rendering article template content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Sensitive information within article templates can be exposed to unauthorized agents. This could lead to a breach of confidentiality and potential misuse of the exposed data.
- **Compromised Confidentiality:** Unauthorized access to sensitive content violates the principle of confidentiality.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with low privileges (agent account) could access and view article template content through the OTRS interface even without having the necessary permissions.
-The attack requires user interaction as mentioned by the UI component in the CVSS vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have a valid agent account within the OTRS system, indicating the need for internal access to the platform.
- The attacker needs to induce a user to trigger a specific action in the OTRS web interface.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as **LOW** severity with a CVSS score of 3.5.
- The issue affects **OTRS 8.0.x** versions.
- The fix is available in **OTRS 8.0.26**.
