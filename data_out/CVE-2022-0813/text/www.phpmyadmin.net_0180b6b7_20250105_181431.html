## [phpMyAdmin 4.9.10 and 5.1.3 are released](/news/2022/2/11/phpmyadmin-4910-and-513-are-released/)

2022-02-11

The phpMyAdmin team announces the release of versions 4.9.10 and 5.1.3.

These versions primarily address a regression that caused the navigation pane to not function correctly when multiple pages of tables were shown.

Version 5.1.3 includes a security hardening improvement. The issue, reported by Rafael Pedrero, could allow users to cause an error that would reveal the path on disk where phpMyAdmin is running from.
We believe this requires the server to be running with display\_errors on, which is not the recommended setting for a production environment.

Version 5.1.3 includes a few other minor bug fixes and is recommended for all users.

Note that version 4.9 is in extended security support only. Version 5.2.0 is in final testing and is expected to replace the 5.1 branch in the coming week or weeks, with no changes to required versions of PHP or database server.

For the phpMyAdmin team,
Isaac
