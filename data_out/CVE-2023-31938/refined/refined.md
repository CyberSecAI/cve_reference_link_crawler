Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the direct incorporation of the `emp_id` GET parameter into an SQL query within the `employee_detail.php` file without any sanitization or validation. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    * **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a classic SQL injection flaw. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a database query.
    * **Lack of Input Validation:** The `emp_id` parameter is directly used in the SQL query without any checks.
  
* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    * **Data Breach:** An attacker can use SQL injection to access sensitive data stored in the database, including employee details, potentially other tables depending on the database structure and permissions.
    * **Data Modification:** Beyond reading data, an attacker could also modify or delete records.
    * **Database Compromise:** Depending on database configuration, an attacker could potentially escalate privileges, execute operating system commands, or even compromise the entire server.
    * **Denial of Service:** SQL injection can be used to cause the database to become unresponsive, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
    * **Information Disclosure:** The database structure could be revealed, allowing more complex attacks to be launched.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request by manipulating the `emp_id` parameter in the URL.
    * **URL Manipulation:** Specifically, the `emp_id` parameter in the `employee_detail.php` URL is the entry point for the attack.

* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
    * **Basic HTTP knowledge:** Requires knowledge of HTTP requests to manipulate the URL parameter.
    * **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft malicious injection payloads.
    * **No Authentication required for Exploitation:** The provided information indicates that no prior authentication or specific user role is required for exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided code snippet clearly shows how the `$_GET['emp_id']` value is directly inserted into the SQL query: `$sql="select*from employee where emp_id='$_GET[emp_id]'";`
* The attacker has demonstrated the vulnerability through simple SQL injection payloads (`66' and '1'='1` and `66' and '1'='2`), showcasing the ability to manipulate the output of the query.
* The use of `sqlmap` further validates the presence of SQL injection and indicates the potential to extract database information.
