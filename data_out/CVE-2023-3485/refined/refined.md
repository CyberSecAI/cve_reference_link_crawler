The provided content is a release note for Temporal Server version 1.20.0. It contains a security-related change that is relevant to a potential CVE:

**Vulnerability:**
- The `frontend.enableTokenNamespaceEnforcement` dynamic configuration setting now defaults to `true`.
  - **Weakness:** The previous default setting (`false`) allowed cross-namespace access when a task token with a different namespace ID and namespace fields was presented. This could lead to unauthorized access and data manipulation across namespaces.
  - **Root Cause:** The vulnerability existed due to a lack of proper validation of the namespace fields in task tokens against the namespace ID present in the token.
  - **Attack Vector:** A malicious client could potentially craft a task token with a namespace in the token, but an empty namespace field at the top level of the request to bypass authorization checks. This would allow the attacker to access or modify resources in the target namespace.
  - **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to resources in other namespaces.
  - **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker with the ability to create or modify task tokens, and send requests to the Temporal server would be able to exploit this vulnerability. They do not necessarily require a privileged position on the network but must have the ability to interact with the Temporal Server's API.

**Mitigation:**
- The default value of  `frontend.enableTokenNamespaceEnforcement` has been changed to `true`, enforcing stricter validation. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to version 1.20 or, if upgrading is not immediately feasible, set this configuration option to `true`.
