Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

The `remap_file_pages` system call handler directly calls `do_mmap()` without performing a security check via the Linux Security Module (LSM) hook `security_mmap_file()`. This oversight allows a bypass of the W^X (Write XOR Execute) policy when combined with the `READ_IMPLIES_EXEC` personality flag.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing LSM Check:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of the `security_mmap_file()` LSM hook call within the `remap_file_pages` syscall handler before calling `do_mmap()`.
*   **W^X Bypass:** By calling `personality(READ_IMPLIES_EXEC)` and then using `remap_file_pages()` on read-write (RW) pages, an attacker can remap these pages to read-write-execute (RWX), violating the intended W^X policy enforced by SELinux.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** An attacker can introduce executable code into memory regions that should not be executable, enabling them to execute arbitrary code, potentially escalating privileges or performing other malicious actions.
*   **Security Policy Violation:** The bypass allows circumvention of the W^X security policy enforced by SELinux or other LSMs which are designed to prevent code execution from data pages.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`remap_file_pages` syscall:** The attacker leverages the `remap_file_pages` system call.
*   **`personality(READ_IMPLIES_EXEC)`:** The attacker needs to enable the `READ_IMPLIES_EXEC` personality flag before the `remap_file_pages` call.
*   **Memory Mapping:** The attacker needs to have a memory region mapped with read and write permissions.
*   **Exploitation:** The attacker uses the `remap_file_pages` syscall to remap this region with execute permissions as well.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be able to execute code on the system.
*   **System Call Access:** The attacker needs to be able to call `personality` and `remap_file_pages` system calls.
*   **Memory Mapping Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to create memory mappings with read/write permissions via `mmap`, for instance using `memfd_create` as shown in the provided exploit PoC.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) code demonstrates the exploit using `memfd_create`, `mmap`, `personality`, and `remap_file_pages` system calls.
*   The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2016-10044, which also involved bypassing W^X policies using AIO.

The fix involves adding the LSM hook call `security_mmap_file()` before `do_mmap()` in the `remap_file_pages` syscall handler to ensure the memory mapping is consistent with the security policy.
