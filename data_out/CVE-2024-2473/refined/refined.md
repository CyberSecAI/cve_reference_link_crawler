Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2473

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a bypass in the WPS Hide Login plugin's logic when the `action=postpass` parameter is supplied in the URL. This parameter is intended for handling password-protected posts, but it can be manipulated to reveal the hidden login page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Authorization:** The plugin fails to properly restrict access to the login page, even when it's supposed to be hidden.
- **Login Page Disclosure:** The plugin's mechanism for hiding the login page can be easily bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can discover the hidden login page URL, which was meant to be concealed by the plugin. This provides a starting point for further attacks such as brute-force login attempts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** An attacker can send a specially crafted request to the target server using a web browser or other tool, including the `action=postpass` parameter, to bypass the login page hiding mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No special privileges required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or access to the target system.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know to use the `action=postpass` parameter to bypass the login page hiding.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.9.16 of the plugin.
- The provided code diff shows that the fix involves checking for the `action=postpass` parameter, and also if a `post_password` is set in `$_POST`, it will also check using `wp_authenticate_username_password` to make sure it is a valid login attempt and return the origin url if not.
