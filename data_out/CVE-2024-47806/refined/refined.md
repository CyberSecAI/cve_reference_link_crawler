- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin does not validate the `aud` (Audience) claim of an ID Token during the authentication flow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper validation of the `aud` claim in ID Tokens.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers may subvert the authentication flow, potentially gaining administrator access to Jenkins.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific user privileges are required, but the attacker needs to be able to manipulate the authentication flow by providing a malicious ID token. The attacker needs to be able to intercept the authentication process.
