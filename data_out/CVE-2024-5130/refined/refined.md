The provided content relates to a commit that fixes an authorization issue in the `lunary-ai/lunary` repository. The commit addresses a vulnerability related to dataset deletion.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The original code for deleting a dataset lacked proper authorization checks. It allowed deletion of a dataset based solely on the provided `id`, without verifying if the user had the required permission and if the dataset belonged to the user's project.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure direct object reference (IDOR):** An attacker could potentially delete a dataset belonging to another user by simply knowing the dataset's ID.
- **Missing authorization check:** The code didn't verify if the user attempting the deletion had the necessary permission to perform the action.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially delete arbitrary datasets within the application, leading to data loss and potentially disrupting the application's functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability could be exploited by sending a malicious DELETE request to the `/datasets/:id` endpoint with a target dataset ID.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be an authenticated user of the application.
- The attacker would need to know or guess the ID of the dataset they want to delete.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The fix involves adding a check `and projectId = ${projectId}` to ensure that only datasets belonging to the user's project can be deleted.
- The vulnerable code was located in the file `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets/index.ts`
- The commit message mentions "fix: authorization delete dataset" and references pull request #204.
