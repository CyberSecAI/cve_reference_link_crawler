Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The changelog entry in `readme.txt` specifically mentions "Fixed Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability". This indicates that the changes introduced in version 1.3 are related to a security issue. The diffs provided for `class-qi-blocks.php` and related files show the addition of an SVG sanitizer.  This is related to the XSS issue.

**2. Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The plugin was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to a lack of proper sanitization of SVG files uploaded through the media uploader.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Lack of SVG Sanitization:** The plugin did not properly sanitize uploaded SVG files, allowing for the potential injection of malicious scripts within the SVG content.
    *   **Insecure File Handling:** The plugin's code for handling file uploads did not ensure that SVG files were safe before being processed.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker could upload a malicious SVG file containing JavaScript code. This code could be executed in the browser of any user who views a page where this malicious SVG is rendered.
    *   This could lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, cookie stealing, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing administrative actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is through the WordPress media uploader, where an attacker with the required privileges can upload an SVG file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have the ability to upload files to the WordPress media library. This usually requires a user role with at least the 'upload_files' capability which would typically be provided to a 'Contributor' or higher role in a standard WordPress installation.

**3. Additional Technical Details (beyond CVE description):**

*   **SVG Sanitization Implementation:** The code introduces a new SVG sanitization library (`enshrined\svgSanitize\Sanitizer`) to process uploaded SVG files. This library removes potentially malicious elements and attributes from the SVG content before storing it on the server.
*   **Filter Hooks:**  The plugin uses the `wp_handle_upload_prefilter` hook which is a good pre-processing step before storing file uploads on the server, and is further checked using `wp_check_filetype_and_ext`

**4. Code Modifications:**
* The main change is the sanitization of svg files before storing them on the server:
```php
public function handle_svg_wp_media_upload( $file ) {
		
		if ( ! empty( $file ) && isset( $file['type'] ) && 'image/svg+xml' === $file['type'] ) {
			// Load the svg file.
			$get_svg_content = @file_get_contents( $file['tmp_name'] );

			if ( ! empty( $get_svg_content ) ) {
				// Create a new sanitizer instance.
				$sanitizer = new enshrined\svgSanitize\Sanitizer();

				// Pass it to the sanitizer and get it back clean.
				$clean_svg_content = $sanitizer->sanitize( $get_svg_content );

				if ( empty( $clean_svg_content ) ) {
					$clean_svg_content = '';
				}

				// Update clean SVG/XML data.
				@file_put_contents( $file['tmp_name'], $clean_svg_content );
			} else {
				$file['error'] = esc_html__( 'Please upload a valid SVG file.', 'qi-blocks' );
			}
		}
		
		return $file;
	}
```

In summary, this content reveals an XSS vulnerability stemming from insecure SVG file uploads, along with the measures taken to remediate the issue by implementing server-side sanitization and file type checking.
