The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in Tongda OA v2017 and later versions, specifically v11.10 and later.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from directly concatenating user-supplied input, the `$WELFARE_ID` parameter, into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This occurs in the `general/hr/salary/welfare_manage/delete` PHP route.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can obtain sensitive database information by using blind SQL injection techniques such as extracting the database name. The attacker can then potentially access other information as well.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `WELFARE_ID` parameter in the `general/hr/salary/welfare_manage/delete` route. The attacker manipulates this parameter with malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `general/hr/salary/welfare_manage/delete` endpoint with a crafted `WELFARE_ID` parameter.
- No authentication information is mentioned, but it is likely needed as this endpoint handles deletion of records.

**Payload Examples:**
- The provided content gives examples of blind SQL injection payloads:
   - `1)%20and%20(substr(DATABASE(),1,1))=char(116)%20and%20(select%20count(*)%20from%20information_schema.columns%20A,information_schema.columns%20B)%20and(1)=(1` (Used to verify if the first character of the database name is 't' through time delay)
   - `1)%20and%20(substr(DATABASE(),1,1))=char(115)%20and%20(select%20count(*)%20from%20information_schema.columns%20A,information_schema.columns%20B)%20and(1)=(1` (Used to verify if the first character of the database name is 's' without time delay, showing a successful injection).
