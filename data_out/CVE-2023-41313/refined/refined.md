- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The authentication method in Apache Doris versions before 2.0.0 is vulnerable to timing attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Timing attack vulnerability in the authentication process.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can potentially exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access by analyzing the time taken for authentication responses.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based, by sending authentication requests and measuring the response times.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send authentication requests to the vulnerable Apache Doris instance and measure the response time.
