Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-24754:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `pjsip_auth_create_digest()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability occurs when handling hashed digest credentials, specifically those with a `data_type` of `PJSIP_CRED_DATA_DIGEST`.
- The function doesn't properly validate the length of the provided hashed digest data. If the length is not equal to the expected `PJSIP_MD5STRLEN` (32 bytes for MD5, 64 for SHA256), a buffer overflow can occur when copying the credential data into a fixed-size stack buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A stack buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial-of-service by crashing the application, or other undefined behaviors.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing crafted SIP messages containing hashed digest credentials with an invalid data length.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send SIP messages to a vulnerable PJSIP application that accepts hashed digest credentials.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability specifically affects users that accept hashed digest credentials.
- A patch has been provided in commit `d27f79d` which adds a length check to ensure it matches the expected length and returns an error otherwise.
- The vulnerability is considered low severity.
- A workaround is to check the length of the digest data before calling `pjsip_auth_create_digest()` function.
- The fix was applied by adding a check for `cred_info->data.slen` and returning `PJ_EINVAL` if it's not the expected 32 or 64 bytes.
