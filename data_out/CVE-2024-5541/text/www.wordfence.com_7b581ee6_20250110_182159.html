### Description

The Ibtana – WordPress Website Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'ibtana\_visual\_editor\_register\_ajax\_json\_endpont' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.3.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update option values for reCAPTCHA keys on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to bypass reCAPTCHA on the site. CVE-2024-37123 is likely a duplicate of this issue.
