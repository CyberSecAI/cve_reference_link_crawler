Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42013:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2021-42013 along with its description as a Path Traversal and Remote Code Execution vulnerability, confirming relevance. The content also mentions that this CVE is an incomplete fix for the earlier CVE-2021-41773.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an insufficient fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 for CVE-2021-41773. The vulnerability stems from a flawed path normalization, allowing attackers to bypass intended directory restrictions. Specifically, it allows a path traversal attack.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Path Traversal:**  The vulnerability allows an attacker to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives, which breaks intended path restrictions.
-   **Remote Code Execution:** If CGI scripts are enabled for the aliased paths, this vulnerability can be escalated to remote code execution.
- **Incomplete fix**: The fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was insufficient, leading to CVE-2021-42013.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access files outside the document root if not protected by "require all denied".
-    **Remote Code Execution:** If CGI scripts are enabled, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server.
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  While not directly stated, repeated exploitation could lead to resource exhaustion, resulting in a denial of service on vulnerable servers.
- In the context of Oracle products, the vulnerability can have a similar impact on Oracle products, allowing attackers to access sensitive information from files and potentially execute arbitrary code on the affected systems.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

-   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited through specially crafted HTTP requests.
-   **Path Traversal:**  Attackers use "..%2F" to traverse outside allowed directories within the URL.
-   **CGI Scripts:** Exploitation leading to RCE requires CGI scripts to be enabled and available.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the vulnerable server.
-   **No Authentication:** The vulnerabilities can be triggered without prior authentication.
-   **Mod\_cgi enabled:** For RCE, mod\_cgi must be enabled, as the path traversal attack must reach cgi scripts.
-  **Specific configurations:** The server must have alias-like directives and if RCE is the goal, a vulnerable binary should be +x (executable), and apache permissions granted for /bin or /  This is not default. 
-   **Understanding of Path Traversal:**  Attackers need knowledge of path traversal techniques to craft malicious requests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Cisco products are not affected by this vulnerability.
*   Oracle products are affected by this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was exploited in the wild.
*   The official Apache fix is to update to version 2.4.51
*   Oracle's fix addresses CVE-2021-42013, CVE-2021-41773, and CVE-2021-41524 in the same patch.
