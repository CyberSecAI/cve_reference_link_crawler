Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the accumulation of specific EJB transaction objects within the `InvocationTracker` of Wildfly's EJB client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper management of EJB transaction objects in `InvocationTracker`.
- Accumulation of these objects over time.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). The accumulation of objects leads to services slowing down and eventually becoming unavailable.
- System availability is the primary target.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the EJB client in Wildfly.
- The accumulation is likely caused by repeated EJB invocations or specific usage patterns that do not properly clear transaction objects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to interact with the EJB client to trigger the accumulation of transaction objects. This implies the attacker would have some level of access to an application using the vulnerable client or be able to make requests that cause this accumulation. The specific requirements would depend on the application logic.
