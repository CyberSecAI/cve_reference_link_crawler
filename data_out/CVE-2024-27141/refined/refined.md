{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper restriction of recursive entity references in DTDs leading to XML entity expansion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-776"
    ],
     "impact": "Denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to excessive resource consumption while processing a crafted XML payload.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted XML payload with deeply nested entities to the `/contentwebserver` endpoint of the affected Toshiba MFPs."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint on the affected Toshiba MFPs. No authentication is needed for this specific vulnerability.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted XML payload known as a \"Billion Laughs attack,\" which leverages deeply nested entities to cause resource exhaustion. The mod_contentwebserver.so library, which handles XML parsing, is vulnerable. Although exfiltration of files using HTTP/FTP/gopher protocols was not successful, the vulnerability can be leveraged to cause denial of service."
