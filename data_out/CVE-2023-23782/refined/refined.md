- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-based buffer overflow in the command line interpreter (CLI) of FortiWeb.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  A buffer overflow [CWE-122] vulnerability exists.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An authenticated attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution via specifically crafted arguments to existing commands. This could lead to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker must be authenticated to the FortiWeb CLI and then use specially crafted arguments to existing commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the FortiWeb CLI.
