{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an insufficient size limit for status bar icons.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The previous size limit for status bar icons was too small, causing crashes in some apps.",
       "The vulnerability is related to the size of drawables used for status bar icons. Specifically, there was no proper validation of icon sizes. "
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious application could potentially exploit this vulnerability to cause a crash of the System UI by providing a very large drawable. This could lead to denial of service and possibly other unpredictable behavior of system components.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting an application that posts notifications with larger-than-expected drawables as status bar icons, leading to a SystemUI crash.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create and install an application on the device and post a notification with a large drawable."
