Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the "Theme Volty Video Tab" module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the module's front controllers `TvcmsVideoTabConfirmDeleteModuleFrontController::run()` and `TvcmsVideoTabSaveVideoModuleFrontController::run()` directly use values obtained from `Tools::getValue()` in SQL queries without proper escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The module is vulnerable to SQL injection because it doesn't properly sanitize the `id`, `id_lang`, `id_shop`, `name_shop`, `type_video` and values from `name_url_array` before using them in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code, leading to unauthorized database access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Breach:** An attacker could extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, customer data, and order information.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** Attackers could modify or delete data in the database, potentially damaging the website's functionality or causing data loss.
- **Account Takeover:** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker might be able to gain administrative access by manipulating user privileges or bypassing authentication.
- **Email Hijacking:** The attacker could rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.
- **Expose tokens and unlock adminsâ€™ ajax scripts:** By copying data from sensitive tables to FRONT.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **HTTP Requests:** The exploit is triggered through specifically crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable front controller endpoints. It does not require user interaction and doesn't need the attacker to have any privileges. The module controller's path can also be concealed from conventional frontend logs, making it difficult to detect.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any existing user accounts or special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected PrestaShop instance.
- **Technical Knowledge:** Basic knowledge of HTTP requests, SQL and web security vulnerabilities is required to craft the malicious requests.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects versions of the "Theme Volty Video Tab" module up to and including 4.0.0. Version 4.0.1 and above contain a patch that addresses the vulnerability.
- **Patch:** The patch involves casting the `id`, `id_lang`, and `id_shop` parameters to integers using `(int)`, and escaping  `name_shop`, `type_video`, and values from the `name_url_array` parameters using `pSQL()` to prevent SQL injection.
- **Detection:** The use of a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with rules like OWASP 942 might help detect and block such attacks, but may require specific bypass configurations to avoid breaking the back office. Also, the AuditEngine of mod\_security is needed to get the POST data to confirm the exploit.
- **Recommendations:**
    - Upgrade the `tvcmsvideotab` module to the latest version.
    - Ensure all input is properly sanitized and validated.
    - Change the default database prefix `ps_`.
    - Implement proper security measures, such as a WAF, to protect against attacks.
