The provided content relates to a vulnerability fix in the Linux kernel's s390 architecture FPU (Floating Point Unit) code. Specifically, it addresses the improper removal of exception handling for the `lfpc` instruction within the `load_fpu_state()` function.

**Root Cause:**
- A recent rewrite of the FPU code in the s390 architecture inadvertently removed exception handling for the `lfpc` instruction in the `load_fpu_state()` function.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- The lack of exception handling allows the loading of invalid floating-point register values to cause an unhandled specification exception. This could lead to unpredictable system behavior or crashes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Loading invalid floating point register values can cause an unhandled specification exception.
- This could potentially lead to system instability, crashes, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by loading an invalid FPU state.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be in a position to control or influence the FPU state being loaded, potentially by manipulating kernel memory or through other vulnerabilities that allow control over the FPU context.

**Technical Details:**
- The fix involves replacing `fpu_lfpc(&state->fpc)` with `fpu_lfpc_safe(&state->fpc)` in the `load_fpu_state()` function. The `fpu_lfpc_safe()` function presumably adds the necessary exception handling around the `lfpc` instruction.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix is specifically for the s390 architecture.
- The issue was introduced by commit `8c09871a950a`.
- The fix was reported and tested by Aristeu Rozanski.
