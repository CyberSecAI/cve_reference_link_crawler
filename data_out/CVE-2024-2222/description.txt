The Advanced Classifieds & Directory Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the ajax_callback_delete_attachment function in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access or higher, to delete arbitrary media uploads.
