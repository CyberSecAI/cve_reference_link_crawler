Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28201:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how `Title::newMainPage()` in MediaWiki handles local interwiki links. Specifically, when the "mainpage" message (editable on-wiki) is set to a bare local interwiki (e.g., `localiw:`), the function enters an infinite recursion loop. This occurs because the function tries to parse the message to determine the main page, which in turn leads it back to itself.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Infinite Recursion:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for infinite recursion within `Title::newMainPage()`.
- **Lack of Recursion Guard:** The original code lacked a mechanism to detect and prevent this kind of recursive loop.
- **Dependency on User-Controlled Data:** The function relies on the "mainpage" message, which can be modified by users with "editinterface" permissions.
- **Insecure Handling of Local Interwiki:** The handling of local interwiki links was not secure in the context of determining the main page, particularly the case where the link resolves to the main page itself.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The infinite recursion loop can render the wiki inaccessible, effectively causing a DoS. The server becomes unresponsive and requires administrator intervention to fix the configuration.
- **Wiki Bricking:** The wiki can be considered "bricked" as normal operation is impossible.
- **Recovery Challenges:** Recovering from this vulnerability requires either manual database edits, patching the software, or adjusting site configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **On-wiki Modification:** An attacker with "editinterface" permission can exploit the vulnerability by editing the `[[MediaWiki:Mainpage]]` message.
- **Crafted Interwiki Links:** The attacker needs to insert a local interwiki link as the value of the "mainpage" message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Edit Interface Permissions:** The attacker must have the ability to edit interface messages on the wiki. This generally means they need to be an administrator or have similar privileges.
- **Knowledge of Local Interwiki:** The attacker needs to know that the site uses local interwikis. They need to specify a local interwiki prefix that points back to the wiki being attacked.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in MediaWiki 1.24 with commit `c815f959d6b27` to have a link like `[[wikipedia:]]` (where the prefix is a local interwiki) resolve to the main page explicitly.
- A patch was implemented to add a recursion guard to `Title::newMainPage()`. This patch adds a static variable to check if the function is already in the process of being called. If it is, the function returns a hardcoded fallback title, preventing infinite recursion.
- The fix was deployed to Wikimedia sites in December 2021.
- Patches were included in MediaWiki 1.35.6, 1.36.4, and 1.37.2 releases.
- The issue was assigned CVE-2022-28201 and had a Phabricator task number T297571 associated with it.
- Debian assigned DLA-3117-1 to address this issue in MediaWiki 1.31.
