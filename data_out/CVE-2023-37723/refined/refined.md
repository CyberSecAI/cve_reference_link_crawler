{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `page` function within the `/goform/fromqossetting` page of Tenda routers.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `fromqossetting` function reads a user-provided parameter `page` and passes it to `sprintf` without proper length checks. This can cause a stack buffer overflow when the input exceeds the buffer size allocated for `v7`.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "By exploiting the stack buffer overflow, attackers can perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack or achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the affected Tenda routers.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/goform/fromqossetting` endpoint. The attacker provides an overly long string as the value for the `page` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Tenda router, typically requiring network access to the device. No authentication is explicitly mentioned as required for the exploit."
