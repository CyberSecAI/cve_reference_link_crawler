- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application fails to properly sanitize user input, specifically when handling data from the URL. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code on a user's browser by manipulating the URL. This could lead to various impacts, including session hijacking, defacement, or phishing.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code. The attacker would need to induce a victim to visit the crafted URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any special privileges and can be a remote unauthenticated user. The attack requires user interaction as the victim needs to click on the malicious link.
