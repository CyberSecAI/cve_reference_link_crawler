- **Impact of exploitation**: A local malicious user with high privileges may use the exposed password to gain access with the privileges of the compromised user.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access, execution of specific off-array tools.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local user with high privileges on the affected system.
