**Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'feed_id' attribute.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages, which will then execute whenever a user accesses the injected page. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the website.

**Attack vectors:** By exploiting the vulnerable `feed_id` attribute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
