## Description

Curator.io is a social media aggregator or social media curator – it allows you to specify content sources such as Twitter usernames or Instagram tags. It then pulls this content into a feed or stream that you can curate/manage and embed within your website.

Unlike other social media aggregators Curator.io doesn’t use IFRAMEs. It allows you to embedded the stream as Javascript, HTML & CSS directly into your site where you want it. This means you have full control over how you want the stream to appear and also how it looks. Allowing you to customise it with your sites branding.

The end result is a social media stream that seamlessly integrates into your website.

Currently Curator.io supports Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Tumblr, Flickr, Vimeo, Yelp, Deviant Art, Slack and RSS. If there is a social media site that you would like us to integrate please, get in touch and we’ll add support as soon as possible.

Visit [curator.io](https://curator.io) for more information

The description says it includes LinkedIn, but it doesn’t, not unless you pay. It was the only one I wanted! Shame.

Useful plugin and easy to use. Perfect for anyone who is running a website that needs to showcase their social network posts/feeds. The support is fantastic too! Answers any query that you have, esp. now that social networks are becoming strict and changes policies very often.

### Description

The Curator.io: Show all your social media posts in a beautiful feed. plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘feed\_id’ attribute in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
