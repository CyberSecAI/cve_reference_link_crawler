## Description

Curator.io is a social media aggregator or social media curator – it allows you to specify content sources such as Twitter usernames or Instagram tags. It then pulls this content into a feed or stream that you can curate/manage and embed within your website.

Unlike other social media aggregators Curator.io doesn’t use IFRAMEs. It allows you to embedded the stream as Javascript, HTML & CSS directly into your site where you want it. This means you have full control over how you want the stream to appear and also how it looks. Allowing you to customise it with your sites branding.

The end result is a social media stream that seamlessly integrates into your website.

Currently Curator.io supports Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Tumblr, Flickr, Vimeo, Yelp, Deviant Art, Slack and RSS. If there is a social media site that you would like us to integrate please, get in touch and we’ll add support as soon as possible.

The description says it includes LinkedIn, but it doesn’t, not unless you pay. It was the only one I wanted! Shame.

I have a website and I needed to show social media feeds. This plugin makes integration very easy. And the support guys are amazing. Thumbs up for everyone behind this.

Useful plugin and easy to use. Perfect for anyone who is running a website that needs to showcase their social network posts/feeds. The support is fantastic too! Answers any query that you have, esp. now that social networks are becoming strict and changes policies very often.
