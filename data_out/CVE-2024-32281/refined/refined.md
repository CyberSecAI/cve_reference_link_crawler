{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `formexeCommand` function in Tenda AC7V1.0 V15.03.06.44 firmware directly uses user-provided input from the `cmdinput` parameter without proper sanitization. This input is assigned to the `cmd_buf` variable and subsequently passed to the `doSystemCmd` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command injection vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-provided input.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a POST request to the `/goform/exeCommand` endpoint with a crafted `cmdinput` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device (likely requires network access to the device)."
