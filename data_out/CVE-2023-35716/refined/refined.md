- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing AR files. This can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a malicious AR file or visiting a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious AR file or a malicious page to a user. The user must interact with this content.
