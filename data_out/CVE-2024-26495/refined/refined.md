The provided content describes a stored XSS vulnerability in the Friendica application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the improper sanitization of user-supplied input when using BBCode tags in post content. Specifically, the `[url]` tag is not properly sanitized, allowing the injection of malicious attributes like `onmouseover` within the URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious JavaScript code is stored in the database and executed when other users view the affected post content.
- Improper Input Sanitization: The application fails to sanitize user-provided input containing BBCode tags, specifically the `[url]` tag, leading to the injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of other users' browsers.
- This can lead to:
  - Account hijacking: Stealing user session cookies or credentials.
  - Data theft: Accessing sensitive information of the user.
  - Defacement: Modifying the user interface or content.
  - Malicious redirects: Redirecting users to phishing sites.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- By creating a new post with a crafted BBCode URL tag.
- The attacker inserts the malicious payload in the post content, which is stored in the database.
- When another user views the post, the stored XSS payload is triggered in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a registered user of the Friendica application.
- The attacker needs to be able to create new posts or comments.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges.
