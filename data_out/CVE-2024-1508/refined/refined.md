### Summary:
The provided content details a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Prime Slider â€“ Addons For Elementor WordPress plugin, specifically affecting versions up to and including 3.13.2. The vulnerability exists within the Mercury widget, where the `title_tags` attribute is not properly sanitized.

### Root Cause:
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of sufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling the `title_tags` attribute within the Mercury widget of the Prime Slider plugin.

### Weaknesses:
- **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'):** The plugin fails to sanitize user-controlled input in the `title_tags` attribute, allowing arbitrary JavaScript to be injected.
- **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape output, allowing the injected JavaScript to execute within the context of the webpage.

### Impact:
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the affected page. This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
- Account hijacking
- Data theft
- Defacement of the website
- Redirection to malicious websites

### Attack Vectors:
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the 'settings['title\_tags']' attribute of the Mercury widget.
- An authenticated attacker with contributor-level access or higher can inject the malicious code via the WordPress admin interface.

### Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with contributor-level access or higher.
- **WordPress Access:** The attacker requires access to the WordPress admin dashboard.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker must know that the 'settings['title\_tags']' parameter in the Mercury Widget is vulnerable.
