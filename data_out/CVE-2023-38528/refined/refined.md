- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application contains an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer while parsing a specially crafted X_T file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs by tricking a user into opening a malicious X_T file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted X_T file to a user of the affected application.
