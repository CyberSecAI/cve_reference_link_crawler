SSA-407785: Multiple X\_T File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Parasolid and Teamcenter Visualization

| Publication Date: | 2023-08-08 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-08-13 |
| Current Version: | V1.3 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.8 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 7.3 |

SUMMARY

Parasolid and Teamcenter Visualization are affected by memory corruption vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the application reads files in X\_T format. If a user is tricked to open a malicious file with the affected applications, an attacker could leverage the vulnerability to perform remote code execution or denial of service in the context of the current process.

Siemens has released new versions for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions. Siemens recommends specific countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.
