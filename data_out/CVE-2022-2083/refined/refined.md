Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the insecure exposure of the OAuth `client_secret` within the redirect URL of the Simple Single Sign On WordPress plugin. This secret, intended for server-side use, is exposed to the client-side, enabling unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Client Secret Handling:** The primary weakness is the inclusion of the `client_secret` in the redirect URL during the OAuth authorization process. This violates the OAuth 2.0 standard, which specifies that the `client_secret` should not be exposed in this manner.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The plugin does not properly validate or sanitize the redirect URL, thus allowing the `client_secret` to be exposed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the normal authentication process by leveraging the exposed `client_secret`. This enables them to obtain an access token from the OAuth server without authenticating as a legitimate user.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** By obtaining a valid `access_token`, an attacker can potentially gain access to resources on the client's website, depending on the permissions granted to the client application.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In the provided example, the attacker could obtain user information, and if the user does not exist in the client database, the plugin will create a new user, possibly with high level access such as administrator. If a user does exist, then the attacker would be logged in as that user, allowing for actions to be performed.
*   **Full account takeover:** With a successful privilege escalation, the attacker could perform full account takeover and gain total control of the target website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** An attacker can directly access the vulnerable URL containing the leaked `client_secret` to obtain the credentials.
*   **Automated Scripting:** Attackers can use automated scripts to extract the `client_secret` from the redirect URL and obtain an `access_token`.
*   **Browser manipulation:** By inspecting the URL after clicking "Single Sign On" button, an attacker can obtain the `client_secret`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable website over the network.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not require any prior authentication or knowledge of user credentials.
*   **Basic Scripting Knowledge (optional):** While not strictly necessary, scripting knowledge helps to automate the exploit process, though simply opening the link in a browser is enough.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable plugin:** The attacker must be aware of the presence of the vulnerable plugin on the target website.
*   **OAuth Server Connection:** For exploitation, it is essential to have an OAuth server available, though it was noted that the free version does not provide the ability to use client credentials grant type for authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Simple Single Sign On WordPress plugin versions 4.1.0 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Lana Codes.
*   The provided content includes proof-of-concept code (Python scripts) demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The content also includes steps of the exploit, clearly stating how the vulnerability can be exploited.
*   The attack can be carried out using both python scripts and direct browser manipulation.
