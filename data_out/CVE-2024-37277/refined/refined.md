**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Authorization Bypass:** An attacker could bypass authorization mechanisms.
*   **Access to Sensitive Files/Folders:** The vulnerability could allow access to sensitive files or folders.
*   **Database Interaction:** Malicious actors may be able to interact with the database without proper authorization.
*   The general description notes that impact varies case by case.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves manipulating object references, likely through HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application using HTTP requests and manipulate object identifiers to access resources.

**Additional Notes:**
