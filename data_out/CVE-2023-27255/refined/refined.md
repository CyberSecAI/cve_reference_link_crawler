Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability present in the `DeleteRoomChanges` method of IDAttend's IDWeb application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries, leading to SQL injection. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring prior authentication, making it easier for attackers to exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Extraction:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, potentially including user information, financial records, or other confidential business data.
- **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database, which could lead to data corruption, system instability, or financial loss.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attack vector is through network access to the vulnerable IDWeb application. Specifically, the vulnerability is in the `DeleteRoomChanges` method which can be accessed remotely.
- **Malformed Input:** The attacker crafts a malicious SQL query as input to `DeleteRoomChanges` via HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the IDWeb application. No prior authentication is required, making it trivially exploitable from a remote location.
- **Technical Skills:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jack Misiura on behalf of The Missing Link Security.
- Affected version: 3.1.013
- Fixed version: 3.1.053
