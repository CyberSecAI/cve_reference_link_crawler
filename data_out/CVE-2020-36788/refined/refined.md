The provided content is related to CVE-2020-36788.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the Nouveau DRM driver. When `nouveau_bo_init()` fails, the underlying `ttm_bo_init()` function invokes a destructor that de-initializes and frees the memory. However, the `nouveau_gem_new()` function was still attempting to dereference the freed memory in this error case, leading to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  A use-after-free can lead to a variety of issues including:
    -  System crash
    -  Arbitrary code execution
    -  Denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when `nouveau_bo_init()` fails, which is called during the creation of a new GEM object in `nouveau_gem_new()`. A malicious user-space application could trigger this failure leading to a use-after-free in the kernel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Nouveau DRM driver, which could be achieved by a local user with appropriate privileges to utilize DRM functionalities.
