{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin unserializes user input provided via the settings.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "PHP Object Injection via insecure deserialization of user-provided input.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution when a suitable gadget chain is present. The provided PoC demonstrates this by calling the `__wakeup()` method, which could be leveraged to perform arbitrary actions on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can inject a malicious serialized PHP object by uploading a file through the plugin's import feature.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have admin or similar high-privileges access to upload files and use the import feature."
