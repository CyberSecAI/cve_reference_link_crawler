```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A memory corruption issue was addressed with improved validation.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Memory corruption.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker with arbitrary kernel read and write capability may be able to bypass kernel memory protections. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited.
- Attack vectors: An attacker with arbitrary kernel read and write capability.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Arbitrary kernel read and write capability.
