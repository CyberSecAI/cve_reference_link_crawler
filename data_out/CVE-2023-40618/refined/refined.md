Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue.
- It stems from the `service` parameter in the `headstart_snapshot.php` file not being properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the web browser of a user.
- This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Other browser based attacks

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `service` parameter of the `headstart_snapshot.php` URL.
- The crafted URL is then presented to the victim.
- When the victim accesses the malicious URL, the unsanitized payload is reflected back in the response and gets executed in the browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the payload and lure the victim to click the URL.
- No specific level of access to the system is needed, just the ability to induce the user to access the malicious URL

**Affected software:**
- OpenKnowledgeMaps Head Start versions 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Visual Project Explorer 1.0

**Additional notes:**
- The provided PoC demonstrates the injection by using the following URL:
   `<host>/server/services/snapshot/headstart_snapshot.php?service=test%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(5)%3C/script%3E`
- The vulnerability was discovered by Florian Walter in August 2023
