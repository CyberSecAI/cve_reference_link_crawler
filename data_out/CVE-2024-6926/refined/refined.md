- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information, data modification, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessible through an AJAX action available to unauthenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without any authentication. They need to send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `idsignup` parameter.
