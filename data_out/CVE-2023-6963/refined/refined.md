      "content": "The provided content is a changeset from the WordPress Plugin Directory, specifically for the 'getwid' plugin. It details changes made in version 2.0.5, including modifications to JavaScript files related to the contact form and general frontend functionality, and adjustments to PHP files for block functionality, scripts management, and language support. Crucially, it shows a change in the frontend.js which appears to correct a vulnerability related to the captcha in the contact form block. The key change is the replacement of `security:Getwid.nonces.recaptcha_v2_contact_form` with `nonce:Getwid.nonces.contact_form`.\n\nAdditionally, the content shows changes to the getwid.php which includes a version bump from 2.0.4 to 2.0.5, and a change in `includes/blocks/ai-text.php` where '(Beta)' is removed from the 'AI Assistant' block label.  It also mentions an improvement in the way to modify reCAPTCHA Site Key and Secret Key and that the Captcha - Contact Form child block was removed.",
      "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is related to incorrect nonce usage in the contact form submission. The `frontend.js` file was using  `Getwid.nonces.recaptcha_v2_contact_form` when it should have used `Getwid.nonces.contact_form`. This resulted in the server not properly verifying the nonce and allowing the contact form to be submitted without a captcha token. ",
