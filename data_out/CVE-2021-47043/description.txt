In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: venus: core: Fix some resource leaks in the error path of 'venus_probe()'

If an error occurs after a successful 'of_icc_get()' call, it must be
undone.

Use 'devm_of_icc_get()' instead of 'of_icc_get()' to avoid the leak.
Update the remove function accordingly and axe the now unneeded
'icc_put()' calls.
