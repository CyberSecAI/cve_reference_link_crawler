Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-2663:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause lies in insufficient input validation during deserialization within multiple classes of the Libraries, AWT, and JNDI components of OpenJDK. This lack of validation allows for the creation of objects with an inconsistent state or the use of an excessive amount of memory when deserialized. Specifically, the `ArrayBlockingQueue` class is mentioned as vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Deserialization vulnerability: The software fails to properly validate serialized input data when creating new object instances during deserialization. This leads to the possibility of creating objects that have an inconsistent state or that use excessive memory during creation.
- Lack of input sanitization/validation: There's a lack of proper checks and restrictions when creating objects from serialized data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): By providing a specially crafted, malicious input, an attacker can cause a Java application to crash or consume excessive memory, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs through the deserialization of malicious input data.
- A remote attacker could provide the crafted input to a Java application running on the target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to supply malicious serialized data to the vulnerable application/service. This could occur in various scenarios, such as network data streams or from local files that are subsequently deserialized.

**Additional Details**

- The vulnerability is fixed by updating the relevant packages that use the vulnerable `ArrayBlockingQueue` class, along with other vulnerable classes in the Libraries, AWT, and JNDI components.
- Multiple sources confirm the vulnerability affects OpenJDK and IBM JDK.

- Red Hat's security advisory RHSA-2018:0349 and RHSA-2018:0099 both mention this CVE, indicating it affects both OpenJDK and Oracle JDK respectively.
- Ubuntu's USN-3613-1 and USN-3614-1 also highlight this vulnerability in OpenJDK.
- Oracle's CPU advisory for January 2018 indicates that the fix is included in Java SE versions 6u181, 7u171, 8u161, and 9.0.1.
