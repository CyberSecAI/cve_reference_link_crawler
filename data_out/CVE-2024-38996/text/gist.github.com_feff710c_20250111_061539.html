[CVE-2024-38996] Vulnerability Advisory: Prototype Pollution in ag-grid-community, version 31.3.2

 [Raw](/mestrtee/c1590660750744f25e86ba1bf240844b/raw/57a28cf09229c56dbff99d5e4bbf6d4f92a86921/Advisory_ag-grid.md)

[**Advisory\_ag-grid.md**](#file-advisory_ag-grid-md)

**Vulnerability type:**
Prototype Pollution

**SVSS Score**
9.8 CRITICAL

**Vendor of the Package:**
ag-grid

**SVSS Score**
9.8 CRITICAL

**Affected Package:**

* Product: ag-grid-community
* Version: 31.3.2

**Affected component(s):**

```
_.mergeDeep
```

**Attack vector(s):**
the attacker can modify built-in Object.prototype by calling the vulnerable function: `_.mergeDeep` with an argument containing a special property `__proto__` to pollute the application logic that can be escalated to Denial of service, remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks.

**Description:**
Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution through the vulnerable function: `_.mergeDeep`. An attacker can alter the behavior of all objects inheriting from the affected prototype by passing arguments to the vulenrable function crafted with the built-in property: `__proto__`. The attack can potentially escalated to Denial of service, remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks depends on the gadgets that may affected by the attack

**Proof-of-Concept:**

```
(async () => {
  const lib = await import('ag-grid-community');

  var victim = {}

  console.log("Before Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));

  try {

  lib._.mergeDeep ({}, JSON.parse('{"__proto__":{"test":123}}'))

  } catch (e) { }

  console.log("After Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));

  delete Object.prototype.test;

  })();
```

Please note this has been addressed and resolved via patch `31.3.4` for version 31 and patch `32.0.2` for version 32.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Hi [@AG-Zoheil](https://github.com/AG-Zoheil),

Are previous versions, including the 20.2.0 version which I'm using for both ag-grid-community and ag-grid-enterprise, also vulnerable?

Thanks,

Sorry, something went wrong.

We are not in a position to do a comprehensive investigation into which earlier versions of AG Grid are affected, however we can now confirm that our findings are in line with the EPSS rating of the vulnerability that stands at just 0.05% (independently verified here: <https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2024-39001/>), meaning this vulnerability is extremely unlikely to be exploited.

We have provided patches for our latest version (`v32`) and the version it was reported in (`v31`).

As usual, we'd recommend upgrading the version of AG Grid in your application so you can benefit from all the improvements in functionality, stability, security, theming and performance we've made since the version you're using.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Hi [@AG-Zoheil](https://github.com/AG-Zoheil) ,

Does this vulnerability exist in all prior versions of ag-grid-community ? The latest update in advisory database: [github/advisory-database@c2bcebe](https://github.com/github/advisory-database/commit/c2bcebe306b7b600c3c701478985f88d8b59385f), says all versions of ag-grid-community up until 31.3.4 are affected.

Hi [@vigneshnithyanandan](https://github.com/vigneshnithyanandan),

Please read my comment above regarding older versions of AG Grid.

We have provided patches for our latest version (`v32`) and the version it was reported in (`v31`) and we'd recommend upgrading to either of them.

Sorry, something went wrong.
