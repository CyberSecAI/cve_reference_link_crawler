Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `get_balance.php` page of the itsourcecode Society Management System v1.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `student_id` parameter, before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The provided payload uses a time-based blind SQL injection technique, which allows the attacker to potentially:
   - Extract sensitive data from the database
   - Modify or delete data
   - Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system
The impact is severe, allowing for complete compromise of the database and potentially the web application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the HTTP POST request to the `/admin/get_balance.php` page.
- The attacker injects SQL code through the `student_id` POST parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No special authentication seems to be needed for this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the application structure or how the query is made, at least enough to inject a malicious SQL query.

**Technical Details**
- The provided payload demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection: `student_id=111231231' AND (SELECT 9827 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))XYjI) AND 'jqiB'='jqiB`
  - The `SLEEP(5)` function forces the database to pause execution for 5 seconds, which can be detected by the attacker to confirm the injection.
  - This shows that a successful time-based blind SQL injection is possible using this method.
