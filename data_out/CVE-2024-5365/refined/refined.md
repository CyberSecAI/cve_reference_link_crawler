Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to direct SQL query construction by concatenating the `id` parameter from the GET request within the `manage_payment.php` file without any sanitization or validation.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection. The application is vulnerable because it does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform SQL injection, which can lead to:
    *   Reading arbitrary data from the database.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attack vector is through the HTTP GET method.
    *   The vulnerable parameter is `id` in `manage_payment.php`
    *   The vulnerable URL is `/index.php?page=manage_payment&id=1`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
    *   They do not need prior authentication to the application's front-end, only to the admin panel in order to obtain a valid `PHPSESSID` for the exploitation.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `manage_payment.php` file directly uses the `$_GET['id']` parameter in a SQL query without any filtering or sanitization.
*   The provided example demonstrates using sqlmap to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability, extracting the current database name.
*   The application is identified as "SourceCodester Best House Rental Management System v1.0".
*   The github content provides the following URL for the software: `<https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/17375/best-courier-management-system-project-php.html>`
