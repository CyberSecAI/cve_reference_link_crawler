The provided content relates to CVE-2024-26838.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A race condition exists in the `irdma` driver when freeing an interrupt request (IRQ). A tasklet associated with the IRQ could be pending on another CPU core while the IRQ is being deleted. This can lead to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability.
- Race condition between the freeing of an IRQ and the execution of a pending tasklet associated with that IRQ.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash due to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the freeing of an IRQ while a related tasklet is still pending on another core.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to trigger the `irdma` driver and cause an IRQ to be freed.
