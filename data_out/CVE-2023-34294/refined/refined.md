- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of validation of the existence of an object before performing operations on it during the parsing of DCM files. This leads to a use-after-free condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information. It can also be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious DCM file or visiting a malicious page. This means user interaction is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious DCM file or create a malicious page that, when interacted with, triggers the vulnerability.
