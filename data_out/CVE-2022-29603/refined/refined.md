Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Improper validation of user-supplied input to the `$select` parameter in multiple API endpoints. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application fails to properly sanitize or neutralize special characters within the `$select` parameter, leading to SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information from the database, including personal data such as IDs, names, addresses, phone numbers, and Social Security numbers.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify data in the back-end database, such as changing student grades.
*   **Data Deletion:** Attackers could potentially delete information from the back-end database.
*   **Unauthorized Access**: Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through API endpoints.
*   **HTTP Parameter Injection:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code via the `$select` parameter in HTTP requests.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have valid authentication credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a valid, authenticated user of the UniverSIS-API.
*   **Knowledge of API Endpoints:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable API endpoints that utilize the `$select` parameter.
*   **Understanding of SQL Injection Techniques:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SQL statements that are injected through the `$select` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content gives more detail than the official CVE description, including specific attack examples and the impact.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in commit `39e47d7f`.
*   The affected API endpoints included `/api/students/me/messages/`.
