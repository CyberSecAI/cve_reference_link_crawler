# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Package        : prometheus-alertmanager
Version        : 0.15.3+ds-3+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-40577
Debian Bug     : 1050558

prometheus-alertmanager package, a component of Prometheus,
an application used for event monitoring and alerting,
was vulnerable to stored XSS type attack.

Alertmanager handles alerts sent by client applications such as the
Prometheus server. An attacker with the permission to perform POST
requests on the /api/v1/alerts endpoint could be able to execute
arbitrary JavaScript code on the users of Prometheus Alertmanager.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
0.15.3+ds-3+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your prometheus-alertmanager packages.

For the detailed security status of prometheus-alertmanager please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/prometheus-alertmanager>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
