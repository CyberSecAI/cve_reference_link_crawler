Alertmanager handles alerts sent by client applications such as the Prometheus server. An attacker with the permission to perform POST requests on the /api/v1/alerts endpoint could be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the users of Prometheus Alertmanager. This issue has been fixed in Alertmanager version 0.2.51.
