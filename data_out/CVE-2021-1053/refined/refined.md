Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-1053:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper validation of a user pointer in the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver's kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`) handler for DxgkDdiEscape or IOCTL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper input validation on a user-provided pointer within the kernel mode driver. This allows for out-of-bounds memory access by an attacker controlled user-space program.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Potential for limited Information Disclosure
- Potential for limited Data Tampering

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access (AV:L). The attacker must have local access to the system.
- Requires a low privileged user account(PR:L)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to have a user account on the system to run a crafted user-mode application that can interact with the vulnerable kernel driver through `DxgkDdiEscape` or `IOCTL`.
- No user interaction (UI:N) is required for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects both Windows and Linux NVIDIA GPU Display Drivers.
- The issue resides in the kernel mode component of the driver.
- The provided CVSS vector is `AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H`, which indicates a base score of 6.6. This further clarifies that the vulnerability is local, requires low privileges, no user interaction, and has the potential for low confidentiality and integrity impacts but high availability impact.
- The issue is resolved in newer versions of the driver.
