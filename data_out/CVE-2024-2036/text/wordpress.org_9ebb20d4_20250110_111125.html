#### Multiple Ad Types support with only one plugin

Does your organization collect admission forms and also looking for job ads? Look no further, Ad Types feature is the solution for you. Go to *ApplyOnline/Settings/Types* in WordPress admin and create as many types as you wish. Just copy generated shortcode and paste into your desired WordPress page.

### How to create an ad?

In your WordPress admin panel, go to “All Ads” menu and create an ad here.

Add [aol] shortcode in an existing page or add a new page and write shortcode anywhere in the page editor. Now click on VIEW to see all of your ads on front-end.

### Can I show selected ads on front-end?

Yes, use shortcode with “ads” attribute. Ad ids must be separated with commas i.e. [aol ads=”1,2,3″ type=”ad”]. Deafult type is ad.

This plugin is crap. We bought this to replace a free plugin that is no longer supported. Tried for days to get this running and looked like something out of the 1990’s. Replaced it with a [another form plugin] and it is responsive and modern. When I went to there site to make sure I did not get charged for another year the site was done.

My customers bought three of their add-ons for this plugin. And despite them being entitled to support, WP Reloaded only responded once, submitting a bugfix for an add-on we didn’t buy, and after that never got back to my countless e-mails regarding bugs and inconsistencies in this plugin and the add-on plugins as well. If you look for a solid plugin that does work and your business depends on it, better think twice.

I would give this product 0 stars if I could. Never worked since it was purchased. Was not able to submit applications. When registering, the user is not sent an email. The user needs to reset their password after registering just to access their account. Additionally we paid for the Applicant Tracking Add-On which was never able to be utilized since applications could not be submitted. What a complete waste of time and money!

Super Lightweight and Nice Plugin with excellent Support.
I gave it a 4 out of 5, because of 2 reasons which i think would be fixed in any of the coming updates:
1. There’s a small bug while posting an ad at the back-end, The “Ad Feature” refreshes and discards the ad feature data after editing a published ad post.
2. A Front-end ad submission form would be an excellent feature for community based sites.
All round, It’s a great, flexible and useful plugin for a variety of applications.
