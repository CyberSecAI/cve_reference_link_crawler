Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2036

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check on the `aol_modal_box` AJAX action within the ApplyOnline plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to properly verify user capabilities before allowing access to the `aol_modal_box` AJAX action. This allows users with lower privileges (like subscriber access) to view sensitive information they should not have access to.
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** As a result of missing authorization, application submission data can be accessed by unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers with low-level privileges (such as subscribers) can view submitted applications, potentially exposing sensitive information contained within the forms. This could include personal details, resumes, and other data submitted by applicants.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending an AJAX request to the `aol_modal_box` action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with subscriber level access or higher.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.6.2.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.6.3 by adding a capability check to the `aol_modal_box` AJAX action.
- The Wordfence vulnerability database entry for this CVE provides links to the relevant code changes on the WordPress plugin repository's trac system which includes a link to the specific commit where the fix was implemented.
