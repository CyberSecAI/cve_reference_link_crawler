Based on the provided content, the commit `b7096af1028d8f909f63dd076d1bbd573913a92d` addresses missing permission checks and encoding issues within the OrchardCore CMS. This commit is related to CVE-2022-0821, which refers to a vulnerability related to insufficient checks and encoding.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause:** Missing permission checks and improper encoding in several controllers within OrchardCore CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authorization Checks:** Several controllers lacked proper authorization checks before performing actions, potentially allowing unauthorized users to perform sensitive operations. Specifically:
    - `LocalizationSetContentPickerAdminController` lacked authorization checks when retrieving content items.
    - `ContentController` lacked authorization checks when displaying or editing content items.
    - `AdminController` (Features) lacked authorization checks when disabling or enabling features.
    - `AdminController` (Roles) lacked authorization checks when creating a new role.
- **Encoding Issues**: Although the commit message mentions encoding, the diff does not provide explicit details regarding encoding changes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized users could potentially view or modify content they should not have access to.
- Unauthorized users could potentially disable or enable features.
- Unauthorized users could create new roles.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By sending crafted HTTP requests to the affected controllers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to have network access to the OrchardCore CMS instance.
- The attacker would need to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected endpoints.
- In some cases, the attacker may need to be authenticated, but with insufficient privileges for the targeted action.

**Additional details from the provided commit:**
The commit includes changes to several controller classes to add authorization checks using `IAuthorizationService` and the `AuthorizeAsync` method, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific actions. The specific files affected include:

- `src/OrchardCore.Modules/OrchardCore.ContentFields/Controllers/LocalizationSetContentPickerAdminController.cs`
- `src/OrchardCore.Modules/OrchardCore.Demo/Controllers/ContentController.cs`
- `src/OrchardCore.Modules/OrchardCore.Features/Controllers/AdminController.cs`
- `src/OrchardCore.Modules/OrchardCore.Roles/Controllers/AdminController.cs`
- `src/OrchardCore.Modules/OrchardCore.Seo/Drivers/SeoContentDriver.cs` (no security changes, just formatting)
- `src/OrchardCore.Modules/OrchardCore.Shortcodes/Controllers/AdminController.cs` (no security changes, just formatting)
- `src/OrchardCore.Modules/OrchardCore.Tenants/Controllers/FeatureProfilesController.cs` (no security changes, just formatting)

The commit primarily introduces authorization checks to various controller actions, preventing unauthorized users from performing actions such as viewing, editing, enabling/disabling, or creating data if they lack sufficient permissions.
