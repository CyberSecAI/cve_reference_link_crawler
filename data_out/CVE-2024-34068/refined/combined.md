# Unchecked hostname resolution could allow access to local network resources by users outside the local network

Moderate

[DaneEveritt](/DaneEveritt)
published
GHSA-6rg3-8h8x-5xfv
Jan 7, 2021

## Package

wings

## Affected versions

1.2.0

## Patched versions

1.2.1

## Description

### Impact

A newly implemented route allowing users to download files from remote endpoints was not properly verifying the destination hostname for user provided URLs. This would allow malicious users to potentially access resources on local networks that would otherwise be inaccessible.

This vulnerability requires valid authentication credentials and is therefore **not exploitable by unauthenticated users**. If you are running an instance for yourself or other trusted individuals this impact is unlikely to be of major concern to you. However, you should still upgrade for security sake.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to the latest version of Wings.

### Workarounds

There is no workaround available that does not involve modifying Panel or Wings code.

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Server-side Request Forgery during remote file pull

## Package

gomod

github.com/pterodactyl/wings
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.11.11

## Patched versions

1.11.12

## Description

### Impact

An authenticated user who has access to a game server is able to bypass the previously implemented access control ([GHSA-6rg3-8h8x-5xfv](https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/security/advisories/GHSA-6rg3-8h8x-5xfv "GHSA-6rg3-8h8x-5xfv")) that prevents accessing internal endpoints of the node hosting Wings in the pull endpoint. This would allow malicious users to potentially access resources on local networks that would otherwise be inaccessible.

### Workarounds

Enabling the `api.disable_remote_download` option or updating to the latest version of Wings are the only known workarounds.

### Patches

[c152e36](https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/commit/c152e36101aba45d8868a9a0eeb890995e8934b8)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
