| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=8148#c0)  Shiloong   admin  2024-02-01 17:08:00 UTC  ``` 上报人信息：   - 白家驹 <baijiaju@buaa.edu.cn>   - 北京航空航天大学网络空间安全学院  	 成因： 在snd_hdac_regmap_sync函数中，检查codec->regmap指针非空后在regcache_sync中进行了解引用，但检查codec->regmap指针非空并没有包含在解引用的mutex lock临界区内，codec->regmap在检查后仍有可能被其他线程的snd_hdac_regmap_exit等函数置空，从而触发空指针解引用，此bug是一个典型的原子性违反。  	 危害： 该模块被编译进内核里，发生空指针解引用会导致kernel panic并挂起系统，可以用于拒绝服务攻击。   修复缓解：    -  将snd_hdac_regmap_sync函数的临界区扩大到判断指针非空外，防止codec->regmap在检查非空后被赋空。  补丁已提交给Linux Kernel并被接收，补丁链接：<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=1f4a08fed450db87fbb5ff5105354158bdbe1a22> ``` |  |
