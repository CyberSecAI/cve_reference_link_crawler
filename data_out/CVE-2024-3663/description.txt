The WP Scraper plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on the wp_scraper_multi_scrape_action() function in all versions up to, and including, 5.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to create arbitrary pages and posts.
