- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unprivileged users can execute higher-privileged actions. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable function. They do not need to have any prior authentication or elevated privileges.
