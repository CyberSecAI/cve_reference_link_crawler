Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11925:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Luvion Grand Elite 3 Connect allows clients to authenticate using credentials that are exposed through an unauthenticated web request, specifically a JavaScript file. This also exposes the Wi-Fi SSID and WPA2 key.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  **Insecure credential storage/exposure:** The device stores and exposes authentication credentials, along with Wi-Fi information, in a way that is accessible without authentication.
-   **Authentication bypass:**  An attacker can bypass the device's authentication mechanism by obtaining the exposed credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Complete device access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the device, gaining access to the camera feed and potentially other functionalities.
- **Privacy violation:** Attackers can remotely monitor video and potentially audio feeds of the camera, leading to severe privacy breaches.
- **Network access:**  An attacker can gain access to the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated web request:** The attacker sends a web request to the device and retrieves the credentials from a JavaScript file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device or have access to the device via the internet.
- **Basic networking knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to send a web request to the device, and how to use the obtained credentials to authenticate.
