Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47126:

**CVE-2024-47126: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)**

*   **Root Cause:** The goTenna Pro App uses a cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) instead of `SecureRandom` when generating passwords for sharing cryptographic keys. This makes the generated password more vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
*   **Vulnerability:** The use of a weak PRNG for generating encryption key sharing passwords.
*   **Impact:** If an attacker captures the broadcasted encryption key over RF, the weak password can be brute-forced, allowing the attacker to decrypt the key and gain access to all past and future messages encrypted with that specific key.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   An attacker needs to be within RF range to capture the broadcasted encryption key.
    *   The attacker then performs a brute-force attack on the weak password used to protect the key.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs the capability to:
    *   Capture RF signals.
    *   Perform a brute-force attack to crack the weak password.
*   **Additional Details:** The vulnerability is specific to the optional broadcast feature of encryption keys over RF. Sharing keys via local QR codes is recommended as a more secure alternative.
