Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-6214

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `purchased_products` function within the `class.sale_notification.php` file of the HT Mega – Absolute Addons For Elementor plugin. This function retrieves and exposes recent order data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The `purchased_products` function retrieves order information, including product details and customer Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This information is then made accessible to unauthenticated users, leading to sensitive data exposure.
*   **Missing Access Control:** The core issue is the lack of proper access control on the `purchased_products` function, which is accessible via AJAX requests. There is no check to verify if the request is coming from an authorized user.
*   **Missing Nonce Check:** Initially, the function lacked a nonce check to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, which was later added.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive order data from the past 7 days.
*   **Privacy Violation:** Customer PII, including names, locations (city, state, country) is exposed. This could lead to privacy violations.
*   **Competitive Advantage Loss:**  Exposed product details could be used by competitors.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending a direct AJAX request to the `wp_ajax_nopriv_wcsales_purchased_products` or `wp_ajax_wcsales_purchased_products` action, as these actions were publicly accessible before the patch.
*   **Network:** The attack can be carried out over the network, requiring no physical access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Needed:** The attacker does not need any user credentials or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** Requires network access to the affected WordPress site.
*   **Basic Knowledge of AJAX:** An attacker needs to be able to send AJAX requests.

**Technical Details from the provided files:**
*   **Vulnerable Function:** `purchased_products` located in `ht-mega-for-elementor/tags/2.3.6/extensions/wc-sales-notification/classes/class.sale_notification.php`
*   The vulnerability exists because the `purchased_products` function, hooked to `wp_ajax_nopriv_wcsales_purchased_products` and `wp_ajax_wcsales_purchased_products`, retrieves order data using `get_posts` with parameters that include `shop_order` post type and order status, then extracts product and customer information and returns it in JSON format.
*   The code uses `get_transient` to cache product data for a minute, however, this does not mitigate the vulnerability.
*   The code originally lacked nonce verification, which was added in a later version (patch).
*   The patch included a call to `check_ajax_referer('wcsales-ajax-request', 'security');` to validate the nonce.

**Patched Version:** 2.4.7

**Summary**
The HT Mega – Absolute Addons For Elementor plugin had a sensitive information exposure vulnerability due to a lack of access control on the `purchased_products` AJAX endpoint, allowing unauthenticated attackers to retrieve recent order data and customer PII. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.4.7 by adding a nonce check.
