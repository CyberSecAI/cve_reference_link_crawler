Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28706:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')" in the Apache Airflow Hive Provider. This means that the Hive Provider does not properly sanitize or validate user-controlled input when generating code, allowing for injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Code Injection: The core vulnerability is that untrusted input is used to construct code, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands to be executed by the Hive provider.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Command Execution: An attacker can inject malicious code that will be executed on the server, potentially leading to complete control over the system running Apache Airflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability lies within the Apache Airflow Hive Provider.
- Attackers can likely inject malicious code through parameters or configurations that are passed to the Hive provider and used to construct the underlying command executed by the provider when interacting with Hive.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have the ability to influence the parameters or configurations of the Apache Airflow Hive Provider. This likely means being able to create or modify Airflow DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) or interact with the configuration of the Hive provider via other means such as the Airflow UI.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 6.0.0 of the Apache Airflow Hive provider.
- The specific fix relates to moving the Hive authentication parameters from the 'extra' field to the hook. This change likely involves better sanitization or validation of the auth parameter when used by the Hook to construct a command for the Hive system.
- The provided GitHub link shows the pull request that fixed the vulnerability, focusing on moving the auth parameter for the Hive connection from 'extra' to the Hook.
