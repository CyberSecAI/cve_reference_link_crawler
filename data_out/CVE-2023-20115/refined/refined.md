- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic error in the SFTP server implementation when verifying the user role during an SFTP connection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper privilege verification in the SFTP server when an SFTP connection is established. This allows a non-administrator user to perform actions they should not be authorized to perform.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who has authenticated as a non-administrator user can read or overwrite files on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the authenticated user.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited remotely through the SFTP protocol.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have valid credentials for a non-administrator user on the affected device and the SFTP server feature must be enabled.
