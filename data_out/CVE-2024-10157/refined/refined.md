Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10157

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `username` parameter during the password reset process. Specifically, the application does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application constructs an SQL query using the `username` parameter directly, without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other user information.
- **Integrity:** An attacker can modify or delete data within the database, leading to data corruption or loss.
- **Availability:** An attacker can potentially disrupt the application's functionality by injecting SQL code that causes errors or crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `/admin/password-recovery.php` page.
- Specifically, the `username` parameter is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the password reset functionality of the application.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `username` parameter, which is likely done through a web form.
-  The attacker can use tools like Burp Suite to intercept and modify the HTTP request with the malicious SQL payload.
-  The attacker can use SQLMap to automate the process of exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.
