Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1637

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The 360 Javascript Viewer plugin lacks proper authorization checks and exposes nonce values on several AJAX actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Capability Check:** The plugin does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform certain actions (specifically, updating plugin settings) before allowing them to do so.
- **Nonce Exposure:** Nonces, which are intended to protect against CSRF attacks, are exposed, potentially making the vulnerability more exploitable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access or higher can modify the plugin settings.
- This could lead to unauthorized changes in the plugin's behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through AJAX actions.
- An attacker sends a malicious request to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site with subscriber-level access or higher.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the 360 Javascript Viewer plugin up to and including 1.7.12.
- The fix is included in version 1.7.13 and later.
- The code snippet provided shows that the `saveSettings()` function did not properly check user capabilities before updating plugin settings. Specifically, the capability check `current_user_can('manage_options')` was present but was bypassed for a large number of operations, effectively only checking permission *after* the action was already started.
