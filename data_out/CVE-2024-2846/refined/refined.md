Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2846

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output escaping within the Visual Footer Credit Remover plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input for the `selector` parameter, and also fails to escape the output when rendering the plugin's settings page. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected through the vulnerable `selector` parameter and saved in the plugin's settings. This script will then be executed when the plugin's settings page is loaded in the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary script execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the targeted WordPress site. This can lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to:
  - **Session hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
  - **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive information, including other plugin settings or WordPress configuration data.
  - **Defacement:** Modifying the website's appearance.
  - **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or serving them malware.
  - **Administrative takeover:** If an administrator views the settings page while the injected script is present, the attacker can potentially escalate privileges or gain full control of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTTP request to modify the plugin settings, including the vulnerable `selector` parameter with malicious JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative level access (or a role with the unfiltered_html capability disabled on a multisite installation), meaning they must be able to log into the WordPress backend.
- **Target plugin:** The target must have the vulnerable Visual Footer Credit Remover plugin installed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions 1.2 and below.
- Version 1.3 of the plugin includes fixes that sanitize user input for the `selector` parameter and properly escape output.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the settings page of the Visual Footer Credit Remover plugin is loaded in a web browser, and only impacts multi-site installations, or installations with `unfiltered_html` disabled.
- The vulnerable parameters appear to be `selector`, `manipulation`, and `html`.
