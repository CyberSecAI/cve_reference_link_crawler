- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Himer theme fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input within its Post settings, specifically in the "Custom CSS code" section.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to add or modify a post and insert malicious code into the "Custom CSS code" section.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor level privileges in the WordPress instance, which allows them to create or edit posts.
