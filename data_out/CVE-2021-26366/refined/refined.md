- **Weaknesses:** Insufficient access control leading to unauthorized data access.
- **Impact:** Loss of system integrity due to the unauthorized reading of sensitive data from the Boot ROM.
- **Attack Vectors:** An attacker who has already gained elevated privileges through another vulnerability.
- **Required Capabilities:** Requires the attacker to have already achieved elevated privileges on the system.
