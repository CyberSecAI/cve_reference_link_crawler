Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `desc` parameter of the `/view/student_payment_invoice.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. This occurs because the application directly uses user-supplied input in the response without proper encoding or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application. This could lead to:
    *   **Malicious actions:**  Redirecting users to malicious websites, stealing cookies/session tokens, defacing the website, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Malware distribution:** Triggering the download of malware onto the victim's system without their consent.
    *   **Reputational damage:** Harm the trust and reputation of the website owner.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted GET request to `/view/student_payment_invoice.php` with a malicious payload in the `desc` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious `desc` parameter. The attacker would then need to trick a user into clicking the malicious link.
*   No special privileges are required.

**Additional Details:**
*   The affected software is "Campcodes Complete Web-Based School Management System" version 1.0 or earlier.
*   The vulnerable parameter is "desc".
*   The provided payload is `desc=desc'"()%26%25<zzz><ScRiPt%20>alert(9309)</ScRiPt>`. This payload attempts to execute a JavaScript alert box on the victim's browser.
