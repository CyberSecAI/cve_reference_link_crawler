- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP eStore plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in certain areas.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a missing CSRF check that allows an attacker to make a logged-in user perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick an administrator into deleting a coupon without their consent, leading to a potential loss of sales or impact on promotional campaigns.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed through a crafted URL containing the coupon ID that is sent to an authenticated user and if the user clicks on the link the action will be performed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to lure a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated.
