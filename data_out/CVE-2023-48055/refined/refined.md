- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses a hardcoded, constant key for encryption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Use of a hardcoded encryption key (`key = b'e3mp0E0Jr3jnVb96A31\_lKzGZlSTPIp4-rPaVseyn58='`)
    - Inadequate encryption strength due to the use of a constant key.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who gains access to the codebase can easily extract the hardcoded encryption key. This key can then be used to decrypt any data encrypted with it, including sensitive information like API keys.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Access to the application's source code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to access the source code of the SuperAGI application.
