The provided content relates to CVE-2024-2278.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WooCommerce Product Filter plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape filter settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin does not sanitize user input when creating filters.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker, with administrative privileges, can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of other users' browsers when they view the product filters table in the WordPress admin interface. This could be used to perform actions as the victim user, including changing site settings, stealing sensitive information, or redirecting the user to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** By creating a filter with a malicious payload in the name field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be logged in as a WordPress administrator to create or modify product filters.
