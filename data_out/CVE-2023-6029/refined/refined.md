The provided content describes a vulnerability in the EazyDocs WordPress plugin, which is related to CVE-2023-6029.

**Root Cause:**
The plugin lacks authorization and CSRF checks when handling documents. It does not verify if the manipulated posts are actually related to the plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authorization:** Any authenticated user, even with the subscriber role, can perform actions on posts/documents/sections.
- **Lack of CSRF protection:** The plugin does not include CSRF checks which makes the attack easier to perform.
- **Broken Access Control:** Inadequate checks allow arbitrary post deletion and document management by unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Post Deletion:** Any authenticated user can delete arbitrary posts, including those not related to the plugin.
- **Document Management Manipulation:** Any authenticated user can add, and delete documents/sections within the EazyDocs plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending crafted GET requests to specific admin-post.php endpoints.
  - `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-post.php?Create_doc=yes&parent_title=doc%201` (add document)
  - `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-post.php?Doc_Delete=yes&DeleteID=12` (delete document)
  - `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-post.php?Create_Section=yes&parentID=90&is_section=sec%201` (add section)
  - `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-post.php?Section_Delete=yes&ID=110` (delete section)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Requires a user account on the target WordPress site, even a low-privileged one like a subscriber.
- The attacker needs to know the specific URL and parameters to make the malicious requests.
