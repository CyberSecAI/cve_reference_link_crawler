**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS, where malicious code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) injected by an attacker via the vulnerable fields, gets executed in the browsers of other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

    *   Performing actions on behalf of a user without their consent.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Weblog Category Name:** Inputting malicious code into the category name field.
*   **Website About:** Injecting scripts via the Website About section.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is considered medium severity.
