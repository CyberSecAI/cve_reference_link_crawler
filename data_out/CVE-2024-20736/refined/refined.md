The provided document contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2024-20736.

**CVE-2024-20736**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Read
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a classic out-of-bounds read (CWE-125). This occurs when the software attempts to access memory outside the bounds of a designated buffer or data structure.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a memory leak. The attacker can read sensitive information from the process memory, potentially exposing sensitive data.
*  **Attack vectors:** Local attack vector, the attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a crafted file. User interaction is required for the exploit to work. The attacker does not need special privileges.
