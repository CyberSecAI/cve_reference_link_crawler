{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The code did not properly validate user-controlled values when calculating memory allocation sizes, which could lead to integer overflows.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious user could cause a buffer overflow in kernel memory by providing crafted input, leading to a denial of service or potential for arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through the `qib_user_sdma_queue_pkts` function by providing specially crafted iovec structures which are passed through the InfiniBand user space interface",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to interact with the InfiniBand user space interface of a vulnerable system."
  },
  "remediation": "The code was fixed by adding checks for integer overflows when calculating memory allocation sizes and by changing relevant variables to type `size_t`.",
  "details": "The vulnerability lies in the `drivers/infiniband/hw/qib/qib_user_sdma.c` file where calculations involving `bytes_togo` and `addrlimit` were performed using user-provided data. The fix introduces `check_add_overflow` to prevent integer overflows during the calculation of the size of the packet and allocation of memory for `qib_user_sdma_pkt`. Additionally, variables like `npages` and `bytes_togo` were changed from `int` to `size_t` to accommodate larger memory sizes."
