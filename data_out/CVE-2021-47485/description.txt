In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

IB/qib: Protect from buffer overflow in struct qib_user_sdma_pkt fields

Overflowing either addrlimit or bytes_togo can allow userspace to trigger
a buffer overflow of kernel memory. Check for overflows in all the places
doing math on user controlled buffers.
