Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-1354:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `TIFFReadRawDataStriped()` function located in `tiffinfo.c`. This is triggered when processing a specially crafted TIFF file.
*   The issue stems from a flaw in how the `libtiff` library handles OJPEG compressed data within TIFF files when reading a directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow, which occurs when the program attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer in the heap memory.
*   **Input validation:**  The vulnerability arises due to insufficient validation of data extracted from the TIFF file before it is processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can lead to a crash of the application due to the memory corruption, resulting in a denial of service. The `tiffinfo` tool is specifically mentioned as being vulnerable to crashing due to this issue.
*   **Memory Corruption**: The heap buffer overflow can cause memory corruption

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious TIFF file:** The attack vector is a crafted TIFF image file containing malicious data that triggers the vulnerability when processed by vulnerable versions of libtiff, especially via `tiffinfo` tool.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a malicious TIFF file using vulnerable utilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide a malicious file:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious TIFF file to the vulnerable system, either by uploading it or getting a user to open it via a vulnerable application, such as `tiffinfo`.
*   **User Interaction:** In some cases, such as via the command line utility `tiffinfo`, user interaction is necessary to trigger the vulnerability if an attacker uses social engineering to convince the victim to use the crafted file.
