Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the deserialization of untrusted data within the `wpeden_post_meta` post meta value. This occurs in the `util-functions.php` file of the The Next theme.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **PHP Object Injection:** The theme deserializes data from the `wpeden_post_meta` meta, allowing for the injection of a PHP object. This is a critical vulnerability because PHP object injection can lead to arbitrary code execution if a suitable "POP chain" (a chain of methods that can be triggered to achieve malicious objectives) is present in the application or in other installed plugins.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The theme does not properly sanitize the data before deserializing it, allowing malicious input to be processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If a suitable POP chain is present within the WordPress installation (either in the theme itself or another installed plugin or theme), an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions:
    *   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Attackers can delete any file on the server that the web server user has access to.
    *   **Sensitive Data Retrieval:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive data stored on the server, including database credentials, user information and other secrets.
    *   **Full System Compromise:** In a worst-case scenario, an attacker could gain complete control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `wpeden_post_meta` post meta value, which is stored in the WordPress database. An attacker can manipulate this value to include a serialized PHP object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This implies that they would need to have valid credentials on the WordPress instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information notes that the vulnerability is present in all versions of "The Next" theme up to and including 1.1.0.
*   There is no known patch available for this vulnerability at the time of this report.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Francesco Carlucci.
*   The provided source code snippet from `util-functions.php` shows the use of `maybe_unserialize()` which is where the vulnerability exists at line 365.
