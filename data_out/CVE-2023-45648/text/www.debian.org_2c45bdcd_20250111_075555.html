Package        : tomcat9
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-24998 CVE-2023-41080 CVE-2023-42795 CVE-2023-44487
                 CVE-2023-45648

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Tomcat
servlet and JSP engine.

CVE-2023-24998

    Denial of service. Tomcat uses a packaged renamed copy of Apache Commons
    FileUpload to provide the file upload functionality defined in the Jakarta
    Servlet specification. Apache Tomcat was, therefore, also vulnerable to the
    Commons FileUpload vulnerability CVE-2023-24998 as there was no limit to
    the number of request parts processed. This resulted in the possibility of
    an attacker triggering a DoS with a malicious upload or series of uploads.

CVE-2023-41080

    Open redirect. If the ROOT (default) web application is configured to use
    FORM authentication then it is possible that a specially crafted URL could
    be used to trigger a redirect to an URL of the attackers choice.

CVE-2023-42795

    Information Disclosure. When recycling various internal objects, including
    the request and the response, prior to re-use by the next request/response,
    an error could cause Tomcat to skip some parts of the recycling process
    leading to information leaking from the current request/response to the
    next.

CVE-2023-44487

    DoS caused by HTTP/2 frame overhead (Rapid Reset Attack)

CVE-2023-45648

    Request smuggling. Tomcat did not correctly parse HTTP trailer headers. A
    specially crafted, invalid trailer header could cause Tomcat to treat a
    single request as multiple requests leading to the possibility of request
    smuggling when behind a reverse proxy.

For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 9.0.43-2~deb11u7.

We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat9 packages.
