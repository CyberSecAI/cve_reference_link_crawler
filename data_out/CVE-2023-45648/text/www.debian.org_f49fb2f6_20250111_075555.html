Package        : tomcat10
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-28709 CVE-2023-41080 CVE-2023-42795 CVE-2023-44487
                 CVE-2023-45648

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Tomcat
servlet and JSP engine.

CVE-2023-28709

    Denial of Service. If non-default HTTP connector settings were used such
    that the maxParameterCount could be reached using query string parameters
    and a request was submitted that supplied exactly maxParameterCount
    parameters in the query string, the limit for uploaded request parts could
    be bypassed with the potential for a denial of service to occur.

CVE-2023-41080

    Open redirect. If the ROOT (default) web application is configured to use
    FORM authentication then it is possible that a specially crafted URL could
    be used to trigger a redirect to an URL of the attackers choice.

CVE-2023-42795

    Information Disclosure. When recycling various internal objects, including
    the request and the response, prior to re-use by the next request/response,
    an error could cause Tomcat to skip some parts of the recycling process
    leading to information leaking from the current request/response to the
    next.

CVE-2023-44487

    DoS caused by HTTP/2 frame overhead (Rapid Reset Attack)

CVE-2023-45648

    Request smuggling. Tomcat did not correctly parse HTTP trailer headers. A
    specially crafted, invalid trailer header could cause Tomcat to treat a
    single request as multiple requests leading to the possibility of request
    smuggling when behind a reverse proxy.

For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.1.6-1+deb12u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat10 packages.
