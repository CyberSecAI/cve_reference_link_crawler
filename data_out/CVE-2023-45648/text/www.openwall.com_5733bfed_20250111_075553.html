Subject: CVE-2023-45648: Apache Tomcat: Trailer header parsing too lenient

Severity: important

Affected versions:

- Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M11
- Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.13
- Apache Tomcat 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.81
- Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 through 8.5.93

Description:

Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.Tomcat from
11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M11, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.13, from
9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.81 and from 8.5.0 through 8.5.93 did not correctly
parse HTTP trailer headers. A specially
crafted, invalid trailer header could cause Tomcat to treat a single
request as multiple requests leading to the possibility of request
smuggling when behind a reverse proxy.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M12 onwards, 10.1.14
onwards, 9.0.81 onwards or 8.5.94 onwards, which fix the issue.
