- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application responds differently to login attempts with valid and invalid usernames, allowing attackers to distinguish between them. Specifically, the application returns "password wrong" for valid usernames with incorrect passwords and "login failed" for invalid usernames.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Account enumeration vulnerability due to distinct responses for valid and invalid usernames. This can also lead to guessable user accounts, as the default username 'admin' is prepopulated in the login form.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can enumerate valid user accounts, which can facilitate further attacks such as brute-forcing passwords.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, unauthenticated attackers can send login requests with different usernames and observe the distinct responses to determine valid accounts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device's login page. They do not require prior authentication.
