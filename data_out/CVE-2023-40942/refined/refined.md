- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formSetFirewallCfg` function. This is due to the lack of length validation when copying the user-provided `firewallEn` parameter into a local buffer `firewall_buf` of size 8 bytes using `strcpy`.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Stack-based buffer overflow.
  - Lack of input validation on user-controlled parameter.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
   - A successful exploit could allow an attacker to overwrite data on the stack.
  - The provided text indicates that exploitation can lead to a root shell on the device, giving an attacker full control of the device.

- **Attack vectors**:
  - Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/SetFirewallCfg` with a `firewallEn` parameter longer than 4 characters (since it is later copied to 8-byte buffer).

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router.
  - The attacker has to know the target router's IP address.
  - Requires no authentication since no authentication is checked in the vulnerable code.
