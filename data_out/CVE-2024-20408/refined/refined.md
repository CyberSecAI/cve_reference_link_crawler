- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of data in HTTPS POST requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability exists in the Dynamic Access Policies (DAP) feature of Cisco ASA and FTD software. Specifically, the software fails to properly validate data within HTTPS POST requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows an attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTPS POST request to an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs valid remote access VPN user credentials on the affected device. Additionally, the following conditions must be met on the targeted device:
    - SSL VPN must be enabled on at least one interface.
    - At least one custom DAP must be configured.
    - HostScan must be enabled.
