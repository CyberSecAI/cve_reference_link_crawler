Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-0908:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check within the `apbPosts()` function of the "Advanced Post Block" WordPress plugin. This function is hooked to an AJAX action, and the lack of proper capability verification allows unauthenticated users to access it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary weakness is the absence of a capability check on the `apbPosts()` function, which is accessible through an AJAX action.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows for the disclosure of post data, including potentially password-protected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Information Access:** Attackers can retrieve all post data, including those intended to be private or protected, such as password-protected posts.
- **Data Exposure:** Sensitive information within posts could be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated AJAX Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending an AJAX request to the vulnerable `apbPosts()` function without authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated User:** Attackers do not need to have any form of authentication or user privileges on the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.

**Summary:**
The "Advanced Post Block" plugin versions 1.13.4 and below are vulnerable due to a missing authorization check in the `apbPosts()` AJAX function. This allows unauthenticated attackers to retrieve all post data, including password-protected posts. The vulnerability is classified as medium severity with a CVSS score of 5.3. The issue was fixed in version 1.13.5.
