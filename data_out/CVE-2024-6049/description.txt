The web server of Lawo AG vsm LTC Time Sync (vTimeSync) is affected by a "..." (triple dot) path traversal vulnerability. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request, an unauthenticated remote attacker could download arbitrary files from the operating system. As a limitation, the exploitation is only possible if the requested file has some file extension, e. g. .exe or .txt.
