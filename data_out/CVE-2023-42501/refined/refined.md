- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unnecessary read permissions within the Gamma role in Apache Superset.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Gamma role, intended for a lower level of access, had `can_read` permissions on CSS templates and annotations which should not be accessible to this role.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Authenticated users with the Gamma role could read configured CSS templates and annotations, potentially revealing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through authenticated access to the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the Gamma role in Apache Superset.
