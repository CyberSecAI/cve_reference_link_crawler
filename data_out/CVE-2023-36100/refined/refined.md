Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **Lack of Authorization/Insufficient validation:** The `/api/User/ChangeUser/(self_token)` API endpoint lacks proper authorization checks and input validation. It allows modification of user information through the `UserID` field without any verification or filtering.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The API endpoint uses the `UserID` parameter directly without verifying if the user making the request is authorized to modify the specified user's data.
*   **Missing authorization:** The API does not enforce authorization, allowing any authenticated user to modify any other user's information.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary User Data Modification:** An attacker can modify the information of any user by manipulating the `UserID` parameter in the API request. This could include changing usernames, passwords, email addresses, or other sensitive user data.
*   **Account Takeover:** By changing user credentials, attackers can gain unauthorized access to user accounts and potentially sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Direct API Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted API request to `/api/User/ChangeUser/(self_token)` with a target `UserID` and desired modifications.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
*   **Knowledge of User IDs:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess valid user IDs in order to modify other accounts.

**Additional Information:**
* The attacker provided a link to a demo website where the vulnerability can be reproduced.
* The developer acknowledged the vulnerability stating "it is Inenegligence in authorization.should be apply shiro to certify user."
* The vulnerability allows arbitrary information traversal and modification.
