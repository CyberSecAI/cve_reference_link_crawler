Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `searchdata` parameter within the `index.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries through the `searchdata` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker can bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Sensitive Information Extraction:** The attacker can extract sensitive information from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the `searchdata` POST parameter in the `index.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the application.
*   No specific authentication is mentioned as needed before injecting the SQL.

**Technical Details:**
*   The provided SQLMap Proof of Concept demonstrates different types of SQL injection:
    *   Boolean-based blind SQL injection
    *   Error-based SQL injection
    *   Stacked query SQL injection
    *   Time-based blind SQL injection
    *   UNION query SQL injection
*   The PoC shows that the attacker can retrieve the database name (`tsasdb`).
