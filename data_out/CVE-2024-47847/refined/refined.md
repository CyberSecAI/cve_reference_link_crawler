Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-47847

**Vulnerability Description:** Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were identified in the Cargo MediaWiki extension. These vulnerabilities are categorized as DOM-based XSS (where the malicious script is executed due to modifications in the DOM) and reflective XSS (where the malicious script is reflected back to the user from the server), as well as stored XSS (where the malicious script is stored on the server).

**Root Cause:** The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of proper input sanitization and output escaping when handling user-controlled data within the Cargo extension. Specifically, the extension failed to correctly escape HTML entities and other special characters in various contexts, leading to the injection of malicious scripts. This included:
    -  System messages used in the interface
    - HTTP query parameters
    - Values stored in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **DOM-based XSS:** Vulnerabilities found in multiple system messages that are used by the extension, such as `cargo-viewdata-tablestooltip`, `cargo-viewdata-orderbytooltip`, `show`, `cargo-cargotables-columncountinfo`, `cargo-dynamictables-searchcolumn`, `cargo-recreatedata-success` and more. These messages contained hardcoded HTML or were not properly escaped, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in the user's browser.
*   **Reflective XSS:** Vulnerabilities found in HTTP query parameters such as `header_tooltips`, `delimiter`, `filename` and `link_text`. These parameters were not properly sanitized, leading to malicious scripts being executed in the user's browser.
*   **Stored XSS:** Several system messages such as `cargo-cargotables-mandatory`, `cargo-pagevalues-tablevalues`, `cargo-field-type`, `cargo-allowed-values`, `cargo-cargotables-replacementtable`, `returnto`, and `cargo-switchtables-confirm` were vulnerable to stored XSS. Furthermore, XSS was possible through allowed values in a table. An attacker can inject malicious code that will then be executed when other users view the affected pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
*   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, and other malicious activities.
*   Modify the content of the web page, deface the website, or redirect users to malicious sites.
*   Gain unauthorized access to user accounts and data.
*  Perform actions on behalf of a victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Maliciously crafted URLs:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into HTTP query parameters and share the URL, tricking users into accessing the link and triggering the XSS.
*   **System messages:** Attackers can manipulate system messages by using admin-level privileges, injecting scripts that execute when users visit certain pages.
*  **Database entries:** Attackers can inject malicious values into database entries, which are then displayed to other users without proper sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Basic User:** Some XSS vulnerabilities (e.g. reflective) can be exploited by tricking users into clicking malicious links.
*   **(editinterface) user right:** Some of the XSS vulnerabilities requires the ability to edit system messages, meaning a user needs to have the `editinterface` user right.
*   **Admin level privileges:** Some attacks require the creation of cargo tables or manipulation of data, which may require admin level privileges.
