    ASN.1: Fix check for strdup() success
    
    commit 5a43001c01691dcbd396541e6faa2c0077378f48 upstream.
    
    It seems there is a misprint in the check of strdup() return code that
    can lead to NULL pointer dereference.
    
    Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

    dma_request_slave_channel() may return NULL which will lead to
    NULL pointer dereference error in 'tmp_chan->private'.
    
    Correct this behaviour by, first, switching from deprecated function

    With PCI if the device was suspended it is brought back to full
    power and then suspended again.
    
    This doesn't happen when device is described via DT.

    was previously active (thus the pipelines were setup).

    mm/page_alloc: fix potential deadlock on zonelist_update_seq seqlock
    
    commit 1007843a91909a4995ee78a538f62d8665705b66 upstream.
    
    syzbot is reporting circular locking dependency which involves
    zonelist_update_seq seqlock [1], for this lock is checked by memory
    allocation requests which do not need to be retried.
    
    One deadlock scenario is kmalloc(GFP_ATOMIC) from an interrupt handler.
    
      CPU0
      ----
      __build_all_zonelists() {
        write_seqlock(&zonelist_update_seq); // makes zonelist_update_seq.seqcount odd
        // e.g. timer interrupt handler runs at this moment
          some_timer_func() {
            kmalloc(GFP_ATOMIC) {
              __alloc_pages_slowpath() {
                read_seqbegin(&zonelist_update_seq) {
                  // spins forever because zonelist_update_seq.seqcount is odd
                }
              }
            }
          }
        // e.g. timer interrupt handler finishes
        write_sequnlock(&zonelist_update_seq); // makes zonelist_update_seq.seqcount even
      }
    
    This deadlock scenario can be easily eliminated by not calling
    read_seqbegin(&zonelist_update_seq) from !__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM allocation
    requests, for retry is applicable to only __GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM allocation
    requests.  But Michal Hocko does not know whether we should go with this
    approach.
    
    Another deadlock scenario which syzbot is reporting is a race between
    kmalloc(GFP_ATOMIC) from tty_insert_flip_string_and_push_buffer() with
    port->lock held and printk() from __build_all_zonelists() with
    zonelist_update_seq held.
    
      CPU0                                   CPU1

                                               write_seqlock(&zonelist_update_seq);
                                               build_zonelists() {
                                                 printk() {

                                                   }
                                                 }
                                               }
                                               write_sequnlock(&zonelist_update_seq);
                                             }
        }
      }
    
    This deadlock scenario can be eliminated by
    
      preventing interrupt context from calling kmalloc(GFP_ATOMIC)
    
    and
    
      preventing printk() from calling console_flush_all()
    
    while zonelist_update_seq.seqcount is odd.
    
    Since Petr Mladek thinks that __build_all_zonelists() can become a
    candidate for deferring printk() [2], let's address this problem by
    
      disabling local interrupts in order to avoid kmalloc(GFP_ATOMIC)
    
    and
    
      disabling synchronous printk() in order to avoid console_flush_all()
    
    .
    
    As a side effect of minimizing duration of zonelist_update_seq.seqcount
    being odd by disabling synchronous printk(), latency at
    read_seqbegin(&zonelist_update_seq) for both !__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM and
    __GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM allocation requests will be reduced.  Although, from
    lockdep perspective, not calling read_seqbegin(&zonelist_update_seq) (i.e.
    do not record unnecessary locking dependency) from interrupt context is
    still preferable, even if we don't allow calling kmalloc(GFP_ATOMIC)
    inside
    write_seqlock(&zonelist_update_seq)/write_sequnlock(&zonelist_update_seq)
    section...

    fpga: bridge: properly initialize bridge device before populating children
    
    commit dc70eb868b9cd2ca01313e5a394e6ea001d513e9 upstream.
    
    The current code path can lead to warnings because of uninitialized device,
    which contains, as a consequence, uninitialized kobject. The uninitialized
    device is passed to of_platform_populate, which will at some point, while
    creating child device, try to get a reference on uninitialized parent,
    resulting in the following warning:
    
    kobject: '(null)' ((ptrval)): is not initialized, yet kobject_get() is
    being called.
    
    The warning is observed after migrating a kernel 5.10.x to 6.1.x.
    Reverting commit 0d70af3c2530 ("fpga: bridge: Use standard dev_release for
    class driver") seems to remove the warning.
    This commit aggregates device_initialize() and device_add() into
    device_register() but this new call is done AFTER of_platform_populate

    gcc: disable '-Warray-bounds' for gcc-13 too
    
    commit 0da6e5fd6c3726723e275603426e09178940dace upstream.
    
    We started disabling '-Warray-bounds' for gcc-12 originally on s390,
    because it resulted in some warnings that weren't realistically fixable
    (commit 8b202ee21839: "s390: disable -Warray-bounds").
    
    That s390-specific issue was then found to be less common elsewhere, but
    generic (see f0be87c42cbd: "gcc-12: disable '-Warray-bounds' universally
    for now"), and then later expanded the version check was expanded to
    gcc-11 (5a41237ad1d4: "gcc: disable -Warray-bounds for gcc-11 too").
    
    And it turns out that I was much too optimistic in thinking that it's
    all going to go away, and here we are with gcc-13 showing all the same
    issues.  So instead of expanding this one version at a time, let's just
    disable it for gcc-11+, and put an end limit to it only when we actually
    find a solution.
    
    Yes, I'm sure some of this is because the kernel just does odd things
    (like our "container_of()" use, but also knowingly playing games with
    things like linker tables and array layouts).
    
    And yes, some of the warnings are likely signs of real bugs, but when
    there are hundreds of false positives, that doesn't really help.
    
    Oh well.

    PCI/MSI: Remove over-zealous hardware size check in pci_msix_validate_entries()
    
    commit e3c026be4d3ca046799fde55ccbae9d0f059fb93 upstream.
    
    pci_msix_validate_entries() validates the entries array which is handed in
    by the caller for a MSI-X interrupt allocation. Aside of consistency
    failures it also detects a failure when the size of the MSI-X hardware table
    in the device is smaller than the size of the entries array.
    
    That's wrong for the case of range allocations where the caller provides
    the minimum and the maximum number of vectors to allocate, when the
    hardware size is greater or equal than the mininum, but smaller than the
    maximum.
    
    Remove the hardware size check completely from that function and just
    ensure that the entires array up to the maximum size is consistent.
    
    The limitation and range checking versus the hardware size happens
    independently of that afterwards anyway because the entries array is
    optional.

    LoongArch: Make WriteCombine configurable for ioremap()
    
    commit 16c52e503043aed1e2a2ce38d9249de5936c1f6b upstream.
    
    LoongArch maintains cache coherency in hardware, but when paired with
    LS7A chipsets the WUC attribute (Weak-ordered UnCached, which is similar
    to WriteCombine) is out of the scope of cache coherency machanism for
    PCIe devices (this is a PCIe protocol violation, which may be fixed in
    newer chipsets).
    
    This means WUC can only used for write-only memory regions now, so this
    option is disabled by default, making WUC silently fallback to SUC for
    ioremap(). You can enable this option if the kernel is ensured to run on
    hardware without this bug.
    
    Kernel parameter writecombine=on/off can be used to override the Kconfig
    option.

    LoongArch: Make -mstrict-align configurable
    
    commit 41596803302d83a67a80dc1efef4e51ac46acabb upstream.
    
    Introduce Kconfig option ARCH_STRICT_ALIGN to make -mstrict-align be
    configurable.
    
    Not all LoongArch cores support h/w unaligned access, we can use the
    -mstrict-align build parameter to prevent unaligned accesses.
    
    CPUs with h/w unaligned access support:
    Loongson-2K2000/2K3000/3A5000/3C5000/3D5000.
    
    CPUs without h/w unaligned access support:
    Loongson-2K500/2K1000.
    
    This option is enabled by default to make the kernel be able to run on
    all LoongArch systems. But you can disable it manually if you want to
    run kernel only on systems with h/w unaligned access support in order to
    optimise for performance.

    KVM: arm64: Make vcpu flag updates non-preemptible
    
    commit 35dcb3ac663a16510afc27ba2725d70c15e012a5 upstream.
    
    Per-vcpu flags are updated using a non-atomic RMW operation.
    Which means it is possible to get preempted between the read and
    write operations.
    
    Another interesting thing to note is that preemption also updates
    flags, as we have some flag manipulation in both the load and put
    operations.
    
    It is thus possible to lose information communicated by either
    load or put, as the preempted flag update will overwrite the flags
    when the thread is resumed. This is specially critical if either
    load or put has stored information which depends on the physical
    CPU the vcpu runs on.
    
    This results in really elusive bugs, and kudos must be given to
    Mostafa for the long hours of debugging, and finally spotting
    the problem.
    
    Fix it by disabling preemption during the RMW operation, which
    ensures that the state stays consistent. Also upgrade vcpu_get_flag
    path to use READ_ONCE() to make sure the field is always atomically
    accessed.

    cifs: avoid dup prefix path in dfs_get_automount_devname()
    
    commit d5a863a153e90996ab2aef6b9e08d509f4d5662b upstream.
    
    @server->origin_fullpath already contains the tree name + optional
    prefix, so avoid calling __build_path_from_dentry_optional_prefix() as
    it might end up duplicating prefix path from @cifs_sb->prepath into
    final full path.
    
    Instead, generate DFS full path by simply merging
    @server->origin_fullpath with dentry's path.
    
    This fixes the following case
    
            mount.cifs //root/dfs/dir /mnt/ -o ...
            ls /mnt/link
    
    where cifs_dfs_do_automount() will call smb3_parse_devname() with
    @devname set to "//root/dfs/dir/link" instead of
    "//root/dfs/dir/dir/link".

    mm: page_alloc: skip regions with hugetlbfs pages when allocating 1G pages
    
    commit 4d73ba5fa710fe7d432e0b271e6fecd252aef66e upstream.
    
    A bug was reported by Yuanxi Liu where allocating 1G pages at runtime is
    taking an excessive amount of time for large amounts of memory.  Further
    testing allocating huge pages that the cost is linear i.e.  if allocating
    1G pages in batches of 10 then the time to allocate nr_hugepages from
    10->20->30->etc increases linearly even though 10 pages are allocated at
    each step.  Profiles indicated that much of the time is spent checking the
    validity within already existing huge pages and then attempting a
    migration that fails after isolating the range, draining pages and a whole
    lot of other useless work.
    
    Commit eb14d4eefdc4 ("mm,page_alloc: drop unnecessary checks from
    pfn_range_valid_contig") removed two checks, one which ignored huge pages
    for contiguous allocations as huge pages can sometimes migrate.  While
    there may be value on migrating a 2M page to satisfy a 1G allocation, it's
    potentially expensive if the 1G allocation fails and it's pointless to try
    moving a 1G page for a new 1G allocation or scan the tail pages for valid
    PFNs.
    
    Reintroduce the PageHuge check and assume any contiguous region with
    hugetlbfs pages is unsuitable for a new 1G allocation.
    
    The hpagealloc test allocates huge pages in batches and reports the
    average latency per page over time.  This test happens just after boot
    when fragmentation is not an issue.  Units are in milliseconds.

    The vanilla kernel is poor, taking up to 1.3 second to allocate a huge
    page and almost 10 minutes in total to run the test.  Reverting the
    problematic commit reduces it to 8ms at worst and the patch takes 26ms.
    This patch fixes the main issue with skipping huge pages but leaves the
    page_count() out because a page with an elevated count potentially can
    migrate.

    mm: kmsan: handle alloc failures in kmsan_vmap_pages_range_noflush()
    
    commit 47ebd0310e89c087f56e58c103c44b72a2f6b216 upstream.
    
    As reported by Dipanjan Das, when KMSAN is used together with kernel fault
    injection (or, generally, even without the latter), calls to kcalloc() or
    __vmap_pages_range_noflush() may fail, leaving the metadata mappings for
    the virtual mapping in an inconsistent state.  When these metadata
    mappings are accessed later, the kernel crashes.
    
    To address the problem, we return a non-zero error code from
    kmsan_vmap_pages_range_noflush() in the case of any allocation/mapping
    failure inside it, and make vmap_pages_range_noflush() return an error if
    KMSAN fails to allocate the metadata.
    
    This patch also removes KMSAN_WARN_ON() from vmap_pages_range_noflush(),
    as these allocation failures are not fatal anymore.

    mm: kmsan: handle alloc failures in kmsan_ioremap_page_range()
    
    commit fdea03e12aa2a44a7bb34144208be97fc25dfd90 upstream.
    
    Similarly to kmsan_vmap_pages_range_noflush(), kmsan_ioremap_page_range()
    must also properly handle allocation/mapping failures.  In the case of
    such, it must clean up the already created metadata mappings and return an
    error code, so that the error can be propagated to ioremap_page_range().
    Without doing so, KMSAN may silently fail to bring the metadata for the
    page range into a consistent state, which will result in user-visible
    crashes when trying to access them.

    mm/huge_memory.c: warn with pr_warn_ratelimited instead of VM_WARN_ON_ONCE_FOLIO
    
    commit 4737edbbdd4958ae29ca6a310a6a2fa4e0684b01 upstream.
    
    split_huge_page_to_list() WARNs when called for huge zero pages, which
    sounds to me too harsh because it does not imply a kernel bug, but just
    notifies the event to admins.  On the other hand, this is considered as
    critical by syzkaller and makes its testing less efficient, which seems to
    me harmful.
    
    So replace the VM_WARN_ON_ONCE_FOLIO with pr_warn_ratelimited.

    mm/khugepaged: check again on anon uffd-wp during isolation
    
    commit dd47ac428c3f5f3bcabe845f36be870fe6c20784 upstream.
    
    Khugepaged collapse an anonymous thp in two rounds of scans.  The 2nd
    round done in __collapse_huge_page_isolate() after
    hpage_collapse_scan_pmd(), during which all the locks will be released
    temporarily.  It means the pgtable can change during this phase before 2nd
    round starts.
    
    It's logically possible some ptes got wr-protected during this phase, and
    we can errornously collapse a thp without noticing some ptes are
    wr-protected by userfault.  e1e267c7928f wanted to avoid it but it only
    did that for the 1st phase, not the 2nd phase.
    
    Since __collapse_huge_page_isolate() happens after a round of small page
    swapins, we don't need to worry on any !present ptes - if it existed
    khugepaged will already bail out.  So we only need to check present ptes
    with uffd-wp bit set there.
    
    This is something I found only but never had a reproducer, I thought it
    was one caused a bug in Muhammad's recent pagemap new ioctl work, but it
    turns out it's not the cause of that but an userspace bug.  However this
    seems to still be a real bug even with a very small race window, still
    worth to have it fixed and copy stable.

    mm/userfaultfd: fix uffd-wp handling for THP migration entries
    
    commit 24bf08c4376be417f16ceb609188b16f461b0443 upstream.
    
    Looks like what we fixed for hugetlb in commit 44f86392bdd1 ("mm/hugetlb:
    fix uffd-wp handling for migration entries in
    hugetlb_change_protection()") similarly applies to THP.
    
    Setting/clearing uffd-wp on THP migration entries is not implemented
    properly.  Further, while removing migration PMDs considers the uffd-wp
    bit, inserting migration PMDs does not consider the uffd-wp bit.
    
    We have to set/clear independently of the migration entry type in
    change_huge_pmd() and properly copy the uffd-wp bit in
    set_pmd_migration_entry().
    
    Verified using a simple reproducer that triggers migration of a THP, that
    the set_pmd_migration_entry() no longer loses the uffd-wp bit.

    mm: fix memory leak on mm_init error handling
    
    commit b20b0368c614c609badfe16fbd113dfb4780acd9 upstream.
    
    commit f1a7941243c1 ("mm: convert mm's rss stats into percpu_counter")
    introduces a memory leak by missing a call to destroy_context() when a
    percpu_counter fails to allocate.
    
    Before introducing the per-cpu counter allocations, init_new_context() was
    the last call that could fail in mm_init(), and thus there was no need to
    ever invoke destroy_context() in the error paths.  Adding the following
    percpu counter allocations adds error paths after init_new_context(),
    which means its associated destroy_context() needs to be called when
    percpu counters fail to allocate.

    afa965a45e01 ("drm/rockchip: vop2: fix suspend/resume") uses
    regmap_reinit_cache() to fix the suspend/resume issue with the VOP2

    regcache_sync() instead. As the original patch is already applied
    fix this up in this follow-up patch.

    commit afa965a45e01e541cdbe5c8018226eff117610f0 upstream.
    
    During a suspend/resume cycle the VO power domain will be disabled and
    the VOP2 registers will reset to their default values. After that the
    cached register values will be out of sync and the read/modify/write
    operations we do on the window registers will result in bogus values
    written. Fix this by re-initializing the register cache each time we
    enable the VOP2. With this the VOP2 will show a picture after a
    suspend/resume cycle whereas without this the screen stays dark.

    drm/amdgpu: Fix desktop freezed after gpu-reset
    
    commit c8b5a95b570949536a2b75cd8fc4f1de0bc60629 upstream.
    
    [Why]
    After gpu-reset, sometimes the driver fails to enable vblank irq,
    causing flip_done timed out and the desktop freezed.
    
    During gpu-reset, we disable and enable vblank irq in dm_suspend() and
    dm_resume(). Later on in amdgpu_irq_gpu_reset_resume_helper(), we check
    irqs' refcount and decide to enable or disable the irqs again.
    
    However, we have 2 sets of API for controling vblank irq, one is
    dm_vblank_get/put() and another is amdgpu_irq_get/put(). Each API has
    its own refcount and flag to store the state of vblank irq, and they
    are not synchronized.
    
    In drm we use the first API to control vblank irq but in
    amdgpu_irq_gpu_reset_resume_helper() we use the second set of API.
    
    The failure happens when vblank irq was enabled by dm_vblank_get()
    before gpu-reset, we have vblank->enabled true. However, during
    gpu-reset, in amdgpu_irq_gpu_reset_resume_helper() vblank irq's state
    checked from amdgpu_irq_update() is DISABLED. So finally it disables
    vblank irq again. After gpu-reset, if there is a cursor plane commit,
    the driver will try to enable vblank irq by calling drm_vblank_enable(),
    but the vblank->enabled is still true, so it fails to turn on vblank
    irq and causes flip_done can't be completed in vblank irq handler and
    desktop become freezed.
    
    [How]
    Combining the 2 vblank control APIs by letting drm's API finally calls
    amdgpu_irq's API, so the irq's refcount and state of both APIs can be
    synchronized. Also add a check to prevent refcount from being less then
    0 in amdgpu_irq_put().
    
    v2:
    - Add warning in amdgpu_irq_enable() if the irq is already disabled.
    - Call dc_interrupt_set() in dm_set_vblank() to avoid refcount change
      if it is in gpu-reset.
    
    v3:
    - Improve commit message and code comments.

    bdi_split_work_to_wbs() traverses &bdi->wb_list to split work into all
    wbs.  If the allocation of new work fails, the on-stack fallback will be
    used and the reference count of the current wb is increased afterwards.
    If cgroup writeback membership switches occur before getting the reference
    count and the current wb is released as old_wd, then calling wb_get() or
    wb_put() will trigger the null pointer dereference above.
    
    This issue was introduced in v4.3-rc7 (see fix tag1).  Both
    sync_inodes_sb() and __writeback_inodes_sb_nr() calls to
    bdi_split_work_to_wbs() can trigger this issue.  For scenarios called via
    sync_inodes_sb(), originally commit 7fc5854f8c6e ("writeback: synchronize
    sync(2) against cgroup writeback membership switches") reduced the
    possibility of the issue by adding wb_switch_rwsem, but in v5.14-rc1 (see
    fix tag2) removed the "inode_io_list_del_locked(inode, old_wb)" from
    inode_switch_wbs_work_fn() so that wb->state contains WB_has_dirty_io,
    thus old_wb is not skipped when traversing wbs in bdi_split_work_to_wbs(),
    and the issue becomes easily reproducible again.
    
    To solve this problem, percpu_ref_exit() is called under RCU protection to
    avoid race between cgwb_release_workfn() and bdi_split_work_to_wbs().
    Moreover, replace wb_get() with wb_tryget() in bdi_split_work_to_wbs(),
    and skip the current wb if wb_tryget() fails because the wb has already
    been shutdown.

    kernel/sys.c: fix and improve control flow in __sys_setres[ug]id()
    
    commit 659c0ce1cb9efc7f58d380ca4bb2a51ae9e30553 upstream.
    
    Linux Security Modules (LSMs) that implement the "capable" hook will
    usually emit an access denial message to the audit log whenever they
    "block" the current task from using the given capability based on their
    security policy.
    
    The occurrence of a denial is used as an indication that the given task
    has attempted an operation that requires the given access permission, so
    the callers of functions that perform LSM permission checks must take care
    to avoid calling them too early (before it is decided if the permission is
    actually needed to perform the requested operation).
    
    The __sys_setres[ug]id() functions violate this convention by first
    calling ns_capable_setid() and only then checking if the operation
    requires the capability or not.  It means that any caller that has the
    capability granted by DAC (task's capability set) but not by MAC (LSMs)
    will generate a "denied" audit record, even if is doing an operation for
    which the capability is not required.
    
    Fix this by reordering the checks such that ns_capable_setid() is checked
    last and -EPERM is returned immediately if it returns false.
    
    While there, also do two small optimizations:
    * move the capability check before prepare_creds() and
    * bail out early in case of a no-op.

    memstick: fix memory leak if card device is never registered
    
    commit 4b6d621c9d859ff89e68cebf6178652592676013 upstream.
    
    When calling dev_set_name() memory is allocated for the name for the
    struct device.  Once that structure device is registered, or attempted
    to be registerd, with the driver core, the driver core will handle
    cleaning up that memory when the device is removed from the system.
    
    Unfortunatly for the memstick code, there is an error path that causes
    the struct device to never be registered, and so the memory allocated in
    dev_set_name will be leaked.  Fix that leak by manually freeing it right
    before the memory for the device is freed.

    The root cause is that the worker can force fallback to TCP the first
    mptcp subflow, actually deleting the unaccepted msk socket.
    
    We can explicitly prevent the race delaying the unaccepted msk deletion
    at listener shutdown time. In case the closed subflow is later accepted,
    just drop the mptcp context and let the user-space deal with the
    paired mptcp socket.

    mptcp: stops worker on unaccepted sockets at listener close
    
    commit 2a6a870e44dd88f1a6a2893c65ef756a9edfb4c7 upstream.
    
    This is a partial revert of the blamed commit, with a relevant
    change: mptcp_subflow_queue_clean() now just change the msk
    socket status and stop the worker, so that the UaF issue addressed
    by the blamed commit is not re-introduced.
    
    The above prevents the mptcp worker from running concurrently with
    inet_csk_listen_stop(), as such race would trigger a warning, as
    reported by Christoph:

    nilfs2: initialize unused bytes in segment summary blocks
    
    commit ef832747a82dfbc22a3702219cc716f449b24e4a upstream.
    
    Syzbot still reports uninit-value in nilfs_add_checksums_on_logs() for
    KMSAN enabled kernels after applying commit 7397031622e0 ("nilfs2:
    initialize "struct nilfs_binfo_dat"->bi_pad field").
    
    This is because the unused bytes at the end of each block in segment
    summaries are not initialized.  So this fixes the issue by padding the
    unused bytes with null bytes.

    ASoC: SOF: ipc4-topology: Clarify bind failure caused by missing fw_module
    
    commit de6aa72b265b72bca2b1897d5000c8f0147d3157 upstream.
    
    The original patch uses a feature in lib/vsprintf.c to handle the invalid
    address when tring to print *_fw_module->man4_module_entry.name when the
    *rc_fw_module is NULL.
    This case is handled by check_pointer_msg() internally and turns the
    invalid pointer to '(efault)' for printing but it is hiding useful
    information about the circumstances. Change the print to emmit the name
    of the widget and a note on which side's fw_module is missing.

    maple_tree: fix a potential memory leak, OOB access, or other unpredictable bug
    
    commit 1f5f12ece722aacea1769fb644f27790ede339dc upstream.
    
    In mas_alloc_nodes(), "node->node_count = 0" means to initialize the
    node_count field of the new node, but the node may not be a new node.  It
    may be a node that existed before and node_count has a value, setting it
    to 0 will cause a memory leak.  At this time, mas->alloc->total will be
    greater than the actual number of nodes in the linked list, which may
    cause many other errors.  For example, out-of-bounds access in
    mas_pop_node(), and mas_pop_node() may return addresses that should not be
    used.  Fix it by initializing node_count only for new nodes.
    
    Also, by the way, an if-else statement was removed to simplify the code.

    maple_tree: fix mas_empty_area() search
    
    commit 06e8fd999334bcd76b4d72d7b9206d4aea89764e upstream.
    
    The internal function of mas_awalk() was incorrectly skipping the last
    entry in a node, which could potentially be NULL.  This is only a problem
    for the left-most node in the tree - otherwise that NULL would not exist.
    
    Fix mas_awalk() by using the metadata to obtain the end of the node for
    the loop and the logical pivot as apposed to the raw pivot value.

    LoongArch: Mark 3 symbol exports as non-GPL
    
    commit dce5ea1d0f45fa612f5760b88614a3f32bc75e3f upstream.
    
    vm_map_base, empty_zero_page and invalid_pmd_table could be accessed
    widely by some out-of-tree non-GPL but important file systems or drivers
    (e.g. OpenZFS). Let's use EXPORT_SYMBOL() instead of EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL()
    to export them, so as to avoid build errors.
    
    1, Details about vm_map_base:
    
    This is a LoongArch-specific symbol and may be referenced through macros
    PCI_IOBASE, VMALLOC_START and VMALLOC_END.
    
    2, Details about empty_zero_page:
    
    As it stands today, only 3 architectures export empty_zero_page as a GPL
    symbol: IA64, LoongArch and MIPS. LoongArch gets the GPL export by
    inheriting from MIPS, and the MIPS export was first introduced in commit
    497d2adcbf50b ("[MIPS] Export empty_zero_page for sake of the ext4
    module."). The IA64 export was similar: commit a7d57ecf4216e ("[IA64]
    Export three symbols for module use") did so for kvm.
    
    In both IA64 and MIPS, the export of empty_zero_page was done for
    satisfying some in-kernel component built as module (kvm and ext4
    respectively), and given its reasonably low-level nature, GPL is a
    reasonable choice. But looking at the bigger picture it is evident most
    other architectures do not regard it as GPL, so in effect the symbol
    probably should not be treated as such, in favor of consistency.
    
    3, Details about invalid_pmd_table:
    
    Keep consistency with invalid_pte_table and make it be possible by some
    modules.

    LoongArch: Fix probing of the CRC32 feature
    
    commit df830336045db1246d3245d3737fee9939c5f731 upstream.
    
    Not all LoongArch processors support CRC32 instructions. This feature
    is indicated by CPUCFG1.CRC32 (Bit25) but it is wrongly defined in the
    previous versions of the ISA manual (and so does in loongarch.h). The
    CRC32 feature is set unconditionally now, so fix it.
    
    BTW, expose the CRC32 feature in /proc/cpuinfo.

    LoongArch: Check unwind_error() in arch_stack_walk()
    
    commit 370a3b8f58743eceb97c5256538d6048c26d2d03 upstream.
    
    We can see the following messages with CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING=y on
    LoongArch:
    
      BUG: MAX_STACK_TRACE_ENTRIES too low!
      turning off the locking correctness validator.
    
    This is because stack_trace_save() returns a big value after call
    arch_stack_walk(), here is the call trace:
    
      save_trace()
        stack_trace_save()
          arch_stack_walk()
            stack_trace_consume_entry()
    
    arch_stack_walk() should return immediately if unwind_next_frame()
    failed, no need to do the useless loops to increase the value of c->len
    in stack_trace_consume_entry(), then we can fix the above problem.

    LoongArch: module: set section addresses to 0x0
    
    commit 93eb1215ed794a18ba8753e0654f069d58838966 upstream.
    
    These got*, plt* and .text.ftrace_trampoline sections specified for
    LoongArch have non-zero addressses. Non-zero section addresses in a
    relocatable ELF would confuse GDB when it tries to compute the section
    offsets and it ends up printing wrong symbol addresses. Therefore, set
    them to zero, which mirrors the change in commit 5d8591bc0fbaeb6ded
    ("arm64 module: set plt* section addresses to 0x0").

    btrfs: reinterpret async discard iops_limit=0 as no delay
    
    commit ef9cddfe57d86aac6b509b550136395669159b30 upstream.
    
    Currently, a limit of 0 results in a hard coded metering over 6 hours.
    Since the default is a set limit, I suspect no one truly depends on this
    rather arbitrary setting. Repurpose it for an arguably more useful
    "unlimited" mode, where the delay is 0.
    
    Note that if block groups are too new, or go fully empty, there is still
    a delay associated with those conditions. Those delays implement
    heuristics for not trimming a region we are relatively likely to fully
    overwrite soon.

    btrfs: set default discard iops_limit to 1000
    
    commit e9f59429b87d35cf23ae9ca19629bd686a1c0304 upstream.
    
    Previously, the default was a relatively conservative 10. This results
    in a 100ms delay, so with ~300 discards in a commit, it takes the full
    30s till the next commit to finish the discards. On a workstation, this
    results in the disk never going idle, wasting power/battery, etc.
    
    Set the default to 1000, which results in using the smallest possible
    delay, currently, which is 1ms. This has shown to not pathologically
    keep the disk busy by the original reporter.

    Revert "userfaultfd: don't fail on unrecognized features"
    
    commit 2ff559f31a5d50c31a3f9d849f8af90dc36c7105 upstream.
    
    This is a proposal to revert commit 914eedcb9ba0ff53c33808.
    
    I found this when writing a simple UFFDIO_API test to be the first unit
    test in this set.  Two things breaks with the commit:
    
      - UFFDIO_API check was lost and missing.  According to man page, the
      kernel should reject ioctl(UFFDIO_API) if uffdio_api.api != 0xaa.  This
      check is needed if the api version will be extended in the future, or
      user app won't be able to identify which is a new kernel.
    
      - Feature flags checks were removed, which means UFFDIO_API with a
      feature that does not exist will also succeed.  According to the man
      page, we should (and it makes sense) to reject ioctl(UFFDIO_API) if
      unknown features passed in.

    pwm: Zero-initialize the pwm_state passed to driver's .get_state()
    
    commit 1271a7b98e7989ba6bb978e14403fc84efe16e13 upstream.
    
    This is just to ensure that .usage_power is properly initialized and
    doesn't contain random stack data. The other members of struct pwm_state
    should get a value assigned in a successful call to .get_state(). So in
    the absence of bugs in driver implementations, this is only a safe-guard
    and no fix.

    When calling debugfs_lookup() the result must have dput() called on it,
    otherwise the memory will leak over time.  To solve this, remove the
    lookup and create the directory on the first device found, and then
    remove it when the module is unloaded.

    nvme-tcp: fix a possible UAF when failing to allocate an io queue
    
    [ Upstream commit 88eaba80328b31ef81813a1207b4056efd7006a6 ]
    
    When we allocate a nvme-tcp queue, we set the data_ready callback before
    we actually need to use it. This creates the potential that if a stray
    controller sends us data on the socket before we connect, we can trigger
    the io_work and start consuming the socket.
    
    In this case reported: we failed to allocate one of the io queues, and
    as we start releasing the queues that we already allocated, we get
    a UAF [1] from the io_work which is running before it should really.
    
    Fix this by setting the socket ops callbacks only before we start the
    queue, so that we can't accidentally schedule the io_work in the
    initialization phase before the queue started. While we are at it,
    rename nvme_tcp_restore_sock_calls to pair with nvme_tcp_setup_sock_ops.

    drm: test: Fix 32-bit issue in drm_buddy_test
    
    [ Upstream commit 25bbe844ef5c4fb4d7d8dcaa0080f922b7cd3a16 ]
    
    The drm_buddy_test KUnit tests verify that returned blocks have sizes
    which are powers of two using is_power_of_2(). However, is_power_of_2()
    operations on a 'long', but the block size is a u64. So on systems where
    long is 32-bit, this can sometimes fail even on correctly sized blocks.
    
    This only reproduces randomly, as the parameters passed to the buddy
    allocator in this test are random. The seed 0xb2e06022 reproduced it
    fine here.
    
    For now, just hardcode an is_power_of_2() implementation using
    x & (x - 1).

    drm: buddy_allocator: Fix buddy allocator init on 32-bit systems
    
    [ Upstream commit 4453545b5b4c3eff941f69a5530f916d899db025 ]
    
    The drm buddy allocator tests were broken on 32-bit systems, as
    rounddown_pow_of_two() takes a long, and the buddy allocator handles
    64-bit sizes even on 32-bit systems.
    
    This can be reproduced with the drm_buddy_allocator KUnit tests on i386:
            ./tools/testing/kunit/kunit.py run --arch i386 \
            --kunitconfig ./drivers/gpu/drm/tests drm_buddy
    
    (It results in kernel BUG_ON() when too many blocks are created, due to
    the block size being too small.)
    
    This was independently uncovered (and fixed) by Luís Mendes, whose patch
    added a new u64 variant of rounddown_pow_of_two(). This version instead
    recalculates the size based on the order.

    scsi: core: Improve scsi_vpd_inquiry() checks
    
    [ Upstream commit f0aa59a33d2ac2267d260fe21eaf92500df8e7b4 ]
    
    Some USB-SATA adapters have broken behavior when an unsupported VPD page is
    probed: Depending on the VPD page number, a 4-byte header with a valid VPD
    page number but with a 0 length is returned. Currently, scsi_vpd_inquiry()
    only checks that the page number is valid to determine if the page is
    valid, which results in receiving only the 4-byte header for the
    non-existent page. This error manifests itself very often with page 0xb9
    for the Concurrent Positioning Ranges detection done by sd_read_cpr(),
    resulting in the following error message:
    
    sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Invalid Concurrent Positioning Ranges VPD page
    
    Prevent such misleading error message by adding a check in
    scsi_vpd_inquiry() to verify that the page length is not 0.

    selftests: sigaltstack: fix -Wuninitialized
    
    [ Upstream commit 05107edc910135d27fe557267dc45be9630bf3dd ]
    
    Building sigaltstack with clang via:
    $ ARCH=x86 make LLVM=1 -C tools/testing/selftests/sigaltstack/
    
    produces the following warning:
      warning: variable 'sp' is uninitialized when used here [-Wuninitialized]
      if (sp < (unsigned long)sstack ||
          ^~
    
    Clang expects these to be declared at global scope; we've fixed this in
    the kernel proper by using the macro `current_stack_pointer`. This is
    defined in different headers for different target architectures, so just
    create a new header that defines the arch-specific register names for
    the stack pointer register, and define it for more targets (at least the
    ones that support current_stack_pointer/ARCH_HAS_CURRENT_STACK_POINTER).

    net: bridge: switchdev: don't notify FDB entries with "master dynamic"
    
    [ Upstream commit 927cdea5d2095287ddd5246e5aa68eb5d68db2be ]
    
    There is a structural problem in switchdev, where the flag bits in
    struct switchdev_notifier_fdb_info (added_by_user, is_local etc) only
    represent a simplified / denatured view of what's in struct
    net_bridge_fdb_entry :: flags (BR_FDB_ADDED_BY_USER, BR_FDB_LOCAL etc).
    Each time we want to pass more information about struct
    net_bridge_fdb_entry :: flags to struct switchdev_notifier_fdb_info
    (here, BR_FDB_STATIC), we find that FDB entries were already notified to
    switchdev with no regard to this flag, and thus, switchdev drivers had
    no indication whether the notified entries were static or not.
    
    For example, this command:
    
    ip link add br0 type bridge && ip link set swp0 master br0
    bridge fdb add dev swp0 00:01:02:03:04:05 master dynamic
    
    has never worked as intended with switchdev. It causes a struct
    net_bridge_fdb_entry to be passed to br_switchdev_fdb_notify() which has
    a single flag set: BR_FDB_ADDED_BY_USER.
    
    This is further passed to the switchdev notifier chain, where interested
    drivers have no choice but to assume this is a static (does not age) and
    sticky (does not migrate) FDB entry. So currently, all drivers offload
    it to hardware as such, as can be seen below ("offload" is set).
    
    bridge fdb get 00:01:02:03:04:05 dev swp0 master
    00:01:02:03:04:05 dev swp0 offload master br0
    
    The software FDB entry expires $ageing_time centiseconds after the
    kernel last sees a packet with this MAC SA, and the bridge notifies its
    deletion as well, so it eventually disappears from hardware too.
    
    This is a problem, because it is actually desirable to start offloading
    "master dynamic" FDB entries correctly - they should expire $ageing_time
    centiseconds after the *hardware* port last sees a packet with this
    MAC SA - and this is how the current incorrect behavior was discovered.
    With an offloaded data plane, it can be expected that software only sees
    exception path packets, so an otherwise active dynamic FDB entry would
    be aged out by software sooner than it should.
    
    With the change in place, these FDB entries are no longer offloaded:
    
    bridge fdb get 00:01:02:03:04:05 dev swp0 master
    00:01:02:03:04:05 dev swp0 master br0
    
    and this also constitutes a better way (assuming a backport to stable
    kernels) for user space to determine whether the kernel has the
    capability of doing something sane with these or not.
    
    As opposed to "master dynamic" FDB entries, on the current behavior of
    which no one currently depends on (which can be deduced from the lack of
    kselftests), Ido Schimmel explains that entries with the "extern_learn"
    flag (BR_FDB_ADDED_BY_EXT_LEARN) should still be notified to switchdev,
    since the spectrum driver listens to them (and this is kind of okay,
    because although they are treated identically to "static", they are
    expected to not age, and to roam).

    e1000e: Disable TSO on i219-LM card to increase speed
    
    [ Upstream commit 67d47b95119ad589b0a0b16b88b1dd9a04061ced ]
    
    While using i219-LM card currently it was only possible to achieve
    about 60% of maximum speed due to regression introduced in Linux 5.8.
    This was caused by TSO not being disabled by default despite commit
    f29801030ac6 ("e1000e: Disable TSO for buffer overrun workaround").
    Fix that by disabling TSO during driver probe.

    bpf: Fix incorrect verifier pruning due to missing register precision taints
    
    [ Upstream commit 71b547f561247897a0a14f3082730156c0533fed ]
    
    Juan Jose et al reported an issue found via fuzzing where the verifier's
    pruning logic prematurely marks a program path as safe.
    
    Consider the following program:
    
       0: (b7) r6 = 1024
       1: (b7) r7 = 0
       2: (b7) r8 = 0
       3: (b7) r9 = -2147483648
       4: (97) r6 %= 1025
       5: (05) goto pc+0
       6: (bd) if r6 <= r9 goto pc+2
       7: (97) r6 %= 1
       8: (b7) r9 = 0
       9: (bd) if r6 <= r9 goto pc+1
      10: (b7) r6 = 0
      11: (b7) r0 = 0
      12: (63) *(u32 *)(r10 -4) = r0
      13: (18) r4 = 0xffff888103693400 // map_ptr(ks=4,vs=48)
      15: (bf) r1 = r4
      16: (bf) r2 = r10
      17: (07) r2 += -4
      18: (85) call bpf_map_lookup_elem#1
      19: (55) if r0 != 0x0 goto pc+1
      20: (95) exit
      21: (77) r6 >>= 10
      22: (27) r6 *= 8192
      23: (bf) r1 = r0
      24: (0f) r0 += r6
      25: (79) r3 = *(u64 *)(r0 +0)
      26: (7b) *(u64 *)(r1 +0) = r3
      27: (95) exit
    
    The verifier treats this as safe, leading to oob read/write access due
    to an incorrect verifier conclusion:

    The verifier considers this program as safe by mistakenly pruning unsafe
    code paths. In the above func#0, code lines 0-10 are of interest. In line
    0-3 registers r6 to r9 are initialized with known scalar values. In line 4
    the register r6 is reset to an unknown scalar given the verifier does not
    track modulo operations. Due to this, the verifier can also not determine
    precisely which branches in line 6 and 9 are taken, therefore it needs to
    explore them both.
    
    As can be seen, the verifier starts with exploring the false/fall-through
    paths first. The 'from 19 to 21' path has both r6=0 and r9=0 and the pointer
    arithmetic on r0 += r6 is therefore considered safe. Given the arithmetic,
    r6 is correctly marked for precision tracking where backtracking kicks in
    where it walks back the current path all the way where r6 was set to 0 in
    the fall-through branch.
    
    Next, the pruning logics pops the path 'from 9 to 11' from the stack. Also
    here, the state of the registers is the same, that is, r6=0 and r9=0, so
    that at line 19 the path can be pruned as it is considered safe. It is
    interesting to note that the conditional in line 9 turned r6 into a more
    precise state, that is, in the fall-through path at the beginning of line
    10, it is R6=scalar(umin=1), and in the branch-taken path (which is analyzed
    here) at the beginning of line 11, r6 turned into a known const r6=0 as
    r9=0 prior to that and therefore (unsigned) r6 <= 0 concludes that r6 must
    be 0 (**):
    
      [...]                                 ; R6_w=scalar()
      9: (bd) if r6 <= r9 goto pc+1         ; R6=scalar(umin=1) R9=0
      [...]
    
      from 9 to 11: R1=ctx(off=0,imm=0) R6=0 R7=0 R8=0 R9=0 R10=fp0
      [...]
    
    The next path is 'from 6 to 9'. The verifier considers the old and current
    state equivalent, and therefore prunes the search incorrectly. Looking into
    the two states which are being compared by the pruning logic at line 9, the
    old state consists of R6_rwD=Pscalar() R9_rwD=0 R10=fp0 and the new state
    consists of R1=ctx(off=0,imm=0) R6_w=scalar(umax=18446744071562067968)
    R7_w=0 R8_w=0 R9_w=-2147483648 R10=fp0. While r6 had the reg->precise flag
    correctly set in the old state, r9 did not. Both r6'es are considered as
    equivalent given the old one is a superset of the current, more precise one,
    however, r9's actual values (0 vs 0x80000000) mismatch. Given the old r9
    did not have reg->precise flag set, the verifier does not consider the
    register as contributing to the precision state of r6, and therefore it
    considered both r9 states as equivalent. However, for this specific pruned
    path (which is also the actual path taken at runtime), register r6 will be
    0x400 and r9 0x80000000 when reaching line 21, thus oob-accessing the map.
    
    The purpose of precision tracking is to initially mark registers (including
    spilled ones) as imprecise to help verifier's pruning logic finding equivalent
    states it can then prune if they don't contribute to the program's safety
    aspects. For example, if registers are used for pointer arithmetic or to pass
    constant length to a helper, then the verifier sets reg->precise flag and
    backtracks the BPF program instruction sequence and chain of verifier states
    to ensure that the given register or stack slot including their dependencies
    are marked as precisely tracked scalar. This also includes any other registers
    and slots that contribute to a tracked state of given registers/stack slot.
    This backtracking relies on recorded jmp_history and is able to traverse
    entire chain of parent states. This process ends only when all the necessary
    registers/slots and their transitive dependencies are marked as precise.
    
    The backtrack_insn() is called from the current instruction up to the first
    instruction, and its purpose is to compute a bitmask of registers and stack
    slots that need precision tracking in the parent's verifier state. For example,
    if a current instruction is r6 = r7, then r6 needs precision after this
    instruction and r7 needs precision before this instruction, that is, in the
    parent state. Hence for the latter r7 is marked and r6 unmarked.
    
    For the class of jmp/jmp32 instructions, backtrack_insn() today only looks
    at call and exit instructions and for all other conditionals the masks
    remain as-is. However, in the given situation register r6 has a dependency
    on r9 (as described above in **), so also that one needs to be marked for
    precision tracking. In other words, if an imprecise register influences a
    precise one, then the imprecise register should also be marked precise.
    Meaning, in the parent state both dest and src register need to be tracked
    for precision and therefore the marking must be more conservative by setting
    reg->precise flag for both. The precision propagation needs to cover both
    for the conditional: if the src reg was marked but not the dst reg and vice
    versa.
    
    After the fix the program is correctly rejected:

    mlxsw: pci: Fix possible crash during initialization
    
    [ Upstream commit 1f64757ee2bb22a93ec89b4c71707297e8cca0ba ]
    
    During initialization the driver issues a reset command via its command
    interface in order to remove previous configuration from the device.
    
    After issuing the reset, the driver waits for 200ms before polling on
    the "system_status" register using memory-mapped IO until the device
    reaches a ready state (0x5E). The wait is necessary because the reset
    command only triggers the reset, but the reset itself happens
    asynchronously. If the driver starts polling too soon, the read of the
    "system_status" register will never return and the system will crash
    [1].
    
    The issue was discovered when the device was flashed with a development
    firmware version where the reset routine took longer to complete. The
    issue was fixed in the firmware, but it exposed the fact that the
    current wait time is borderline.
    
    Fix by increasing the wait time from 200ms to 400ms. With this patch and
    the buggy firmware version, the issue did not reproduce in 10 reboots
    whereas without the patch the issue is reproduced quite consistently.

    net: rpl: fix rpl header size calculation
    
    [ Upstream commit 4e006c7a6dac0ead4c1bf606000aa90a372fc253 ]
    
    This patch fixes a missing 8 byte for the header size calculation. The
    ipv6_rpl_srh_size() is used to check a skb_pull() on skb->data which
    points to skb_transport_header(). Currently we only check on the
    calculated addresses fields using CmprI and CmprE fields, see:
    
    https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6554#section-3
    
    there is however a missing 8 byte inside the calculation which stands
    for the fields before the addresses field. Those 8 bytes are represented
    by sizeof(struct ipv6_rpl_sr_hdr) expression.

    bonding: Fix memory leak when changing bond type to Ethernet
    
    [ Upstream commit c484fcc058bada604d7e4e5228d4affb646ddbc2 ]
    
    When a net device is put administratively up, its 'IFF_UP' flag is set
    (if not set already) and a 'NETDEV_UP' notification is emitted, which
    causes the 8021q driver to add VLAN ID 0 on the device. The reverse
    happens when a net device is put administratively down.
    
    When changing the type of a bond to Ethernet, its 'IFF_UP' flag is
    incorrectly cleared, resulting in the kernel skipping the above process
    and VLAN ID 0 being leaked [1].
    
    Fix by restoring the flag when changing the type to Ethernet, in a
    similar fashion to the restoration of the 'IFF_SLAVE' flag.
    
    The issue can be reproduced using the script in [2], with example out
    before and after the fix in [3].

    bnxt_en: Do not initialize PTP on older P3/P4 chips
    
    [ Upstream commit e8b51a1a15d5a3cce231e0669f6a161dc5bb9b75 ]
    
    The driver does not support PTP on these older chips and it is assuming
    that firmware on these older chips will not return the
    PORT_MAC_PTP_QCFG_RESP_FLAGS_HWRM_ACCESS flag in __bnxt_hwrm_ptp_qcfg(),
    causing the function to abort quietly.
    
    But newer firmware now sets this flag and so __bnxt_hwrm_ptp_qcfg()
    will proceed further.  Eventually it will fail in bnxt_ptp_init() ->
    bnxt_map_ptp_regs() because there is no code to support the older chips.
    The driver will then complain:
    
    "PTP initialization failed.\n"
    
    Fix it so that we abort quietly earlier without going through the
    unnecessary steps and alarming the user with the warning log.

    sfc: Fix use-after-free due to selftest_work
    
    [ Upstream commit a80bb8e7233b2ad6ff119646b6e33fb3edcec37b ]
    
    There is a use-after-free scenario that is:
    
    When the NIC is down, user set mac address or vlan tag to VF,
    the xxx_set_vf_mac() or xxx_set_vf_vlan() will invoke efx_net_stop()
    and efx_net_open(), since netif_running() is false, the port will not
    start and keep port_enabled false, but selftest_work is scheduled
    in efx_net_open().
    
    If we remove the device before selftest_work run, the efx_stop_port()
    will not be called since the NIC is down, and then efx is freed,
    we will soon get a UAF in run_timer_softirq() like this:

    virtio_net: bugfix overflow inside xdp_linearize_page()
    
    [ Upstream commit 853618d5886bf94812f31228091cd37d308230f7 ]
    
    Here we copy the data from the original buf to the new page. But we
    not check that it may be overflow.
    
    As long as the size received(including vnethdr) is greater than 3840
    (PAGE_SIZE -VIRTIO_XDP_HEADROOM). Then the memcpy will overflow.
    
    And this is completely possible, as long as the MTU is large, such
    as 4096. In our test environment, this will cause crash. Since crash is
    caused by the written memory, it is meaningless, so I do not include it.

    net: sched: sch_qfq: prevent slab-out-of-bounds in qfq_activate_agg
    
    [ Upstream commit 3037933448f60f9acb705997eae62013ecb81e0d ]
    
    If the TCA_QFQ_LMAX value is not offered through nlattr, lmax is determined by the MTU value of the network device.
    The MTU of the loopback device can be set up to 2^31-1.
    As a result, it is possible to have an lmax value that exceeds QFQ_MIN_LMAX.
    
    Due to the invalid lmax value, an index is generated that exceeds the QFQ_MAX_INDEX(=24) value, causing out-of-bounds read/write errors.
    
    The following reports a oob access:

    regulator: fan53555: Fix wrong TCS_SLEW_MASK
    
    [ Upstream commit c5d5b55b3c1a314137a251efc1001dfd435c6242 ]
    
    The support for TCS4525 regulator has been introduced with a wrong

    regulator: fan53555: Explicitly include bits header
    
    [ Upstream commit 4fb9a5060f73627303bc531ceaab1b19d0a24aef ]
    
    Since commit f2a9eb975ab2 ("regulator: fan53555: Add support for
    FAN53526") the driver makes use of the BIT() macro, but relies on the
    bits header being implicitly included.
    
    Explicitly pull the header in to avoid potential build failures in some
    configurations.
    
    While here, reorder include directives alphabetically.

    [ Upstream commit ad8cd35c58ca3ec5e93f52a0124899627b98efb2 ]
    
    The pmk8280 PMIC PON peripheral is gen3 and uses two sets of registers;
    hlos and pbs.
    
    This specifically fixes the following error message during boot when the
    pbs registers are not defined:
    
            PON_PBS address missing, can't read HW debounce time
    
    Note that this also enables the spurious interrupt workaround introduced
    by commit 0b65118e6ba3 ("Input: pm8941-pwrkey - add software key press
    debouncing support") (which may or may not be needed).
