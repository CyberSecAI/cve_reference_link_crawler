{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the height and width parameters of a GET request.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, and other malicious activities within the user's browser.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the height and width parameters containing the malicious script, and tricks a user into visiting the URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking on the malicious URL or embedding the malicious URL in other parts of the application. No privileged access is needed to exploit the vulnerability."
