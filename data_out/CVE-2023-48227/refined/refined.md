- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Backoffice users with "send for approval" permission but not "publish" permission can bypass the restriction by modifying the request body of the "Send for Approval" request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authorization checks allow users to perform actions beyond their granted privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Users with "send for approval" permission can publish content, which they are not supposed to be able to do. This bypasses the intended content workflow and potentially results in unauthorized publishing of information.
- **Attack vectors**: Network based. An attacker modifies the request body of the "Send for Approval" request to publish the content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a backoffice user with "send for approval" permission within the Umbraco CMS.
