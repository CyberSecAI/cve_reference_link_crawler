    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient input sanitization",
      "Insufficient output escaping"

  "patch_details": {
      "changes": [
        "Added a check for SVG files and uses the `enshrined/svgSanitize` library to sanitize them.",
         "The `wp_handle_upload_prefilter` hook is used to trigger the sanitization process.",
        "Added a check for user capability 'upload_files' to control access."
