I wanted to love this plugin but unfortunately, this plugin caused my site to not be able to save. The posts after updating would just spin when trying to save. Removed all plugins one by one and it was this one causing the major issues. Lost so much time and work.

All the blocks I am looking for are available in this plugin. There are minor problems, but I solve problems with css.

### Description

The GutenGeek Free Gutenberg Blocks for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.
