I wanted to love this plugin but unfortunately, this plugin caused my site to not be able to save. The posts after updating would just spin when trying to save. Removed all plugins one by one and it was this one causing the major issues. Lost so much time and work.

All the blocks I am looking for are available in this plugin. There are minor problems, but I solve problems with css.
