### Description

The Elespare – Build Your Blog, News & Magazine Websites with Expert-Designed Template Kits. One Click Import: No Coding Skills Required! plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized post creation due to a missing capability check on the elespare\_create\_post() function hooked via AJAX in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to create arbitrary posts.
