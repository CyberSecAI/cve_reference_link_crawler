### CVE-2024-0900
**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Elespare WordPress plugin's `elespare_create_post()` function, accessible via AJAX, lacks a capability check, allowing unauthorized users to create posts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Missing authorization check on the `elespare_create_post()` function. The function is hooked to both `wp_ajax_elespare_create_post` and `wp_ajax_nopriv_elespare_create_post` actions, making it accessible via AJAX requests. The vulnerability is present in versions up to and including 2.1.2.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access or higher can create arbitrary posts on the WordPress site.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by sending AJAX requests to the `wp_ajax_elespare_create_post` or `wp_ajax_nopriv_elespare_create_post` endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site.

**Additional details:**
The fix implemented in version 2.1.3 adds a capability check (`current_user_can( 'manage_options' )`) around the AJAX action hooks. This restricts the ability to call the function to users with the 'manage_options' capability (typically administrators).
