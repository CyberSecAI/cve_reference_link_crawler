- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of error conditions when a successfully authorized device administrator updates an IPv4 ACL using the NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol, and the update would reorder access control entries (ACEs) in the updated ACL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the DMI services of Cisco IOS XE Software, which fails to properly handle errors when updating IPv4 ACLs via NETCONF or RESTCONF. This improper handling occurs when the ACL update would reorder access control entries (ACEs).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass configured IPv4 access control lists (ACLs) and access protected resources.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote and through the NETCONF or RESTCONF interfaces.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can be unauthenticated and remote, requiring network access to the device and knowledge of the NETCONF or RESTCONF interface. The attacker must send a crafted update to a IPv4 ACL that would cause a reordering of the ACEs.
