- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape user-supplied parameters and generated URLs before outputting them in HTML attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper sanitization/escaping of user-controlled data before output in HTML attributes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts that will be executed in the context of a victim's browser session. This can allow the attacker to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the victim, or redirect them to malicious sites. The vulnerability affects high-privilege users such as administrators.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting malicious URLs containing JavaScript payloads and inducing a logged-in admin user to visit these URLs, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in their browser. Also, by crafting forms with malicious values submitted to vulnerable pages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft specific URLs or HTML forms containing malicious JavaScript payloads. The victim needs to be a logged-in administrator of the WordPress site.
