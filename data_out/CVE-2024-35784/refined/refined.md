Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a deadlock between the `fiemap` operation and the `mkwrite` operation due to improper extent locking within the Btrfs filesystem. Specifically, the `fiemap` operation held an extent lock for the entire range being queried, which could lead to a deadlock if a page fault occurred while copying the fiemap extent to userspace, and that page fault triggered a `mkwrite` operation in the same region that is currently locked by fiemap.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Deadlock:** The primary vulnerability is a deadlock condition. The `fiemap` operation, which iterates through file extents and copies them to user space, holds an extent lock for the entire duration. If a page fault occurs during the copy to user space (e.g. due to memory mapping) it can trigger a `mkwrite` operation which attempts to acquire the same lock already held by `fiemap`, causing a deadlock.
- **Inadequate locking:** The extent lock was held for too long during the `fiemap` operation, creating the possibility for contention. The lock is only necessary when accessing delalloc data structures.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **System Hang/Denial of Service:** The deadlock leads to a system hang, resulting in a denial of service. The system becomes unresponsive, requiring a reboot to recover.

**Attack vectors:**
- **File I/O:** An attacker could trigger the deadlock by performing the following actions:
    1. Create a file on a Btrfs filesystem.
    2. mmap the file.
    3. Perform a `fiemap` ioctl on the file, to get extent information, which will copy it to userspace.
    4. Cause a page fault while copying the extent information (e.g. by modifying the memory region) which then triggers a `mkwrite` operation in the same memory area, causing a deadlock.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system with the ability to create files, mmap them and use the `fiemap` ioctl on a Btrfs filesystem.

**Mitigation:**
The fix involves modifying the `extent_fiemap` and `fiemap_process_hole` functions to avoid holding the extent lock for the entire fiemap operation. The extent lock is now only acquired when accessing delalloc data structures, which resolves the deadlock. The modified code will acquire the lock only for the delalloc range within the fiemap operation and when checking for the delalloc flag at the end of the fiemap operation

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided stack trace clearly shows the deadlock between `lock_extent` called by `fiemap` and  `lock_extent` indirectly called by `btrfs_page_mkwrite` due to a page fault.
- The fix is applied to the Linux kernel and backported to stable kernel versions 6.1 and later.
- The fix ensures that the extent lock is not held for the entire duration of the fiemap operation which is safe as the code keeps track of the offset in the tree.

The provided patch and commit messages accurately describe and fix the vulnerability by adjusting the extent locking scope within the Btrfs fiemap operation.
