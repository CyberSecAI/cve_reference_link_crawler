- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the WatchGuard Authentication Gateway (Single Sign-On Agent) on Windows. This allows an attacker to execute restricted management commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect authorization leading to the ability to execute restricted management commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can retrieve authenticated usernames and group memberships from the Single Sign-On Agent or tamper with the agent configuration. This does not lead to direct access to user credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the Windows system running the WatchGuard Authentication Gateway. Specifically, the vulnerability is exploited via TCP port 4114.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have already gained network access to the system running the Authentication Gateway.
