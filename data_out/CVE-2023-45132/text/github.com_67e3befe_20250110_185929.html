# IgnoreIP/IgnoreCIDR should not trust X-Forwarded-For

Critical

[wargio](/wargio)
published
GHSA-7qjc-q4j9-pc8x
Oct 11, 2023

## Package

naxsi
(NGINX)

## Affected versions

>= 1.3

## Patched versions

1.6

## Description

### Impact

Allows to bypass the WAF when a malicious `X-Forwarded-For` IP matches `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` rules.

This old code was arranged to allow older NGINX versions to also support `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` when multiple reverse proxies were present.

### Patches

Patched in [1b71252](https://github.com/wargio/naxsi/commit/1b712526ed3314dd6be7e8b0259eabda63c19537)

### Workarounds

Do not set any `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` for older versions.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H
