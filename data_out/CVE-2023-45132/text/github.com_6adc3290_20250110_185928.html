Hi

The special handling of X-Forwarded-For in runtime.c is a security hole and VERY DANGEROUS.

If the ngx\_http\_realip\_module module configuration is enabled, the NGINX $remote\_addr variable is replaced with X-Forwarded-For if (and only if) the IP packet came from any trusted host in set\_real\_ip\_from.

If the IP packet arrived from any other hosts or the ngx\_http\_realip\_module module is not enabled, processing of the X-Forwarded-For header is ignored.

Handling of the X-Forwarded-For header must be completely transparent to NAXSI

Sorry, something went wrong.

| i think the issue should be solved by checking the actual trusted list of IPs. if you have 3 reverse proxy then you should be able to know which IPs it should be in the headers and block bad requests. The original feature has always been problematic, and i do agree on the issue you are raising. |

| This problem does not exist in NGINX It handles everything correctly  But NAXSI in its current implementation additionally tries to check the X-Forwarded-For header itself and, regardless of the settings of trusted hosts, passes requests if the header contains a value from IgnoreCIDR / IgnoreIP.  For example, in our organization, internal addresses are not checked by NAXSI. Specified IgnoreCIDR 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/16 But now **any packet from any host** with X-Forfarded-For: 192.168.1.1 will be passed by NAXSI |
