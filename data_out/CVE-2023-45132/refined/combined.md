# IgnoreIP/IgnoreCIDR should not trust X-Forwarded-For

Critical

[wargio](/wargio)
published
GHSA-7qjc-q4j9-pc8x
Oct 11, 2023

## Package

naxsi
(NGINX)

## Affected versions

>= 1.3

## Patched versions

1.6

## Description

### Impact

Allows to bypass the WAF when a malicious `X-Forwarded-For` IP matches `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` rules.

This old code was arranged to allow older NGINX versions to also support `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` when multiple reverse proxies were present.

### Patches

Patched in [1b71252](https://github.com/wargio/naxsi/commit/1b712526ed3314dd6be7e8b0259eabda63c19537)

### Workarounds

Do not set any `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` for older versions.

### References

[#103](https://github.com/wargio/naxsi/pull/103)

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-45132

Hi

The special handling of X-Forwarded-For in runtime.c is a security hole and VERY DANGEROUS.

If the ngx\_http\_realip\_module module configuration is enabled, the NGINX $remote\_addr variable is replaced with X-Forwarded-For if (and only if) the IP packet came from any trusted host in set\_real\_ip\_from.

If the IP packet arrived from any other hosts or the ngx\_http\_realip\_module module is not enabled, processing of the X-Forwarded-For header is ignored.

Handling of the X-Forwarded-For header must be completely transparent to NAXSI

Sorry, something went wrong.

| i think the issue should be solved by checking the actual trusted list of IPs. if you have 3 reverse proxy then you should be able to know which IPs it should be in the headers and block bad requests. The original feature has always been problematic, and i do agree on the issue you are raising. |

| This problem does not exist in NGINX It handles everything correctly  But NAXSI in its current implementation additionally tries to check the X-Forwarded-For header itself and, regardless of the settings of trusted hosts, passes requests if the header contains a value from IgnoreCIDR / IgnoreIP.  For example, in our organization, internal addresses are not checked by NAXSI. Specified IgnoreCIDR 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/16 But now **any packet from any host** with X-Forfarded-For: 192.168.1.1 will be passed by NAXSI |
