- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Object module in Liferay Portal and Liferay DXP does not segment object definitions by virtual instance during search operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate access control and lack of proper segmentation of object definitions by virtual instance during search operations.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user in one virtual instance can view object definitions from another virtual instance by performing a search. This leads to unauthorized information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by performing a search operation within the Liferay portal.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least high privileges within any virtual instance to exploit this vulnerability. They do not need to be a part of the virtual instance from which they are extracting object definitions, but need to be authenticated to the same portal.
