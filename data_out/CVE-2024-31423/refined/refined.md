- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can perform actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users. The specific impact varies depending on the function affected, but it could include unauthorized modification of settings or data, or even privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: A user with subscriber privileges can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a registered user of the WordPress site, with at least subscriber privileges.
