  "cveId": "CVE-2021-34623",
  "baseScore": "9.8",
  "vector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The plugin used the `exif_imagetype` function to determine the type of uploaded files. This function only checks the file's magic bytes, which can be easily spoofed. This allowed arbitrary files to be uploaded by disguising them as valid image files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure file type validation using `exif_imagetype` function.",
      "Lack of proper file extension verification."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could upload a malicious PHP file, leading to remote code execution and complete site takeover.",
    "attackVector": "By uploading a spoofed image file during user registration or during a profile update.",
     "requiredCapabilities": "No authentication is required if user registration is enabled, otherwise an account on the vulnerable website is needed."
