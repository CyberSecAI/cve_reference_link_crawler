{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from a failure to properly handle errors during the splitting of extents in the ext4 filesystem. Specifically, when `ext4_split_extent_at` fails during the insertion of a new extent (due to ENOSPC or EDQUOT), the code attempts to fix the extent length, which can lead to further corruption. The original code tries to fix the extent length even if `ext4_zeroout_es` fails, leaving the filesystem in an inconsistent state.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper error handling during extent splitting in ext4.",
      "Attempting to fix extent lengths even when encountering critical errors, leading to further file system corruption."
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a kernel BUG and system crash when running fsstress with injected IO faults, due to filesystem corruption and inconsistent extent tree state. This can also result in data loss and filesystem damage.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by injecting IO faults during filesystem operations using tools like fsstress. This can occur during write operations that require splitting of extents.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to induce IO faults, which may be possible through controlled or forced hardware errors. A malicious user can also trigger this error by filling up the disk space or exceeding the user quota leading to ENOSPC and EDQUOT errors"
  },
  "affected_component": "ext4 filesystem",
  "fixed_by": "The fix modifies the `ext4_split_extent_at` function to avoid attempting to fix the extent length when the insertion of a new extent fails due to errors other than ENOSPC or EDQUOT.  The corrected code only attempts to fix the extent length if `ext4_zeroout_es` succeeds after a successful extent insertion attempt, preventing inconsistent state. This addresses the potential for filesystem corruption and prevents kernel BUGs."
