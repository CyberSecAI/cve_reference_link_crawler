Maybe there is a misunderstanding, just to clarify:

1. Oracle Java 15, 16, 17 and 18 are known to be affected
2. Oracle seems to be aware of this (see the various previous comments /
the blog post linked by the OP)
3. The CVE description doesn't reflect that Java 15 and 16 is affected
(only Java 17 and 18 is listed there as vulnerable)
4. The related entry for CVE-2022-21449 on the April 2022 CPU is also
not reflecting this (only Java 17 and 18 is listed there as vulnerable)

and that's what is currently discussed in this thread.

While i fully agree with this be aware that CVE entries could generally
contain incomplete information:

After requesting an update of a CVE entry via the MITRE CVE forum in the
past to add additional affected products for a different vendor (which
wasn't even the assigning CNA like it is the case for Oracle here) my
request was rejected by MITRE with the following rationale given:

 > A CVE description does not necessarily contain all the affected
products or versions and is not part of CVE ID requirements. The
products are documented in the CVE references.

This is also matching my experiences with various other products /
vendors and related CVE entries for these.

Exactly this.

It’s not that they didn’t/can’t verify, it’s already verified, they’re claiming those versions no longer being officially supported means they can seemingly omit them from CVE reporting.

Which is dangerous, misleading, and nonsensical.

A large part of software maintenance is managing technical debt --
and being able to walk away from no-longer-supported products is an
important part of that.
Would you expect Microsoft to evaluate Windows 3.11, Windows 95,
Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0. Windows XP,
etc for every single vulnerability discovered in newest products?

You and Jeremy arguing in bad faith here, OP didn't ask about anything like that.

The problem at hand is, someone *already did all that work*, and Oracle is *actively intervening* to have it dropped from CVE reports.

So the question is: Why is vulnerability information that already exists being censored?

If that universe were consistent, it'd be one where vendors and open
source projects issued pre-emptive CVEs when release branches are no
longer provided with security fixes.

The alternative is what projects I work on do: If the oldest
supported version is vulnerable, then assume all unsupported
versions are also vulnerable unless someone is able to find evidence
to the contrary (we basically just always list <= the oldest fixed
version as vulnerable).

Vulnerability managers' jobs aren't to make things easier for
exploit developers, quite the opposite in fact. My goal is to make
sure users know when they may be running vulnerable software and
disseminate fixes for all supported releases, where possible.

> Why is this being allowed… this is dangerous for everyone involved

Speaking from the perspective of volunteer-run open source projects
like the ones I work on, there are only so many hours in the day so
we have to limit what versions of software we can effectively test
and fix. In our case, as I said, we just assume all older versions
that that are also vulnerable unless we happen to find information
to the contrary, but I can certainly understand if others have a
policy to only bother providing information about versions they
support (and flat out tell users to upgrade to a supported version).

A large part of software maintenance is managing technical debt --
and being able to walk away from no-longer-supported products is an
important part of that.

Would you expect Microsoft to evaluate Windows 3.11, Windows 95,
Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0. Windows XP,
etc for every single vulnerability discovered in newest products?

Products that have reached end of life are clearly communicated as no
longer supported; see, eg:

<https://endoflife.date/java>

There has been discussion about releasing "end of life" CVEs that indicate
when a product goes out of support, so tooling built to compare lists of
CVEs against software that's installed and in use at a site can report on
it, but unless this is consistently applied across the entire ecosystem it
is probably not useful enough for anyone to issue them.

Of course, anyone asking for vulnerability information for EOL software
can have a conversation with the sales team from their vendors. Probably
every company has a price where they'd be happy to provide this
information to you.

Thanks

As for the corp in question, you can expect the legal/PR team is involved
for any 'perceived' damage.

Last time I checked we don't have source to review Microsoft products..
Would also make the argument that unsupported software having CVE's is an
extra wedge to force companies to update that old unloved application in
the corner!

Subject: CVE-2022-21449 and version reporting

Hi All,

Have a question for MITRE, Oracle, and folks here…

<https://neilmadden.blog/2022/04/19/psychic-signatures-in-java/>

“Update 2: Oracle have informed me they are in the process of correcting the advisory to state that only versions 15-18 are impacted. The CVE has already been updated.<<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21449>> Note that 15 and 16 are no longer supported, so it will only list 17 and 18 as impacted.”

Checking the official CVE listing…

<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21449>

It appears this is true, the reported versions in the official CVE listing, only show 17 and 18, where 15 is also impacted.

In what universe exactly are versions omitted from vulnerability reporting because a vendor “no longer supports that version”… this non-supported version is still vulnerable?

Are exploit developers expected to check against the version of the vulnerable application during their exploit detonation to ensure they’re “only infecting supported versions?”.

Why is this being allowed… this is dangerous for everyone involved save for Oracle’s own ego or public image?

Scratching my head,
Chad

```

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

The CNA that assigned that CVE is Oracle, so Oracle is the CNA to talk
to to make changes to it. MITRE won't make changes to it as they're
not the CNA behind that CVE.

Right, this is documented in the CNA rules [1]:

"8.2.1 MUST provide enough information for a reader to have a
reasonable understanding of what products are affected. If the
affected products are not explicitly listed in the description, then
the CNA MUST provide a reference that points to the known affected
products."

You and Jeremy arguing in bad faith here, OP didn't ask about anything
like that.

The problem at hand is, someone *already did all that work*, and Oracle
is *actively intervening* to have it dropped from CVE reports.

So the question is: Why is vulnerability information that already exists
being censored?

CVEs are practically *guaranteed* to have incomplete information,
no one knows all & time is limited even if something *can* be found.
No one should be *required* to determine if some
unsupported versions are vulnerable to a reported vulnerability.

HOWEVER: if important information is *already known* then it should
be incorporated into the CVE data (either originally, or added to the
relevant databases later when that becomes known). That way
the database represents a common basis for what *is* known.
That's how I interpret the quoted CNA rules:

> "8.2.1 MUST provide enough information for a reader to have a
> reasonable understanding of what products are affected. If the
> affected products are not explicitly listed in the description, then
> the CNA MUST provide a reference that points to the known affected

> [1] <https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/AllResources/CNARules#section_8-2_cve_record_prose_description_requirements>

I read that as saying that if a version is *known* then it should be included.

Of course, if Java implementations 7, 8, and 11 didn't have this
vulnerability then it shouldn't be listed (maybe it's not).
But I think it's important to note that CVE information should have
the "best information available at this time & is subject to improvement".

I don't think we need to record vulnerabilities in MS-DOS 1.0, because
I expect that to have a small deployed base. But if an old unsupported version
has a non-trivial installed base, then including known information about
them *should* be provided. If nothing else, it incentivizes organizations
to update - and we *often* have trouble getting organizations to update.

I'm skeptical that CVEs *specifically* are the best mechanism for reporting
"support has ended". But I *completely* agree with you that there
should be an automated mechanism for capturing
what is or isn't still a current/supported version, to make it easy to
answer "which components are no longer supported?". For some components
"only the latest version is supported", but that's not true for
many others. Components that will no longer receive security fixes
are a ticking time bomb.

"Bad faith" doesn't mean what you seem to think it means, unless you
really believe I'm shilling for Oracle in order to mislead or
defraud you in some way. I'll tell you straight up, though, I
personally have no connection to Oracle nor have they ever funded my
work in any way.

If you've got concerns with how Oracle handles their vulnerability
reporting, I would take that as an indication to stop using their
software. That's what I do when I don't trust someone. Expecting
MITRE to set some requirements for how everyone is allowed to report
vulnerabilities for unsupported versions of software is not
something I can get behind, though.

Yes, indeed / in know (since then) but it wasn't clear if all participants in this thread are aware of this fact.

But i just have noticed that my posting was only partly relevant for the quoted message and the question of the OP "Why is this being allowed…" because i have missed that Oracle (if they as the assigning CNA are aware that Java 15 and 16 are affected) AFAICT indeed haven't provided any reference so far about all known affected versions / products.
