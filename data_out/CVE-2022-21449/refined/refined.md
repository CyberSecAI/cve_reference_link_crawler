{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the way the Java SE (Standard Edition) handles certain types of cryptographic signatures, specifically ECDSA signatures with a specific curve.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability allows for the possibility of an attacker crafting a signature that would be considered valid by vulnerable versions of Java SE, even though the signature does not correspond to the data signed, a 'psychic signature' issue."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to bypass signature verification, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or code execution, if the code relies on signature verification to determine trust.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access is required for a remote exploitation attempt.",
	  "Attacker must be able to provide the crafted signature during verification."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a specific type of ECDSA signature to trigger the vulnerability. Knowledge of Java SE internals is beneficial."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "affected_versions": "It is known that Java versions 15, 16, 17, and 18 are vulnerable, but the CVE initially only listed 17 and 18. Oracle later clarified that 15 and 16 are also affected.",
	"cve_omission": "The discussion in the email threads shows that the CVE description is missing affected versions (15 and 16) because the vendor no longer supports those versions.",
	"vendor_actions":"Oracle was aware that java 15 and 16 were affected but did not list them in the CVE or in their advisory initially, claiming those versions were not supported and would not be updated in advisories.",
	 "cna_rules": "The CNA rules state that a CNA MUST provide enough information for a reader to have a reasonable understanding of what products are affected and if not listed must reference where known products can be found. Oracle, as the CNA, did not provide a reference listing that Java 15 and 16 were affected."
