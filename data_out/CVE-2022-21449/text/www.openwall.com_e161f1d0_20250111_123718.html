Subject: Re: CVE-2022-21449 and version reporting

Exactly this.

It’s not that they didn’t/can’t verify, it’s already verified, they’re claiming those versions no longer being officially supported means they can seemingly omit them from CVE reporting.

Which is dangerous, misleading, and nonsensical.

Chad

In what universe exactly are versions omitted from vulnerability

A large part of software maintenance is managing technical debt --
and being able to walk away from no-longer-supported products is an
important part of that.
Would you expect Microsoft to evaluate Windows 3.11, Windows 95,
Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0. Windows XP,
etc for every single vulnerability discovered in newest products?

You and Jeremy arguing in bad faith here, OP didn't ask about anything like that.

The problem at hand is, someone *already did all that work*, and Oracle is *actively intervening* to have it dropped from CVE reports.

So the question is: Why is vulnerability information that already exists being censored?
