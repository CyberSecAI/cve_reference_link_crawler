While i fully agree with this be aware that CVE entries could generally
contain incomplete information:

After requesting an update of a CVE entry via the MITRE CVE forum in the
past to add additional affected products for a different vendor (which
wasn't even the assigning CNA like it is the case for Oracle here) my
request was rejected by MITRE with the following rationale given:

 > A CVE description does not necessarily contain all the affected
products or versions and is not part of CVE ID requirements. The
products are documented in the CVE references.

This is also matching my experiences with various other products /
vendors and related CVE entries for these.
