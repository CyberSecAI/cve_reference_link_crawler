| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1705340#c0)  Marian Rehak    2019-05-02 06:06:39 UTC  ``` A reverse-shell facilitating situation due to insecure logrotate configuration leading to privilege escalation.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1705340#c1)  Marian Rehak    2019-05-02 06:14:12 UTC  ``` Created freeradius tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1705343](show_bug.cgi?id=1705343 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-10143 freeradius: privilege escalation due to insecure logrotate configuration [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1705340#c3)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-05-23 14:30:39 UTC  ``` It is possible for the radiusd user to abuse logrotate to write files in directories normally writable only by root (or other users). freeradius uses logrotate to rotate its logs, but if the radiusd user replaces its log directory with a link to another directory, he could writes file in directories where he normally could not write, possibly leading to code execution as root.  Given the attack can be performed only from the radiusd user, Privilege Required(PR) in CVSSv3 is set to High(H). Moreover, if SELinux is enabled it restricts the set of directories the attacker can writes to.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1705340#c5)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-05-23 15:14:27 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: <https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/pull/2666>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1705340#c7)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-05-28 16:21:21 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Add `su radiusd:radiusd` to all log sections in /etc/logrotate.d/radiusd.  By keeping SELinux in "Enforcing" mode, radiusd user will be limited in the directories he can write to.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1705340#c8)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-06-04 07:51:54 UTC  ``` Reference: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1705143](show_bug.cgi?id=1705143 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Privilege escalation due to insecure logrotate configuration")   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1705340#c9)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-06-11 15:26:32 UTC  ``` Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7, and 8 are all affected as the logrotate configuration does not use `su radiusd:radiusd` to copy files as the radiusd user.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1705340#c11)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-06-11 15:32:41 UTC  ``` This flaw requires an attacker to already have control of the radiusd server to perform the attack. However, an attacker who was able to execute code as the radiusd user (e.g. by exploiting a code execution flaw in the radius server) can run the attack and elevate his privileges to root.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1705340#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-11-05 20:40:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:3353 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3353](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3353)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1705340#c14)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-11-06 00:52:38 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2019-10143>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1705340#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-09-29 20:20:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2020:3984 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3984](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A3984)   ``` |  |
