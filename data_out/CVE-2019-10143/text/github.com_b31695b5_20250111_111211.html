### @cipherboy **[cipherboy](/cipherboy)** commented [May 7, 2019](#issue-441425968)

The `su` directive to `logrotate` ensures that log rotation happens under the

owner of the logs. Otherwise, `logrotate` runs as `root:root`, potentially

enabling privilege escalation if a RCE is discovered against the

FreeRADIUS daemon.

This attack avenue seems quite unlikely to me. The other alternative is making the `/var/log/radiusd` directory owned by root. It seems like the `logrotate` method is better hygiene though. Thoughts?

| [@ret2libc](https://github.com/ret2libc) " we are aware of a way to exploit this"  Uh... any thought that you might *tell* us about this? The email address `security@freeradius.org` has existed for ~20 years, and is available on the public web page. Why did you not look there?  Is it common RedHat security practice to file for a CVE, and then never tell the authors about it?  On top of that, I'm skeptical of "security" issues which require already privileged access. If the "attacker" has access to the radiusd user, then he can run the RADIUS server, and authenticate anyone he wants. That's a huge security problem, too.  So maybe you need to issue another CVE saying "someone running as radiusd can run the RADIUS server"!  I'm more than a bit surprised at this process. It's utterly bizarre to not inform the authors of an issue, and file for a CVE without giving the authors any prior notification.  We will be issuing a PGP signed vendor statement about this process, along with our opinion of the validity of the CVE.  Do you have any feedback which mitigates the disastrous process you've used here? |

| Uh... any thought that you might tell us about this? The email address security@freeradius.org has existed for ~20 years, and is available on the public web page. Why did you not look there?  Sorry for not using your security email first, but the issue was already public in our bugzilla since May 1st (<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1705143>), which, I guess, led [@cipherboy](https://github.com/cipherboy) to submit this PR upstream. It was not discovered by Red Hat as far as I know. Anyway, the comment of the commit clearly explain that the impact is privilege escalation from radius user to root and given the CVE was assigned weeks later, after the bug was public and the patch was already acknowledged and accepted upstream, I did not think an extra email was required.  [@ret2libc](https://github.com/ret2libc) " we are aware of a way to exploit this"  For "a way to exploit this", you can see the reproducer in the first comment of <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1705143>, which confirms the problem is real.  On top of that, I'm skeptical of "security" issues which require already privileged access. If the "attacker" has access to the radiusd user, then he can run the RADIUS server, and authenticate anyone he wants. That's a huge security problem, too.  As you said, the flaw has limited impact, since it requires the attacker to already have control of the radiusd user, but it let him escalate his privileges to root after having compromised the freeradius server. It is true that radiusd user compromise is already not good, but we still believe that privilege escalation from radius user to root has a security impact, which deserves a CVE.  Is it common RedHat security practice to file for a CVE, and then never tell the authors about it?  We do have very careful security response processes in place, but I agree in this particular instance we made a mistake and we could have handled the issue better. We will try to work more closely with you from now on. |
