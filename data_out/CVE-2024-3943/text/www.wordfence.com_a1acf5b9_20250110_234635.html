### Description

The WP To Do plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wptodo\_addcomment function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add comments to to do items via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
