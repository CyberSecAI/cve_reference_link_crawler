Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-25064:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient server-side validation. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from inadequate checks on parameter values during resource access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Authorization:** An attacker with login privileges can bypass access controls by manipulating parameter values. This allows them to access resources that they should normally not have permission to view.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with valid login credentials can gain unauthorized access to resources, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information.  This impact is assessed as "Low" in terms of confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network.
*   **Parameter Manipulation:**  The attacker modifies parameter values in requests to access restricted resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Login privileges:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account to log in to the HikCentral Professional system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable HikCentral Professional system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2024-25063, which involves a separate issue related to URL access without authentication.
*   The vendor has identified the affected versions and advised users to contact their local support to obtain a patch.
*  CVSS score 4.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) reflects the fact that this exploit requires a valid user account.
