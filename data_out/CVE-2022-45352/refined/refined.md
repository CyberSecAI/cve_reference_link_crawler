- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. An unprivileged user can execute higher privileged actions due to the lack of proper access controls.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user (Subscriber) can potentially perform actions they are not authorized to perform. The specific impact depends on the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by a user with subscriber-level privileges by interacting with a function that lacks proper access controls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber-level user on the WordPress site.
