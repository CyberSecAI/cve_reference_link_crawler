Sidhpurwala    2018-01-22 03:52:35 UTC  ``` Analysis:  I am not able to reproduce this on any version of libtiff shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux or with the upstream version compiled with ASAN. Currently there is no response from upstream nor any response from the reporter of this flaw.  I am going to mark this issue as notaffected, until there is more information available.   ``` |  |
