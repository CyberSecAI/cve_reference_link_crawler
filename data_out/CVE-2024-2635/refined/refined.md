Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-2635:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that configuration pages ('webappconfig.jsp') were accessible on internet-facing web servers, and these pages exposed file paths to the client. The application is vulnerable to an 'execution after redirect' vulnerability. By directly accessing the configuration file and cancelling the redirect request, an attacker could access and modify configuration parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Exposure: The configuration pages exposed internal file paths.
- Insecure Direct Object Reference: Directly accessing `webappconfig.jsp` without proper authorization bypasses intended security measures.
- Configuration Tampering: The attacker can modify parameters through the configuration file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could bypass security measures, access the application's configuration file, and modify various parameters, leading to potential system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access to the vulnerable web server.
- Direct access to the `webappconfig.jsp` file.
- Canceling the redirect request intended by the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the specific vulnerable endpoint (`webappconfig.jsp`)
- No prior authentication is required.
