Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6757:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `get_image_alt` function in the Elementor plugin. This function, intended to retrieve the alt text of an image, incorrectly retrieves and exposes post excerpt data or titles of private or password-protected posts when an image is associated with such a post.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Exposure:** The `get_image_alt` function does not properly check access permissions before retrieving the post excerpt or title. It bypasses access controls designed to protect private or password-protected content.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The function directly accesses post data without proper authorization checks based on user roles and permissions.
- **Incorrect Data Retrieval:** The function prioritizes `post_excerpt` and `post_title` if the `_wp_attachment_image_alt` meta is not set. This results in unintended information exposure if an image is associated with a private or password-protected post.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** An attacker can gain access to the excerpt or title of private or password-protected posts, potentially revealing sensitive or confidential content.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct Function Call:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerable `get_image_alt` function.
- **Authenticated Access Required:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **WordPress Account:** The attacker needs an account with Contributor or higher level privileges.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Function:** The attacker needs to know about the `get_image_alt` function and its vulnerability.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability in Elementor's `get_image_alt` function allows authenticated users with Contributor access or higher to bypass access controls and extract post excerpt or titles from private or password-protected posts. The root cause is that the function retrieves these details without checking proper authorization, resulting in information exposure.
