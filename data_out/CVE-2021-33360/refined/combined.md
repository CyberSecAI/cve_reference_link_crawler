Defend your code againstÂ SpringShellÂ in two ways: read ourÂ [blog post](https://checkmarx.com/blog/springshell-remote-code-execution-via-spring-web/)with what-to-do advice, and useÂ Checkmarx SCAÂ to test your applications.

From time to time, our security researchers find zero-day vulnerabilities in open source projects. When this happens, we inform the relevant maintaners of the package and publish our findings here only after theyâve been remediated, or when a patch is available.
