The provided content is related to CVE-2022-26833.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper authentication in the REST API of the Open Automation Software (OAS) Platform. The API allows access using a default user with blank credentials.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing authentication for critical functions (CWE-306).
- The REST API allows authentication with a blank username and password using the `/OASREST/v2/authenticate` endpoint.
- The API provides default credentials that grant access, which is not secured.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain unauthenticated access to the REST API.
- Using the API, an attacker can read configurations, usernames and groups; create new security groups and users with greater permissions; and change the port on which various OAS services listen.
- Full access to platform configurations and operations.
- Could lead to unauthorized modifications of system settings, creation of unauthorized users, and potentially complete control over the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the `/OASREST/v2/authenticate` endpoint with a blank username and password.
- Once authenticated with the default credentials, further API requests can be made to manipulate the system configuration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the OAS Platform.
- No specific privileges are required, as the default user with blank credentials can be used for initial access.
- The attacker needs to know the default API endpoint is exposed and use it to obtain a `clientid` and `token`.
