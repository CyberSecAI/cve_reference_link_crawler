Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Root Cause:** The idccms V1.35 application lacks proper CSRF protection mechanisms. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, can perform unintended actions on the application.

**Weaknesses:**
*   Lack of CSRF tokens or other anti-CSRF measures in the `infoType_deal.php` endpoint.
*   The application does not validate the origin or referrer of the request, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An attacker can manipulate data related to `infoType` configurations. The provided proof of concept (PoC) focuses on modifying settings of "news" content type through `infoType_deal.php`.
*   The impact could be data modification, potential denial of service by altering settings or other actions that the application permits through this endpoint
    .
* Depending on the functionality exposed by `infoType_deal.php`, exploitation may lead to wider compromise

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a crafted HTML form, as shown in the provided PoC.
*   This HTML form can be hosted on an attacker-controlled website or delivered via social engineering (e.g., a phishing email).
*   If a logged-in user visits this malicious page, the form will automatically submit a request to the vulnerable endpoint on the targeted application, performing the attacker-defined action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to host or distribute the malicious HTML.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the target application's structure, specifically the vulnerable endpoint (`/admin/infoType_deal.php`) and required POST parameters.
*   The attacker does not require direct access to the application server; the attack is performed via the victim user's browser.
*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting the malicious page.

**Additional notes:**
*   The provided PoC is quite detailed, showcasing the specific parameters needed to exploit the CSRF vulnerability.
*   The target application is identified as idccms V1.35, running on `http://127.0.0.1:80` (potentially a local development server) but target url was `http://idccms.com/`.
*   The `nohrefStr=close` parameter in the URL may be relevant for an attacker to avoid redirection after the malicious request.
