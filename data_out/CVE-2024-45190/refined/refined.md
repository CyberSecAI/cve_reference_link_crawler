- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Path traversal in the "Pipeline Interaction" request within Mage AI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows a user with the "Viewer" role to access and leak arbitrary files from the server using path traversal sequences in the request.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers with "Viewer" privileges can leak sensitive files on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted GET request to the API endpoint with path traversal sequences in the request path parameter allows for arbitrary file leakage.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs a valid "Viewer" role and a valid user API key to send the crafted request.
