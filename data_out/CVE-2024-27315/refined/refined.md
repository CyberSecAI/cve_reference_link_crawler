- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper error handling when a specially crafted SQL statement, designed to trigger a database error, is used in the creation of an alert.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Failure to properly sanitize or handle database errors when processing user-defined SQL in Alerts & Reports. This results in sensitive information potentially being exposed in error logs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Sensitive data may be inadvertently disclosed in error logs due to unhandled database exceptions.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated user with the required privileges (ability to create alerts) can insert a malicious SQL query when setting up an alert.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the permission to create alerts in Apache Superset.
