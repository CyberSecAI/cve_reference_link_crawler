The provided content relates to CVE-2024-8775.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Improper handling of sensitive variables loaded from Ansible Vault files. Specifically, when using tasks like `include_vars` to load vaulted variables without setting the `no_log: true` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Exposure of sensitive information in Ansible Vault files due to improper logging. Sensitive data, such as passwords or API keys, can be unintentionally exposed in plaintext in playbook output or logs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The unintentional disclosure of secrets can compromise security, potentially allowing unauthorized access or actions.

**Attack vectors:**
A malicious actor could exploit this vulnerability by executing a playbook that includes tasks loading vaulted variables without proper logging protection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to execute Ansible playbooks that use `include_vars` tasks or similar, and be able to view the playbook output or logs.
