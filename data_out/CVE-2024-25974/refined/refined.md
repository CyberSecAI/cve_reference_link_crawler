Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-25974:

**Root Cause:**

*   Insufficient filtering and sanitization of malicious files uploaded by users leads to stored resources within the Media Center that could contain XSS payloads. Specifically, SVG files containing Javascript code can be uploaded and executed by other users when shared.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject and store malicious JavaScript code within the application's Media Center. This is achieved through the upload of a specially crafted SVG file.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-uploaded files, allowing for the injection of executable code.
*   **Inadequate File Type Restrictions:** While file types are limited, the system allows the upload of SVG files, which can embed and execute JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:**  The attacker can potentially steal session cookies, impersonate the victim, or modify data.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By targeting administrator users, the attacker could gain complete control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** An authenticated user uploads a malicious SVG file through the Media Center.
*   **File Sharing:** The attacker shares the malicious file with a target user or group.
*   **File Access:** When the victim accesses the shared SVG file (e.g., by opening it), the embedded JavaScript code is executed in the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the OpenOLAT system to upload files to the Media Center.
*   **Ability to Share Content:** The attacker needs the capability to share the uploaded file with other users.
