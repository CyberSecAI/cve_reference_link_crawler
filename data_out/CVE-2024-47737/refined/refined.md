Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `idmap_id_to_name` function within the `fs/nfsd/nfs4idmap.c` file of the Linux kernel. Specifically, a missing `cache_put` call was identified when `xdr_reserve_space` returns `NULL` due to insufficient buffer space. The `idmap_lookup` function may have already called `cache_get` successfully, and the lack of a corresponding `cache_put` call results in a resource leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Resource Leak:** The primary weakness is a memory leak. The `cache_get` function acquires a reference to a cached item, and if `xdr_reserve_space` fails, the reference is not released by calling `cache_put`.
- **Missing Error Handling:** The original code had incomplete error handling for when `xdr_reserve_space` fails, leading to the missed call to `cache_put`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact is a resource leak, specifically memory. If an attacker can repeatedly trigger the vulnerable code path where `xdr_reserve_space` returns `NULL`, it will eventually lead to memory exhaustion on the server. This can degrade server performance and potentially lead to a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to make NFS requests that trigger the `idmap_id_to_name` function.
-  The attacker needs to cause the `xdr_reserve_space` call to return `NULL`, likely by crafting requests that require large or variable amounts of buffer space such that it exceeds the available buffer size.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send NFS requests to a vulnerable server.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to control the size or characteristics of requests such that `xdr_reserve_space` fails.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves checking the return value of `xdr_reserve_space` and calling `cache_put` if it's `NULL`.  It also adds an nfserr_resource status before calling the `cache_put`
- The vulnerability is present in the NFSv4 idmapping code.
- The fix was introduced by commit `d078cbf5c38de83bc31f83c47dcd2184c04a50c7` and backported to stable trees.
- The affected file is `fs/nfsd/nfs4idmap.c`.
