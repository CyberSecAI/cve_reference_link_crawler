In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: call cache_put if xdr_reserve_space returns NULL

If not enough buffer space available, but idmap_lookup has triggered
lookup_fn which calls cache_get and returns successfully. Then we
missed to call cache_put here which pairs with cache_get.
