# Session is cached for OpenID and OAuth2 if `redirect` is not used

High

[br41nslug](/br41nslug)
published
GHSA-cff8-x7jv-4fm8
Sep 10, 2024

## Package

npm

directus
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<=10.13.2,<=11.0.2

## Patched versions

10.13.3,11.1.0

## Description

### Summary

Unauthenticated user can access credentials of last authenticated user via OpenID or OAuth2 where the authentication URL did not include `redirect` query string.

For example:

* Project is configured with OpenID or OAuth2
* Project is configured with cache enabled
* User tries to login via SSO link, but without `redirect` query string
* After successful login, credentials are cached
* If an unauthenticated user tries to login via SSO link, it will return the credentials of the other last user

The SSO link is something like `https://directus.example.com/auth/login/openid/callback`, where `openid` is the name of the OpenID provider configured in Directus

### Details

This happens because on that endpoint for both OpenId and Oauth2 Directus is using the `respond` middleware, which by default will try to cache GET requests that met some conditions. Although, those conditions do not include this scenario, when an unauthenticated request returns user credentials.

For OpenID, this can be seen here:

<https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/main/api/src/auth/drivers/openid.ts#L453-L459>

And for OAuth2 can be seen here

<https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/main/api/src/auth/drivers/oauth2.ts#L422-L428>

### PoC

* Create a new Directus project
* Set `CACHE_ENABLED` to true
* Set `CACHE_STORE` to `redis` for reliable results (if using memory with multiple nodes, it may only happen sometimes, due to cache being different for different nodes)
* Configure `REDIS` with redis string or redis host, port, user, etc.
* Set `AUTH_PROVIDERS` to `openid`
* Set `PUBLIC_URL` to the the main URL of your project . For example, `PUBLIC_URL: http://localhost:8055`
* Configure `AUTH_OPENID_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH_OPENID_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AUTH_OPENID_ISSUER_URL` with proper OpenID configurations
* Be sure that on OpenID external app you have configured Redirect URI to `http://localhost:8055/auth/login/openid/callback`
* Run Directus
* Open the SSO link like `http://localhost:8055/auth/login/openid/callback`
* Do the authentication on the OpenID external webpage
* Verify that it you got redirected to a page with a JSON including `access_token` property
* Be sure all anonymous mode windows are closed
* Open an anonymous window and go to the SSO Link `http://localhost:8055/auth/login/openid/callback` and see you have the same credentials, even though you don't have any session because you are in anonymous mode

### Impact

All projects using OpenID or OAuth 2, that does not include `redirect` query string on loggin in users.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID
