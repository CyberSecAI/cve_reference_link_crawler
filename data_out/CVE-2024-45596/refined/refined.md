Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45596:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the improper caching of authentication responses in Directus when using OpenID or OAuth2 for authentication. Specifically, if the authentication URL does not include a `redirect` query string, the response containing user credentials (including access tokens) is cached. This cached response can then be accessed by subsequent unauthenticated users attempting to login via the same SSO endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Caching:** The `respond` middleware in Directus incorrectly caches authentication responses when the `redirect` parameter is absent from the authentication URL.
*   **Lack of Authentication Check:** The caching mechanism does not check if the request is authenticated, leading to the exposure of credentials.
*   **Missing `redirect` Parameter:** The vulnerability is exposed when the login request does not include the `redirect` query string in the authentication URL

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Exposure:** An unauthenticated attacker can gain access to the credentials (including access tokens) of the last successfully authenticated user.
*   **Account Impersonation:** With the stolen access token, an attacker could impersonate the legitimate user, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionalities within the Directus application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **SSO Endpoint:** The attacker targets the OpenID or OAuth2 callback endpoint (e.g., `https://directus.example.com/auth/login/openid/callback`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No prior privileges are needed.**
*   **User interaction is required**, to initiate the SSO login process and cache the response.
*   The attacker needs to access the same SSO URL after the authenticated user has logged in without a `redirect` parameter.
*   The attacker should be on the network with access to the vulnerable Directus instance.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Directus versions `<=10.13.2` and `<=11.0.2`.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in versions `10.13.3` and `11.1.0`.
*   The issue is related to how the `respond` middleware handles GET requests in the `/auth` routes.
*   The `CACHE_ENABLED` setting needs to be set to `true`, and it is recommended to use `redis` as the cache store for reliable exploitation.

The provided patch excludes all `/auth` routes from the response caching.
