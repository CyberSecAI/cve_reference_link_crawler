Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure file permissions being set during the gem build process for `rack-cors` version 2.0.1. Specifically, the files within the gem were being distributed with world-writable permissions (666) instead of more restrictive permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** Files within the `rack-cors` gem version 2.0.1 were set to mode `666` (read/write for all users). This is a violation of the principle of least privilege and exposes the files to unauthorized modification or disclosure.
*  **CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions** - The issue is explicitly related to this Common Weakness Enumeration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** The world-readable permissions could lead to the disclosure of potentially sensitive information contained within the gem's files.
*   **Data Tampering:** The world-writable permissions allow any user on the system to modify the files, potentially leading to malicious code injection or other forms of data corruption.
*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Depending on how the affected files are used in a given deployment environment, this could lead to other security vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker must have access to the system where the vulnerable gem is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have local access to the machine where the vulnerable gem (version 2.0.1) is installed.
*   The attacker does not need elevated privileges to exploit the vulnerability as the files are world-writable.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was introduced in `rack-cors` version 2.0.1 and did not exist in version 2.0.0.
*   The file permissions in the git repository were correct (`100644`), indicating the issue was with the gem packaging process.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in `rack-cors` version 2.0.2.
*   The `bundle audit` tool was flagging this vulnerability which caused issues with users not using the vulnerable version, this has been fixed as well.
