- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user-supplied input for the CLI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation leading to command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system and elevate privileges to root.
- **Attack vectors**: Authenticated local attacker using the CLI of Cisco AsyncOS for Secure Web Appliance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs at least guest credentials to authenticate to the system and execute a crafted command.
