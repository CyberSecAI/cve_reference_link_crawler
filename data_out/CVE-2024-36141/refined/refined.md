- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network based (AV:N) with low attack complexity (AC:L). The attacker requires low privileges (PR:L) and user interaction (UI:R) to trigger the vulnerability. The vulnerability occurs within a changed scope (S:C), meaning the vulnerability can affect other components or users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have low privileges and be able to inject malicious scripts into the application. They also need to trick a user into interacting with the malicious content (e.g. by viewing a page containing the malicious script).
