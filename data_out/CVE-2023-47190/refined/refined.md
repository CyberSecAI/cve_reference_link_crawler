- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Apollo13 Framework Extensions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts into the website, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads. These scripts would then be executed when visitors access the compromised pages.
- **Attack vectors:**  A malicious actor could inject malicious scripts through user-supplied input. The exact input vector is not described.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A user with contributor privileges is required to exploit this vulnerability.
