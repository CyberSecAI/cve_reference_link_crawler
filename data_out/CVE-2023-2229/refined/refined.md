Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-2229

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and lack of proper preparation in an SQL query within the Quick Post Duplicator plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the `post_id` parameter, which is used to identify the post to be duplicated, is not adequately escaped before being used in the database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL Injection. The lack of proper escaping of the `post_id` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the WordPress database.
- **Data Manipulation:** It could potentially be used to modify data within the database
- **Complete Compromise:** In severe cases, it may lead to full control over the application through manipulation of the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET/POST Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted GET or POST request containing a malicious `post_id` parameter to the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with contributor-level privileges or higher to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the target WordPress website to send HTTP requests.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code is located within the `rks_duplicate_post_as_draft()` function in the plugin's code. The `post_id` is extracted from the GET or POST request parameters, and then directly used in the SQL query:

```php
$post_id = (isset($_GET['post']) ? $_GET['post'] : $_POST['post']);
...
$post_meta_infos = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT meta_key, meta_value FROM $wpdb->postmeta WHERE post_id=$post_id");
```

The code then uses the results of this SQL query to build another query for inserting data, using `addslashes()` on the `meta_value` but not the `meta_key` and not the `post_id`
```php
foreach ($post_meta_infos as $meta_info) {
  $meta_key = $meta_info->meta_key;
  $meta_value = addslashes($meta_info->meta_value);
  $sql_query_sel[]= "SELECT $new_post_id, '$meta_key', '$meta_value'";
}
```

This exposes the application to SQL injection, as the `post_id` is not sanitized.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions up to and including 2.0 of the Quick Post Duplicator plugin.
- There is no known patch available for this vulnerability as of the provided content.
- The Wordfence article indicates that affected users should uninstall the plugin if they are not able to mitigate the risk.
