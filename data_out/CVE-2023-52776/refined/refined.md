Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper locking when accessing active pdevs (physical device) in the ath12k WiFi driver. Specifically, the DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection) radar and temperature event handling code was calling `ath12k_mac_get_ar_by_pdev_id()`, which accesses these protected pdevs, without holding the required RCU (Read-Copy-Update) read-side lock.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Use-after-free:** The primary vulnerability is a potential use-after-free condition. Because the code was not holding an RCU read-side lock, it could potentially access an ath12k_ar (access point representation) that was freed concurrently. This would occur if a pdev is removed while a radar or temperature event is being processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful use-after-free exploitation could lead to various consequences such as a kernel crash, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the reception of DFS radar detection events or temperature events.  These events trigger the vulnerable code path in the `ath12k_wmi_pdev_dfs_radar_detected_event` and `ath12k_wmi_pdev_temperature_event` functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be in a position to cause the system to receive a radar or temperature event that triggers the vulnerable code path. This would likely involve being within the range of the wireless network, and potentially crafting specific network events.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves adding `rcu_read_lock()` before calling `ath12k_mac_get_ar_by_pdev_id()` and `rcu_read_unlock()` after the access is complete in both the radar and temperature event handlers.
- The temperature event handler is described as a "placeholder," but even in its current state, it is vulnerable and could trigger lockdep splat.
- This vulnerability impacts Linux kernel versions that include the vulnerable code in the ath12k driver. The fix was backported to stable kernels, including v6.2.
