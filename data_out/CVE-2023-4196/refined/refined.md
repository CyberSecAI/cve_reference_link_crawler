Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient file extension filtering in the asset manager of the Cockpit CMS. Specifically, the system initially only prevented uploading `.phps` files. This commit expands the filter to include `.html` and `.htm` files as well.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient file extension filtering:** The system initially lacked complete filtering against potentially dangerous file types. It was missing `.html` and `.htm` from the list.
- **Potential for arbitrary file uploads:** Without a comprehensive filter, an attacker could upload files that could be interpreted and executed by the webserver if the webserver is not configured correctly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** By uploading malicious HTML files (.html, .htm), an attacker could inject client-side scripts that could be executed in the context of other users' browsers. This would allow for a range of attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** If a webserver is misconfigured to execute uploaded files, uploading php files can lead to remote code execution. This commit is preventing this by blocking the `.phps` extension.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Asset manager upload:** An attacker could upload malicious files through the CMS's asset manager interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated access:** The attacker needs to have access to the CMS's asset manager, meaning they would need to be an authenticated user, likely with specific permissions related to file uploads.

**Summary of Changes:**
The commit prevents uploading `.phps`, `.html`, and `.htm` files, which mitigates the risk of Cross-Site Scripting by blocking the upload of such files via the asset manager.

This is a clear fix for an identified vulnerability, not an initial disclosure of the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit adds `html` and `htm` to the list of forbidden extensions, alongside php extensions like `php`, `phar`, and `phtml`.
- The changelog indicates that this is a fix to prevent uploading specific file types.
