- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows an attacker with write access to the underlying system to bypass the file integrity checking system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass the file integrity checking system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to have write access to the underlying system, which would likely require exploitation of another vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must already have write access to the underlying system, usually obtained by exploiting another vulnerability.
