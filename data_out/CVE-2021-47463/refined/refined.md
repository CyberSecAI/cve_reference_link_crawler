Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2021-47463.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `page_is_secretmem()` function. This occurs because the `page->mapping` can be nullified while `gup()` (get_user_pages) is running, for example, by reclaim or truncation. The code was not checking for a NULL value of page->mapping before dereferencing it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- NULL pointer dereference
- Missing null check

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash due to NULL pointer dereference. This can cause a denial of service.
- The provided crash log indicates that the crash occurs within the `internal_get_user_pages_fast` function, which is a core memory management function in the kernel.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered when accessing memory pages backed by `memfd_secret`, while memory reclaim or truncation occurs concurrently, leading to a nullified `page->mapping` value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the execution of `page_is_secretmem()` on a page whose mapping has been nullified during the execution of `gup()`.
- This can potentially be achieved by triggering memory reclaim or truncation while accessing secret memory using `memfd_secret` via KVM.
