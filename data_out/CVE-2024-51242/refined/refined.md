The provided content describes a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in eladmin v2.7 and earlier.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `ServerDeployController.java` in eladmin does not properly validate the "ip" parameter in the `/api/serverDeploy/testConnect` endpoint. While the frontend might perform some checks, the backend directly uses the provided IP to make a connection without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The application makes a request to a user-supplied URL/IP, allowing an attacker to potentially interact with internal resources or external services.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can trigger the application to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources.
- This could lead to:
    - Port scanning of internal networks.
    - Information disclosure.
    - Accessing internal APIs or services not intended for public access.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a POST request to `/api/serverDeploy/testConnect` with the `ip` parameter set to a malicious domain or IP.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated on the application with a valid account (default credentials `admin/123456` can be used).
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application's `/api/serverDeploy/testConnect` endpoint.
