Related: [#907](https://github.com/orchest/orchest/pull/907)

Fixes: [#906](https://github.com/orchest/orchest/issues/906)

Credits to [@porcupineyhairs](https://github.com/porcupineyhairs) for discovery and fix proposal

There are a couple of regressions on `dev` that make it not possible to test all edge cases, it's something we will have to look into next week.

Sorry, something went wrong.

I expect this to cause problems because file paths can be relative and point to files above the pipeline directory. We should find all similar resolves of paths that use the pipeline step file path in particular.

[@fruttasecca](https://github.com/fruttasecca) Isn't this line always returning `false`? `os.path.abspath(os.path.normpath(path))` most likely would start with `/userdir`?
