## Descriptions

### Multiple sandbox bypass vulnerabilities in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-3341
/
CVE-2024-34144 (crafted constructor bodies), CVE-2024-34145 (sandbox-defined classes)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Script Security Plugin provides a sandbox feature that allows low privileged users to define scripts, including Pipelines, that are generally safe to execute.
Calls to code defined inside a sandboxed script are intercepted, and various allowlists are checked to determine whether the call is to be allowed.

Multiple sandbox bypass vulnerabilities exist in Script Security Plugin 1335.vf07d9ce377a\_e and earlier:

* Crafted constructor bodies that invoke other constructors can be used to construct any subclassable type via implicit casts.
* Sandbox-defined Groovy classes that shadow specific non-sandbox-defined classes can be used to construct any subclassable type.

These vulnerabilities allow attackers with permission to define and run sandboxed scripts, including Pipelines, to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

|  | These issues are caused by an incomplete fix of [SECURITY-2824](/security/advisory/2022-10-19/#SECURITY-2824%20(1)). |
| --- | --- |

Script Security Plugin 1336.vf33a\_a\_9863911 has additional restrictions and sanity checks to ensure that super constructors cannot be constructed without being intercepted by the sandbox:

* Calls to to other constructors using `this` are now intercepted by the sandbox.
* Classes in packages that can be shadowed by Groovy-defined classes are no longer ignored by the sandbox when intercepting super constructor calls.
### Missing permission check in Git server Plugin

**SECURITY-3342
/
CVE-2024-34146**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`git-server`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git-server)**

**Description:**

Git server Plugin 114.v068a\_c7cc2574 and earlier does not perform a permission check for read access to a Git repository over SSH.

This allows attackers with a previously configured SSH public key but lacking Overall/Read permission to access Git repositories.

Git server Plugin 117.veb\_68868fa\_027 requires Overall/Read permission to access Git repositories over SSH.

### Token stored in plain text by Telegram Bot Plugin

**SECURITY-3294
/
CVE-2024-34147**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`telegram-notifications`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/telegram-notifications)**

**Description:**

Telegram Bot Plugin 1.4.0 and earlier stores the Telegram Bot token unencrypted in its global configuration file `jenkinsci.plugins.telegrambot.TelegramBotGlobalConfiguration.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

This token can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Security protection disabled by Subversion Partial Release Manager Plugin

**SECURITY-3331
/
CVE-2024-34148**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`svn-partial-release-mgr`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/svn-partial-release-mgr)**

**Description:**

Subversion Partial Release Manager Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier programmatically sets the [Java system property `hudson.model.ParametersAction.keepUndefinedParameters`](/doc/book/managing/system-properties/#hudson-model-parametersaction-keepundefinedparameters) whenever a build is triggered from a release tag with the 'Svn-Partial Release Manager' SCM.
Doing so disables the fix for [SECURITY-170 / CVE-2016-3721](/security/advisory/2016-05-11/#arbitrary-build-parameters-are-passed-to-build-scripts-as-environment-variables).

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
