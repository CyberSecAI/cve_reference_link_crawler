# DoS vulnerability in otelgrpc (uncontrolled resource consumption) due to unbound cardinality metrics

High

[pellared](/pellared)
published
GHSA-8pgv-569h-w5rw
Nov 10, 2023

## Package

gomod

go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/google.golang.org/grpc/otelgrpc
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 0.46.0

## Patched versions

0.46.0

## Description

### Summary

The grpc Unary Server Interceptor [opentelemetry-go-contrib/instrumentation/google.golang.org/grpc/otelgrpc/interceptor.go](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/blob/9d4eb7e7706038b07d33f83f76afbe13f53d171d/instrumentation/google.golang.org/grpc/otelgrpc/interceptor.go#L327)

```
// UnaryServerInterceptor returns a grpc.UnaryServerInterceptor suitable
// for use in a grpc.NewServer call.
func UnaryServerInterceptor(opts ...Option) grpc.UnaryServerInterceptor {

```

out of the box adds labels

* `net.peer.sock.addr`
* `net.peer.sock.port`

that have unbound cardinality. It leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are sent.

### Details

An attacker can easily flood the peer address and port for requests.

### PoC

Apply the attached patch to the example and run the client multiple times. Observe how each request will create a unique histogram and how the memory consumption increases during it.

### Impact

In order to be affected, the program has to configure a metrics pipeline, use [UnaryServerInterceptor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/blob/9d4eb7e7706038b07d33f83f76afbe13f53d171d/instrumentation/google.golang.org/grpc/otelgrpc/interceptor.go#L327), and does not filter any client IP address and ports via middleware or proxies, etc.

### Others

It is similar to already reported vulnerabilities.

* [GHSA-cg3q-j54f-5p7p](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cg3q-j54f-5p7p "GHSA-cg3q-j54f-5p7p") ([prometheus/client\_golang](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang))

### Workaround for affected versions

As a workaround to stop being affected, a view removing the attributes can be used.

The other possibility is to disable grpc metrics instrumentation by passing [`otelgrpc.WithMeterProvider`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/blob/instrumentation/google.golang.org/grpc/otelgrpc/v0.45.0/instrumentation/google.golang.org/grpc/otelgrpc/config.go#L138) option with [`noop.NewMeterProvider`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/noop#NewMeterProvider).

### Solution provided by upgrading

In PR [#4322](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/pull/4322), to be released with v0.46.0, the attributes were removed.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
