**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The gRPC Unary Server Interceptor automatically adds `net.peer.sock.addr` and `net.peer.sock.port` labels to metrics. These labels have unbound cardinality, meaning a malicious attacker can flood requests with unique peer addresses and ports. This will cause the server to potentially exhaust memory as each unique address/port combination creates a new metric series, leading to a denial of service (DoS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled resource consumption due to unbounded cardinality metrics.
- Lack of input validation or sanitization of peer address and port.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion on the server.
- Denial of Service (DoS), making the service unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a large number of gRPC requests to the server with different source IP addresses and ports.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send gRPC requests to the vulnerable server.
- No special privileges are required.
- Attack can be launched remotely over the network.
