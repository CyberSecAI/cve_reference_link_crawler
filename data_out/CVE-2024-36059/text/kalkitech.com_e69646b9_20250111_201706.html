SUMMARY

A security vulnerability reported in the ASE61850 IEDSmart product, allows an attacker to read
arbitrary files in and write files back to the host Computer. The attack requires network access to the
Computer and knowledge of its IP address, as well as knowledge of IEC61850 File Transfer protocols
and its implementation. The attack exploits the lack of Path Traversal control in the product when
performing File Reads/Writes using the IEC61850 Protocol, thus allowing RCE (Remote Code
Execution) and Arbitrary File read in the host Computer. The file access is limited to the privilege of
the user executing the application

Kalkitech/ASE provides an upgraded version that secures the File Transfer operation and eliminates
this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects all release versions upto and including version 2.3.5 of the
product

SEVERITY

The vulnerability has been assessed using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System v2 and has the
following characteristics

CVSS Base Score: 9.0

Impact Subscore: 9.5

Exploitability Subscore: 8.6

CVSS Temporal Score: 7.4

CVSS Environmental Score: NA

Modified Impact Subscore: NA

Overall CVSS Score: 7.4

CVSS V2 Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:P/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

The product simulates IEC61850 Server devices and supports the IEC61850 File Transfer service
allowing Client applications to read/write files in the Simulated device’s FileStore. The product
provides a FileStore location in the Computer’s disk. The vulnerability is caused due to not
restricting/controlling the file path used by a client application to read and write files to the product.
The exploit requires network access to the device and knowledge of its IP address as well as
knowledge of IEC61850 Protocol and its implementation.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS

Products: ASE61850 IEDSmart, all released versions upto and including version 2.3.5.
