- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of path traversal control when performing file reads/writes using the IEC61850 protocol. The product does not restrict the file path used by a client application to read and write files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path Traversal vulnerability, allowing arbitrary file read and potentially remote code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the host computer, write files to the host computer, and potentially achieve remote code execution (RCE). File access is limited to the privileges of the user executing the application.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the device, knowledge of its IP address, and knowledge of IEC61850 File Transfer protocols and their implementation are required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device, know its IP address, and be familiar with the IEC61850 protocol and its file transfer implementation.
