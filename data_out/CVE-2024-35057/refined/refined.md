Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-35057:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The primary vulnerability is the use of the `eval` function to evaluate Python code provided as input in multiple places within the AIT-Core framework. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary Python code that will be executed by the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsafe use of `eval`:** The framework uses the `eval` function to evaluate Python expressions in the API wait function (`ait/core/api.py`) and in Telemetry packet expressions (`ait/core/tlm.py`).
- **Local Code Execution:**  The vulnerability can be exploited by providing malicious Python code through these vulnerable points.
- **Insecure by Design**: The design allows arbitrary python code to be executed via configuration or API calls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation leads to local code execution on the system running AIT-Core.
- **Command Injection:** The attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands.
- **Lateral Movement:** The attacker can potentially move laterally within the network by compromising the AIT-Core system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the context the code is executed in, it could also lead to privilege escalation, where the attacker can gain higher access rights.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Remote Code Execution:** When coupled with unencrypted ZMQ communication, a MITM attacker can inject malicious code via manipulated telemetry packets, leading to RCE on both hosts in communication

**Attack Vectors:**
- **API:** Calling the wait function with a malicious string expression.
- **Telemetry:** Modifying packet definitions to include malicious python expressions which are evaluated when the packet is used.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Intercepting and modifying telemetry packets when the ZMQ communication is unencrypted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** To exploit the `eval` vulnerabilities directly, the attacker needs the ability to modify configuration files (such as the telemetry packet definitions) or interact with the API of the AIT-Core system, possibly through a compromised account or internal system access.
- **Network Position:** For a Man-in-the-Middle attack, the attacker needs to be positioned within the network to intercept and modify the network traffic between the AIT-Core server and telemetry sources.
- **No authentication or user interaction:** The vulnerabilities do not require authentication and do not require user interaction to be exploited.

**Additional Details**
- The linkedIn article provides a very detailed description of the multiple vulnerabilities in AIT-Core, including specific code snippets illustrating the exploitable `eval` calls, and example malicious payloads.
- It also elaborates on how the `pickle` and `yaml` libraries are insecure by default when used to load untrusted data.
- The article also shows the complete workflow of the man-in-the-middle RCE attack, going from packet sniffing, to payload crafting and actual exploitation.
