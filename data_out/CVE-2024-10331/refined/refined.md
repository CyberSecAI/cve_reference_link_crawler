Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `search-vehicle.php` script of the PHPGurukul Vehicle Record System Project V1.0. Specifically, the `searchinputdata` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`searchinputdata`) into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the database queries.
  - Several types of SQL injection are possible: boolean-based blind, stacked queries, time-based blind, and UNION query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary SQL Query Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive data stored in the database, modifying or deleting data, or even taking control of the database server.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker could retrieve sensitive data, including usernames, passwords, or other confidential information from the database.
- **Data Manipulation/Deletion:** An attacker could modify or delete records in the database leading to integrity and availability issues.
- **Potential Full Takeover:** In some cases, an attacker might be able to escalate privileges and gain complete control over the database and possibly the server it's running on.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a POST request to the `/vehiclerecordsystem/admin/search-vehicle.php` endpoint.
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `searchinputdata` parameter within the POST request is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests (e.g., using Burp Suite or similar tools) to inject malicious SQL code into the `searchinputdata` parameter.
- No authentication is mentioned as a prerequisite.

**Technical Details:**

The report includes specific SQL injection payloads used for testing:

   - Boolean-based blind: `searchinputdata=Toyota' AND 9682=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (9682=9682) THEN 9682 ELSE (SELECT 4515 UNION SELECT 4759) END))-- -&Submit=Submit`
   - Stacked queries: `searchinputdata=Toyota';SELECT SLEEP(5)#&Submit=Submit`
   - Time-based blind: `searchinputdata=Toyota' AND (SELECT 1666 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))emnV)-- IHIs&Submit=Submit`
   - UNION query:  `searchinputdata=Toyota' UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x7178787171,0x76436f6e5676554f61466d68685870657577464f49704d45456f43534d756a565166494b7a72526f,0x716b707071),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL-- -&Submit=Submit`
The report also confirms the backend is MySQL version 8.3.0.
