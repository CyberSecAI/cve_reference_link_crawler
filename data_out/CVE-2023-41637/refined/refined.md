Root cause of vulnerability: The application allows users to upload files, including HTML files containing malicious JavaScript code. These files are stored and can be attached to emails, leading to the execution of the injected script when the email content is viewed.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization and validation of uploaded files.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities. The vulnerability is exploitable by any authenticated user.

Attack vectors: 
1.  Navigate to "Patrimonio" -> "Comunicazione" -> "Modelli Comunicazione" and click the "Ente" icon.
2.  Click on the "Carica Immagine..." link.
3.  Upload an HTML file containing the malicious payload  `<html><body><script>alert(document.domain)</script></body></html>`.
4.  Select the uploaded file.
5.  Save the modified model.
6. The XSS payload will be executed when the email model is viewed by other users.

Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs a valid account in the vulnerable RealGimm application to upload files.
