- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition in the AutomationManager.AgentService.exe application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly synchronize access to a shared resource (the C:\ProgramData\N-Able Technologies\AutomationManager\Temp directory) during file operations, leading to a TOCTOU race condition. Specifically, an attacker can create a pseudo-symlink in the temp directory after the application checks for the file and before it uses the file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a local, unprivileged attacker to gain SYSTEM level privileges by manipulating the process to perform arbitrary file deletions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local unprivileged user and possess the knowledge to perform a TOCTOU race condition attack, including the creation of pseudo-symlinks.
