The provided content is related to CVE-2024-26932.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a double-free vulnerability in the `tcpm_port_unregister_pd()` function within the USB Type-C Power Delivery (PD) subsystem of the Linux kernel. The same memory allocated for PD capabilities is freed twice. First, by `pd_capabilities_release()` and second by `tcpm_port_unregister_pd()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double-free vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash due to double-free, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when unregistering PD capabilities in tcpm. This can occur during device removal/unloading.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to trigger the unregistration of USB Type-C PD capabilities. This likely requires some form of local access to the system, or physical connection/disconnection of a USB device.
