### @adhintz **[adhintz](/adhintz)** commented [Jun 25, 2024](#issue-2373642441)

The polyfill.io website has been reported to serve malicious code. ([reference](https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack) and [GitHub issue](https://github.com/polyfillpolyfill/polyfill-service/issues/2873#issuecomment-2143228377))

I do not think there is a need for these es6 polyfills because es6 has been supported in browsers for the past 9 years.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| pdoc 14.5.1 is out. Advisory is at [GHSA-5vgj-ggm4-fg62](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/security/advisories/GHSA-5vgj-ggm4-fg62 "GHSA-5vgj-ggm4-fg62"), I've requested a CVE from GitHub. Thank you again for the report!  I will now do some digging how this made it in the in the first place. I typically avoid CDNs where possible, but I vaguely recall that this was tricky with MathJax. |

| After doing some more digging, we included polyfill.io here because that is what's recommended on <https://www.mathjax.org/#gettingstarted>. I've flagged the latest developments at [mathjax/MathJax-docs#334](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-docs/issues/334).  We're still using jsdelivr for MathJax and Mermaid diagrams if those features are enabled (they are off by default). I'm much less worried about jsdelivr, but we should take a look again if there is a good way for us to embed both of them into pdoc without massively bloating our output. |
