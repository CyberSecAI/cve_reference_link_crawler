Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-0634

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of authorization checks and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the `ta_insert_external_image` action within the ThirstyAffiliates WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to verify if the user initiating the `ta_insert_external_image` action has the necessary permissions to perform this action. This allows even low-privileged users (like Subscribers) to trigger the action.
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The plugin lacks CSRF protection, meaning an attacker can craft a malicious request that, when executed by an authenticated user, will perform the unauthorized action.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to:
*   Upload arbitrary images from external URLs to the affiliate links.
*   This can potentially lead to malicious content being displayed on the website via the affiliate links, or to defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Missing Authorization:** A low-privileged user (Subscriber or above) can directly send a crafted request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   **CSRF:** An attacker can trick a logged-in user into executing the malicious `ta_insert_external_image` request, typically by embedding the crafted request in a link or webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **For missing authorization**: The attacker needs to be a user with at least "Subscriber" role.
*   **For CSRF**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious link or page they control. The user must have an active, valid session with the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**
The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates the vulnerability with a curl command that shows how to add an image from an external URL using the `ta_insert_external_image` action to a specific affiliate link (`link_id=5`). It highlights that no authorization is checked, allowing even low privileged user to do so.

**Affected versions:**
ThirstyAffiliates plugin versions before 3.10.5 are affected.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.10.5 of the ThirstyAffiliates plugin, which implemented authorization and CSRF checks.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided content includes a CVSS score of 3.1 (low), which corresponds to the impact of only low impact to integrity, but does not take into account the possibility of using the uploaded image to perform further attacks.
