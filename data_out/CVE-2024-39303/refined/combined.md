# Improper sanitization of project backups

Moderate

[nijel](/nijel)
published
GHSA-jfgp-674x-6q4p
Jul 1, 2024

## Package

pip

Weblate
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=4.14,<5.6.2

## Patched versions

5.6.2

## Description

### Impact

Weblate didn't correctly validate filenames when restoring project backup. It may be possible to gain unauthorized access to

files on the server using a crafted ZIP file.

### Patches

This issue has been addressed in Weblate 5.6.2 via [b6a7eac](https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate/commit/b6a7eace155fa0feaf01b4ac36165a9c5e63bfdd).

### Workarounds

Do not allow project creation to untrusted users.

### References

Thanks to Bryan Cahill for bringing this issue to our attention.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open a topic in [discussions](https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate/discussions)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-39303
