- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the HTML field of the Mautic form editor.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-80).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with the ability to edit a Mautic form can inject malicious JavaScript code into the HTML field, leading to the execution of the script in the context of other users' browsers. This could allow the attacker to steal sensitive information from the user's current session.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered when a user views a form with the malicious script embedded within it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to edit a Mautic form. This usually implies high privileges within the Mautic system.
