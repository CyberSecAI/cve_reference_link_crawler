{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a racy path_noexec check within the execve system call. The check, intended to prevent execution of files with the noexec flag set, is performed after the may_open() check. Since the noexec flag can be set concurrently, the check can trigger unwarranted warnings, especially when it races with the flag being set.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition in path_noexec check",
       "Redundant permission checks",
       "Unwarranted warnings"
    ],
    "impact": "The primary impact is the generation of spurious warnings in the kernel logs. It does not allow an attacker to bypass any security mechanism or escalate privilege.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local attacker with the ability to execute files could potentially trigger the race condition by concurrently modifying the noexec flag.",
    "required_capabilities": "Local access with the ability to execute files and manipulate their noexec attribute.",
    "details": "The code uses WARN_ON_ONCE to signal if the inode isn't regular or has the path_noexec flag, this code was introduced as a debugging artifact after moving the checks to an earlier stage of the execve process. The path_noexec check occurs after the may_open check which is intended to prevent execution of files with the noexec flag set. The spurious path_noexec check is racy due to concurrent modification of the noexec flag. The issue was resolved by removing the WARN_ON_ONCE macro and thus disabling the logging.",
