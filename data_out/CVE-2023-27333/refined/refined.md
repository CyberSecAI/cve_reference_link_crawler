- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer in the handling of command 0x422 within the `tmpServer` service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a network-adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected TP-Link Archer AX21 router.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted command (0x422) to the `tmpServer` service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the vulnerable device and must have valid authentication credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
