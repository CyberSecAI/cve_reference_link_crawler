We increasingly rely on internet connected devices in our day-to-day lives, with consumer devices that include door bell cameras, thermostats, children’s toys and home assistants. However the cyber security of these devices doesn’t always live up to the trust we place in them to reliability perform their function and protect our personal data. It’s often …

The Good Penguin is and has always been a fully-remote business with our employees based all across the UK. Being fully-remote allows us to hire the best engineers wherever they may be found – a significant benefit given the rare to find skills that are required for the specialist work we do.

Earlier this year, our founder Andrew Murray presented a talk at the Embedded Open Source Summit 2024 in Seattle. The talk was about SD cards, their performance and reliability. The synopsis of the talk follows: “The underlying storage of an SD card is NAND flash, which is inherently unreliable, has a limited number of program/erase …

Code signing is fairly ubiquitous and is a cryptographic technique for verifying the authenticity of a binary. It is often used as part of the secure boot process of an embedded device where software components of the bootchain are verified by the previous component.

The latest Long Term Support (LTS) version of Yocto was released last month with the code name “Scarthgap” – presumably named after a mountain pass in the Lake District national park.
