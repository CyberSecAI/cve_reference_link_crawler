### Details

This section provides a summary of potential vulnerabilities that this security update addresses and their impact. Descriptions use [CWE™](https://cwe.mitre.org/), and base scores and vectors use [CVSS v3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/user-guide) standards.

| **CVE ID** | **Description** | **Base Score** | **Vector** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE‑2021‑34401 | NVIDIA Linux kernel distributions contain a vulnerability in `nvmap` `NVGPU_IOCTL_CHANNEL_SET_ERROR_NOTIFIER`, where improper access control may lead to code execution, compromised integrity, or denial of service. The scope impact may extend to other components. | 8.8 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE‑2021‑4034 | NVIDIA Jetson sample file system contains a vulnerability related in polkit's `pkexec` utility which can lead to local privilege escalation, causing impact to data confidentiality, data integrity, and service availability. | 7.8 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE‑2022‑21819 | NVIDIA distributions of Jetson Linux contain a vulnerability where an error in the IOMMU configuration may allow an unprivileged attacker with physical access to the board direct read/write access to the entire system address space through the PCI bus. Such an attack could result in denial of service, code execution, escalation of privileges, and impact to data integrity and confidentiality. The scope impact may extend to other components. | 7.6 | [AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |

The NVIDIA risk assessment is based on an average of risk across a diverse set of installed systems and may not represent the true risk to your local installation. NVIDIA recommends evaluating the risk to your specific configuration.
