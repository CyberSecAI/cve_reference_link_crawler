- Root cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper authorization checks on the `/user` endpoint of the web management platform.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Unauthorized access vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: Attackers can gain unauthorized access, potentially leading to modification of permissions and password changes.
- Attack vectors: Sending a crafted script to the `csl/user` component by accessing the  `~/user` URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable web management platform of the attendance machine.
