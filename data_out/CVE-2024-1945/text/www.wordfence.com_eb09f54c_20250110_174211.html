### Description

The Contact Form, Survey & Popup Form Plugin for WordPress – ARForms Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'arflite\_remove\_preview\_data' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access and above, to delete arbitrary site options, resulting in loss of availability.
