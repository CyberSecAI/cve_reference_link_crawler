  "cveId": "CVE-2024-50038",
  "description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from netfilter modules registering to the `NFPROTO_UNSPEC` protocol family, while assuming IPv4/IPv6 packet processing. This allows direct users of the set/getsockopt interface to call into targets/matches that were intended for use with ip(6)tables, leading to unexpected behavior and potential crashes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect protocol family registration",
      "Lack of input validation",
        "Type confusion/incorrect assumption of skb context"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially cause a kernel crash or undefined behavior by crafting packets that reach the vulnerable netfilter modules through unexpected code paths.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Direct calls to the set/getsockopt interface",
      "Abuse of ebtables"
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to configure network rules, which usually requires root or admin privileges on the local machine. Additionally, the attacker needs to trigger the vulnerable modules using ebtables (or direct calls to the setsockopt API).",
    "additionalDetails": "The issue is triggered when modules that are only designed to process IPv4 or IPv6 packets are called by code that does not provide the necessary context (such as ebtables). This results in unexpected access patterns (e.g. calling skb_network_header() when the underlying packet doesn't have an IPv4 or IPv6 header) or type mismatches (e.g. the different meaning of XT_CONTINUE and EBT_CONTINUE). The patch modifies the affected modules to register with `NFPROTO_IPV4` and `NFPROTO_IPV6` instead of `NFPROTO_UNSPEC`, thus limiting their scope. The `MARK` target is an exception, which is also used by arptables, so it registers for `NFPROTO_ARP` too. Additionally, the patch includes a check to bail out if `connbytes` fails to enable the corresponding conntrack family."
