Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-32061:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated structure. This occurs when parsing specially crafted IGS files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read:** The software reads data beyond the boundaries of an allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Application Crash:** Opening a malicious file could lead to application crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Parsing:** The vulnerability is triggered when the application parses a specially crafted IGS file.
- **User Interaction:** An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious IGS file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or obtain a specially crafted IGS file.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into opening the crafted IGS file using the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was assigned the identifier ZDI-CAN-21566 by Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative
- The vulnerability is present in "Simcenter Femap" and "PS/IGES Parasolid Translator Component"
- The vulnerability is present in all versions prior to V2406 for "Simcenter Femap" and all versions prior to V27.1.215 for "PS/IGES Parasolid Translator Component"
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by not opening untrusted IGS files in the affected applications.
