Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36088:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-double-free in the `flb_parser_json_do` function within the JSON parser of Fluent Bit. This occurs when a specific condition causes the function to attempt to free the same memory block twice.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Double-Free:** The primary vulnerability is a double-free condition. This occurs when the code attempts to free a memory block that has already been released.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Crash:** Exploiting this double-free leads to a crash of the Fluent Bit application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a specific input that leads to the double-free condition in the JSON parser.
- The specific input that triggers the vulnerability involves a `NULL` pointer within the parsed data structure. This results in the function attempting to free already freed memory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to provide input to Fluent Bit that is processed by the vulnerable JSON parser.
- Specific knowledge of the vulnerability is not required to trigger it, as demonstrated by the OSS-Fuzz report.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was identified by OSS-Fuzz.
- The fix was implemented in commit `22346a74c07ceb90296be872be2d53eb92252a54`.
- The vulnerability affects versions of Fluent Bit between `v1.7.0` and `v1.7.4` (inclusive), including several release candidates.
- The vulnerability is considered to have a high severity.
- The fix also involves commit `9b4d9ee0f9d42383bad593b05b95f25e8b294c71`.
