| CVSS Rating: [CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  A security issue was discovered in the Kubernetes Image Builder where default credentials are enabled during the image build process when using the Nutanix, OVA, QEMU or raw providers. The credentials can be used to gain root access. The credentials are disabled at the conclusion of the image build process. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if their nodes use VM images created via the Image Builder project. Am I vulnerable? Clusters using virtual machine images built with Kubernetes Image Builder (<https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder>) version v0.1.37 or earlier are affected if built with the Nutanix, OVA, QEMU or raw providers. These images were vulnerable during the image build process and are affected only if an attacker was able to reach the VM where the image build was happening and used the vulnerability to modify the image at the time the image build was occurring.  VMs using images built with the Proxmox provider are affected by a related, but much more serious vulnerability (see [#128006](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128006)).  VMs using images built with all other providers are not affected by this issue.  To determine the version of Image Builder you are using, use one of the following methods:   * For git clones of the image builder repository:  ```     cd <local path to image builder repo>     make version  ```  * For installations using a tarball download:  ```     cd <local path to install location>     grep -o v0\\.[0-9.]* RELEASE.md | head -1  ```  * For a container image release:   `docker run --rm <image pull spec> version`   or   `podman run --rm <image pull spec> version`   or look at the image tag specified, in the case of an official image such as `registry.k8s.io/scl-image-builder/cluster-node-image-builder-amd64:v0.1.37`  Affected Versions  * Kubernetes Image Builder versions <= v0.1.37  How do I mitigate this vulnerability? Rebuild any affected images using a fixed version of Image Builder. Re-deploy the fixed images to any affected VMs. Fixed Versions  * Kubernetes Image Builder master - fixed by [Set random ssh password for builder kubernetes-sigs/image-builder#1596](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder/pull/1596) * Fixed in Kubernetes Image Builder release v0.1.38  Detection The linux command `last builder` can be used to view logins to the affected `builder` account.  If you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact security@kubernetes.io Additional Details The fixed version sets a randomly-generated password for the duration of the image build Acknowledgements This vulnerability was reported by Nicolai Rybnikar [@rybnico](https://github.com/rybnico) from Rybnikar Enterprises GmbH.  The issue was fixed and coordinated by Marcus Noble of the Image Builder project.  /area security /kind bug /committee security-response /label official-cve-feed /sig cluster-lifecycle |

Hello Kubernetes Community,

A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where an unauthorized user may be able to ssh to a node VM which uses a VM image built with the Kubernetes Image Builder project (<https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder>).

For images built with the Proxmox provider, this issue has been rated Critical (<https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H>) (9.8), and assigned CVE-2024-9486.

For images built with the Nutanix, OVA, QEMU or raw providers, this issue has been rated Medium (<https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H>) (6.3), and assigned CVE-2024-9594.

Am I vulnerable?

Clusters using virtual machine images built with Kubernetes Image Builder (<https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder>) version v0.1.37 or earlier are affected.

CVE-2024-9486: VMs using images built with the Proxmox provider are confirmed to be vulnerable.

CVE-2024-9594: VMs using images built with the Nutanix, OVA, QEMU or raw providers were vulnerable during the build process and are affected only if an attacker was able to reach the VM where the image build was happening and used the vulnerability to modify the image at the time the image build was occurring.

VMs using images built with all other providers are not affected.

To determine the version of Image Builder you are using, use one of the following methods:

\* For git clones of the image builder repository:
    cd <local path to image builder repo>

    make version

\* For installations using a tarball download:
    cd <local path to install location>

    grep -o v0\\.[0-9.]\* RELEASE.md | head -1

\* For a container image release:

    docker run --rm <image pull spec> version
  or
    podman run --rm <image pull spec> version

  or look at the image tag specified, in the case of an official image such as [registry.k8s.io/scl-image-builder/cluster-node-image-builder-amd64:v0.1.37](http://registry.k8s.io/scl-image-builder/cluster-node-image-builder-amd64%3Av0.1.37)

How do I mitigate this vulnerability?

Rebuild any affected images using a fixed version of Image Builder. Re-deploy the fixed images to any affected VMs.

Prior to upgrading, this vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the builder account on affected VMs:

usermod -L builder

Fixed Versions

Kubernetes Image Builder versions >= v0.1.38

Detection

The linux command "last builder" can be used to view logins to the affected "builder" account.

If you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact secu...@kubernetes.io

Additional Details

See the GitHub issues for more details:

<https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128006>

<https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128007>

Acknowledgements

This vulnerability was reported by Nicolai Rybnikar @rybnico from Rybnikar Enterprises GmbH.

The issue was fixed and coordinated by Marcus Noble of the Image Builder project.

Thank You,

Joel Smith on behalf of the Kubernetes Security Response Committee

### @AverageMarcus **[AverageMarcus](/AverageMarcus)** commented [Oct 14, 2024](#issue-2586205181)

For providers that don't have a built-in support for random ssh keys this change makes sure that the default builder password used during the image build process is a randomly generated value.

Fixes [kubernetes/kubernetes#128007](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128007)
