### @AverageMarcus **[AverageMarcus](/AverageMarcus)** commented [Oct 14, 2024](#issue-2586205181)

For providers that don't have a built-in support for random ssh keys this change makes sure that the default builder password used during the image build process is a randomly generated value.

Fixes [kubernetes/kubernetes#128007](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128007)
