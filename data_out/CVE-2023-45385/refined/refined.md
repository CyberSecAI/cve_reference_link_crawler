- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The module "Print Shipping Labels Pro" (pqprintshippinglabels) lacks proper input validation and path sanitization when handling the 'filename' parameter in the `shipping-labels.php` file. Specifically, the code directly uses the provided filename from the request without ensuring it stays within the intended directory.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Path Traversal (CWE-22)**: The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue. By crafting a malicious filename with ".." sequences, an attacker can navigate outside the intended directory and access files elsewhere in the system.
    - **Lack of Access Control**: The vulnerability exists because the module does not implement proper access controls, allowing unauthenticated guest users to access sensitive files.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Confidentiality Breach**: Attackers can download personal information and potentially access sensitive files on the server.
    - **Access to admin AJAX scripts**: By accessing admin AJAX scripts, attackers can potentially gain unauthorized control over the PrestaShop installation.
    - **Module Exfiltration**: Attackers can download all modules to facilitate further pentesting and identify more vulnerabilities.
    - **Database access information**: Attackers can obtain the table prefix, which could assist in SQL injection attacks. This can also lead to compromised database access to login in exposed PHPMyAdmin/Adminer instances.
    - **Bypass WAF**: Attackers can bypass Web Application Firewalls (WAF) and .htaccess restrictions to access protected files, including logs located at predictable paths.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - **Network**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
    - **HTTP Request**: An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request containing a malicious filename parameter to the `shipping-labels.php` file.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - **No Privileges Needed**: The attacker does not need any form of authentication or special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
    - **Remote Access**: The attacker can be anywhere with network access to the server hosting the PrestaShop installation.

- **Patch Information**: The fix implemented in version 4.15.0 replaces `$filename = $_REQUEST['filename'];` with `$filename = basename($_REQUEST['filename']);`. This uses the `basename()` function to remove directory path components, but it is noted that this fix may be incomplete and further restrictions might be necessary.

- **Additional Recommendations**:
    - Restrict access to the module's `pdfs/` directory using a whitelist or remove the directory.
    - Secure PHPMyAdmin/Adminer instances with authentication mechanisms like htpasswd.
    - Activate and configure OWASP 930's rules on a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for enhanced protection.
