Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in a combination of missing authorization checks and the ability to bypass nonce protection in the "OAuth Single Sign On â€“ SSO (OAuth Client)" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `save_app()` function within the `mo_oauth_ajax()` function lacks capability checks, allowing any logged-in user to save a new OAuth application configuration. Additionally, the nonce protection is bypassed because the nonce value can be obtained by sending a GET request to the Setup Wizard page, which also lacks authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to properly check user capabilities before allowing access to critical functionalities like saving OAuth application configurations (`save_app()`) and accessing the setup wizard page.
*   **Broken Authentication:**  The plugin allows authentication bypass using a crafted OAuth setup.
*  **Nonce Bypass:** The nonce intended to protect the ajax call is easily retrievable due to lack of authorization on the page containing it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** By exploiting the missing authorization checks and the nonce bypass, an attacker can save a malicious OAuth application configuration with a crafted endpoint that returns a specific username, bypassing the normal authentication flow.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  An attacker, even with subscriber level privileges, can gain administrative access to the WordPress website by crafting an OAuth server that returns the username 'admin' upon resource access.
*   **Full Site Compromise**:  Potentially, by gaining administrative access, an attacker can then take complete control of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Get Nonce Value:** Send a GET request to the Setup Wizard page to obtain the nonce value.
2.  **Save Malicious App:** Send a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `mo_oauth_option` set to `save_app` including a crafted OAuth server URL.
3.  **Complete Wizard:** Send a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with `mo_oauth_option` set to `test_finish`.
4.  **Login:** Click the "Login with Other" button to trigger the authentication with the crafted malicious OAuth server which returns admin username.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site, with any role (even a subscriber).
*   The attacker needs the ability to send GET and POST requests to the WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to know the vulnerable plugin is installed and activated.
*   The attacker needs to setup a simple webserver to host the exploit script (OAuth server)

**Additional Details:**

* The exploit involves setting up a fake OAuth server to respond with a specified user login (admin in the example), which allows the attacker to log in as that user.
*   The provided example uses PHP for the fake OAuth server, demonstrating the ease of setting up the exploit.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "High" severity by Patchstack with a CVSS score of 8.8.
*  The vulnerability is present in plugin versions <= 6.23.3 and fixed in version 6.23.4.
*   The vulnerability is related to OWASP Top 10 A02:2021 - Broken Authentication.
