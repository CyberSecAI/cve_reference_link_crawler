# TYPO3-CORE-SA-2024-002: Code Execution in TYPO3 Install Tool

Categories:
[Development](/help/security-advisories/development "Development"),

[TYPO3 CMS](/help/security-advisories/typo3-cms "TYPO3 CMS")

Created by Oliver Hader

It has been discovered that TYPO3 CMS is vulnerable to code execution.

* **Component Type:** TYPO3 CMS
* **Subcomponent:** Install Tool (ext:install)
* **Release Date:** February 13, 2024
* **Vulnerability Type:** Code Execution
* **Affected Versions:** 8.0.0-8.7.56, 9.0.0-9.5.45, 10.0.0-10.4.42, 11.0.0-11.5.34, 12.0.0-12.4.10, 13.0.0
* **Severity:** Medium
* **Suggested CVSS:** CVSS:3.1/[AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)
* **References:** [CVE-2024-22188](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22188), [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html)

### Problem Description

Several settings in the Install Tool for configuring the path to system binaries were vulnerable to code execution. Exploiting this vulnerability requires an administrator-level backend user account with system maintainer permissions.

The corresponding change for this advisory involves enforcing the known disadvantages described in [TYPO3-PSA-2020-002: Protecting Install Tool with Sudo Mode](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-psa-2020-002).

### Solution

Update to TYPO3 versions 8.7.57 ELTS, 9.5.46 ELTS, 10.4.43 ELTS, 11.5.35 LTS, 12.4.11 LTS, 13.0.1 that fix the problem described.

### Credits

Thanks to Rickmer Frier & Daniel Jonka who reported this issue and to TYPO3 core & security team member Benjamin Franzke who fixed the issue.

### General Advice

Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Guide](https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/CoreApiReference/Security/Index.html#security). Please subscribe to the [typo3-announce](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce) mailing list.

### General Note

All security-related code changes are tagged so you can easily look them up in our [review system](https://review.typo3.org/#/q/status:merged+project:Packages/TYPO3.CMS+topic:security,n,z).

# Code Execution in TYPO3 Install Tool

High

[ohader](/ohader)
published
GHSA-5w2h-59j3-8x5w
Feb 13, 2024

## Package

composer

typo3/cms-core
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

8.0.0-8.7.56, 9.0.0-9.5.45, 10.0.0-10.4.42, 11.0.0-11.5.34, 12.0.0-12.4.10, 13.0.0

## Patched versions

8.7.57, 9.5.46, 10.4.43, 11.5.35, 12.4.11, 13.0.1

## Description

### Problem

Several settings in the Install Tool for configuring the path to system binaries were vulnerable to code execution. Exploiting this vulnerability requires an administrator-level backend user account with system maintainer permissions.

The corresponding change for this advisory involves enforcing the known disadvantages described in [TYPO3-PSA-2020-002: Protecting Install Tool with Sudo Mode](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-psa-2020-002).

### Solution

Update to TYPO3 versions 8.7.57 ELTS, 9.5.46 ELTS, 10.4.43 ELTS, 11.5.35 LTS, 12.4.11 LTS, 13.0.1 that fix the problem described.

### Credits

Thanks to Rickmer Frier & Daniel Jonka who reported this issue and to TYPO3 core & security team member Benjamin Franzke who fixed the issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
