Subject: CVE-2022-37400: Apache OpenOffice Static Initialization Vector
 Allows to Recover Passwords for Web Connections Without Knowing the Master
 Password

Severity: important

Description:

Apache OpenOffice supports the storage of passwords for web connections in the user's configuration database. The stored passwords are encrypted with a single master key provided by the user. A flaw in OpenOffice existed where the required initialization vector for encryption was always the same which weakens the security of the encryption making them vulnerable if an attacker has access to the user's configuration data. This issue affects: Apache OpenOffice versions prior to 4.1.13.
