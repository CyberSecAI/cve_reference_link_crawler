Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `extractImageSection()` function within the `tiffcrop` tool of the libtiff library.
*   The overflow occurs at two locations: `tools/tiffcrop.c:7916` and `tools/tiffcrop.c:7801`.
*   The issue arises during the processing of TIFF images, specifically when extracting image sections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The code attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.
*   The `extractImageSection` function is vulnerable when handling specific image cropping and manipulation operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the application to crash due to the heap-buffer-overflow. The provided ASan logs clearly demonstrate the crash caused by the overflow.
*   Potentially, in more sophisticated exploitation scenarios, other malicious activities such as code execution or data corruption might be possible but this is not explicitly mentioned.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted TIFF Image:** The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted TIFF image using the `tiffcrop` tool.
*   The provided steps to reproduce the issue show how command-line arguments `-R 270 -S 4:2 -O l -e d -U cm -m 1,2,3,4 -i` combined with specific TIFF files `poc1` and `poc2` can trigger the overflow.
*   The `-R 270` argument seems to be related to rotation, and `-S 4:2` related to sub sampling which may be a part of the trigger for this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to supply a malicious TIFF image:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted TIFF file as input to the vulnerable `tiffcrop` tool.
*   **Ability to execute `tiffcrop`:** The attacker needs to have the capability to run the `tiffcrop` tool with the crafted image.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The provided `poc1` triggers the heap-buffer-overflow at `tools/tiffcrop.c:7916`, while `poc2` triggers the overflow at `tools/tiffcrop.c:7801`.
*   The AddressSanitizer (ASan) output provides detailed information about the memory corruption, including the location of the overflow, the allocated memory region, and the call stack.
*   The `poc1` ASan output shows a `READ of size 1` at `0x6140000005f3`, which is located 0 bytes to the right of a 435-byte region, and the `poc2` ASan output shows a `READ of size 312` at `0x62e00000a54f`, which is located 0 bytes to the right of a 41295-byte region, further confirming that the overflow is occurring at the end of allocated memory regions.
*   The git log output shows the version of libtiff being used which is 4.5.0
*  The issue is related to reported issues #536 and #537.

In summary, this is a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the `tiffcrop` tool of libtiff, triggered by a crafted TIFF image that results in a denial-of-service by crashing the tool.
