  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within multiple parameters (service, method, widget_type, request_id, payload) before reflecting it back to the user in the HTML response.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page, allowing them to potentially steal sensitive information like session tokens, or perform other malicious actions by executing arbitrary code in the victim's browser.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP POST or GET requests. The malicious payload is injected through the vulnerable parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the target web server and the user must be authenticated on the AudimexEE portal."
