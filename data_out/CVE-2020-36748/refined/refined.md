  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-36748",
    "description": "The Dokan plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.0.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the handle_order_export() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger an order export via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
    "affected_versions": "<= 3.0.8",
    "fixed_versions": ">= 3.0.9",
    "root_cause": "Missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `handle_order_export()` function.",
    "vulnerability": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
    "impact": "Unauthenticated attackers can trigger an order export by tricking a site administrator into clicking a link or performing a similar action.",
    "attack_vector": "The attacker needs to create a forged request and trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated but needs to trick a site administrator to perform an action. The attacker does not need any special privileges to execute this attack.",

If this parameter is missing, the security check is bypassed allowing an attacker to perform the action."
