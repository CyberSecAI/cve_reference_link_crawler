Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-23818:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper handling of special characters in the WMS OpenLayers output format within GeoServer. Specifically, user-controlled data from the GeoServer catalog, such as layer titles or style names, is not properly sanitized or encoded when being inserted into the generated JavaScript code. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript payloads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is stored within the GeoServer application (catalog) and is then executed when another user views the vulnerable output.
*   **Insufficient output sanitization/encoding:** The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-provided input before rendering it in a web page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:
*   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of another user's browser.
*   Perform actions within the application on behalf of the victim user.
*   View or modify any information that the victim user is authorized to access.
*   Potentially initiate further attacks against other users.
*   Full compromise of victim user, exfiltrating data, or performing administrative actions depending on user privilege.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator with workspace-level privileges to modify GeoServer catalog information, specifically layer titles or style names.
*   The injected payload is triggered when another user views the WMS GetMap OpenLayers Output Format.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Authenticated access to GeoServer with workspace-level administration permissions.
*   Ability to modify the GeoServer catalog to inject the malicious script via layer title or style names.
*   The victim user needs to request a map using the WMS GetMap request in OpenLayers format.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed by properly escaping special characters using the `?js_string` directive within the FreeMarker templates and using `StringEscapeUtils::escapeHtml4` to encode style names in the java code.
*   The vulnerability affects GeoServer versions prior to 2.23.3 and 2.24.1.
*   The fix was implemented in pull requests #7174, #7193, and #7194.
*   The `?html` directive in freemarker is deprecated as it escapes the script tags and it may not be entirely correct javascript.
*  The attack vector is through the network, attack complexity is low, requires high privileges, and user interaction. The scope is changed, and impact on confidentiality is low, as well as integrity. No impact on availability.
