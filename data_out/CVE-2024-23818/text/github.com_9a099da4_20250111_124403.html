Confused about escaping done in different places, see below.

Why are the other parameters escaped in the template, while this one is escaped in Java code?

I wasn't sure what to do with this one. The FreeMarker `?html` directive is deprecated in favor of auto-escaping but HTML auto-escaping will escape the contents of script tags so that they may not be entirely correct JavaScript. The `?js_string` directive is not deprecated.
