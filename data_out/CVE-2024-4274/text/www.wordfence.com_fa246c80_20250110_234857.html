### Description

The Essential Real Estate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to insufficient validation on the remove\_property\_attachment\_ajax() function in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary attachments.
