- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Exclusive Addons Elementor plugin for WordPress, in versions 2.7.1 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This is due to insufficient input sanitization or output encoding within the plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the plugin does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input, allowing for injection of arbitrary scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to inject scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, into a website. When guests visit the site, these malicious scripts can be executed within their browsers, potentially leading to account hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through injecting malicious scripts into input fields or parameters processed by the plugin. This could involve crafting specific URLs or form submissions containing the malicious code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable areas of the plugin. The required privileges to exploit the vulnerability are "Contributor" level.
