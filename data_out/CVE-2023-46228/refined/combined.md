1. [Handle filenames passed to `unzck` more sanely](/zchunk/zchunk/commit/67f921e18f73d016f27b83617d84819bf2d9ef27)
    …

   ```
   We were doing some very strange things when trying to figure out the output
   filename, including failing if the input didn't end in `.zck` or `.zhr`.

   None of this made sense, so now we're just stripping `.zck` from the input
   file if it's there when calculating the output file name.

   Thanks to Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo for finding and reporting this.
