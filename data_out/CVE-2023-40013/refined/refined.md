Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-40013:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is insufficient sanitization of SVG input by the `external-svg-loader` library. The library attempts to remove potentially malicious JavaScript code by stripping event attributes like `onmouseover` and `onclick`. However, it fails to account for all possible event attributes that can execute JavaScript within an SVG, such as `onbegin` within an `<animate>` tag.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Input Sanitization:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of comprehensive filtering of event attributes within the SVG. The library uses a blacklist approach which is easily bypassed due to the vast number of available events.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability leads to a stored XSS vulnerability. Maliciously crafted SVGs can execute arbitrary JavaScript code when rendered by the library.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Stored XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a website by uploading or providing a malicious SVG file. This code will then be executed in the browsers of users who view the affected page.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:** A successful attack could lead to the compromise of confidentiality (access to sensitive user data), integrity (modification of website content), and availability (denial of service by disrupting the website).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious SVG Input:** The primary attack vector is through the injection of malicious SVG files.
*   **User-Provided SVG:** Websites that use `external-svg-loader` and allow users to upload or provide SVG files as input are particularly vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide SVG:** An attacker needs the capability to provide the vulnerable application with a malicious SVG file, either through direct upload or a URL.
*   **No Privileges Required:** No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability, as it leverages the insufficient input sanitization logic of the library.
*   **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any user interaction once a malicious SVG is loaded via the vulnerable library.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was identified by r00tdaemon.
*   The affected versions are <=1.6.8, and the patched version is 1.6.9.
*   The fix involved expanding the list of removed event attributes in `svg-loader.js` and adding `values` attribute to remove also javascript injections
*   The provided PoC demonstrates that using `onbegin` within the `<animate>` tag can execute JavaScript code, bypassing the library's event attribute filtering.
*   The CVSS score is 9.8 (Critical), reflecting the severity of the vulnerability.
*   The code diff shows that the fix expanded the list of events to be removed in `svg-loader.js`, and added 2 test cases, `svg-xss.svg` and `svg-xss-2.svg`
*   The library attempts to prevent XSS by removing event attributes and `javascript:` prefixes. However, it did not cover all possible event attributes or the usage of `javascript:` in `values` attributes of SVG elements.
