The provided content is related to CVE-2024-1595.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the affected software insecurely loading libraries, specifically through an uncontrolled search path element.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427)
- DLL Hijacking

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the system where the software is installed.

**Attack vectors:**
- DLL hijacking.
- The application's insecure library loading can be exploited by placing a malicious DLL in the search path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to the system is required to place the malicious DLL, but the vulnerability itself is considered low complexity.
- User interaction is required, indicated by the "UI:R" vector, meaning a user needs to perform some action (like launching the application) to trigger the vulnerable library load.
