Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2021-47370.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from an incorrect signed/unsigned comparison in the `mptcp_sendmsg_frag` function within the Linux kernel's MPTCP (Multipath TCP) implementation. Specifically, the expression `info->size_goal - skb->len > 0` is evaluated using a mix of signed and unsigned integers, causing it to return true even when `size_goal` is smaller than `skb->len`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect signed/unsigned comparison leading to a flawed condition check.
- Lack of proper handling of the tx cache, resulting in skbs not being allocated with the required MPTCP extensions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The primary impact is a kernel warning (`WARN_ON()`) and potentially a denial-of-service, as the system might not be able to properly handle MPTCP connections due to the missing extensions. The incorrect calculation prevents the tx cache from being refilled with skbs that have MPTCP extensions. When a subsequent send operation occurs, the kernel will access the data structure as if it had the necessary MPTCP extension, leading to a memory corruption or an access violation, triggering a WARN\_ON.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending data over an MPTCP connection, where the size of the skb is larger than the `size_goal`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send data through an MPTCP connection. This might be achieved locally or remotely depending on the setup, but is likely an unprivileged operation. The attacker needs to trigger the size check condition to cause the missing MPTCP extension on the SKB, leading to the crash condition.
