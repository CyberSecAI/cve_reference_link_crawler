It doesn‚Äôt matter if it has a million modules if one (and the one you need) doesn‚Äôt work, then none of it works. The accordion modules seems to have no way to delete an entry once it has been made. So if you want to remove anything, you‚Äôre out of luck. Seems like a problem that shouldn‚Äôt exist, but I‚Äôve looked everywhere, googled it, contacted the developers, and I‚Äôve gotten nowhere. So it doesn‚Äôt matter if everything else works great, if this one module doesn‚Äôt work right, none of it works. If this was fixed, it would be a great plugin.
