Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2163

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes, specifically URLs, within the plugin's widgets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input when creating widgets. This lack of sanitization allows malicious scripts to be saved within the widget data. When this unsanitized data is rendered, the browser executes the malicious script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the page containing the injected widget.
- This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as:
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Stealing cookies and session data.
    - Defacing websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user, such as adding administrative accounts or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin's widgets.
- An authenticated user with Contributor-level access or higher can insert malicious code via widget attributes, such as URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have an account with at least Contributor-level permissions on the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to be able to create or edit pages where they can insert or modify widgets provided by the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Notes:**
- The plugin has been closed and is not available for download from the WordPress plugin directory due to the security issue.
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.4.5.
- There is no known patch available. It is advised to uninstall the plugin and find a replacement.
- CVE-2024-37244 is likely a duplicate of this vulnerability.
