It doesn‚Äôt matter if it has a million modules if one (and the one you need) doesn‚Äôt work, then none of it works. The accordion modules seems to have no way to delete an entry once it has been made. So if you want to remove anything, you‚Äôre out of luck. Seems like a problem that shouldn‚Äôt exist, but I‚Äôve looked everywhere, googled it, contacted the developers, and I‚Äôve gotten nowhere. So it doesn‚Äôt matter if everything else works great, if this one module doesn‚Äôt work right, none of it works. If this was fixed, it would be a great plugin.

### Description

The Ninja Beaver Add-ons for Beaver Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's widgets in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes such as urls. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. CVE-2024-37244 is likely a duplicate of this issue.
