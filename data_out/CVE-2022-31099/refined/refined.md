The provided content is related to CVE-2022-31099.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to uncontrolled recursion in the rulex parsing logic. Specifically, deeply nested expressions can cause a stack overflow, leading to a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled recursion during parsing of rulex expressions.
- Lack of a recursion limit or a mechanism to prevent excessively deep nesting during parsing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) due to stack overflow, causing the process to abort immediately.
- The service becomes unavailable if the process parsing rulex expressions crashes.

**Attack vectors:**
- Providing a crafted rulex expression with several hundred levels of nesting as input to the parsing logic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide untrusted rulex expressions as input to the service.
-  Ability to cause the process running rulex to abort due to stack overflow.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The issue was addressed by adding a recursion limit in version 0.4.3.
- The fix involved adding a `recursion` field to the Input struct, incrementing/decrementing it at the start and end of parsing functions.
- The `recursion_start` method will return an error `ParseErrorKind::RecursionLimit` if the limit is reached.
- The commit `60aa2dc` adds this recursion limit.
- The vulnerability is classified as low severity.
- The affected versions are <= 0.4.2.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion).
