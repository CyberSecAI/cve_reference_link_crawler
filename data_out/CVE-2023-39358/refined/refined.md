Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-39358:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is an authenticated SQL injection, located in the `reports_user.php` file, specifically within the `ajax_get_branches` function.
- The `tree_id` parameter is passed to the `reports_get_branch_select` function without proper validation.
- The `reports_get_branch_select` function directly uses the `tree_id` variable within a SQL query's WHERE clause when the `tree_id` is greater than 0, leading to SQL injection.
- The same issue exists in `reports_admin.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input (`tree_id`) before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges within the Cacti application.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By leveraging the SQL injection, an attacker can modify the 'path_php_binary' value in the database which can lead to RCE.
- **System Compromise:** The combined impact of privilege escalation and RCE can allow a complete compromise of the affected system.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The vulnerability affects all three security aspects, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `reports_user.php` with a malicious `tree_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the Cacti application.
- **Low Privileges:**  The exploit can be performed even with low-level user privileges within Cacti.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Cacti instance.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `tree_id` parameter is supplied to `reports_user.php` or `reports_admin.php` with the `action` parameter set to `ajax_get_branches`.
- The vulnerable code path is `reports_get_branch_select`, where the `tree_id` variable is used directly in a SQL WHERE clause.
- Stacked SQL queries are possible.
- A provided proof-of-concept (PoC) uses a sleep command to demonstrate the SQL injection.

**CVSS Score:**
- **High Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as high severity with a CVSS score of 8.8
- **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
