Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2024-22108:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `setTermsHashAction` method of the `CCApi.class.php` file within the GTB Central Console application. This occurs because the application directly incorporates user-supplied input into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** The `setTermsHashAction` method is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `hash` and `userId` parameters in a crafted request. Specifically, the `hash` parameter is directly concatenated into the SQL query within single quotes, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. The `userId` parameter is also directly inserted into the query without proper sanitization, enabling further SQL injection possibilities.
2.  **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerable `ccapi.php` endpoint, which exposes the `setTermsHashAction` method, is accessible without authentication. This means that an attacker can exploit the SQL injection without needing to log in to the application.
3. **Insecure password storage:** The application stores user passwords using unsalted MD5 hashes, allowing an attacker to gain administrative access by replacing the existing password hash with a known hash.
4.  **Command Injection**: The `systemSettingsDnsDataAction` function in `/opt/webapp/src/AppBundle/Controller/React/SystemSettingsController.php` is vulnerable to command injection. The `host_name` parameter within the `data` payload is passed unsanitized to a shell command using `exec()`, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands by controlling this parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **Database Manipulation:** An attacker can use the SQL injection vulnerability to modify data within the `users` table and potentially other tables in the database. Specifically, it can be used to change user passwords to known values.
2. **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting the SQL injection to change the administrator password, an attacker can gain administrative access to the application, enabling further attacks.
3.  **Remote Code Execution:** After gaining administrative access using the SQLi, the attacker can exploit the command injection vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This can lead to complete control of the system, including the ability to read sensitive data, install malware, and pivot to other systems on the network.
4.  **Webshell creation:** The command injection is used to inject a webshell in the server, allowing further command execution and system exploration.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **HTTP Request:** The SQL injection is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `ccapi.php` endpoint.
2. **HTTP Request:** The command injection is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `systemSettingsDnsDataAction` endpoint after authenticating as administrator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the GTB Central Console server to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints. No prior authentication is needed to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability, but the command injection requires administrator privileges which are gained through the SQLi.
2.  **Basic understanding of SQL syntax and web requests:** An attacker needs to understand SQL to craft the injection and the structure of HTTP requests.

**Additional Notes:**
