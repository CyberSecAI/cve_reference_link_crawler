| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Softing](https://industrial.softing.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [edgeAggregator](https://industrial.softing.com/products/docker/edgeaggregator.html) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Softing edgeAggregator. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of the input parameters provided to the edgeAggregetor client. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can lead to the injection of an arbitrary script. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. |
