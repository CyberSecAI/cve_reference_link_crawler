### **[s0md3v](/s0md3v)** commented [Apr 28, 2019](#issue-438031743)

| Hi there,  I am submitting this issue as the team is unable to see any impact by using the "exploit strings" i provided. Look at the following regular expression:  ``` (?i:(?:(?:(?:^[\"'`\\\\]*?[^\"'`]+[\"'`])+|(?:^[\"'`\\\\]*?[\d\"'`]+)+)\s*?(?:n(?:and|ot)| (?:x?x)?or|between|\|\||like|and|div|&&)\s*?[\w\"'`][+&!@(),.-]|\@(?:[\w-]+\s(?:between|like| x?or|and|div)\s*?[^\w\s]|\w+\s+(?:between|like|x?or|and|div)\s*?[\"'`\d]+)|[\"'`]\s*?(?:b etween|like|x?or|and|div)\s*?[\"'`]?\d|[^\w\s:]\s*?\d\W+[^\w\s]\s*?[\"'`].|[^\w\s]\w+\s*?[|-]\s* ?[\"'`]\s*?\w|\Winformation_schema|\\\\x(?:23|27|3d)|table_name\W|^.?[\"'`]$))  ```  This is indeed a very long regular expression to reverse into a string by hand when you are looking at tons of such regular expressions. However, the only vulnerable part of the regular expression is the following:  ``` (?:^[\"'`\\\\]*?[^\"'`]+[\"'`])+|(?:^[\"'`\\\\]*?[\d\"'`]+)+)\s*?(?:n(?:and|ot)  ```  This part will cause the regex engine to backtrack a lot because of the alternate and adjacent sub-patterns and character classes matching the same characters. I focused only on finding vulnerabilities and not on writing exploits and that way, I was able to find and verify 5 vulnerabilities under and hour. I assumed you guys would understand what I was trying to convey without making a ready-to-use exploit public, open to abuse.  The strings I mentioned are exploits for the vulnerable parts of the regular expressions, they aren't complete attack vectors as I mentioned in [my interview with Portswigger](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/unpatched-modsecurity-crs-vulnerabilities-leave-web-servers-open-to-denial-of-service-attacks):  The researcher added: ‚ÄúIt should be noted that I haven‚Äôt released the full exploit strings yet because the vulnerabilities still exist and can be abused. The exploits mentioned in my blog are just for the vulnerable parts of the regular expressions and won‚Äôt have any effect on an implementation of ModSecurity.‚Äù  I hope it makes sense now. |

| [@s0md3v](https://github.com/s0md3v) if this is really a matter of using the right payload you can send this privately to the core developers. I still fail to understand why a different payload will work when the pcre limits are in place though. |

| [@fgsch](https://github.com/fgsch) If PCRE limits are in place, ReDOS won't occur but i guess Mod Security v3 doesn't have those limits because of some compatibility issue. It's up to you if you want to fix the regexes or set up the limits. |

| ModSec 3 does not allow a user to configure the limits, but they are there baked into the binary. However, transformations come into play too, so maybe it's the transformations that kill your attack (payload). Honestly, I do not really know why the attacks do not work.  The resulting problem with your issues / CVEs is thus, that they do not lead to a DoS. It is obvious, that quite a few of our regular expressions have a ReDoS problem. That is no news, at least not to the project as explained in the blog post at <https://coreruleset.org/20190425/regular-expression-dos-weaknesses-in-crs/>.  We know we need to fix the regular expressions. But we want to do so in a very diligent way. Ideally, the updated regex will match 100% the same patterns as before. And developing that takes time, so we did not merge your welcome submissions just yet.  With regards to the CVEs, I just do not see a constellation (with the excaption of [CVE-2019-11387](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-473r-xgj8-7xqq "CVE-2019-11387")), where you / your payloads are able to DoS a system running CRS. ModSec 2 and ModSec 3 do not seem to be affected and we clearly write that our rules work on *compatible* systems too. Compatible would mean, that the rule execution is the same. If the rule execution is different and DoS happens, then they are no longer compatible and they are beyond our responsibility / authority.  Do you understand this argumentation, or is there something flawed in my thinking? |

| Unlike what you reported on [#1359](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/issues/1359) I'm not able to reproduce the issue. Any help on defining a ReDoS HTTP request that matches 932140? |

| Hi [@s0md3v](https://github.com/s0md3v) ,there is a limit for following those bad regex matches in modsecurity, have you tested this in modsecurity? what is your current modsecurity setup and what is the extent of the impact you noticed?  [PCRE match limit](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-%28v2.x%29#SecPcreMatchLimit) [PCRE match limit recursion](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-%28v2.x%29#SecPcreMatchLimitRecursion) |

| Hi [@spartantri](https://github.com/spartantri) ,  I don't have modsecurity setup on my machine and I don't really need one because the vulnerability exists in the regular expression.  I simply extracted all the regular expressions from the configuration files, ran a quick grep to find the find the potentially vulnerable ones, tried to exploit them one by one by using [regex101.com](http://regex101.com/) and then verified the impact using `re.search(pattern, exploit_string)` in Python. I apologize for not using `match` instead of `search` which is the reason 4 out 5 vulnerabilities were not reproducible.  Also, I wasn't aware about the limits but I have a few questions about this implementation   1. The timeout seems to be 1.5 seconds but what happens if the matching times out? Is the request blocked? 2. Shouldn't we fix the root cause instead of relying on such limits? PS: I am not a regex wizard but I believe the recursion limit has nothing to with backtracking which is the real culprit.   I believe the regular expressions should be fixed but it's up to your team to make the final decision. |

| Unless the configuration is made purposely changed to extremely high limits this is not a high DoS vulnerability as the title suggest as the limits are like adding an {#} to the regex in place of a recursive match.  When limits are reached, depending on your particular setup and the rule logic the transaction most probably will be blocked. I agree there are some regex that need some love to make them more efficient and this fixes should definitively be implemented to prevent a possible vulnerability when an administrator sets crazy values on their setup.  Maybe we can add this to CONTRIBUTING as guidelines to keep this in mind and prevent this from happening in the future, and also tune and benchmark the CRS for performance. |

| Thanks for making this clear but what's the default behavior? Does mod\_security flags the request as malicious when the timeout value is reached? |

| This issue is being referenced as [CVE-2019-11388](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11388) by NIST.  I confirm that this issue is not present with ModSecurity.  I have tried to reproduce the behaviour with the following call:  ``` curl -v "http://localhost" -d "x=for/d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d//d/ %x in(x) dx"  ```  against the following setups:   * Vanilla ModSec 2.9.3 on Apache * ModSec 2.9.3 on Apache with PCRE Match Limits of 50M * ModSec 3.0.3 on Nginx 1.3.12   None of them shows the behaviour claimed in the issue.  [@s0md3v](https://github.com/s0md3v): Please explain. |

| [@dune73](https://github.com/dune73) Some engines (like the one of regex101 which is different than modsec) get catastrophic backtracking errors with `for/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d/d %variable in(set) do command` But wasn't able to reproduce or had delays in modsec v2 with Apache |

| Thanks for your feedback [@s0md3v](https://github.com/s0md3v). I see the problem in the regex and I can confirm what [@fgsch](https://github.com/fgsch) got with `pcre2test`. Yet I am not sure if you can really exploit this via CRS/ModSec. After all CRS rule 932140 applies two transformations to the payload and I do not see any misbehaviour of the webserver with your subpattern.  Also: Where would the subpattern and the pattern lead to different behaviours of the ModSec engine? I do not understand this completely yet. |
