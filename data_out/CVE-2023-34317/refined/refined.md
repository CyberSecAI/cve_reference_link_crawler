- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the OAS Engine User Creation functionality. The application does not filter the username field when adding a new user via a protobuf, allowing storage of arbitrary data in the configuration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation (CWE-20). The lack of filtering on user input allows for injection of unexpected data in the username field.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary data into the configuration. When combined with authentication bypass and save configuration functionality, it is possible to gain access to the underlying system by adding a user with an SSH key in the username field.
- **Attack vectors:** Network requests to the OAS Engine User Creation functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be authenticated to the application to make requests to create a new user. The exploit also requires combining it with other vulnerabilities such as authentication bypass and save configuration.
