Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-26265:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Image Uploader module in Liferay Portal and Liferay DXP relies on a request parameter (`maxFileSize`) to limit the size of uploaded files. This parameter can be modified by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or enforce the `maxFileSize` parameter, allowing it to be manipulated by the user.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** By modifying the `maxFileSize` parameter, an attacker can bypass the intended file size limits.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File System Flooding:** Attackers can upload arbitrarily large files, potentially filling up the system's temporary folder, leading to denial of service by consuming all available storage space. This is a resource exhaustion vulnerability.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The system's performance and availability may degrade or become completely unavailable due to the exhaustion of storage space.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed remotely via HTTP requests.
*   **Request Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the `maxFileSize` parameter in the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a valid authenticated user within the Liferay system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Liferay Portal or DXP.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Liferay Portal 7.4.0 through 7.4.3.15
*   Liferay Portal 7.3.0 through 7.3.7
*   Liferay Portal 7.2.0 and 7.2.1
*   Older unsupported versions of Liferay Portal
*   Liferay DXP 7.4 before update 16
*   Liferay DXP 7.3 before update 4
*   Liferay DXP 7.2 before fix pack 19
*   Older unsupported versions of Liferay DXP

**Fixed Versions:**
*   Liferay Portal 7.4.3.16
*   Liferay DXP 7.4 update 16
*   Liferay DXP 7.3 update 4
*  Liferay DXP 7.2 fix pack 19
