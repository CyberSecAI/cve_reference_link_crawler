- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of certain IPv4 packets by the IPv4 Software-Defined Access (SD-Access) fabric edge node feature of Cisco IOS XE Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of specific IPv4 packets, which can lead to high CPU utilization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can cause the affected device to exhaust CPU resources and stop all traffic processing, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote; an unauthenticated attacker can send specifically crafted IPv4 packets to a vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required.
