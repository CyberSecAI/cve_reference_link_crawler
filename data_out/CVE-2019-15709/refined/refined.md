- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation of the `tcpdump` command parameters in the FortiAP CLI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-20 Improper Input Validation. The system does not sanitize the input passed to the tcpdump command, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands via the CLI.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated administrator can overwrite system files leading to execution of unauthorized code or commands.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation is done through the FortiAP CLI by providing specially crafted parameters to the `tcpdump` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator with access to the FortiAP CLI.
