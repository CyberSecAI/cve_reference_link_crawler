The provided content is related to CVE-2022-23331.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a Broken Access Control issue within the DataEase application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Broken Access Control: An authenticated user can access information about all users, which they should not have access to.
- Insecure Direct Object Reference: An authenticated user can change the administrator's password by using an API that does not properly validate permissions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information about all users, including potentially their usernames and other details.
- An attacker can change the administrator's password and gain full control over the DataEase application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access to the application.
- Exploitation is achieved by sending crafted HTTP POST requests to specific API endpoints (`/api/user/userGrid/1/10` and `/api/user/adminUpdatePwd`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the DataEase application.
- They do not need to have administrator level privileges. A regular user can use the vulnerability.
