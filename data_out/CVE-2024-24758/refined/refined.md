Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-24758:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `undici` library, an HTTP/1.1 client for Node.js. Specifically, the `Proxy-Authorization` header was not being cleared during cross-origin redirects, unlike the `Authorization` header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of `Proxy-Authorization` headers during cross-origin redirects.
- Failure to clear sensitive authentication headers during redirects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  The `Proxy-Authorization` header, which may contain sensitive credentials, could be unintentionally sent to a different origin during a redirect. This could lead to the disclosure of credentials to unauthorized parties.
- **Data Modification or Denial of Service (DoS):**  Although not explicitly stated in the provided content for this specific vulnerability, NetApp notes the broader impact could include data modification or Denial of Service (DoS). This may be related to a more generalized impact of security flaws in HTTP clients.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable over the network (AV:N).
- An attacker would need to induce a cross-origin redirect while the vulnerable client is configured with a `Proxy-Authorization` header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Attack Complexity:** High (AC:H), suggesting the exploit requires some sophistication or precise conditions.
- **Privileges Required:** High (PR:H), which, in this context of a client-side issue, means the attacker needs to be in a position to control the code execution using the vulnerable `undici` library.
- **User Interaction:** Required (UI:R), which indicates the attacker needs some user action to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue is rated as LOW severity (3.9) by CVSS v3.1.
- The vulnerability affects `undici` versions `<= v5.28.2` and `>= v6.0.0 <= v6.6.0`.
- Patched versions are `v5.28.3` and `v6.6.1`.
- The vulnerability is related to the [fetch specification](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#authentication-entries).
- The fix involves deleting the `proxy-authorization` header in the relevant code path.
-  NetApp products are mostly not affected, but `ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10` is under investigation.
