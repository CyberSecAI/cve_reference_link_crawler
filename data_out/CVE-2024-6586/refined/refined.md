Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-6586:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how Lightdash's dashboard export functionality uses Puppeteer. Specifically, Puppeteer was setting sensitive headers, including cookies, on requests made to the headless browser during dashboard export. This resulted in the exporting user's session cookie being included in requests to external domains embedded within the dashboard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application allows the injection of HTML elements into a dashboard, which, when exported, trigger HTTP requests to attacker-controlled domains.
*   **Session Cookie Exposure:** The SSRF vulnerability leads to the leakage of the exporting user's session cookie to the attacker-controlled domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **User Session Hijacking:** An attacker can steal the session cookie and use it to impersonate the user, gaining unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Administrative Control Takeover:** If an administrative user's session is compromised, the attacker could gain complete control over the Lightdash instance.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTML Injection:** The attacker injects malicious HTML, including `<iframe>` or `<img>` tags with attacker-controlled URLs, into a shared dashboard's markdown content.
*   **Dashboard Export:** Any user who exports a dashboard containing the injected HTML will trigger the SSRF and leak their session cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the Lightdash application.
*   **Dashboard Creation/Editing Permissions:** The attacker needs the ability to create or edit shared dashboards to inject the malicious HTML.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs an accessible endpoint to receive the exfiltrated cookies.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability was present in Lightdash version 0.1024.6.
*   The issue was resolved in version 0.1027.2 by changing the method of setting the cookie for the puppeteer browser.
*   The fix involved extracting the `connect.sid` cookie value and using `page.setCookie` instead of `page.setExtraHTTPHeaders`, ensuring the cookie was properly scoped to the application's domain.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by any user exporting a dashboard with the injected code.
*   The vulnerability can be combined with XSS attacks (CVE-2024-6585) to force users to export malicious dashboards.
*   CVSS v3 score: 7.3 (High), CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

**Remediation:**
Upgrade to Lightdash version 0.1027.2 or later.
