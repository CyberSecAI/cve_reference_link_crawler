{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or unauthorized actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `CatalogsPageDescriptionForm[1][name]` parameter in the `/admin/catalog-pages/edit?id=0&platform_id=1&parent_id=0` URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to modify the specified parameter (CatalogsPageDescriptionForm[1][name]) with a malicious payload, which appears to require having an administrative session in this case."
