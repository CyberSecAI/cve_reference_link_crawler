      "cve_id": "CVE-2024-8131",
      "description": "The DLINK nas DNS-320/320L/321/323/325/327L all firmware version has a command injection vulnerability in module\_enable\_disable function of the file /cgi-bin/apkg\_mgr.cgi. The variable f\_module\_name is passed from a POST request and is assigned to v4 via the snprintf function at line 49 and invoked by the system command, it can lead to command execution.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to improper handling of user-supplied input within the `module_enable_disable` function in the `/cgi-bin/apkg_mgr.cgi` script. Specifically, the `f_module_name` parameter from a POST request is incorporated into a command string without proper sanitization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Command Injection",
        "Insufficient Input Validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the affected device.",
       "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted POST request to the `/cgi-bin/apkg_mgr.cgi` endpoint, specifically targeting the `module_enable_disable` function with a malicious payload in the `f_module_name` parameter.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected device's web interface."
