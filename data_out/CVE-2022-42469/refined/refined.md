Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-42469:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a "permissive list of allowed inputs" in FortiGate's Policy-based NGFW mode. Specifically, the system fails to properly filter accesses via bookmarks in the web portal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is that the system is not enforcing access control policies when users access resources through bookmarks in the SSL-VPN web portal. This bypasses the intended security policies.
- **CWE-183 (Permissive List of Allowed Inputs):** The system's reliance on a permissive list of allowed inputs makes it vulnerable to bypasses when unexpected input (bookmarks in this case) is provided.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated SSL-VPN user can bypass the policy and potentially gain access to resources they should not have. This could result in unauthorized access to sensitive data or network resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Bookmarks:** The vulnerability is exploited through the use of bookmarks in the SSL-VPN web portal.
- **SSL-VPN:** The attack requires access to the SSL-VPN service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the SSL-VPN service.
- **Access to SSL-VPN web portal:** The attacker must be able to access the SSL-VPN web portal.
