| [@laiyousin](https://github.com/laiyousin) [@xunliu](https://github.com/xunliu)  `submarine.auth.default.secret` is not hard-coded and can be overridden by `SUBMARINE_AUTH_DEFAULT_SECRET` in the environment variable. Therefore, I think this PR still needs more consideration, and there are too many problems in CI that have not been solved, and it still needs the support of other fixes to merge.  Refer to the documentation <https://submarine.apache.org/docs/designDocs/wip-designs/security-implementation#authentication> for more authentication details. |

| If there is no more to deal with this PR, I will revert this recently and fix the problem in CI first. |
