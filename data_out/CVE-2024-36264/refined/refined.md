Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36264:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded default secret (`SUBMARINE_AUTH_SECRET`) within the Apache Submarine Commons Utils. This means that if the application is deployed without configuring a custom secret, all installations would share the same secret, potentially allowing unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authentication:** The primary weakness is the use of a default, hard-coded authentication secret. This violates the principle of secure defaults, as the default secret is known to the developers and could be potentially discovered by malicious actors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The impact is described as "low", but if exploited, it could lead to unauthorized access to systems relying on this component for authentication. The degree of impact would depend on the scope of the affected systems. This is further mitigated by the fact that the project is retired.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker who has knowledge of the default secret could leverage it to bypass authentication mechanisms in systems using the vulnerable Apache Submarine Commons Utils library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to know the hard-coded default secret. If that secret is not changed by a user, any user knowing the secret can access the service. No particular network position is mentioned.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by retrieving the `SUBMARINE_AUTH_SECRET` from an environment variable rather than using the hardcoded value. This is described in the provided link to the pull request ([https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1125](https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1125)). However, the fix was not released and the project is retired.
*   The CVE description notes that this vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Users are advised to find an alternative.
*   The provided content indicates some disagreement on the fix, suggesting it should be revisited. However, as the project is archived, no further action is likely.
*   The issue is tracked as `SUBMARINE-1417`.
