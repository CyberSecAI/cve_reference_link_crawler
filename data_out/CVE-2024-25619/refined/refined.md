Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2024-25619:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Doorkeeper handles the relationship between OAuth Applications and Access Tokens. It uses `dependent: delete_all`, which bypasses the ActiveRecord callbacks defined in `AccessTokenExtension`. This means that when an OAuth Application is deleted, the associated Access Tokens are deleted without notifying the streaming API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incomplete Resource Cleanup:** Deleting an OAuth Application doesn't properly revoke associated access tokens for the streaming API.
- **Missing Callback Execution:** The `delete_all` method used in the relationship between applications and access tokens prevents `after_commit` callbacks in `AccessTokenExtension` from being triggered.
- **Lack of Streaming API Notification:** The streaming server is not informed when access tokens are destroyed, leading to potential security issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An application could continue listening to the streaming API even after being destroyed, potentially leading to unauthorized access to user data via the streaming connection.
- Although the impact is considered low, since the application had to be owned by the user, it still creates a potential privacy issue.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is **network-based**, since the attacker needs to connect to the streaming API.
- This vulnerability can be triggered by a user destroying their own OAuth application through the application management interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be a user who has created an OAuth application.
- The attacker must be able to destroy their own OAuth Application

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is mitigated by adding a `before_destroy` callback to `ApplicationExtension`. This callback notifies the streaming API that the application's access tokens are being "killed".
- Additionally, password resets will now revoke access to the Streaming API, and there were performance improvements made to the deletion of OAuth tokens.
