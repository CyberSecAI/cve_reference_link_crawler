- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the way Qlik QlikView for Windows handles repair operations. When a repair operation is triggered, certain file operations, including the execution of temporary files, are performed in the user's %TEMP% folder under a SYSTEM context. This allows an attacker to manipulate these temporary files to achieve privilege escalation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Creation of temporary files in a directory with insecure permissions (%TEMP% folder).
    - Execution of these temporary files with SYSTEM privileges via Windows Installer service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a local unprivileged attacker to gain SYSTEM level privileges on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by initiating a repair operation on the cached MSI file. This can be done through the Windows Installer API or by directly executing "msiexec.exe /fa c:\windows\installer\[XXXXX].msi".
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must have local access to the system.
    - The attacker must be an authenticated local user.
    - The attacker must be able to trigger a repair operation on the Qlik QlikView installation.
