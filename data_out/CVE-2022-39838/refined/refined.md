Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Systematica FIX Adapter (ALFAFX) 2.4.0.25 allows remote file inclusion through a UNC share pathname and also allows absolute path traversal to local pathnames. The application is not properly validating the file path provided in the `file` parameter of the `info?page=logfile` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The application allows access to arbitrary files within the server's file system by using absolute paths in the `file` parameter.
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application allows the inclusion of files from remote locations via UNC paths, making it possible to fetch and potentially execute malicious files over SMB.
*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The application does not sanitize or validate the user-supplied file path, leading to both path traversal and RFI vulnerabilities.
*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The application lacks proper access controls, allowing remote users to access sensitive files on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive data like configuration files, user data, or system files.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By including malicious files from UNC paths, an attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint (`/info?page=logfile`).
*   **`file` Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the `file` parameter of the HTTP GET request, providing absolute or UNC paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL path (`/info?page=logfile`) and parameter (`file`).

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) URLs demonstrate how to read the `/etc/hosts` file on a Windows system and how to include a file from a remote SMB share.
*   The application version `2.4.0.25 (Build 13/09/2017)` is vulnerable.
*   The vendor is `Systematica`.
*   The vulnerability type is `Incorrect Access Control`.
*   The attack type is `Remote`.
