{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of approved NLSes in settings. Specifically, NLSes with names that are too long should not be approvable. However, if such an NLS was already approved (either before the length check was introduced or via other means), revoking its access would cause it to disappear from the list.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inconsistent handling of approved NLSes based on name length."
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is that a user might be confused when a previously approved NLS disappears after revoking its access due to it having too long a name.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a user revoking access to a previously approved NLS with a name that is too long. This is an edge case that can be encountered either if the NLS was approved before the length check, or through other means.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not need specific capabilities or position. The user can trigger the vulnerability by performing normal actions within the Android settings interface."
