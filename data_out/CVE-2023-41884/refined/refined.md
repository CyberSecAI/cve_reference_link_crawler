The provided content is related to CVE-2023-41884.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization of the `$sort` parameter in the `web/ajax/watch.php` file before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability. The `$sort` parameter is directly inserted into the SQL query without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to extract information from the database.
- In the provided PoC, the attacker injects a `SLEEP` command, showing that arbitrary SQL commands can be executed.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- The attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint (`/zm/index.php?view=watch&request=watch&mid=1`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the ZoneMinder instance.
- The attacker needs to send a crafted request to the `/zm/index.php` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to know the valid request parameters to access the vulnerable part of the code.
- Low privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
