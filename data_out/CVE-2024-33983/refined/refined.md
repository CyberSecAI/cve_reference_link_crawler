Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-33983:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, it's a reflected XSS vulnerability where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized and is reflected back in the web page, allowing execution of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user inputs before reflecting them back in the HTML. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can create a specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript. When a victim clicks on the link, the attacker's JavaScript will execute within the context of the victim's browser session.
*   This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing session cookies).
    *   Redirection to malicious sites.
    *   Defacement of the web page.
    *   Potentially performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **URL manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with parameters that inject the XSS payload. This URL is then sent to a victim, often through social engineering.
*   **Specific parameters:** The vulnerability is triggered using the following parameters in the specified paths:
    *   `Attendance`, `attenddate`, and `YearLevel` in `/AttendanceMonitoring/report/attendance_print.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
*   The attacker needs to be able to entice a user to click the crafted URL.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
