Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Database connections for deleted users are not properly closed on MySQL data sources.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Failure to terminate database connections upon user deletion, leaving active connections that can still be used to access data.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Deleted users can potentially access unauthorized data due to active database connections. This implies a data breach risk with possible unauthorized data access.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  The vulnerability is present in how the application manages database connections upon user deletion. An attacker, who was previously a valid user, would be able to use their existing open connection.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have been a valid user with access to the affected MySQL database prior to being deleted. Once deleted, their connection may remain open and exploitable.
