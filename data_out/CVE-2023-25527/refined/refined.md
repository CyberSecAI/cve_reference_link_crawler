- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NVIDIA DGX H100 BMC contains a vulnerability in the host KVM daemon that allows for corruption of kernel memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  A memory corruption vulnerability exists within the host KVM daemon. Specifically, a buffer overflow (CWE-119) is mentioned, which leads to the corruption of kernel memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may lead to arbitrary kernel code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An authenticated local attacker is required to exploit this vulnerability (PR:L). The attacker needs to be on the same system as the vulnerable KVM daemon.
