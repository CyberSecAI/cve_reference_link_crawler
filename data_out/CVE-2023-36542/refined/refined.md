Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36542:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Apache NiFi handles HTTP URL references within Processors and Controller Services. Specifically, these components support retrieving drivers from remote locations specified by HTTP URLs. This functionality allows authenticated and authorized users to configure a location that can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Remote Resource Loading:**  The system allowed users to specify arbitrary HTTP URLs for driver retrieval.
*   **Lack of Privilege Separation:** The ability to configure remote resource loading was not restricted to privileged users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could configure a malicious HTTP server to host a payload disguised as a driver. When Apache NiFi attempts to load the "driver" from this URL, it could execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HTTP URL Configuration:** An attacker with the required user privileges could modify the configuration of a vulnerable Processor or Controller Service, replacing a legitimate driver URL with a URL pointing to attacker-controlled server hosting malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user in Apache NiFi.
*   **Authorization:** The attacker needs authorization to configure Processors or Controller Services that have the ability to load drivers through HTTP URLs.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Mitigation:** The fix implemented in Apache NiFi 1.23.0 introduces a new "Reference Remote Resources" permission. This restricts the configuration of components that can load remote resources to privileged users. This prevents unprivileged users from configuring these components.
*   **Affected Versions:** Apache NiFi versions 0.0.2 through 1.22.0 are affected.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability has been rated as "moderate".
*   **Credit:** The vulnerability was discovered by nbxiglk.
