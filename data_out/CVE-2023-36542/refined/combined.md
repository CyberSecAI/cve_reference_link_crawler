# SecLists.Org Security Mailing List Archive

Any hacker will tell you that the latest news and exploits are not
found on any web site—not even [Insecure.Org](https://insecure.org). No, the cutting edge
in security research is and will continue to be the full
disclosure mailing lists such as Bugtraq. Here we provide web
archives and RSS feeds (now including message extracts), updated in real-time, for many of our favorite lists.
Browse the individual lists below, or search them all using the Site Search box above.

[![dailydave logo](/images/dailydave-logo.png)](/dailydave/)

**[Daily Dave](/dailydave/)** — This technical discussion list covers vulnerability research, exploit development, and security events/gossip. It was started by [ImmunitySec](http://www.immunitysec.com/) founder Dave Aitel and many security luminaries participate. Many posts simply advertise Immunity products, but you can't really fault Dave for being self-promotional on a list named DailyDave.

Subject: CVE-2023-36542: Apache NiFi: Potential Code Injection with
 Properties Referencing Remote Resources

Severity: moderate

Affected versions:

- Apache NiFi 0.0.2 through 1.22.0

Description:

Apache NiFi 0.0.2 through 1.22.0 include Processors and Controller Services that support HTTP URL references for retrieving drivers, which allows an authenticated and authorized user to configure a location that enables custom code execution. The resolution introduces a new Required Permission for referencing remote resources, restricting configuration of these components to privileged users. The permission prevents unprivileged users from configuring Processors and Controller Services annotated with the new Reference Remote Resources restriction. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 1.23.0 is the recommended mitigation.

# Apache NiFi Security

Apache NiFi welcomes the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. Project Management Committee members will
collaborate and respond to potential vulnerabilities, providing an assessment of the concern and a plan of action to
remediate verified issues.

## Reporting Policy

Please read the [Apache Project Security for Committers](https://www.apache.org/security/committers.html)
policy for general guidelines applicable disclosure of security issues for Apache Software Foundation projects.

Do not perform the following actions after discovering a potential security concern:

* Open a Jira disclosing a security vulnerability to the public
* Send a message to the project mailing lists disclosing a security vulnerability to the public
* Send a message to the project Slack instance disclosing a security vulnerability to the public

## Reporting Guidelines

Configuring dangerous operating system commands or custom scripts is not a project security vulnerability.
Authenticated and authorized users are responsible for the security of operating system commands and custom
code.

Apache NiFi provides a framework for developing processing pipelines using standard and custom
components. The framework supports configurable permissions that enable authorized users to execute code
using several standard components. Components such as ExecuteProcess and ExecuteStreamCommand support
running operating system commands, while other scripted components support executing custom code using
different programming languages. Configuring these components with untrusted commands or arguments is
contrary to best practices, but it does not constitute of security issue for remediation.

## Reporting Process

* Notify the project on initial discovery of a potential security vulnerability
* Provide a reasonable amount of time for an initial assessment and remediation plan
* Limit interaction to accounts under direct control or accounts with explicit permission of the owner
* Avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of services
* Avoid spamming, social engineering, and methods to manipulate project members

## Reporting Methods

* Security Mailing List: security@nifi.apache.org
  + Members of the Project Management Committee monitor this private mailing list and respond to disclosures

## Severity Ratings

Severity ratings represent the determination of project members based on an evaluation of
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) calculations.

* Critical: Arbitrary code execution from a remote attacker
* High: Compromise of integrity or availability through resource exhaustion
* Medium: Requires special configuration settings and significant mitigations are available
* Low: Minimal impact and significant difficulty of exploitation

# Published Vulnerabilities

The following announcements include published vulnerabilities that apply directly to Apache NiFi components.

### CVE-2024-56512

* Title: Missing Complete Authorization for Parameter and Service References
* Published: 2024-12-27
* Severity: Low
* Products: Apache NiFi
* Affected Versions: 1.10.0 to 2.0.0
* Fixed Versions: 2.1.0
* Reporter: Matt Gilman
* References
  + CVE Record: [CVE-2024-56512](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-56512)
  + NVD Record: [CVE-2024-56512](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56512)
  + Apache Jira Issue: [NIFI-13976](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13976)
  + GitHub Pull Request: [9535](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9535)

Apache NiFi 1.10.0 through 2.0.0 are missing fine-grained authorization checking for Parameter Contexts, referenced
Controller Services, and referenced Parameter Providers, when creating new Process Groups. Creating a new Process Group
can include binding to a Parameter Context, but in cases where the Process Group did not reference any Parameter values,
the framework did not check user authorization for the bound Parameter Context. Missing authorization for a bound
Parameter Context enabled clients to download non-sensitive Parameter values after creating the Process Group. Creating
a new Process Group can also include referencing existing Controller Services or Parameter Providers. The framework did
not check user authorization for referenced Controller Services or Parameter Providers, enabling clients to create
Process Groups and use these components that were otherwise unauthorized. This vulnerability is limited in scope to
authenticated users authorized to create Process Groups. The scope is further limited to deployments with
component-based authorization policies. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.1.0 is the recommended mitigation, which includes
authorization checking for Parameter and Controller Service references on Process Group creation.

### CVE-2024-52067

* Title: Potential Insertion of Sensitive Parameter Values in Debug Log
* Published: 2024-11-20
* Severity: Medium
* Products: Apache NiFi
* Affected Versions: 1.16.0 to 1.28.0 and 2.0.0-M1 to 2.0.0-M4
* Fixed Versions: 1.28.1 and 2.0.0
* Reporter: David Handermann
* References
  + CVE Record: [CVE-2024-52067](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52067)

  + Apache Jira Issue: [NIFI-13971](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13971)
  + GitHub Pull Request: [9489](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9489)

Apache NiFi 1.16.0 through 1.28.0 and 2.0.0-M1 through 2.0.0-M4 include optional debug logging of Parameter Context values
during the flow synchronization process. An authorized administrator with access to change logging levels could enable debug logging
for framework flow synchronization, causing the application to write Parameter names and values to the application log.
Parameter Context values may contain sensitive information depending on application flow configuration.
Deployments of Apache NiFi with the default Logback configuration do not log Parameter Context values.
Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.0.0 or 1.28.1 is the recommendation mitigation, eliminating Parameter value logging from the flow synchronization process regardless of the Logback configuration.

### CVE-2024-45477

* Title: Improper Neutralization of Input in Parameter Description
* Published: 2024-10-28
* Severity: Medium
* Products: Apache NiFi

Apache NiFi 1.10.0 through 1.27.0 and 2.0.0-M1 through 2.0.0-M3 support a description field for Parameters in a Parameter Context
configuration that is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. An authenticated user, authorized to configure a Parameter Context,
can enter arbitrary JavaScript code, which the client browser will execute within the session context of the authenticated user.
Upgrading to Apache NiFi 1.28.0 or 2.0.0-M4 is the recommended mitigation.

### CVE-2024-37389

* Title: Improper Neutralization of Input in Parameter Context Description

Apache NiFi 1.10.0 through 1.26.0 and 2.0.0-M1 through 2.0.0-M3 support a description field in the Parameter Context
configuration that is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. An authenticated user, authorized to configure a Parameter
Context, can enter arbitrary JavaScript code, which the client browser will execute within the session context of the
authenticated user. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 1.27.0 or 2.0.0-M4 is the recommended mitigation.

### CVE-2023-49145

* Title: Improper Neutralization of Input in Advanced User Interface for Jolt
* Published: 2023-11-27
* Severity: High
* Products: Apache NiFi
* Affected Versions: 0.7.0 to 1.23.2
* Fixed Versions: 1.24.0
* Reporter: Dr. Oliver Matula, DB Systel GmbH

  + GitHub Pull Request: [8060](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8060)

Apache NiFi 0.7.0 through 1.23.2 include the JoltTransformJSON Processor, which provides an advanced configuration user
interface that is vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting. If an authenticated user, who is authorized to configure
a JoltTransformJSON Processor, visits a crafted URL, then arbitrary JavaScript code can be executed within the session
context of the authenticated user. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 1.24.0 or 2.0.0-M1 is the recommended mitigation.

### CVE-2023-40037

* Title: Incomplete Validation of JDBC and JNDI Connection URLs
* Published: 2023-08-18
* Severity: Medium
* Products: Apache NiFi
* Affected Versions: 1.21.0 to 1.23.0
* Fixed Versions: 1.23.1
* Reporter: Matei 'Mal' Badanoiu
* References
  + CVE Record: [CVE-2023-40037](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-40037)

  + GitHub Pull Request: [7586](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7586)

Apache NiFi 1.21.0 through 1.23.0 support JDBC and JNDI JMS access in several Processors and Controller Services with
connection URL validation that does not provide sufficient protection against crafted inputs. An authenticated and
authorized user can bypass connection URL validation using custom input formatting. The resolution enhances connection
URL validation and introduces validation for additional related properties. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 1.23.1 is the
recommended mitigation.

### CVE-2023-36542

* Title: Potential Code Injection with Properties Referencing Remote Resources
* Published: 2023-07-28

  + GitHub Pull Request: [7426](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7426)

Apache NiFi 0.0.2 through 1.22.0 include Processors and Controller Services that support HTTP URL references for
retrieving drivers, which allows an authenticated and authorized user to configure a location that enables custom code
execution. The resolution introduces a new Required Permission for referencing remote resources, restricting
configuration of these components to privileged users. The permission prevents unprivileged users from configuring
Processors and Controller Services annotated with the new Reference Remote Resources restriction. Upgrading to Apache
NiFi 1.23.0 is the recommended mitigation.

### CVE-2023-34468

* Title: Potential Code Injection with Database Services using H2
* Published: 2023-06-12

The DBCPConnectionPool and HikariCPConnectionPool Controller Services in Apache NiFi 0.0.2 through 1.21.0 allow an
authenticated and authorized user to configure a Database URL with the H2 driver that enables custom code execution.
The resolution validates the Database URL and rejects H2 JDBC locations. Upgrading to NiFi 1.22.0 disables H2 JDBC URLs
in the default configuration.

### CVE-2023-34212

* Title: Potential Deserialization of Untrusted Data with JNDI in JMS Components

The ExtractCCDAAttributes Processor in Apache NiFi 1.2.0 through 1.19.1 does not restrict XML External Entity
references. Flow configurations that include the ExtractCCDAAttributes Processor are vulnerable to malicious XML
documents that contain Document Type Declarations with XML External Entity references. The resolution disables Document
Type Declarations and disallows XML External Entity resolution in the ExtractCCDAAttributes Processor. Upgrading to NiFi
1.20.0 disables Document Type Declarations in the default configuration for ExtractCCDAAttributes.

The optional ShellUserGroupProvider in Apache NiFi 1.10.0 to 1.16.2 and Apache NiFi Registry 0.6.0 to 1.16.2 does not
neutralize arguments for group resolution commands, allowing injection of operating system commands on Linux and macOS
platforms. The ShellUserGroupProvider is not included in the default configuration. Command injection requires
ShellUserGroupProvider to be one of the enabled User Group Providers in the Authorizers configuration. Command injection
also requires an authenticated user with elevated privileges. Apache NiFi requires an authenticated user with
authorization to modify access policies to execute the command. Apache NiFi Registry requires an authenticated user with
authorization to read user groups to execute the command. NiFi and NiFi Registry version 1.16.3 has completely removed
the shell commands from the ShellUserGroupProvider that received user arguments.

Multiple components in Apache NiFi 0.0.1 to 1.16.0 do not restrict XML External Entity references in the default
configuration. The Standard Content Viewer service attempts to resolve XML External Entity references when viewing
formatted XML files. The following Processors attempt to resolve XML External Entity references when configured with
default property values: EvaluateXPath, EvaluateXQuery, and ValidateXml. Apache NiFi flow configurations that include
these Processors are vulnerable to malicious XML documents that contain Document Type Declarations with XML External
Entity references. Upgrading to NiFi 1.16.1 disables Document Type Declarations in the default configuration for these
processors, and disallows XML External Entity resolution in standard services.

When creating or updating credentials for single-user access, NiFi wrote a copy of the Login Identity Providers
configuration to the operating system temporary directory. The Login Identity Providers configuration file contains the
username and a bcrypt hash of the configured password. On most platforms, the operating system temporary directory has
global read permissions. NiFi immediately moved the temporary file to the final configuration directory, which
significantly limited the window of opportunity for access. Bcrypt is a password-hashing algorithm that incorporates a
random salt and a specified cost factor, designed to maintain resistance to brute-force attacks. Use of the bcrypt
algorithm minimizes the impact of disclosing the single-user credentials stored in Login Identity Providers. NiFi 1.16.0
includes updates to replace the Login Identity Providers configuration without writing a file to the operating system
temporary directory.

The NiFi download token (one-time password) mechanism used a fixed cache size and did not authenticate a request to
create a download token, only when attempting to use the token to access the content. An unauthenticated user could
repeatedly request download tokens, preventing legitimate users from requesting download tokens. NiFi 1.12.0 disabled
anonymous authentication, implemented a multi-indexed cache, and limited token creation requests to
one concurrent request per user. Users running any previous NiFi release should upgrade to 1.12.0.

The NiFi UI and API were protected by mandating TLS v1.2, as well as listening connections established by processors
like ListenHTTP and HandleHttpRequest. However intra-cluster communication such as cluster request replication,
Site-to-Site, and load balanced queues continued to support TLS 1.0 or 1.1. NiFI 1.12.0 refactored disparate internal
SSL and TLS code, reducing exposure for extension and framework developers to low-level primitives. NiFi 1.12. also
added support for TLS v1.3 on supporting JVMs. This version restricted all incoming TLS communications to TLS
1.2 or higher. Users running any previous NiFi release should upgrade to 1.12.0.

  + Apache Jira Issue: [NIFI-3487](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-3487)

In a cluster environment, if an anonymous user request is replicated to another node, the originating node identity is
used rather than the anonymous user. NiFi 0.7.2 and 1.1.2 remove the negative check for anonymous user before building
the proxy chain and throwing an exception, and evaluating each user in the proxy chain iteration and comparing against a
static constant anonymous user. Users running a prior release should upgrade to 0.7.2 or 1.1.2.

In a cluster environment, the proxy chain serialization and deserialization is vulnerable to an injection attack where a
carefully crafted username could impersonate another user and gain their permissions on a replicated request to another
node. NiFi 0.7.2 and 1.1.2 modify the tokenization code and sanitization of user-provided input. Users running a prior
release should upgrade to 0.7.2 or 1.1.2.
