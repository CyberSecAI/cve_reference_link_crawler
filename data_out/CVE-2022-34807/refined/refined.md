  "cve": "CVE-2022-34807",
  "security_issue": "SECURITY-2073",
  "description": "Elasticsearch Query Plugin 1.2 and earlier stores a password unencrypted in its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.elasticsearchquery.ElasticsearchQueryBuilder.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.\n\nThis password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.",
  "root_cause": "The plugin stores the password in plain text within a configuration file on the Jenkins controller's file system.",
  "vulnerability": "Plaintext storage of sensitive information",
   "impact": "The stored password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system. This could lead to unauthorized access to the Elasticsearch instance, depending on the scope and permissions of the password. The impact is low as it requires direct access to the server's file system.",
  "attack_vector": "Local file system access on the Jenkins controller.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have access to the Jenkins controller's file system."
