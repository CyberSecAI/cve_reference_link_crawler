# Summary

Name: Business Logic Flaw in EMSigner’s Web Application User Management Allows Unauthorized Modification of User Names and Privileges

Product: EMSigner

Affected versions: EMSigner version 2.8.7

Affected Component: EndPoint /eMsecure/Users/AdhocUser and web parameter “Name” Attack Type: Remote

Vulnerability Type: Incorrect Access Control

Impact: Integrity

CVSSv3.1 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L

CVSSv3.1 Base Score: 7.1

CVE ID(s): CVE-2023-43901

# Description

Incorrect access control in the AdHoc User creation form of EMSigner v2.8.7 allows unauthenticated attackers to arbitrarily modify usernames and privileges by using the email address of a registered user.

# Vulnerability

The “Business Logic Flaw in EMSigner’s Web Application User Management Allows Unauthorized Modification of User Names and Privileges” vulnerability is rooted in a critical business logic flaw within the user management system of the EMSigner web application. This flaw permits unauthorized users to manipulate user data, including changing user names and downgrading user privileges, when using the email address of a registered user.

# Attack Vectors

The vulnerability is exploited through the web application’s AdHoc User creation form or web request. An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the form or request, allowing them to modify user names and privileges by using the email address of a registered user. This business logic flaw permits unauthorized alteration of existing user data, potentially leading to unauthorized actions and privilege downgrading.

# Explotation

During the web application assessment for one of our clients, we performed an assessment on a web app that used the emSigner software. Now, speaking of emSigner, this software is a document automation solution that helps organizations completely eliminate paper from all workflows and create an end-to-end document automation ecosystem, digitizing documents using legally valid digital signatures.

While researching this web app, we discovered a vulnerability that allows unauthorized modification of user names and downgrading of user privileges by exploiting the AdHoc User creation form or web request. The vulnerability allows overwriting or modifying existing user data, including user names and privileges, when using the email address of a registered user.

Below, we will explain this vulnerability and the steps needed to exploit it.

First logged in as a low-privilege user [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and clicking on the option to create Adhoc Users as shown in figure 1

*Figure* *1* *Adhoc Users*

An attacker sends an HTTP POST request to the AdHoc User creation endpoint at <https://domain.com/eMsecure/Users/AdhocUser>  with the “Name” parameter set to a new name (e.g., “Juan”) and the email address of an existing user as shown in figure 2.

*Figure 2* *Request HTTP*

The server processes the request and successfully updates the user’s name and downgrades their privileges associated with the provided email address as shown in figure 3.

*Figure 3* *Response HTTP*

The victim’s user name is now changed, and they are left with the minimum privileges in the application as shown in figure 4.
