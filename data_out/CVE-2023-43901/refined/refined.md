Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   A business logic flaw exists in the EMSigner web application's user management system, specifically in the AdHoc User creation functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The application fails to properly validate user privileges when creating or modifying AdHoc users.
*   **Lack of proper input validation:** The application does not verify if a user has the right to modify another user's data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Integrity Violation:** Attackers can modify existing user data, including usernames and privileges, leading to potential unauthorized actions.
*   **Privilege Downgrading:** Attackers can downgrade the privileges of existing users, limiting their access and capabilities within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through the AdHoc User creation form or a direct web request to `/eMsecure/Users/AdhocUser`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low-Privilege User:** An attacker needs to be a registered user of the EMSigner application with basic access.
*   **Access to Web Application:** An attacker must have network access to the EMSigner web application.
*  **Email Address of Target User:** The attacker must know or have access to the email address of the user they wish to modify.

**Summary:**

This vulnerability allows a low-privilege user to modify other user's data, including changing their username and downgrading their privileges. This is achieved by sending a crafted web request to the AdHoc User creation endpoint, specifying the target user's email address and the desired username. The application fails to check if the attacker has the right to modify the targeted user.
