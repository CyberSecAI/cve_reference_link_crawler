Advisory 2022-09

3  Vulnerability details

3.1  Detailed Description

CODESYS products such as CODESYS Control runtime systems contain communication servers for the
CODESYS protocol to enable communication with clients like the CODESYS Development System. To limit
resource consumption, the CODESYS runtime system allows a certain number of incoming TCP connections
(CmpBlkDrvTcp) or channel connections (CmpChannelServer, CmpChannelServerEmbedded) of the
CODESYS protocol. Once this limit is reached, it does not allow any new client connection.

An unauthenticated attacker is able to block all available TCP connections or communication channels. If the
attack is repeated, it can permanently prevent legitimate users or clients from establishing a new connection to
the CODESYS runtime system. Existing connections are not affected and therefore remain intact.

CVE-2022-30791: CmpBlkDrvTcp allows unauthenticated attackers to block all its available TCP connections.

CVE-2022-30792: CmpChannelServer, CmpChannelServerEmbedded allow unauthenticated attackers to block
all their available communication channels.

3.2  Exploitability

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

3.3  Difficulty

An attacker with low skills would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

3.4  Existence of exploit

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities in CODESYS products.

4  Available software updates

Advisory 2022-09

The CODESYS Development System and the products available as CODESYS AddOns can be downloaded
and installed directly with the CODESYS Installer or be downloaded from the CODESYS Store.

Alternatively, as well as for all other products, you will find further information on obtaining the software update
in the CODESYS Update area [3].

5  Mitigation

CODESYS GmbH recommends using the available software update to fix the vulnerabilities.

Currently, CODESYS GmbH has not identified any specific workarounds for these vulnerabilities, in case the
software update is not applied.

As part of a security strategy, CODESYS GmbH recommends the following general defense measures to
reduce the risk of exploits:
• Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that
they are not accessible from outside
• Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks
• Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
• Activate and apply user management and password features
• Use encrypted communication links
• Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
• Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions
For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the
CODESYS Security Whitepaper [1].
