The GiveWP â€“ Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'handle_request' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.13.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to edit event ticket settings if the Events beta feature is enabled.
