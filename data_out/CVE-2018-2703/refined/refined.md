  "CVE-2018-2703": {
    "description": "The MySQL server is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack when using sha256_password authentication. This vulnerability can be triggered by a client providing a specially crafted hash with a large rounds value during authentication, potentially causing the server to hang.",
    "affected_products": [
      "MySQL Server versions 5.5.58 and prior, 5.6.38 and prior, 5.7.20 and prior",
        "Red Hat rh-mysql56-mysql",
        "Red Hat rh-mysql57-mysql",
         "NetApp Products incorporating Oracle MySQL"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the rounds value in the sha256_password authentication mechanism, allowing a client to send a specially crafted hash that forces the server into excessive computation, leading to a denial-of-service.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial-of-Service (DoS)",
      "Resource exhaustion",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can cause the MySQL server to hang or crash due to excessive resource consumption, leading to a denial-of-service condition.",
    "attack_vector": "Network",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to initiate a connection to the MySQL server and attempt authentication. No specific privileges or credentials are required to trigger the vulnerability, but knowledge of MySQL protocol or the server setup might be needed for crafting the malicious payload."
