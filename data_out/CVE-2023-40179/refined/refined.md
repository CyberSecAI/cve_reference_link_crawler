- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The password recovery form would throw an error if the specified email was not found in the database, allowing an attacker to determine if an email is associated with a user account.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Account enumeration through inconsistent responses.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can enumerate valid user accounts by observing the system's responses.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack by interacting with the password recovery form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special capabilities or privileges are required. The attacker only needs to interact with the password recovery form.
