Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-39959:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that unauthenticated users can send a DAV request to the Nextcloud server which reveals whether a calendar or address book with a given identifier exists for a user. This occurs because the server does not properly check permissions before responding to the request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The server discloses the existence of calendars or address books to unauthenticated users.
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The vulnerability highlights a lack of proper authorization checks before processing the DAV request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can enumerate existing calendars and address books for users.
- This can be used to create a more targeted attack against users who have these features enabled.
- It's also a privacy violation, as unauthorized users can probe the data structure of a server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed over the network.
- **DAV Request:** Attackers send a specially crafted DAV request to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the Nextcloud instance.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Nextcloud server.
- **Low Technical Skill:** The attack has a low complexity, suggesting it does not require advanced technical capabilities.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is considered **Low** severity.
- The issue was patched in Nextcloud Server versions 25.0.9, 26.0.4 and 27.0.1.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).
- The vulnerability was reported by themarkib.
