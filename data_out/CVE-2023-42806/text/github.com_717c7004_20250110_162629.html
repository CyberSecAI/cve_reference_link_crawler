# Snapshot signature not including HeadID will allow replay attacks

Moderate

[ch1bo](/ch1bo)
published
GHSA-gr36-mc6v-72qq
Sep 21, 2023

## Package

hydra-node

## Affected versions

< 0.13.0

## Patched versions

0.14.0

## Description

### Summary

Not including a unique head identifier in the multi-signatures, allows an attacker to replay old signatures to close or contest a head with a wrong or incompatible head state.

### Details

In the Hydra HeadV1 protocol, all parties do sign snapshots off-chain. The snapshots themselves only include the new UTxO state and a list of transactions which led to that state. Such a "signed snapshot" can then be used as a certificate $\xi$ to close the head or contest a state of a closed head on the main chain.

For that the close & contest validators do check $\mathsf{MSVerify}(\tilde{k}\_H, \mathsf{msg}, \xi) = \mathsf{true}$ where the signed message is $\mathsf{msg} = (\mathsf{cid}, \eta\_0, \eta)$ where $\eta = (sn, U^{\#})$.

The current implementation, however, does **only sign $\eta$** and neither incorporate $\mathsf{cid}$ nor $\eta\_0$ with the following impact:

* Not sign $\mathsf{cid}$: Signatures of the same participants, but from different heads can be re-used or re-played. (Scope of this advisory)
* Not sign $\eta\_0$: Signatures of an open head can be re-used in case the main chain roll-backs "past open" and a *different commit* transaction leads to the head opening. (Out of scope, much harder to mount an attack)

The on-chain verification of the snapshot signature is [here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/ec6c7a2ab651462228475d0b34264e9a182c22bb/hydra-plutus/src/Hydra/Contract/Head.hs#L583-L599)

The off-chain signing of a snapshot is [here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/ec6c7a2ab651462228475d0b34264e9a182c22bb/hydra-node/src/Hydra/HeadLogic.hs#L357) where the [signable representation](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/ec6c7a2ab651462228475d0b34264e9a182c22bb/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Snapshot.hs#L50-L54) decides on the actual bytes signed.

### Impact

Not signing and verifying $\mathsf{cid}$ allows an attacker (which must be a participant of this head) to use a snapshot from an old head instance with the same participants to close the head or contest the state with it.

This can lead to an incorrect distribution of value (= value extraction attack; hard, but possible) or prevent the head to finalize because the value available is not consistent with the closed utxo state (= denial of service; easy).

### Workaround

Rotate keys between heads so not to re-use keys and not result in the same multi-signature participants.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
