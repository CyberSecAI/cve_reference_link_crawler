[v43.1.1](/ckeditor/ckeditor5/tree/v43.1.1)

[`6b1e550`](/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/6b1e550ba3eee4618f36258ee2ed7cbbc2361246)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v43.1.1.

During a recent internal audit, we identified a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the CKEditor 5 clipboard package ([`CVE-2024-45613`](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/security/advisories/GHSA-rgg8-g5x8-wr9v)). This vulnerability could be triggered by a specific user action, leading to unauthorized JavaScript code execution, if the attacker managed to insert malicious content into the editor, which might happen with a very specific editor configuration.

This vulnerability affects **only** installations where the editor configuration meets the following criteria:

1. The [**Block Toolbar**](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/getting-started/setup/toolbar.html#block-toolbar) plugin is enabled.
2. One of the following plugins is also enabled:
   * [**General HTML Support**](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/html/general-html-support.html) with a configuration that permits unsafe markup.
   * [**HTML Embed**](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/html/html-embed.html).

You can read more details in the relevant [security advisory](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/security/advisories/GHSA-rgg8-g5x8-wr9v) and [contact us](https://ckeditor.com/contact/) if you have more questions.

Taking the occasion, we decided to introduce additional hardening to some parts of our codebase that introduce **theoretical and unexploitable issues**. Our security team confirmed that none of these issues were exploitable in a real scenario, however, we decided to fix them, in order to increase the overall security posture of our software.
