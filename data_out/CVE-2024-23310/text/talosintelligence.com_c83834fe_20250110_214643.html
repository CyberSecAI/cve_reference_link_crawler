# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2024-1923

## The Biosig Project libbiosig sopen\_FAMOS\_read use-after-free vulnerability

##### February 20, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2024-23310

##### SUMMARY

A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the sopen\_FAMOS\_read functionality of The Biosig Project libbiosig 2.5.0 and Master Branch (ab0ee111). A specially crafted .famos file can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

The Biosig Project libbiosig 2.5.0

The Biosig Project libbiosig Master Branch (ab0ee111)

##### PRODUCT URLS

libbiosig - <https://biosig.sourceforge.net/index.html>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

9.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-825 - Expired Pointer Dereference

##### DETAILS

Libbiosig is an open source library designed to process various types of medical signal data (EKG, EEG, etc) within a vast variety of different file formats. Libbiosig is also at the core of biosig APIs in Octave and Matlab, sigviewer, and other scientific software utilized for interpreting biomedical signal data.

When reading in or writing out data of any filetype, libbiosig will always end up hitting the `sopen_extended` function:

```
HDRTYPE* sopen_extended(const char* FileName, const char* MODE, HDRTYPE* hdr, biosig_options_type *biosig_options) {
/*
    MODE="r"
        reads file and returns HDR
    MODE="w"
        writes HDR into file
 */

```

This is where the vast majority of parsing logic is for most file types, albeit with some exceptions to this generalization which end up calling more specific `sopen_*` functions. Regardless, unless specifically stated, it’s safe to assume we’re somewhere in this extremely large function. The general flow of `sopen_extended` is as one might expect: initialize generic structures, figure out what file type we’re dealing with, parse the filetype, and finally populate the generic structures that can be utilized by whatever is calling `sopen_extended`. To determine file type, `sopen_extended` calls `getfiletype`, which goes through a list of magic byte comparisons. Alternatively we could force a particular file type, but this is generally more useful when writing data to a file.

Moving on from the generic overview, we can get to be more specific. For our current vulnerability we deal with the imc FAMOS file format, a generic format for quick data analysis. To figure out if we’re dealing with a .famos file, `getfiletype` runs the following magic-byte check:

```
else if (!memcmp(Header1,"|CF,",4))
        hdr->TYPE = FAMOS;

```

Simple enough, and assuming we find a .famos file, `sopen_extended` hits the following branch:

```
#ifdef WITH_FAMOS
        else if (hdr->TYPE==FAMOS) {
            hdr->HeadLen=count;
            sopen_FAMOS_read(hdr);
    }
#endif

```

Worth noting that while the famos file format can be disabled with the `WITH_FAMOS` compiler flag, by default it is enabled. Continuing on into `sopen_FAMOS_read`:

```
EXTERN_C void sopen_FAMOS_read(HDRTYPE* hdr) {
#define Header1 ((char*)hdr->AS.Header)

        size_t count = hdr->HeadLen;

        char *t, *t2;
        const char EOL[] = "|;\xA\xD";
        size_t pos, l1, len;
        pos  = strspn(Header1, EOL);   // [1]
        uint16_t gdftyp, CHAN=0;
        char OnOff=1;
        double Fs = NAN;
        uint32_t NoChanCurrentGroup = 0;    // number of (undefined) channels of current group
        int level = 0;  // to check consistency of file

        char flag_AbstandFile = 0;      // interleaved format ??? used for experimental code

        fprintf(stdout,"SOPEN(FAMOS): support is experimental. Only time series with equidistant sampling and single sampling rate are supported.\n"); // [2]

        while (pos < count-20) { // [3]
            t       = Header1+pos;  // start of line // [4]

            l1      = strcspn(t+5, ","); // [5]
            t[l1+5] = 0;
            len     = atol(t+5);  // [6]
            pos    += 6+l1;
            t2      = Header1+pos;  // start of line // [7]
            if (count < max(pos,hdr->HeadLen)+256) { // HeadLen can be updated... //[8]
                    size_t bufsiz = 4095;
                    hdr->AS.Header = (uint8_t*)realloc(hdr->AS.Header, count+bufsiz+1); // [9]
                    count += ifread(hdr->AS.Header+count,1,bufsiz,hdr);
            }
            pos    += len+1;

        // [...]
        pos += strcspn(Header1+pos,EOL);
        pos += strspn(Header1+pos,EOL);
    }

```

To start, our code skips over any sort of newlines or delimiter at [1], and then prints out the fact that FAMOS support is experimental [2]. Heeding this warning, our input file proceeds with caution as we enter the main logic loop at [3]. The variables `t` [4] is saved to denote the start of the line, `l1` [5] is the length of our current line (the +5 is there since the tags denoting data type are 4 bytes long), `len` ends up being the length of the data of the current line, and finally `t2` ends up pointing to the actual start of our data for the current line. Assuming that our `count` variable is smaller than the position of where we’re about to start reading plus 0xFF [8], then we end up reallocating our memory buffer and reading in more of the file into it. Starting out, `count` is assigned to `hdr->HeadLen`, and so usually ends up being the size of the file, capped out at 0x1000. Regardless, on the first iteration of the loop we will always hit the branch at [8] and reallocate a bigger `hdr->AS.header` than before [9]. We can see an example of this in the gdb output below:

```
sopen_extended.c:3830            hdr->AS.Header = (uint8_t*)malloc(PAGESIZE+1); // [10]
[o.O]> p/x PAGESIZE
$9 = 0x1000
[^.^]> c
Continuing.
Thread 1 hit Breakpoint 1, sopen_FAMOS_read () at ./t210/sopen_famos_read.c:43

[o.o]> c
Continuing.
SOPEN(FAMOS): support is experimental. Only time series with equidistant sampling and single sampling rate are supported.
Thread 1 "" hit Breakpoint 3, 0x000055555562fe74 in realloc ()

rsi            0x1055              4181                // [11]

```

At [10] we clearly see the original `hdr->AS.header` allocation as `malloc(0x10001)`, and then this buffer gets reallocated to size `0x1055` at [11]. All this should be well and good, but let us go on to see how this new buffer is parsed:

```
        if (!strncmp(t,"CF,2",4) && (level==0)) {             // [12]
            level = 1;
        }
        else if (!strncmp(t,"CK,1",4) && (level==1)) {
            level = 2;
        }
        else if (!strncmp(t,"NO,1",4) && ((level==1) || (level==2))) {  // [13]
            int p;
            // Ursprung
            p = strcspn(t2,",");     // [14]
            t2[p] = 0;               // [15]
            // NameLang
            t2 += p+1;
            p = strcspn(t2,",");
            t2[p] = 0;

```

The line at [12] gives the template for reading each line - the first 0x4 bytes should be an opcode of sorts, and a `strncmp` is used to determine what branch to use. For example, assume we’ve traversed through the state machine enough that `level == 2` and also our line starts with `NO,1`, such that we enter the branch at [13]. Since `t2` should point to our actual filedata read into the `hdr->AS.header` buffer that was reallocated, the line at [14] will find the number of non-comma characters and then we null terminate the comma at [15]. Simple enough, but we also now have enough information to discuss the vulnerability. A lesser known fact about the `realloc` function is that it can change the underlying address of the memory buffer that’s passed in, along with the size. As such, it’s critical to always use the return value of `realloc`, which will contain the updated pointer if it ends up changing. While the call to `realloc` at [9] does end up reassigning `hdr->AS.Header`, it does not actually update the `t` and `t2` variables, which will be left dangling on freed memory if the `hdr->AS.Header` buffer ends up shifting (which it usually does). As such, the many uses of `t` and `t2` in `sopen_FAMOS_read` all end up operating on freed memory for one iteration of the loop at [3] whenever the `realloc` at [9] moves the memory buffer, resulting in many different possible use-after-free read and write situations and potential code execution.
