This fixes [CVE-2024-22190](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2mqj-m65w-jghx "CVE-2024-22190").

Although [#1636](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1636) caused GitPython to avoid using an untrusted search path on Windows under the most typical circumstances, it turns out that some cases remained. I believe only two remain at this time. This pull request fixes those. The CI status on all commits appears to be as I expected and intended.

This vulnerability was reported privately, initially without a full public writeup, since I wanted to get the pull request out as coordinated/requested, without extra delays. A summary of the vulnerability this fixes is now available in the [CVE-2024-22190](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2mqj-m65w-jghx "CVE-2024-22190") advisory. Further information about these changes is present in the commit messages. For the benefit of future readers, I have also since added some more information below, lightly adapted from my original disclosure.

---

I have found that the fix for [CVE-2023-40590](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wfm5-v35h-vwf4 "CVE-2023-40590") ([#1635](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/1635)) that I contributed in [#1636](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1636) was unfortunately incomplete, missing two cases.

When `git` is run with a shell, setting the [`NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processenv/nf-processenv-needcurrentdirectoryforexepatha#remarks) environment variable in the caller's environment is insufficient, because the shell subprocess is what performs the path search. When a shell is used, the child process's environment needs to have that variable set. This does not happen automatically, because while the `env` dict is based on `os.environ`, it is created before `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath` is set in the caller environment. Omitting that variable from the child process's environment was intentional, to avoid modifying the operation of child processes more than necessary. (`git` itself does not need that variable to be set to avoid looking in the current directory to run its own subprocesses, including custom commands.) But it has to be done when a shell is used.

In addition, when GitPython uses `bash.exe` to run hooks, it does not do anything to avoid finding and running `bash.exe` in the current directory, which may be the working tree of an untrusted repository. Because in some reasonable workflows one checks out a branch from an untrusted remote to review it, and such a branch could contain a malicious `bash.exe`, this is exploitable. The description of [CVE-2023-40590](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wfm5-v35h-vwf4 "CVE-2023-40590") had mentioned *"And there are other commands executed that should probably be aware of this problem,"* but I had not given enough attention to that point when working on the fix, nor recognized its full ramifications.

Historically there have been other places in GitPython where a subprocess was created insecurely on Windows, but I believe that is no longer the case. The call to [`taskkill`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/taskkill) was removed ([#1754](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1754)), and a call to `ps` does not occur on Windows because it is part of the `kill_after_timeout` feature of `Git.execute` ([#1756](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/1756), [#1761](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1761)). This is not true of the test suite, but when running tests, a more trusted environment can reasonably be assumed: people trust the directory out of which they are intentionally running the test suite, and I don't think any test cases attempt git operations directly in `/tmp` anymore, as opposed to a subdirectory ([#1744](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/1744), [#1759](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1759)). Therefore I believe these are the only places that need to be changed. I searched for the names of all `subprocess` module functions and I did not find other problematic calls.

The `shell=True` bug was not detected before, due to a combination of two flaws in the regression tests I wrote in [#1636](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1636) for [CVE-2023-40590](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wfm5-v35h-vwf4 "CVE-2023-40590"). First, I did not commit a test with `shell=True`. Second, although I had also tried it locally with `shell=True`, the test contained a shortcoming that prevented it from revealing the vulnerability in that case. It entered a new temporary directory with an impostor `git.exe` in it. But when `shell=True`, the relevant CWD is that of the `cmd.exe` shell subprocess, which was the `rorepo` working tree rather than the GitPython process's CWD. My patch clarifies the test, creating a repository explicitly so that all the test logic is plain, and it parameterizes the test to cover substantially more cases, including when the devious `git.exe` is in the repository and `git` is run with a shell.

I have likewise undertaken efforts to make the newly introduced `bash.exe` impostor test robust, tried it out with each of the `WinBashStatus` cases, and set up the impostor scenario in a way that allows the effect to be observed whether or not a real `bash.exe` is available and whether or not it is usable.

To avoid code duplication, make intent clearer, and make it easier to avoid introducing new untrusted search path bugs, this patch extracts both the shell and non-shell logic for preventing such bugs to a `safer_popen` function that can be used like `Popen` with no special forethought. This function also documents the relevant issues, including the strange but important distinction on Windows between shell and non-shell executable search behavior (i.e., why facilities such as [`shutil.which`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.which) or the external [`where`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/where) command often don't do what we need, on Windows). Having this in one place should also aid in future improvements to the technique used, such as to mitigate or eliminate the race condition on `os.environ` that [irwand commented about](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1650#issuecomment-1710089136) in [#1650](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1650). On non-Windows systems, `safer_popen` is simply an alias for `Popen`.

Because `Git.USE_SHELL = True` was useful for suppressing undesired console windows in graphical applications on Windows ([#126](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/126), [1c2dd54](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/commit/1c2dd54358dd526d1d08a8e4a977f041aff74174), [#360](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/360)) prior to [2.0.8](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/main/doc/source/changes.rst#208---features-and-bugfixes) ([0d93908](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/commit/0d9390866f9ce42870d3116094cd49e0019a970a), [#469](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/469)), and is only much more recently longer documented as recommended for that ([#1781](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/1781), [#1782](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1782), [#1787](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1787)), it is likely that a significant minority of applications use it on Windows. Searching on GitHub, and the web more broadly, turns up some uses and makes me think this may be so. In contrast, I doubt many people intentionally use GitPython to run hooks. But this happens automatically if it is used in a repository with a pre-commit hook enabled.

Sorry, something went wrong.

`[Show "not from cwd" test is broken for shell=True](/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1792/commits/1c65efbe73513028510fe3fb599777a721f8d80c "Show \"not from cwd\" test is broken for shell=True

`[Correct the "not from cwd" test and add more cases](/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1792/commits/2b47933fba1e9266edb1bb71163768288bbfd409 "Correct the \"not from cwd\" test and add more cases

This shows that CVE-2023-40590 is only partially patched. This
commit does not fix the vulnerbility, only the test.

The problem is that, when shell=True, the environment of the shell
subprocess, instead of the GitPython process, determines whether
searching for the \"git\" command will use the current directory.
Currently NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath is set only in the
current process, and this is done after the environment for the
subprocess (env) is computed. So when git is an indirect subprocess
due to shell=True, Windows still checks a CWD when looking it up.

(Note that this should not be a problem for indirect subprocesses
started by git itself. When a standard git command is implemented
as an external executable, when git runs a custom command, and when
one git command delegates some of its work to another -- e.g.
\"git clone\" running git-remote-https -- Git for Windows already
does not search the current directory. Custom git commands that
start their own git subprocesses could have an analogous path
search bug, but this would be separate from the bug in GitPython.)

This is an exploitable vulnerability in GitPython. Although
shell=True is rarer and inherently less secure than the default of
shell=False, it still ought to avoid automatically running an
executable that may exist only due to having been cloned as part of
an untrusted repository. In addition, historically programs on
Windows had sometimes used shell=True as a workaround for console
windows being displayed for subprocesses, and some such code may
still be in use.

Furthermore, even when GitPython's current working directory is
outside the repository being worked on, the Git object in a Repo
instance's \"git\" attribute holds the repository directory as its
\"_working_dir\" attribute, which Git.execute consults to determine
the value of \"cwd\" to pass to subprocess.Popen. When the created
direct subprocess is really a shell, this is the CWD where git.exe
is looked for before searching PATH directories.

This is also why previous, more limited testing (including
accompanying manual testing with shell=True) didn't discover the
bug. Even when modified to test with shell=True, the old test had
the \"impostor\" git.exe in the GitPython process's own current
directory (which was changed to a temporary directory for the test,
where the \"impostor\" was created, but this was separate from the
working tree of the self.git repository). This was effective for
the shell=False case, but not the shell=True case where the
impostor would be found and run in the repository directory even
when it differs from the GitPython process's CWD.")`

This shows that run_commit_hook is vulnerable to an untrusted
search path bug on Windows, when running script hooks: bash.exe is
run without setting NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath or otherwise
excluding the current directory from the path search.

The new test uses a non-bare repo, even though the surrounding
tests use bare repos. Although the test also works if the repo is
initialized with `Repo.init(rw_dir, bare=True)`, using a bare repo
would obscure how the bug this test reveals would typically be
exploited, where a command that uses a hook is run after a
malicious bash.exe is checked out into the working tree from an
untrusted branch.

Running hooks that are themselves provided by an untrusted
repository or branch is of course never safe. If an attacker can
deceive a user into doing that, then this vulnerability is not
needed. Instead, an attack that leverages this untrusted search
path vulnerability would most likely be of roughly this form:

1. The user clones a trusted repository and installs hooks.
2. A malicious party offers a contribution to the project.
3. The user checks out the malicious party's untrusted branch.
4. The user performs an action that runs a hook.

The hook the user runs is still trusted, but it runs with the
malicious bash.exe found in the current directory (which is the
working tree or perhaps some subdirectory of it).

The test added in this commit should, if possible, be improved to
be able to run and detect the bug (or its absence) even when bash
is absent from the Windows system and, preferably, also even when
the WSL bash.exe is present but no WSL distribution is installed.")`

This creates git.util.safer_popen that, on non-Windows systems, is
bound to subprocess.Popen (to avoid introducing unnecessary
latency). On Windows, it is a function that wraps subprocess.Popen,
consolidating two pieces of logic that had previously been
duplicated:

1. Temporarily setting NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath in the
   calling environment and, when shell=True is used, setting it in
   the subprocess environment as well. This prevents executables
   specified as single names (which are mainly \"git\" and, for
   hooks, \"bash.exe\") from being searched for in the current
   working directory of GitPython or, when a shell is used, the
   current working directory of the shell used to run them.

2. Passing the CREATE_NO_WINDOW and CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP flags
   as creationflags. This is not a security measure. It is
   indirectly related to safety in that CREATE_NO_WINDOW eliminated
   at least some, and possibly all, cases where calling Git.execute
   (directly, or indirectly via a dynamic method) with shell=True
   conferred an advantage over the inherently more secure default
   of shell=False; and CREATE_NEW_PROCESS facilitates some ways of
   terminating subprocesses that would otherwise be unavailable,
   thereby making resource exhaustion less likely. But really the
   reason I included creationflags here is that it seems it should
   always be used in the same situations as preventing the current
   directory from being searched (and always was), and including it
   further reduces code duplication and simplifies calling code.

This commit does not improve security or robustness, because these
features were already present. Instead, this moves them to a single
location. It also documents them by giving the function bound to
safer_popen on Windows, _safer_popen_windows, a detailed docstring.

Because there would otherwise be potential for confusion on the
different ways to perform or customize path searches, I have also
added a doctring to py_where noting its limited use case and its
relationship to shutil.which and non-shell search.

(The search in _safer_popen_windows is typically a non-shell
search, which is why it cannot be reimplemented to do its own
lookup by calling an only slightly modified version of
shutil.which, without a risk of breaking some currently working
uses. It may, however, be possible to fix the race condition by
doing something analogous for Windows non-shell search behavior,
which is largely but not entirely described in the documentation

Thanks so much for figuring this out (!!) and for providing not only the fix, but also the tests that exemplify the issue while assuring they are now fixed.

I will create a new release shortly.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I hope it's okay that I've made a small edit to the advisory to fix some confusing and slightly inaccurate wording that I had missed when first writing it. I'd be pleased to make any further changes if desired (or even undo this change if for some reason it is not considered beneficial).  I've applied the change already at [the advisory on this repository](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/security/advisories/GHSA-2mqj-m65w-jghx). For [the global advisory](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2mqj-m65w-jghx), I cannot apply the change directly; I've submitted [github/advisory-database#3290](https://github.com/github/advisory-database/pull/3290).  I've noticed that these changes may be hard to spot quickly in the public web-based interface, so I've also made a gist whose [revision history shows](https://gist.github.com/EliahKagan/478e34530f88df77580f436526130a7e/revisions#diff-0ebb4bc00c0cb17af8a1e7dc079aed4cf1a07f35872d40ec0b84cdbedf183142) the proposed changes. |

| Thanks a lot, and since the first time I wasn't able to suggest improvements, now that it is further improved, I am even more out of my ability to do so. I am sure, however, that the one reviewing the advisory PR will come to the same conclusion and merge the improvements.  Thanks again for your relentless pursuit of excellence! |

`[Fix mypy error with creationflags in subprocess module](/EliahKagan/GitPython/commit/dc95a768b3381cf5a68fc9ad4e8dc4bba37b0ca0 "Fix mypy error with creationflags in subprocess module

On Windows, Python's subprocess module contains constants useful to
pass to the `creationflags` parameter of subprocess.Popen. These
are absent on other platforms, where they are not meaningful.

The code was already safe at runtime from any AttributeError
related to these constants, because they were only used in
git.cmd._safer_popen_windows, which was defined on Windows.

But in #1792 I did not write the code in a way where mypy can
verify its correctness. So if a regression of the kind mypy can in
principle catch were to occur, it would be harder to notice it.

This refactors the code, keeping the same behavior but expressing
it in a way mypy can understand. This consists of two changes:

1. Only define _safer_popen_windows when the platform is Windows,
   placing it in the first branch of the `if` statement.

   This is needed because mypy will not take the only current call
   to that nonpublic function being on Windows as sufficient
   evidence that the platform is always Windows when it is run.

2. Determine the platform, for this purpose, using sys.platform
   instead of os.name.

   These are far from equivalent in general (see the deprecation
   rationale for is_<platform> in #1732, revised in a0fa2bd
   in #1787). However, in Python 3 (GitPython no longer supports
   Python 2), in the specific case of Windows, we have a choice of
   which to use, as both `sys.platform == \"win32\"` and
   `os.name == \"nt\"`.

   os.name is \"nt\" on native Windows, and \"posix\" on Cygwin.
   sys.platform is \"win32\" on native Windows (including 64-bit
   systems with 64-bit Python builds), and \"cygwin\" on Cygwin. See:
   https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.platform

   This is needed because the type stubs for the subprocess module
   use this sys.platform check (rather than an os.name check) to
   determine if the platform is Windows for the purpose of deciding
   which constants to say the subprocess module defines.

I have verified that neither of these changes is enough by itself.")`

`[Expand USE_SHELL docstring; clarify a test usage](/EliahKagan/GitPython/commit/bdabb21fe62063ce51fcae6b5f499f10f55525c5 "Expand USE_SHELL docstring; clarify a test usage

In the USE_SHELL docstring:

- Restore the older wording \"when executing git commands\" rather
  than \"to execute git commands\". I've realized that longer phrase,
  which dates back to the introduction of USE_SHELL in 1c2dd54, is
  clearer, because readers less familiar with GitPython's overall
  design and operation will still not be misled into thinking
  USE_SHELL ever affects whether GitPython uses an external git
  command, versus some other mechanism, to do something.

- Give some more information about why USE_SHELL = True is unsafe
  (though further revision or clarification may be called for).

- Note some non-obvious aspects of USE_SHELL, that some of the way
  it interacts with other aspects of GitPython is not part of what
  is or has been documented about it, and in practice changes over
  time. The first example relates to #1792; the second may help
  users understand why code that enables USE_SHELL on Windows, in
  addition to being unsafe there, often breaks immediately on other
  platforms; the third is included so the warnings in the expanded
  docstring are not interpreted as a new commitment that any shell
  syntax that may have a *desired* effect in some application will
  continue to have the same effect in the future.

- Cover a second application that might lead, or have led, to
  setting USE_SHELL to True, and explain what to do instead.

In test_successful_default_refresh_invalidates_cached_version_info:

- Rewrite the commented explanation of a special variant of that
  second application, where the usual easy alternatives are not
  used because part of the goal of the test is to check a \"default\"
  scenario that does not include either of them. This better
  explains why that choice is made in the test, and also hopefully
  will prevent anyone from thinking that test is a model for
  another situation (which, as noted, is unlikely to be the case
  even in unit tests).")`

- Give some more information about why USE_SHELL = True is unsafe
  (though further revision or clarification may be called for).

- Note some non-obvious aspects of USE_SHELL, that some of the way
  it interacts with other aspects of GitPython is not part of what
  is or has been documented about it, and in practice changes over
  time. The first example relates to [gitpython-developers#1792](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1792); the second may help
  users understand why code that enables USE_SHELL on Windows, in
  addition to being unsafe there, often breaks immediately on other
  platforms; the third is included so the warnings in the expanded
  docstring are not interpreted as a new commitment that any shell
  syntax that may have a *desired* effect in some application will
  continue to have the same effect in the future.

- Cover a second application that might lead, or have led, to
  setting USE_SHELL to True, and explain what to do instead.

In test_successful_default_refresh_invalidates_cached_version_info:

- Rewrite the commented explanation of a special variant of that
  second application, where the usual easy alternatives are not
  used because part of the goal of the test is to check a "default"
  scenario that does not include either of them. This better
  explains why that choice is made in the test, and also hopefully
  will prevent anyone from thinking that test is a model for
  another situation (which, as noted, is unlikely to be the case
  even in unit tests).

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[CVE-2024-22190](https://togithub.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/security/advisories/GHSA-2mqj-m65w-jghx)

### Summary

This issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-40590. On
Windows, GitPython uses an untrusted search path if it uses a shell to
run `git`, as well as when it runs `bash.exe` to interpret hooks. If
either of those features are used on Windows, a malicious `git.exe` or
`bash.exe` may be run from an untrusted repository.

### Details

Although GitPython often avoids executing programs found in an untrusted
search path since 3.1.33, two situations remain where this still occurs.
Either can allow arbitrary code execution under some circumstances.

#### When a shell is used

GitPython can be told to run `git` commands through a shell rather than
as direct subprocesses, by passing `shell=True` to any method that
accepts it, or by both setting `Git.USE_SHELL = True` and not passing
`shell=False`. Then the Windows `cmd.exe` shell process performs the
path search, and GitPython does not prevent that shell from finding and
running `git` in the current directory.

When GitPython runs `git` directly rather than through a shell, the
GitPython process performs the path search, and currently omits the
current directory by setting `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath` in its
own environment during the `Popen` call. Although the `cmd.exe` shell
will honor this environment variable when present, GitPython does not
currently pass it into the shell subprocess's environment.

Furthermore, because GitPython sets the subprocess CWD to the root of a
repository's working tree, using a shell will run a malicious `git.exe`
in an untrusted repository even if GitPython itself is run from a
trusted location.

This also applies if `Git.execute` is called directly with `shell=True`
(or after `Git.USE_SHELL = True`) to run any command.

#### When hook scripts are run

On Windows, GitPython uses `bash.exe` to run hooks that appear to be
scripts. However, unlike when running `git`, no steps are taken to avoid
finding and running `bash.exe` in the current directory.

This allows the author of an untrusted fork or branch to cause a
malicious `bash.exe` to be run in some otherwise safe workflows. An
example of such a scenario is if the user installs a trusted hook while
on a trusted branch, then switches to an untrusted feature branch
(possibly from a fork) to review proposed changes. If the untrusted
feature branch contains a malicious `bash.exe` and the user's current
working directory is the working tree, and the user performs an action
that runs the hook, then although the hook itself is uncorrupted, it
runs with the malicious `bash.exe`.

Note that, while `bash.exe` is a shell, this is a separate scenario from
when `git` is run using the unrelated Windows `cmd.exe` shell.

### PoC

On Windows, create a `git.exe` file in a repository. Then create a
`Repo` object, and call any method through it (directly or indirectly)
that supports the `shell` keyword argument with `shell=True`:

```powershell
mkdir testrepo
git init testrepo
cp ... testrepo git.exe # Replace \"...\" with any executable of choice.
python -c \"import git; print(git.Repo('testrepo').git.version(shell=True))\"
```

The `git.exe` executable in the repository directory will be run.

Or use no `Repo` object, but do it from the location with the `git.exe`:

```powershell
cd testrepo
python -c \"import git; print(git.Git().version(shell=True))\"
```

The `git.exe` executable in the current directory will be run.

For the scenario with hooks, install a hook in a repository, create a
`bash.exe` file in the current directory, and perform an operation that
causes GitPython to attempt to run the hook:

```powershell
mkdir testrepo
cd testrepo
git init
mv .git/hooks/pre-commit.sample .git/hooks/pre-commit
cp ... bash.exe # Replace \"...\" with any executable of choice.
echo \"Some text\" >file.txt
git add file.txt
python -c \"import git; git.Repo().index.commit('Some message')\"
```

The `bash.exe` executable in the current directory will be run.

### Impact

The greatest impact is probably in applications that set `Git.USE_SHELL
= True` for historical reasons. (Undesired console windows had, in the
past, been created in some kinds of applications, when it was not used.)
Such an application may be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution from a
malicious repository, even with no other exacerbating conditions. This
is to say that, if a shell is used to run `git`, the full effect of
CVE-2023-40590 is still present. Furthermore, as noted above, running
the application itself from a trusted directory is not a sufficient
mitigation.

An application that does not direct GitPython to use a shell to run
`git` subprocesses thus avoids most of the risk. However, there is no
such straightforward way to prevent GitPython from running `bash.exe` to
interpret hooks. So while the conditions needed for that to be exploited
are more involved, it may be harder to mitigate decisively prior to
patching.

### Possible solutions

A straightforward approach would be to address each bug directly:

- When a shell is used, pass `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath` into
the subprocess environment, because in that scenario the subprocess is
the `cmd.exe` shell that itself performs the path search.
- Set `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath` in the GitPython process
environment during the `Popen` call made to run hooks with a `bash.exe`
subprocess.

These need only be done on Windows.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[CVE-2024-22190](https://togithub.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/security/advisories/GHSA-2mqj-m65w-jghx)

### Summary

This issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-40590. On
Windows, GitPython uses an untrusted search path if it uses a shell to
run `git`, as well as when it runs `bash.exe` to interpret hooks. If
either of those features are used on Windows, a malicious `git.exe` or
`bash.exe` may be run from an untrusted repository.

### Details

Although GitPython often avoids executing programs found in an untrusted
search path since 3.1.33, two situations remain where this still occurs.
Either can allow arbitrary code execution under some circumstances.

#### When a shell is used

GitPython can be told to run `git` commands through a shell rather than
as direct subprocesses, by passing `shell=True` to any method that
accepts it, or by both setting `Git.USE_SHELL = True` and not passing
`shell=False`. Then the Windows `cmd.exe` shell process performs the
path search, and GitPython does not prevent that shell from finding and
running `git` in the current directory.

When GitPython runs `git` directly rather than through a shell, the
GitPython process performs the path search, and currently omits the
current directory by setting `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath` in its
own environment during the `Popen` call. Although the `cmd.exe` shell
will honor this environment variable when present, GitPython does not
currently pass it into the shell subprocess's environment.

Furthermore, because GitPython sets the subprocess CWD to the root of a
repository's working tree, using a shell will run a malicious `git.exe`
in an untrusted repository even if GitPython itself is run from a
trusted location.

This also applies if `Git.execute` is called directly with `shell=True`
(or after `Git.USE_SHELL = True`) to run any command.

#### When hook scripts are run

On Windows, GitPython uses `bash.exe` to run hooks that appear to be
scripts. However, unlike when running `git`, no steps are taken to avoid
finding and running `bash.exe` in the current directory.

This allows the author of an untrusted fork or branch to cause a
malicious `bash.exe` to be run in some otherwise safe workflows. An
example of such a scenario is if the user installs a trusted hook while
on a trusted branch, then switches to an untrusted feature branch
(possibly from a fork) to review proposed changes. If the untrusted
feature branch contains a malicious `bash.exe` and the user's current
working directory is the working tree, and the user performs an action
that runs the hook, then although the hook itself is uncorrupted, it
runs with the malicious `bash.exe`.

Note that, while `bash.exe` is a shell, this is a separate scenario from
when `git` is run using the unrelated Windows `cmd.exe` shell.

### PoC

On Windows, create a `git.exe` file in a repository. Then create a
`Repo` object, and call any method through it (directly or indirectly)
that supports the `shell` keyword argument with `shell=True`:

```powershell
mkdir testrepo
git init testrepo
cp ... testrepo git.exe # Replace \"...\" with any executable of choice.
python -c \"import git; print(git.Repo('testrepo').git.version(shell=True))\"
```

The `git.exe` executable in the repository directory will be run.

Or use no `Repo` object, but do it from the location with the `git.exe`:

```powershell
cd testrepo
python -c \"import git; print(git.Git().version(shell=True))\"
```

The `git.exe` executable in the current directory will be run.

For the scenario with hooks, install a hook in a repository, create a
`bash.exe` file in the current directory, and perform an operation that
causes GitPython to attempt to run the hook:

```powershell
mkdir testrepo
cd testrepo
git init
mv .git/hooks/pre-commit.sample .git/hooks/pre-commit
cp ... bash.exe # Replace \"...\" with any executable of choice.
echo \"Some text\" >file.txt
git add file.txt
python -c \"import git; git.Repo().index.commit('Some message')\"
```

The `bash.exe` executable in the current directory will be run.

### Impact

The greatest impact is probably in applications that set `Git.USE_SHELL
= True` for historical reasons. (Undesired console windows had, in the
past, been created in some kinds of applications, when it was not used.)
Such an application may be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution from a
malicious repository, even with no other exacerbating conditions. This
is to say that, if a shell is used to run `git`, the full effect of
CVE-2023-40590 is still present. Furthermore, as noted above, running
the application itself from a trusted directory is not a sufficient
mitigation.

An application that does not direct GitPython to use a shell to run
`git` subprocesses thus avoids most of the risk. However, there is no
such straightforward way to prevent GitPython from running `bash.exe` to
interpret hooks. So while the conditions needed for that to be exploited
are more involved, it may be harder to mitigate decisively prior to
patching.

### Possible solutions

A straightforward approach would be to address each bug directly:

- When a shell is used, pass `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath` into
the subprocess environment, because in that scenario the subprocess is
the `cmd.exe` shell that itself performs the path search.
- Set `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath` in the GitPython process
environment during the `Popen` call made to run hooks with a `bash.exe`
subprocess.

These need only be done on Windows.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[[CVE-2024-22190](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2mqj-m65w-jghx "CVE-2024-22190")](<https://togithub.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/security/advisories/GHSA-2mqj-m65w-jghx>)

### Summary

This issue exists because of an incomplete fix for [CVE-2023-40590](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wfm5-v35h-vwf4 "CVE-2023-40590"). On
Windows, GitPython uses an untrusted search path if it uses a shell to
run `git`, as well as when it runs `bash.exe` to interpret hooks. If
either of those features are used on Windows, a malicious `git.exe` or
`bash.exe` may be run from an untrusted repository.

### Details

Although GitPython often avoids executing programs found in an untrusted
search path since 3.1.33, two situations remain where this still occurs.
Either can allow arbitrary code execution under some circumstances.

#### When a shell is used

GitPython can be told to run `git` commands through a shell rather than
as direct subprocesses, by passing `shell=True` to any method that
accepts it, or by both setting `Git.USE_SHELL = True` and not passing
`shell=False`. Then the Windows `cmd.exe` shell process performs the
path search, and GitPython does not prevent that shell from finding and
running `git` in the current directory.

When GitPython runs `git` directly rather than through a shell, the
GitPython process performs the path search, and currently omits the
current directory by setting `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath` in its
own environment during the `Popen` call. Although the `cmd.exe` shell
will honor this environment variable when present, GitPython does not
currently pass it into the shell subprocess's environment.

Furthermore, because GitPython sets the subprocess CWD to the root of a
repository's working tree, using a shell will run a malicious `git.exe`
in an untrusted repository even if GitPython itself is run from a
trusted location.

This also applies if `Git.execute` is called directly with `shell=True`
(or after `Git.USE_SHELL = True`) to run any command.

#### When hook scripts are run

On Windows, GitPython uses `bash.exe` to run hooks that appear to be
scripts. However, unlike when running `git`, no steps are taken to avoid
finding and running `bash.exe` in the current directory.

This allows the author of an untrusted fork or branch to cause a
malicious `bash.exe` to be run in some otherwise safe workflows. An
example of such a scenario is if the user installs a trusted hook while
on a trusted branch, then switches to an untrusted feature branch
(possibly from a fork) to review proposed changes. If the untrusted
feature branch contains a malicious `bash.exe` and the user's current
working directory is the working tree, and the user performs an action
that runs the hook, then although the hook itself is uncorrupted, it
runs with the malicious `bash.exe`.

Note that, while `bash.exe` is a shell, this is a separate scenario from
when `git` is run using the unrelated Windows `cmd.exe` shell.

### PoC

On Windows, create a `git.exe` file in a repository. Then create a
`Repo` object, and call any method through it (directly or indirectly)
that supports the `shell` keyword argument with `shell=True`:

```powershell
mkdir testrepo
git init testrepo
cp ... testrepo git.exe # Replace "..." with any executable of choice.
python -c "import git; print(git.Repo('testrepo').git.version(shell=True))"
```

The `git.exe` executable in the repository directory will be run.

Or use no `Repo` object, but do it from the location with the `git.exe`:

```powershell
cd testrepo
python -c "import git; print(git.Git().version(shell=True))"
```

The `git.exe` executable in the current directory will be run.

For the scenario with hooks, install a hook in a repository, create a
`bash.exe` file in the current directory, and perform an operation that
causes GitPython to attempt to run the hook:

```powershell
mkdir testrepo
cd testrepo
git init
mv .git/hooks/pre-commit.sample .git/hooks/pre-commit
cp ... bash.exe # Replace "..." with any executable of choice.
echo "Some text" >file.txt
git add file.txt
python -c "import git; git.Repo().index.commit('Some message')"
```

The `bash.exe` executable in the current directory will be run.

### Impact

The greatest impact is probably in applications that set `Git.USE_SHELL
= True` for historical reasons. (Undesired console windows had, in the
past, been created in some kinds of applications, when it was not used.)
Such an application may be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution from a
malicious repository, even with no other exacerbating conditions. This
is to say that, if a shell is used to run `git`, the full effect of
[CVE-2023-40590](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wfm5-v35h-vwf4 "CVE-2023-40590") is still present. Furthermore, as noted above, running
the application itself from a trusted directory is not a sufficient
mitigation.

An application that does not direct GitPython to use a shell to run
`git` subprocesses thus avoids most of the risk. However, there is no
such straightforward way to prevent GitPython from running `bash.exe` to
interpret hooks. So while the conditions needed for that to be exploited
are more involved, it may be harder to mitigate decisively prior to
patching.

### Possible solutions

A straightforward approach would be to address each bug directly:

- When a shell is used, pass `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath` into
the subprocess environment, because in that scenario the subprocess is
the `cmd.exe` shell that itself performs the path search.
- Set `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath` in the GitPython process
environment during the `Popen` call made to run hooks with a `bash.exe`
subprocess.

These need only be done on Windows.
