{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of URL encoding of user-provided input in functions like `Client.rest.channels.removeBan`. This allows for path traversal by injecting crafted input strings.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-23 Path Traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "By injecting specially crafted inputs such as `../../../channels/{id}`, an attacker can cause the application to normalize the URL to `/api/v10/channels/{id}`, leading to the deletion of a channel instead of removing a ban as intended. This could result in unauthorized resource deletion.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through user input provided to functions within the `oceanic.js` library that handle URL construction.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to provide input to functions that construct URLs, such as `Client.rest.channels.removeBan`. This could potentially be any user-controlled input processed by the affected functions."
  },
  "affected_versions": "< 1.10.4",
  "patched_versions": "1.10.4",
  "workarounds": [
    "Sanitizing user input, ensuring strings are valid for the purpose they are being used for.",
    "Encoding input with `encodeURIComponent` before providing it to the library."
  ],
   "cve_id": "CVE-2024-34712"
