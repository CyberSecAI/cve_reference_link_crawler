# Unsanitized user input can lead to path traversal in URLs

Moderate

[DonovanDMC](/DonovanDMC)
published
GHSA-5h5v-hw44-f6gg
May 14, 2024

## Package

npm

oceanic.js
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 1.10.4

## Patched versions

1.10.4

## Description

### Impact

Input to functions such as `Client.rest.channels.removeBan` is not url-encoded, resulting in specially crafted input such as `../../../channels/{id}` being normalized into the url `/api/v10/channels/{id}`, and deleting a channel rather than removing a ban.

### Workarounds

* Sanitizing user input, ensuring strings are valid for the purpose they are being used for.
* Encoding input with `encodeURIComponent` before providing it to the library.

### References

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-34712

### Weaknesses

[CWE-23](/advisories?query=cwe%3A23)
