Based on the provided information, this content is related to the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-48895.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the uncoordinated interaction between the IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) group removal and the shutdown procedure of a PCI device, specifically the `fsl_enetc` driver. The `arm_smmu_device_shutdown()` function was inadvertently causing the IOMMU device to unregister, which in turn triggered the removal of IOMMU groups used by other devices while those devices might still be using DMA (Direct Memory Access).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `arm_smmu_device_shutdown()` function was made to behave the same as `arm_smmu_device_remove()`, causing the IOMMU device to unregister during shutdown.
- The `iommu_device_unregister()` call was made to call `remove_iommu_group()`, which was not intended during shutdown
- The shutdown procedure of the `enetc` driver was not coordinated with IOMMU group removal, leading to a race condition.
- The dependency of devices on IOMMU groups was not being properly handled during shutdown.
- The assumption that PCI device drivers must implement `shutdown()` if DMA is used with an IOMMU was not correct.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel panic due to NULL pointer dereference. This happens because the IOMMU domain might be released during shutdown of the SMMU, while the network device is still trying to perform DMA operations using that domain.
- System instability during shutdown or reboot.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a system shutdown or reboot, especially when forced (`reboot -f`).
- The problem is more easily triggered by network activity, such as a ping flood, which causes the `enetc` driver to continuously perform DMA operations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need special capabilities as the vulnerability is triggered by the shutdown process itself.
- The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by initiating a forceful reboot (`reboot -f`) while the system is under network load.

**Technical Details:**
- The commit `b06c076ea962` made `arm_smmu_device_shutdown()` run the exact same code as `arm_smmu_device_remove()`.
- The commit `57365a04c921` made `iommu_device_unregister()` call `remove_iommu_group()`.
- The fix restores the old shutdown behavior by making remove() call shutdown(), but shutdown() does not call the remove() specific bits. The `shutdown()` method now only handles disabling translation, while the `remove()` method handles unregistering the IOMMU device and removing it from sysfs.
- The vulnerability is observed during a forced reboot (`reboot -f`). The stack trace provided shows null pointer dereferences within `iommu_get_dma_domain` during `iommu_dma_map_page` and `iommu_dma_unmap_page` operations related to the `enetc` driver.
- The fix involves modifying `drivers/iommu/arm/arm-smmu/arm-smmu.c` to separate the shutdown and remove functions, preventing the premature unregistration of the IOMMU during the shutdown procedure.

This patch fixes the issue by restoring the original behavior: `remove` calls `shutdown` to disable translation, unregisters the IOMMU device and removes it from sysfs. The `shutdown` method does not call the remove specifics.
