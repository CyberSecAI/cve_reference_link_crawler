Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-36750:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing or incorrect nonce validation within the `ewww_ngg_bulk_init()` function of the EWWW Image Optimizer plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the nonce check was performed incorrectly, allowing it to be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can bypass the CSRF protection implemented using nonces. The code uses `&&` (AND) in conjunction with `!wp_verify_nonce` such that if the nonce isn't present, the check passes, thereby bypassing nonce verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Bulk Image Optimization:** An attacker can trick an administrator into performing a bulk image optimization. While this doesn't directly lead to data theft, it can waste server resources or potentially be used to hide other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Forged Request:** An attacker can craft a malicious request to trigger bulk image optimization.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or performing some action that triggers the forged request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker does not need to have an account or authenticated session on the target WordPress site.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator to trigger the malicious request.

**Technical Details (from the provided code snippets):**

The vulnerable code snippet from `blog.nintechnet.com` is:

```php
if ( empty( $_REQUEST['ewww_wpnonce'] ) && ! wp_verify_nonce( sanitize_key( $_REQUEST['ewww_wpnonce'] ), 'ewww-image-optimizer-bulk' ) || ! current_user_can( $permissions ) ) {
    $output['error'] = esc_html__( 'Access denied.', 'ewww-image-optimizer' );
    ewwwio_ob_clean();
    wp_die( wp_json_encode( $output ) );
}
```

The corrected code snippet, from `plugins.trac.wordpress.org`, shows that the `&&` was replaced with `||`, which requires the nonce to be present and valid:
```php
if ( empty( $_REQUEST['ewww_wpnonce'] ) || ! wp_verify_nonce( sanitize_key( $_REQUEST['ewww_wpnonce'] ), 'ewww-image-optimizer-bulk' ) || ! current_user_can( $permissions ) ) {
   $output['error'] = esc_html__( 'Access denied.', 'ewww-image-optimizer' );
   ewwwio_ob_clean();
}
```

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Jerome Bruandet of NinTechNet.
- This vulnerability was found in EWWW Image Optimizer versions 5.8.1 and below.
- The issue was fixed in version 5.9 of the plugin.
- Several other plugins were found to have similar vulnerabilities during the same time period.
