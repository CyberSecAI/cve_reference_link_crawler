### An analysis of the Keycloak authentication system

Earlier this year, I was working with my colleague Ema on a **source-assisted application and architecture assessment** for a client who was using [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) to implement **single sign-on** on their applications. The purpose of the assessment was not to audit Keycloak itself. However, being it at the core of the authentication system, we took a look at it.

Keycloak is described as a solution for *“Open Source Identity and Access Management. Add authentication to applications and secure services with minimum effort. No need to deal with storing users or authenticating users. Keycloak provides user federation, strong authentication, user management, fine-grained authorization, and more.”*

The relationship between Keycloak and Red Hat is not entirely clear to me, but the former is definitely supported by the latter:

* <https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/getting-started-keycloak-single-sign-operator>
* <https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-build-of-keycloak>

During our analysis we identified some security issues and, therefore, we looked into how to report them to the developers:

![Pasted image 20240820165225.png](https://security.humanativaspa.it/sec/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pasted-image-20240820165225.png)

Let’s see what vulnerabilities we have discovered and reported.

### OTP bypass

In the [step-up-flow guide](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#step-up-flow), a mechanism is described for defining different levels of security depending on the level of authentication (LOA), allowing for applications to use a first level (only username + password) or a second level (username + password + OTP). An administrator who follows this guide is led to make the “step-up flow” the default flow for the “browser flow” so that it is used for all applications.

The security issue is caused by the fact that **the default “account” and “account-console” applications are considered as LOA1, therefore access is possible with only a username and a password**, also if all other applications require an OTP (LOA2). **This allows an attacker to completely bypass the OTP request** with only a username and a password, as follows:

1. The attacker tries to access one of the applications configured to login with Keycloak in LOA2.
2. The application redirects to Keycloak for authentication.
3. The attacker provides the correct username and password. At this point, Keycloak requests the OTP.
4. The attacker does not provide the OTP and instead goes to <https://keycloak_url/realms/myrealm/account> (the URL of the “account” default application, which requires username and password). Here the attacker can add a new OTP method without even being asked for a currently configured OTP, even if it’s present.
5. At this point, the attacker can return to the application and will know both the credentials and the OTP, thus being able to access it.

Essentially, **it is possible to completely bypass the second factor of authentication with only a username and a password**.

The communication timeline follows:

28/03/2024 – First communication sent with all details and a proposed fix.

10/04/2024 – Request for a follow-up with additional details about the proposed fix.

17/04/2024 – [Advisory](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/security/advisories/GHSA-4f53-xh3v-g8x4) published.

21/04/2024 – Request of a follow-up.

22/04/2024 – First response: `Apologies for the lack of communication on our side. The discussion moved internally to the Keycloak team as this might be a duplicate of a CVE that was already reported and a fix was implemented and released. You can now find it as CVE-2023-3597 (see https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/security/advisories/GHSA-4f53-xh3v-g8x4).`

Further details are available at:

* <https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4f53-xh3v-g8x4>

In hindsight, by analyzing the details available at <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2221760>, it is possible to see how **the vulnerability was known to the developers since July 2023 and the fix therefore took 10 months**.

![Pasted image 20240820170144.png](https://security.humanativaspa.it/sec/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pasted-image-20240820170144.png)

### Multiple security issues in authentication and authorization

Multiple issues have been identified regarding the authentication and authorization of certain endpoints in the Keycloak software.

It has been observed that **certain functionalities within Keycloak, specifically the */metrics* and */health* endpoints, are accessible without proper authentication**. Even though those endpoints do not provide sensitive information, it is preferable that they are accessible only to authenticated individuals with the correct privileges.

Additionally, **users with low privileges could access administrative functionalities in the Keycloak admin interface**. This issue presents a significant security risk as it allows unauthorized users to perform actions reserved for administrators, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise. The affected endpoints are:

* /admin/realms/myrealm/client-registration-policy/providers
* /admin/myrealm/console/whoami
* /admin/realms/myrealm/testLDAPConnection

In particular, the last functionality (*testLDAPConnection*), in the event that an AD authentication system has been configured, allows to modify application data, **enabling the submission of an LDAP request (and consequently LDAP access credentials) to a malicious endpoint that can steal the credentials**.

An attacker with access to a non-administrative user account can invoke the “*testLDAPConnection* functionality by modifying the *connectionUrl* parameter with an arbitrary value, and the LDAP credentials will be sent to the attacker-controller server. To successfully execute this attack, it’s also necessary to know the *componentId* related to the domain authentication, which is retrievable in the cookies *KEYCLOAK\_SESSION*, *KEYCLOAK\_SESSION\_LEGACY*, and in the responses returned by the */admin/myrealm/console/whoami* endpoint.

The communication timeline follows:

04/04/2024 – First communication sent with all details.

09/04/2024 – Response with request of clarifications.

09/04/2024 – More details sent.

09/04/2024 – Second reply.

09/04/2024 – [Proposed fix](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/27629) for the first issue.

10/04/2024 – Multiple emails about the first issue.

02/05/2024 – Request for information about the second issue (which is more severe).

09/05/2024 – Response with assigned **CVE-2024-3656** and request not to release any details: `For the moment there is no estimated keycloak version to include the fix`

27/05/2024 – Request for an update and a timeline for the fix.

11/06/2024 – [Advisory](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/security/advisories/GHSA-2cww-fgmg-4jqc) published without any notification.

Further details are available at:

* <https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/security/advisories/GHSA-2cww-fgmg-4jqc>
* <https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2cww-fgmg-4jqc>

### Multiple race conditions in anti-brute force mechanism

Keycloak implements an [anti-brute force mechanism](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#password-guess-brute-force-attacks) (which is not enabled by default) which should limit the attack attempts by locking out user accounts after a configured number of incorrect login attempts.

Based on our analysis, the software **didn’t implement mechanisms to prevent concurrent access** to security-critical resources, such as the number of failed authentication attempts. Therefore, it’s possible to **send multiple requests that are processed simultaneously by different threads, allowing the attacker to perform many more login attempts than allowed, and consequently partially bypassing the anti-brute-force mechanism**. Furthermore, when the account is locked out, active sessions are not invalidated.

The issue has been verified both on the username and password-based login and on the OTP request. No checks have been performed on the “Quick Login Check Milliseconds” functionality, but we expect it to be affected by the same issue. The configuration used for testing was set to lockout accounts after 3 incorrect login attempts.

The communication timeline follows:

18/04/2024 – First communication with details.

18/04/2024 – Response: we can’t see the details.

18/04/2024 – Send details again as an attachment.

02/05/2024 – Request for a follow-up.

09/05/2024 – Response: **CVE-2024-4629** assigned, fix in backlog.

24/05/2024 – Request for a roadmap of the fix.

22/08/2024 – Request for a follow-up.

26/08/2024 – Response: Already fixed and published as a [public issue](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/31726).

03/09/2024 – [CVE-2024-4629](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-4629) is published.

### Some final considerations

**Authentication is one of the fundamental mechanisms to ensure the security of applications** and Keycloak is considered to be one of the standard open source software on which many organizations rely for their authentication needs.

I am a strong proponent of open source. However, I believe that **those who develop important projects should carefully consider the impact that their work can have**. I think that for a centralized authentication system, a bypass of the two-factor authentication should be solved or at least mitigated in a timely manner: 10 months is a lot of time to fix a core feature of a security product.

Furthermore, communication with security researchers and, crucially, product users should be as clear and explicit as possible. Keycloak’s advisories are very generic and do not allow users to understand what the actual impacts of the vulnerabilities are. **Attackers can easily look at the code, understand it, and exploit any vulnerability, but the poor system administrator who needs to figure out if it’s important to quickly update certainly will not do that…**

If your company is too cheap for that, maybe a PR would have been nice? Having very high expectations when using the software without contributing anything else than public shaming on something that clearly state in the license: "Licensor provides the Work ... WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND" shouldn't be ok, this is quite literally how you make open source developer to burn out | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [tgsovlerkhgsel](user?id=tgsovlerkhgsel) [57 days ago](item?id=42137517)   | [parent](#42136723) | [next](#42137650) [–]  Regardless of whether it's a project run by a big company or a guy in a shed, a security-critical project not fixing critical vulns for 10 months is an important bit of information when judging whether you should use it. It doesn't really matter whether it's someone's fault, or wrong, or whatever - what matters for the user is that using the project is likely unsafe. Sharing that information is a public service. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nijave](user?id=nijave) [57 days ago](item?id=42139571)   | [root](#42136723) | [parent](#42137517) | [next](#42138927) [–]  >a guy in a shed That should be enough without needing to shame them over timeline. You can also judge based off issue open/close rate and contribution frequency (GitHub has pretty charts for these if the project is hosted there) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hinkley](user?id=hinkley) [57 days ago](item?id=42138927)   | [root](#42136723) | [parent](#42137517) | [prev](#42139571) | [next](#42137650) [–]  The number of software engineers who either don’t understand social contracts or only understand them when it benefits them to do so is frankly appalling. You said you’re going to do something and now people depend on you having done it. Volunteer organizations fall apart if they can’t trust each other. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [from-nibly](user?id=from-nibly) [57 days ago](item?id=42139573)   | [root](#42136723) | [parent](#42138927) | [next](#42142589) [–]  People depending on you is not somethng in your control, therefore you can't be responsible for that. It's up to the people depending on you to make a judgement on whether or not that's a good idea.

So it's not a RH / IBM product anymore. I would even go as far as say that it never was; Red Hat had their own product called "Red Hat Single Sign On" that was, for some time, based on opensource Keycloak project, but the opensource Keycloak project has existed before RH SSO. And exists now that RH SSO product has been deprecated (retired? Idk what happened). Red Hat does offer a "Red Hat build of Keycloak" now, and of course Keycloak would not exists in it's current form without Red Hat. But saying that "Keycloak is a Red Hat product and therefore Red Hat and / or IBM should support it" would be, in my opinion, harmful for the whole opensource movement. If, by being engaged with opensource project, a company risks it's reputation then such company could decide against any engagement, or would engage only if it could keep control of the project / community around it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ffsm8](user?id=ffsm8) [57 days ago](item?id=42138004)   | [root](#42136723) | [parent](#42137535) | [next](#42137753) [–]  RH SSO was the LTS build of keycloak with business support. Keycloak doesn't publish hot fixes for previous major versions, and these major versions come out on a very tight release schedule / every few months.

It absolutely detest wading through vendor marketing material to figure out which open source product is being used under the hood. With names like "Red Hat Build of Keycloak" and "Microsoft Build of OpenJDK" it's crystal clear. I believe it works out better for the vendors as well because there are so many obstacles with evaluating anything that requires a license in an enterprise setting. If the technical person downloads and evaluates the underlying open source version some manager will insist on purchasing a support contract before going to production. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bigfatkitten](user?id=bigfatkitten) [54 days ago](item?id=42167606)   | [root](#42136723) | [parent](#42138921) | [next](#42136872) [–]  Though Red Hat did a search and replace for RHSSO with "Red Hat Build of Keycloak" in their docs, and now they are extremely painful to read with Red Hat Build of Keycloak sometimes appearing three times in one sentence when "Keycloak" or some other shortened form would suffice. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hypeatei](user?id=hypeatei) [57 days ago](item?id=42136872)   | [parent](#42136723) | [prev](#42137033) | [next](#42137338) [–]  Money doesn't guarantee anything, as seen by the recent issue with Okta.

After that point, any additional help (including a pull request) is going above and beyond. I run into this attitude you're exhibiting a lot.

'Giving a fuck' is not really a boolean value but more of a broad spectrum. Of course, anyone who writes any software cared a little bit about it at one point, or they wouldn't have written it. But *warranty* is about whether they care enough to cater specifically to you when you have a problem in the future.

Would you mind sharing your thoughts on our pricing? We certainly love to improve this. Its not our intent to have a smoke and mirrors pricing ;-) On the subject of maturity and security. Many known enterprises trust Zitadel for their identity needs, especially the self-hosted version, which can be used for free. I think what makes Zitadel a great package in regard of security is that our community actively provides vulnerability disclosures to the project which we track in public.

The most common metric I know is monthly active users (users that log in at least once a month) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ffo](user?id=ffo) [57 days ago](item?id=42138278)   | [root](#42137201) | [parent](#42138209) | [next](#42137358) [–]  Great input, thank you! So, if we would increase the free amount and the included in the pro tier it would a little alleviate this pain? On the definition, we wanted to use DAU because with this we can have on metric to price consumers, business customers and service accounts. To us it was weird to pay for a MAU when a consumer only logs in once a month. Coming back to my reply above... would a "bigger" number of included DAU solve this? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [andix](user?id=andix) [56 days ago](item?id=42147359)   | [root](#42137201) | [parent](#42138278) | [next](#42139389) [–]  I think it's your business decision how much quota you want to give away for free and how much you charge for each DAU. But the current free plan has a few issues (I would even call them traps): It has a monthly DAU and API request limit. If this limit is exhausted Zitadel will essentially shut down the service until the end of the month, unless you switch to the Pro plan, or just accept getting locked out until the end of the month. The DAU restriction can be safeguarded by only onboarding 3 users, then the DAU quota will never be exhausted. The API limit is even more tricky, if your users heavily use the console or log in very often it is out of your control. This makes the Zitadel free plan practically just a demo version (1 admin user, 1 test account, 1 service account). In my case I nearly hit the quota already after 5 days of developing a product, just me, developing alone. I ended up switching to auth0, because I was not very invested in Zitadel yet. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ffo](user?id=ffo) [56 days ago](item?id=42147614)   | [root](#42137201) | [parent](#42147359) | [next](#42139389) [–]  I know it’s our decision, but I wanted to get a sense of how our pricing looks to people from a less biased perspective.

We’ve already had some ideas that address some of your concerns, especially around the quotas. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [andix](user?id=andix) [56 days ago](item?id=42147723)   | [root](#42137201) | [parent](#42147614) | [next](#42139389) [–]  I set up Zitadel Cloud for the services at home, just for a few basic services (professionally I'm mostly using AAD and Keycloak). Already with one user per family member we are coming dangerously close to the quotas, it's my fault, I didn't take the time to check the terms and conditions. But I honestly did not expect the free plan to be that restrictive. I just stopped at "100 users" and thought: "well, that should be enough". That's why I'm warning everyone about this fact. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ffo](user?id=ffo) [56 days ago](item?id=42147776)   | [root](#42137201) | [parent](#42147723) | [next](#42139389) [–]  I see, no worries btw. we do not take an insult in you talking about this.

That way you don't pay a full month license for somebody that logged in twice or once in that period, I rather log them in manually :-) About the pricing, I haven't made the calculations in your product, but in other products I sometimes miss a middle ground between free and pro like a "hobby" or "mini" tier. maybe I have a small product, an SMB, or a personal thing thing that needs a service, and I don't want to be a "freeloader" on the free plan, but the pro is too much. There are services I've used that I know I'll stop using once I grow out of the free plan, because it's so expensive. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ffo](user?id=ffo) [57 days ago](item?id=42141098)   | [root](#42137201) | [parent](#42139389) | [next](#42137358) [–]  Noted, so something between a free plan and the $100 pro would fit your needs.

Another thing would be to mix daily active users and monthly active users. For example in the ratio 1:10 (100 DAUs or 10 MAUs). Just cap the DAU counter for a user at 10 logins per month. It's really hard to predict how often users are going to log in. So if you have a company with 50 people, you know 50 MAUs are enough. But will 500 DAUs be enough? You just don't know that in advance. The DAUs can also grow a lot even if MAUs stay the same, if your product becomes better and is used more often in the company. Really hard to tell the customer at a later stage that Zitadel is now more expensive, because people log in more often. The DAU/API limit is also an incentive to cache authentication/2FA longer and compromise on security. Maybe remove a few enterprise features for the cheaper plans like SAML or restrict branding. But please keep passwordless/2FA, for me those features were the main reason to try Zitadel, that's one of the features where Zitadel shines over auth0. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tecleandor](user?id=tecleandor) [57 days ago](item?id=42137358)   | [parent](#42137201) | [prev](#42137857) | [next](#42138393) [–]  Dex + FreeIPA (or whatever backend you want to use) ?

However, I believe that those who develop important projects should carefully consider the impact that their work can have. I think that for a centralized authentication system, a bypass of the two-factor authentication should be solved or at least mitigated in a timely manner: 10 months is a lot of time to fix a core feature of a security product. What does the author propose as the solution here? Simply saying "you should be careful" isn't a solution. If you proposed a fix, where was the PR? Why is there no further discussion of what the holdups were? My guess here, not being privy to internal communications: The RedHat folks were probably worried that a simple change like increasing the required access to add another 2FA would break some other functionality, or cause logical loopholes for situations where a user loses access to their 2nd factors. The result was that they were exceedingly careful/slow to get to testing and validation. Doesn't make it right. This guess comes from what I observed in my previous time at IBM -- I saw a lot of the company's open source contributions hung up in similar ways. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [brabel](user?id=brabel) [57 days ago](item?id=42138479)   | [parent](#42138393) | [next](#42138541) [–]  The author seems to be suggesting that if you don't have time to fix even basic security bugs in a security project, you may want to consider archiving it and making sure people know your project is unmaintained?!
