It doesn't really matter whether it's someone's fault, or wrong, or whatever - what matters for the user is that using the project is likely unsafe. Sharing that information is a public service. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nijave](user?id=nijave) [57 days ago](item?id=42139571)   | [root](#42136723) | [parent](#42137517) | [next](#42138927) [–]  >a guy in a shed That should be enough without needing to shame them over timeline.

It's up to the people depending on you to make a judgement on whether or not that's a good idea. Social contracts are not contracts, they do not end up in court, and if you depend on them you have no recourse.

And for the second one, a fix existed 2 days after first communication, doing a PR doesn't magically make that go faster. For the third, a fix was done within a month, but once again was delayed, and didn't land until several months later. - - - RH does not provide support contracts for any affordable price.

This isn't a student eating ramen supporting this software, its IBM. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hiciu](user?id=hiciu) [57 days ago](item?id=42137535)   | [root](#42136723) | [parent](#42137033) | [next](#42136872) [–]  Keycloak has been donated to CNCF in 2023. So it's not a RH / IBM product anymore. I would even go as far as say that it never was; Red Hat had their own product called "Red Hat Single Sign On" that was, for some time, based on opensource Keycloak project, but the opensource Keycloak project has existed before RH SSO. And exists now that RH SSO product has been deprecated (retired? Idk what happened). Red Hat does offer a "Red Hat build of Keycloak" now, and of course Keycloak would not exists in it's current form without Red Hat. But saying that "Keycloak is a Red Hat product and therefore Red Hat and / or IBM should support it" would be, in my opinion, harmful for the whole opensource movement. If, by being engaged with opensource project, a company risks it's reputation then such company could decide against any engagement, or would engage only if it could keep control of the project / community around it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ffsm8](user?id=ffsm8) [57 days ago](item?id=42138004)   | [root](#42136723) | [parent](#42137535) | [next](#42137753) [–]  RH SSO was the LTS build of keycloak with business support. Keycloak doesn't publish hot fixes for previous major versions, and these major versions come out on a very tight release schedule / every few months. So if you didn't want to upgrade all the time, you'd have been forced to use rhsso. And now the red hat keycloak build. <https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/discussions/25688> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [vbezhenar](user?id=vbezhenar) [57 days ago](item?id=42138643)   | [root](#42136723) | [parent](#42138004) | [next](#42137753) [–]  > So if you didn't want to upgrade all the time, you'd have been forced to use rhsso. Or just not upgrade at all. Not the most wise strategy for security-focused software, but I'm sure many teams do that. Especially because keycloak often being heavily customized with plugins and themes, so upgrading this setup might actually be not trivial. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tapoxi](user?id=tapoxi) [57 days ago](item?id=42137753)   | [root](#42136723) | [parent](#42137535) | [prev](#42138004) | [next](#42138921) [–]  If there's a Red Hat build of Keycloak, and Red Hat products depend on Keycloak, then this vulnerability is present in all of those Red Hat products. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [TheNewsIsHere](user?id=TheNewsIsHere) [55 days ago](item?id=42161635)   | [root](#42136723) | [parent](#42137753) | [next](#42138921) [–]  Not necessarily.

It absolutely detest wading through vendor marketing material to figure out which open source product is being used under the hood. With names like "Red Hat Build of Keycloak" and "Microsoft Build of OpenJDK" it's crystal clear. I believe it works out better for the vendors as well because there are so many obstacles with evaluating anything that requires a license in an enterprise setting. If the technical person downloads and evaluates the underlying open source version some manager will insist on purchasing a support contract before going to production. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bigfatkitten](user?id=bigfatkitten) [54 days ago](item?id=42167606)   | [root](#42136723) | [parent](#42138921) | [next](#42136872) [–]  Though Red Hat did a search and replace for RHSSO with "Red Hat Build of Keycloak" in their docs, and now they are extremely painful to read with Red Hat Build of Keycloak sometimes appearing three times in one sentence when "Keycloak" or some other shortened form would suffice. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hypeatei](user?id=hypeatei) [57 days ago](item?id=42136872)   | [parent](#42136723) | [prev](#42137033) | [next](#42137338) [–]  Money doesn't guarantee anything, as seen by the recent issue with Okta. If you're using a centralized auth service and expecting no vulns or exploits, you're going to be severely disappointed. These are the juiciest targets and very complex pieces of software. I don't see an issue with calling out this Keycloak response time either. It's not inherently negative, just stating facts. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [debarshri](user?id=debarshri) [57 days ago](item?id=42137874)   | [root](#42136723) | [parent](#42136872) | [next](#42137338) [–]  If you central auth - you have vulnerabilities If you decentralize auth - you have vulnerabilities. It can lead to shadow credentials as well as credential and auth sprawl. It is about de-risking your approach. Either approaches work until they don't. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [aseipp](user?id=aseipp) [57 days ago](item?id=42137338)   | [parent](#42136723) | [prev](#42136872) | [next](#42136837) [–]  Keycloak is not written by some random person in the middle of nowhere who is shouldering the burdens of the world. It is security sensitive software that in part is funded by major open-source corporations like Red Hat, including full time engineers. What you're reading in this blog is literally standard fare in security research where a disclosure happens after some set period of time, regardless of when, or even if, the fix happened. Fixing authentication bypasses is not "very high expectations", it's exactly what you would expect from this software. Get a grip on reality, please. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [threatofrain](user?id=threatofrain) [57 days ago](item?id=42140923)   | [root](#42136723) | [parent](#42137338) | [next](#42136837) [–]  Is it still funded by Red Hat today? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [aseipp](user?id=aseipp) [56 days ago](item?id=42147881)   | [root](#42136723) | [parent](#42140923) | [next](#42136837) [–]  Several developers and full-time employees, including the project lead, are still employed by Red Hat. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [some\_furry](user?id=some_furry) [57 days ago](item?id=42136837)   | [parent](#42136723) | [prev](#42137338) | [next](#42138009) [–]  > What if instead of publicly blaming an OSS product, you try to get a support contract with some of the engineers behind it? If your company is too cheap for that, maybe a PR would have been nice? Yeah, no. That's not how security research works. If I disclose a security issue to you, it doesn't matter if you're a multinational trillion dollar corporation or a hobbyist in Nebraska, the onus is on you to fix it. Not the security researcher. Their job is done once it's disclosed. From the timeline: > 28/03/2024 – First communication sent with all details and a proposed fix. After that point, any additional help (including a pull request) is going above and beyond. I run into this attitude you're exhibiting a lot. Where proprietary software has the legal threats, the open source community is plagued by *patch entitlement*. Knowledge of a security issue in a project is, in and of itself, a valuable contribution. Expecting a PR devalues this work. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [noselasd](user?id=noselasd) [57 days ago](item?id=42136977)   | [root](#42136723) | [parent](#42136837) | [next](#42137118) [–]  > If I disclose a security issue to you, it doesn't matter if you're a multinational trillion dollar corporation or a hobbyist in Nebraska, the onus is on you to fix it.

They're a way to reduce the risk that you'll get sued, but not any "I don't give a fuck" statement. You could add "I don't care about fixing security vulnerabilities" somewhere in the beginning of the readme, if you're developing security related OSS software? That'd be more clear. Maybe the WTFPL actually a little bit indicates that the developers maybe don't give a fuck, though: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL> ? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kube-system](user?id=kube-system) [57 days ago](item?id=42138621)   | [root](#42136723) | [parent](#42138158) | [next](#42139020) [–]  That sounds a little like having your cake and eating it too. 'Giving a fuck' is not really a boolean value but more of a broad spectrum. Of course, anyone who writes any software cared a little bit about it at one point, or they wouldn't have written it. But *warranty* is about whether they care enough to cater specifically to you when you have a problem in the future. Maybe many of these projects do care enough to give general updates to the community as a whole on a best effort basis, but that's a lower level of assurance and more voluntary than what you'd get in a legal warranty. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hifromwork](user?id=hifromwork) [57 days ago](item?id=42139020)   | [root](#42136723) | [parent](#42138158) | [prev](#42138621) | [next](#42139660) [–]  >You could add "I don't care about fixing security vulnerabilities" somewhere in the beginning of the readme I care about fixing security vulnerabilities in my OS projects, but I care more about my sanity, my family, getting enough money to survive, and a few other things. Unless you pay me I don't care about your problems with my free (as in a beer) software. And that's a good thing btw - I tried to ask for donations once, got the equivalent of a few cups of coffee per month, and... burned out almost immediately. I started to feel responsible for that project, staying up late to fix reported minor bugs, and it turns out watching Github issues 365 days a year for a few dollars monthly is not a great business strategy. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ziddoap](user?id=ziddoap) [57 days ago](item?id=42139110)   | [root](#42136723) | [parent](#42139020) | [next](#42139660) [–]  This is not a one-person project ran by someone in their spare time, posted online for fun. They are going out of their way to advertise so that people use their security-critical software in security-critical applications, and then they neglect the security. While they aren't under any legal obligation, it's (in my worldview at least) pretty damn unethical. All they would have to do to not be unethical is make it clear that this software should not be used in any security-critical application because it is not properly/frequently maintained.

Nowhere on the Keycloak home page does it say "just a hobby project" or anything that would remotely indicate that it is not a serious project and that you shouldn't use the software. Instead, it seems like they are trying very hard to be taken seriously as an identity management product. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [flanked-evergl](user?id=flanked-evergl) [57 days ago](item?id=42137119)   | [root](#42136723) | [parent](#42137081) | [next](#42139052) [–]  > Nowhere on the Keycloak home page does it say "just a hobby project" or anything that would remotely indicate that it is not a serious project and that you shouldn't use the software.

So, if we would increase the free amount and the included in the pro tier it would a little alleviate this pain? On the definition, we wanted to use DAU because with this we can have on metric to price consumers, business customers and service accounts. To us it was weird to pay for a MAU when a consumer only logs in once a month. Coming back to my reply above... would a "bigger" number of included DAU solve this? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [andix](user?id=andix) [56 days ago](item?id=42147359)   | [root](#42137201) | [parent](#42138278) | [next](#42139389) [–]  I think it's your business decision how much quota you want to give away for free and how much you charge for each DAU. But the current free plan has a few issues (I would even call them traps): It has a monthly DAU and API request limit. If this limit is exhausted Zitadel will essentially shut down the service until the end of the month, unless you switch to the Pro plan, or just accept getting locked out until the end of the month. The DAU restriction can be safeguarded by only onboarding 3 users, then the DAU quota will never be exhausted. The API limit is even more tricky, if your users heavily use the console or log in very often it is out of your control. This makes the Zitadel free plan practically just a demo version (1 admin user, 1 test account, 1 service account). In my case I nearly hit the quota already after 5 days of developing a product, just me, developing alone. I ended up switching to auth0, because I was not very invested in Zitadel yet. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ffo](user?id=ffo) [56 days ago](item?id=42147614)   | [root](#42137201) | [parent](#42147359) | [next](#42139389) [–]  I know it’s our decision, but I wanted to get a sense of how our pricing looks to people from a less biased perspective.

Already with one user per family member we are coming dangerously close to the quotas, it's my fault, I didn't take the time to check the terms and conditions. But I honestly did not expect the free plan to be that restrictive. I just stopped at "100 users" and thought: "well, that should be enough". That's why I'm warning everyone about this fact. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ffo](user?id=ffo) [56 days ago](item?id=42147776)   | [root](#42137201) | [parent](#42147723) | [next](#42139389) [–]  I see, no worries btw. we do not take an insult in you talking about this.

That way you don't pay a full month license for somebody that logged in twice or once in that period, I rather log them in manually :-) About the pricing, I haven't made the calculations in your product, but in other products I sometimes miss a middle ground between free and pro like a "hobby" or "mini" tier. maybe I have a small product, an SMB, or a personal thing thing that needs a service, and I don't want to be a "freeloader" on the free plan, but the pro is too much.

Another thing would be to mix daily active users and monthly active users. For example in the ratio 1:10 (100 DAUs or 10 MAUs). Just cap the DAU counter for a user at 10 logins per month. It's really hard to predict how often users are going to log in. So if you have a company with 50 people, you know 50 MAUs are enough. But will 500 DAUs be enough? You just don't know that in advance. The DAUs can also grow a lot even if MAUs stay the same, if your product becomes better and is used more often in the company. Really hard to tell the customer at a later stage that Zitadel is now more expensive, because people log in more often. The DAU/API limit is also an incentive to cache authentication/2FA longer and compromise on security. Maybe remove a few enterprise features for the cheaper plans like SAML or restrict branding. But please keep passwordless/2FA, for me those features were the main reason to try Zitadel, that's one of the features where Zitadel shines over auth0. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tecleandor](user?id=tecleandor) [57 days ago](item?id=42137358)   | [parent](#42137201) | [prev](#42137857) | [next](#42138393) [–]  Dex + FreeIPA (or whatever backend you want to use) ?

I think that for a centralized authentication system, a bypass of the two-factor authentication should be solved or at least mitigated in a timely manner: 10 months is a lot of time to fix a core feature of a security product. What does the author propose as the solution here? Simply saying "you should be careful" isn't a solution. If you proposed a fix, where was the PR? Why is there no further discussion of what the holdups were? My guess here, not being privy to internal communications: The RedHat folks were probably worried that a simple change like increasing the required access to add another 2FA would break some other functionality, or cause logical loopholes for situations where a user loses access to their 2nd factors. The result was that they were exceedingly careful/slow to get to testing and validation. Doesn't make it right. This guess comes from what I observed in my previous time at IBM -- I saw a lot of the company's open source contributions hung up in similar ways. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [brabel](user?id=brabel) [57 days ago](item?id=42138479)   | [parent](#42138393) | [next](#42138541) [–]  The author seems to be suggesting that if you don't have time to fix even basic security bugs in a security project, you may want to consider archiving it and making sure people know your project is unmaintained?! I kind of agree with that because lots of businesses may be impacted by this kind of bug, and if they knew the project was no longer maintained effectively, they might have considered migrating elsewhere. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [xyst](user?id=xyst) [57 days ago](item?id=42138541)   | [prev](#42138393) | [next](#42138468) [–]  Anybody worth their salt at RedHat has been 86’d or sunsetted with a golden parachute after the IBM acquisition. 10 months for IBM and subsidiaries is actually much better than average, with all things considered. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ei625](user?id=ei625) [57 days ago](item?id=42138468)   | [prev](#42138541) | [next](#42137400) [–]  Some developers write needless low level codes to intimidate other developers, which makes Keycloak difficult to maintain. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hooli\_gan](user?id=hooli_gan) [57 days ago](item?id=42137400)   | [prev](#42138468) [3 more]  [flagged] | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tgsovlerkhgsel](user?id=tgsovlerkhgsel) [57 days ago](item?id=42137544)   | [parent](#42137400) | [next](#42139169) [–]  That doesn't help you fix other vulnerabilities that may have been found and reported by others but not fixed. You alone will never find all of them. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [goku12](user?id=goku12) [57 days ago](item?id=42139169)   | [parent](#42137400) | [prev](#42137544) [–]  This is a digital security company reporting their findings, along with the fix. They did everything that could be expected of them. The real problem is how long RH took to address vulnerabilities. OSS isn't an excuse. There are other OSS projects with much less resources, that take security much more seriously. To make it worse, it isn't easy switch IdP software - even for OSS ones. | | --- | --- | --- | | |
