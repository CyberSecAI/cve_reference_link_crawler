Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-35750

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the DDP (D-Link Discovery Protocol) service of the D-Link DAP-2622 router. It stems from a lack of authentication prior to allowing access to certain functionality.
*   **Weakness:** The specific weakness is the absence of proper authentication checks in the DDP service. This allows unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to disclose stored credentials, specifically WPA PSK (Pre-Shared Key) information for configured SSIDs. This can lead to further compromise of the network.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is network-adjacent, meaning an attacker needs to be within the same network as the affected device.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable D-Link DAP-2622 access point. Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as "D-Link DAP-2622 DDP Get SSID List WPA PSK Information Disclosure Vulnerability" by the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
