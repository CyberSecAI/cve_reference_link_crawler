- **Root cause of vulnerability:** User passwords can be leaked in the Audit and System logs of Arista CloudVision Portal (CVP) when "enable" passwords on the switch are different from the CVP user's login passwords and Advanced Login Options for Device Provisioning is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive information (user passwords) to unauthorized actors. Specifically, passwords are being logged in audit logs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** CVP user login passwords can be leaked to other authenticated users.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with access to the CVP audit logs could potentially view user passwords.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the CVP application to access the logs. The vulnerability requires specific configuration conditions: different CVP user passwords than switch enable passwords, and Advanced Login Options for Device Provisioning enabled.
