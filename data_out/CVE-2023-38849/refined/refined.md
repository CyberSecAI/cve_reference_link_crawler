{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The mini-app 'tire-sales' on Line exposes the 'channel access token' in the client-side response.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Exposure of sensitive information (channel access token) in the client-side response.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can use the exposed channel access token to broadcast malicious messages to users of the 'tire-sales' mini-app on Line. This includes the possibility of sending malicious links and fraudulent information.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker only needs to open the mini-app ‘tire-sales’ on Line and intercept the response of the request to www.l-members.me/miniapp/members_card to retrieve the channel access token.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the Line app installed and be able to access the 'tire-sales' mini-app. No special privileges or advanced skills are mentioned, as the vulnerability lies in a publicly accessible response. The attacker can then extract the exposed token."
