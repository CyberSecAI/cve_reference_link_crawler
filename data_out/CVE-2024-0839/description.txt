The FeedWordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 2022.0222 due to missing validation on the user controlled 'guid' key. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view draft posts that may contain sensitive information.
