- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape user-supplied parameters before outputting them back into the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of the `type` and `offset` parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. If the victim is a high-privilege user (e.g., an admin), the attacker could potentially gain control of the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack involves crafting a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload within the vulnerable `type` and `offset` parameters. The victim needs to be tricked into opening the crafted URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a user (preferably an admin) to open it.
