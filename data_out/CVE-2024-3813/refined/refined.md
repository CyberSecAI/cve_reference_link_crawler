Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3813

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper control of filenames used in include/require statements within the PHP program of the tagDiv Composer plugin. Specifically, the plugin uses the 'td_block_title' shortcode with the 'block_template_id' attribute, which allows an attacker to specify a local file path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize or validate the 'block_template_id' attribute, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
*   **Unrestricted File Access:** The LFI vulnerability provides access to any PHP file on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This could lead to:
    *   Bypassing access controls
    *   Obtaining sensitive data
    *   Full compromise of the web server, particularly if the attacker can upload a malicious PHP file to the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited via the 'td_block_title' shortcode.
*   The 'block_template_id' attribute is the point of injection for the malicious local file path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least Contributor-level permissions on the WordPress site. This means that an unauthenticated user can not exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Shortcode Usage:** The attacker needs to be able to insert the vulnerable shortcode with the malicious file path as attribute value.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability affects all versions of tagDiv Composer up to and including 4.8.
* The fix is to update to version 4.9 or later.
