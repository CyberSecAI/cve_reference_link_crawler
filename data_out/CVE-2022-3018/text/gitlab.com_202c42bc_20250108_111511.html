# DataDog integration leaking Datadog API Key

While testing the datadog integration, a `Maintainer` can recover the API Key by clicking on :

And then you get the API Key:

[![image](data:image/gif;base64...)](/-/project/278964/uploads/305030e1144bc2bc86f1be3adc2e97a7/image.png)

Knowing that, I'm wondering if those API Keys could also reside in logs?

/cc [@arturoherrero](/arturoherrero "Arturo Herrero") as the EM

/cc [@mhenriksen](/mhenriksen "Michael Henriksen") as the SC

### Availability & Testing

Suggestions:

* Add new feature spec that triggers a DataDog webhook and validates that the secret(s) are masked in the logs.
* run `package-and-qa`
