By [Daiji Hirata](https://movabletype.org/news/../author/daiji-hirata/)

Posted August 24, 2022, in [MT Newsbox](https://movabletype.org/news/mt-newsbox/).

Movable Type 7 r.5301 (v7.9.5), v6.8.7 released.

This release is included a security fix. For those of you who use Movable Type 4.0 and later, Six Apart strongly recommends that you upgrade to the latest version or execute one of workarounds immediately.

### detail of the security issue

Through the XMLRPC API of MT (mt-xmlrpc.cgi), Perl / OS command injection (RCE) could be performed limitedly. This issue may occur when mt-xmlrpc.cgi can be executed on the Internet.

### Workarounds for those who cannot upgrade the latest version

The one of following steps can be taken to avoid or reduce of the affect of the vulnerability.

* Remove the execution permission of mt-xmlrpc.cgi
* Delete the mt-xmlrpc.cgi file
* Restrict the access to mt-xmlrpc.cgi on the Internet
* PSGI env: Set `RestrictedPSGIApp xmlrpc` in mt-config.cgi (6.2 and later) or ‘XMLRPCScript *long random characters enough not to guess*` (6.1 and earlier)

Since Six Apart has already terminated the support of Movable Type 4.x, 5.x, and 6.0.x-6.3.x, we strongly recommend upgrading to the latest version of Movable Type 7 r.5301 or 6.8.7.
