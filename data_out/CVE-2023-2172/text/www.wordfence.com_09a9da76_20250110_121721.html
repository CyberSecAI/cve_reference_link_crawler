### Description

The BadgeOS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in versions up to, and including, 3.7.1.6. This is due to improper validation and authorization checks within the badgeos\_update\_steps\_ajax\_handler, badgeos\_update\_award\_steps\_ajax\_handler, badgeos\_update\_deduct\_steps\_ajax\_handler, and badgeos\_update\_ranks\_req\_steps\_ajax\_handler functions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to overwrite arbitrary post titles.
