| systemd version the issue has been seen with 251 Used distribution *No response* Linux kernel version used *No response* CPU architectures issue was seen on *No response* Component *No response* Expected behaviour you didn't see *No response* Unexpected behaviour you saw In the file `time-util.c`, the function `format_timespan` has the following [code](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/b5fe371c0ea1814738b685634c5d405cfb750a6a/src/basic/time-util.c#L500):  ``` char *format_timespan(char *buf, size_t l, usec_t t, usec_t accuracy) {     char *p = buf;     for (size_t i = 0; i < ELEMENTSOF(table); i++) {         size_t n;         ....         if (!done) {             k = snprintf(p, l,                                 "%s"USEC_FMT"%s",                                 p > buf ? " " : "",                                 a,                                 table[i].suffix);              t = b;         }         n = MIN((size_t) k, l);         l -= n;         p += n;     }     *p = 0;     return buf; }  ```  The problem of the above code is that `n = MIN((size_t) k, l);` can assign the buffer size `l` to `n`. Then `p += n;` will cause `p` to point to one byte after the buffer `buf`, leading to a buffer overwrite in `*p=0` (an off-by-one error). Steps to reproduce the problem To reproduce the buffer overrun, just run the following test code  ``` int main() {     char buf[5];     char *p;     usec_t t = 100005;     usec_t accuracy = 1000;     p = format_timespan(buf, sizeof(buf), t, accuracy);     printf("%s\n",p);     return 0; }  ```  `format_timespan` will write to `buf[5]`, which is an error. Additional program output to the terminal or log subsystem illustrating the issue *No response* |
