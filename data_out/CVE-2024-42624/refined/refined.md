The provided content relates to CVE-2024-42624.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing CSRF protection mechanism in FrogCMS v0.9.5 when deleting a page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing unwanted actions on the web application, such as deleting pages, without their knowledge or consent.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a form that sends a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1:80/admin/?/page/delete/10`). If a logged-in administrator visits the malicious page, the form will automatically be submitted, potentially deleting a page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user, specifically an administrator in this case, to visit a malicious website or open a malicious email containing the crafted form. The user must be logged into FrogCMS for the attack to be successful.
