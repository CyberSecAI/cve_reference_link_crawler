"It covery everything you want to do backup. It was very easy to implementing by few

the window update where may cause the server reboot and missing the backup. Most
importance is it have ransomware protection to protect the backup data under the hood so
you can almost forget the additional ransomware antivirus for backup server. It also
very easy to integrate for majority of the Hypervisor platform like VMware vSphere,
Hyper-V, Cirtix, Sangfor, openstack and etc. The customer support also very supportive
and helpful."
