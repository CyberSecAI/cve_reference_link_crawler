| [@sshedi](https://github.com/sshedi) please open a dedicated ticket for questions like that, next time 🙏  Hi [@hartwork](https://github.com/hartwork), Does this CVE affect expat-2.2.9? In NVD it's mentioned as it affects everything before 2.6.0. Can you please let me know.  Yes, all prior releases are vulnerable.  I checked: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-52426>  In this commit, [0f075ec](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/commit/0f075ec8ecb5e43f8fdca5182f8cca4703da0404)  For example (snippet from above commit):  ``` -#ifndef XML_DTD -      ftprintf(stderr, T("Warning: Given attack threshold ignored") T( -                           ", xmlwf has been compiled without DTD support.\n")); +#if ! defined(XML_DTD) && XML_GE == 0 +      ftprintf(stderr, +               T("Warning: Given attack threshold ignored") +                   T(", xmlwf has been compiled without DTD/GE support.\n"));  #endif ```  The remove portion of this code is not present in 2.2.9.  The picture is this:   * Expat was long vulnerable to billion laughs attacks and release 2.4.0 fixed it for compilation with XML\_DTD enabled but not for XML\_DTD disabled * Expat 2.6.0 now fixes the vulnerability for XML\_DTD disabled also. That case is not super common, so depending on your environment you may be lucky and that case does not even matter to your environment. E.g. most if not all Linux distros have XML\_DTD enabled. |

| Why not combine all the commits in pr into one commit?  [@zhuofeng6](https://github.com/zhuofeng6) I believe that would be…   * a) <https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/pull/777.diff> * b) `git diff daa89e42^ 8a6c61de`   This is a great benefit to the functioning of the community? Or you can do like the cpython community, which merges multiple commits in pr into one.  That's not a good idea and I wish CPython would not do that, but I will not go into details here because too far off-topic.  Is there any easy way to reproduce it?  Yes, compile Expat <2.6.0 without DTD support, feed the example from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack#Code_example> to e.g. Expat's own xmlwf, and see it take minutes, e.g.:  ``` cd "$(mktemp -d)" git clone --depth 1 --branch R_2_5_0 https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/ cd libexpat/expat/ cmake -S . -B build -DEXPAT_DTD=OFF && make -C build wget -O- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack | html2text | sed -n '95,109p' | tee billion.xml time ./build/xmlwf/xmlwf < billion.xml  # takes minutes but should not ```  The extraction of `billion.xml` is a brittle quickhack and may break after my post (..). html2text used in there is <https://github.com/grobian/html2text> in version 2.2.3. |

It depends on what your layer of integration does, it would be easy to disable if wanted.  The description of cve is that `XML_DTD` is not defined, but in the example you gave, it is `EXPAT_DTD`. You are renaming CMakeLists.txt in this file.  ``` _expat_copy_bool_int(EXPAT_DTD XML_DTD) ```  But there doesn't seem to be a rename through configure.  `XML_DTD` is primilary a C preprocessor macro, while `EXPAT_DTD` only exists in the CMake build system. The key question is whether when compiling macro `XML_DTD` is defined. Most integrations control that via file `expat_config.h`. |

Description:

A flaw was found in Expat (libexpat). If XML_DTD is undefined at compile time, a
recursive XML Entity Expansion condition can be triggered.This issue may lead to
a condition where data is expanded exponentially, which will quickly consume system
resources and cause a denial of service.
