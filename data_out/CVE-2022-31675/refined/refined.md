- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an authentication bypass in VMware vRealize Operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system allows an unauthenticated user to bypass the authentication mechanism and gain the ability to create a user with administrative privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can create a user with administrative privileges. This can lead to full compromise of the vRealize Operations instance.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network based, and an unauthenticated malicious actor with network access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable vRealize Operations instance, and does not need prior authentication.
