## Description

### Impact

The Apollo Router is a configurable, high-performance graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation. Affected versions are subject to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) type vulnerability which causes the Router to panic and terminate when a multi-part response is sent. When users send queries to the router that uses the `@defer` or Subscriptions, the Router will panic.

To be vulnerable, users of Router must have a coprocessor with `coprocessor.supergraph.response` configured in their `router.yaml` and also to support either `@defer` or Subscriptions.

### Patches

Router version 1.33.0 has a fix for this vulnerability. [#4014](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/4014) fixes the issue.

### Workarounds

For affected versions, avoid using the coprocessor supergraph response:

```
# do not use this stage in your coprocessor configuration
coprocessor:
  supergraph:
    response:
```

Or you can disable defer and subscriptions support:

```
# disable defer and subscriptions:
supergraph:
  defer_support: false # enabled by default
subscription:
  enabled: false # disabled by default
```

and continue to use the coprocessor supergraph response.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @BrynCooke **[BrynCooke](/BrynCooke)** commented [Oct 11, 2023](#issue-1937424335)

The logic for supporting deferred responses can't work.

The issues is here: [router/apollo-router/src/plugins/coprocessor/supergraph.rs](https://github.com/apollographql/router/blob/cf4a79a126132eb30e368bdf2277a89278ae2a9b/apollo-router/src/plugins/coprocessor/supergraph.rs#L431-L432)

This will always panic as the wrong builder is used for the stage.

Fixes [#4013](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/4013)

#### 🚀 Features

##### Add `hasNext` to SupergraphRequest ([Issue
#&#8203;4016](https://togithub.com/apollographql/router/issues/4016))

Coprocessors multi-part response support has been enhanced to include
`hasNext`, allowing you to determine when a request has completed.

When `stage` is `SupergraphResponse`, `hasNext` if present and `true`
indicates that there will be subsequent `SupergraphResponse` calls to
the co-processor for each multi-part (`@defer`/subscriptions) response.

See the [coprocessor
documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/customizations/coprocessor/)
for more details.

##### Expose the ability to set topology spread constraints on the helm
chart ([3891](https://togithub.com/apollographql/router/issues/3891))

Give developers the ability to set topology spread constraints that can
be used to guarantee that federation pods are spread out evenly across
AZs.

#### 🐛 Fixes

##### Ignore JWKS keys which aren't supported by the router ([Issue
#&#8203;3853](https://togithub.com/apollographql/router/issues/3853))

If you have a JWKS which contains a key which has an algorithm (alg)
which the router doesn't recognise, then the entire JWKS is disregarded
even if there were other keys in the JWKS which the router could use.

We have changed the JWKS processing logic so that we remove entries with
an unrecognised algorithm from the list of available keys. We print a
warning with the name of the algorithm for each removed entry.

##### Fix panic when streaming responses to co-processor ([Issue
#&#8203;4013](https://togithub.com/apollographql/router/issues/4013))

Streamed responses will no longer cause a panic in the co-processor
plugin. This affected defer and stream queries.

[https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/4014](https://togithub.com/apollographql/router/pull/4014)

##### Only reject defer/subscriptions if actually part of a batch
([Issue
#&#8203;3956](https://togithub.com/apollographql/router/issues/3956))

Fix the checking logic so that deferred queries or subscriptions will
only be rejected when experimental batching is enabled and the
operations are part of a batch.

Without this fix, all subscriptions or deferred queries would be
rejected when experimental batching support was enabled.

##### Fix router hang when opening the explorer, prometheus or health
check page ([Issue
#&#8203;3941](https://togithub.com/apollographql/router/issues/3941))

The Router did not gracefully shutdown when an idle connections are made
by a client, and would instead hang. In particular, web browsers make
such connection in anticipation of future traffic.

This is now fixed, and the Router will now gracefully shut down in a
timely fashion.

##### Fix hang and high CPU usage when compressing small responses ([PR
#&#8203;3961](https://togithub.com/apollographql/router/pull/3961))

When returning small responses (less than 10 bytes) and compressing them
using gzip, the router could go into an infinite loop

By [@&#8203;Geal](https://togithub.com/Geal) in
[https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3961](https://togithub.com/apollographql/router/pull/3961)

#### 📃 Configuration

##### Add `enabled` field for telemetry exporters ([PR
#&#8203;3952](https://togithub.com/apollographql/router/pull/3952))

Telemetry configuration now supports `enabled` on all exporters. This
allows exporters to be disabled without removing them from the
configuration and in addition allows for a more streamlined default
configuration.

```diff
telemetry:
  tracing:
    datadog:
+      enabled: true
    jaeger:
+      enabled: true
    otlp:
+      enabled: true
    zipkin:
+      enabled: true
```

Existing configurations will be migrated to the new format automatically
on startup. However, you should update your configuration to use the new
format as soon as possible.

#### 🛠 Maintenance

##### Create a replacement self-signed server certificate: 10 years
lifespan ([Issue
#&#8203;3998](https://togithub.com/apollographql/router/issues/3998))

This certificate is only used for testing, so 10 years lifespan is
acceptable.

##### Updated documentation for deploying router ([PR

by a client, and would instead hang. In particular, web browsers make
such connection in anticipation of future traffic.

This is now fixed, and the Router will now gracefully shut down in a
timely fashion.

##### Fix hang and high CPU usage when compressing small responses ([PR
#&#8203;3961](<https://togithub.com/apollographql/router/pull/3961>))

When returning small responses (less than 10 bytes) and compressing them
using gzip, the router could go into an infinite loop

#### 📃 Configuration

##### Add `enabled` field for telemetry exporters ([PR
#&#8203;3952](<https://togithub.com/apollographql/router/pull/3952>))

Telemetry configuration now supports `enabled` on all exporters. This
allows exporters to be disabled without removing them from the
configuration and in addition allows for a more streamlined default
configuration.

```diff
telemetry:
  tracing:
    datadog:
+      enabled: true
    jaeger:
+      enabled: true
    otlp:
+      enabled: true
    zipkin:
+      enabled: true
```

Existing configurations will be migrated to the new format automatically
on startup. However, you should update your configuration to use the new
format as soon as possible.

#### 🛠 Maintenance

##### Create a replacement self-signed server certificate: 10 years
lifespan ([Issue
#&#8203;3998](<https://togithub.com/apollographql/router/issues/3998>))

This certificate is only used for testing, so 10 years lifespan is
acceptable.
