Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-6708:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling SVG files uploaded through the SVG Support plugin. Even with the "Sanitize SVG while uploading" feature enabled, the plugin fails to properly neutralize potentially malicious code embedded within SVG files.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the plugin's failure to prevent the injection of arbitrary web scripts through the SVG upload feature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. This means that malicious scripts injected into SVG files are stored on the server and executed when other users view pages containing the injected SVG.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately sanitize the SVG file contents before storing them, even when sanitization is enabled in the settings.
*   **Output Escaping Issues:** The plugin fails to properly escape the SVG content before displaying it in the browser, allowing embedded scripts to execute.
*   **Content-Type Bypass:**  Prior to version 2.5.8, the SVG sanitization could be bypassed by uploading files with a content-type other than `image/svg+xml`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users who view pages containing the malicious SVG.
*   This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user cookies to impersonate them.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or injecting malware into their browsers.
    *   **Website Defacement:** Modifying the content of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The primary attack vector is uploading a specially crafted SVG file that contains malicious JavaScript code through the WordPress media library.
*   **User Interaction (Indirect):** Exploitation requires another user to interact with the page where the malicious SVG is displayed, as the stored XSS is triggered when the SVG is rendered in the browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with "author-level access or higher" to be able to upload files.
*   **Administrator Configuration:** The WordPress administrator must allow author-level users to upload SVG files for this vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 2.5.7 of the SVG Support plugin.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.5.8 and later by enhancing the sanitization process of SVG uploads.
*   Wordfence researchers are credited with discovering and disclosing this vulnerability.
*   The provided changelog highlights the security improvements made in version 2.5.8.
