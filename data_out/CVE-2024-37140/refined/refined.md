- **Root cause of vulnerability**: OS command injection in an admin operation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in OS commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Execution of arbitrary OS commands on the system application's underlying OS with the privileges of the vulnerable application, potentially leading to system takeover.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-privileged attacker with remote network access.
