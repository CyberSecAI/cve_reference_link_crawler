Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3644-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : phppgadmin
Version        : 5.1+ds-4+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-40619
Debian Bug     : 1053004

It was discovered there was a potential remote code execution
vulnerability in phppgadmin, a web-based administration tool for the
PostgreSQL database server. This issue concerned the deserialisation
of untrusted data which may have led to remote code execution because
user-controlled data was being passed directly to the PHP
'unserialize()' function.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
5.1+ds-4+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your phppgadmin packages.

For the detailed security status of phppgadmin please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/phppgadmin>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# CVE-2023-40619: Untrusted Deserialization in phpPgAdmin v.7.14.4 and before

phpPgAdmin <= 7.14.4 is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data which may lead to remote code execution because user-controlled data is directly passed to the PHP `unserialize()` function in multiple places. An example is the functionality to manage tables in `tables.php` where the `ma[]` POST parameter is deserialized.

Discovered by Florian Walter, August 2023.
