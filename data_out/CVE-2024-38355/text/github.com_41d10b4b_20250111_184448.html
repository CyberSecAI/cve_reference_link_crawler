# Unhandled 'error' event

High

[darrachequesne](/darrachequesne)

GHSA-25hc-qcg6-38wj
Jun 19, 2024

## Package

npm

socket.io
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<2.5.0
>=3.0.0,<4.6.2

## Patched versions

2.5.1
4.6.2

## Description

### Impact

A specially crafted Socket.IO packet can trigger an uncaught exception on the Socket.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process.

```
node:events:502
    throw err; // Unhandled 'error' event
    ^

Error [ERR_UNHANDLED_ERROR]: Unhandled error. (undefined)
    at new NodeError (node:internal/errors:405:5)
    at Socket.emit (node:events:500:17)
    at /myapp/node_modules/socket.io/lib/socket.js:531:14
    at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:77:11) {
  code: 'ERR_UNHANDLED_ERROR',
  context: undefined
}

```
### Affected versions

| Version range | Needs minor update? |
| --- | --- |
| `4.6.2...latest` | Nothing to do |
| `3.0.0...4.6.1` | Please upgrade to `socket.io@4.6.2` (at least) |
| `2.3.0...2.5.0` | Please upgrade to `socket.io@2.5.1` |

### Patches

This issue is fixed by [15af22f](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/15af22fc22bc6030fcead322c106f07640336115), included in `socket.io@4.6.2` (released in May 2023).

The fix was backported in the 2.x branch today: [d30630b](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/d30630ba10562bf987f4d2b42440fc41a828119c)

### Workarounds

As a workaround for the affected versions of the `socket.io` package, you can attach a listener for the "error" event:

```
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  socket.on("error", () => {
    // ...
  });
});
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
