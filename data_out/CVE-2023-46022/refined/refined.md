- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `bid` parameter in the `/delete.php` file of Code-Projects Blood Bank V1.0 is vulnerable due to insufficient input validation, allowing for SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-Band (OOB) SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database via OOB SQL injection.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/delete.php` file, injecting a malicious SQL payload into the `bid` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and should be able to intercept and modify the request, typically using a tool like Burp Suite.
