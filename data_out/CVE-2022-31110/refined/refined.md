Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2022-31110**.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of a regular expression engine that is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking and the fact that the application allows user-supplied regular expressions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS):** The application uses the JavaScript's built-in `RegExp` engine, which is susceptible to catastrophic backtracking.
- **User-Supplied Regular Expressions:** The application allows users to provide regular expressions through parameters like `filter`, `filter_title`, `filter_description`, `filter_author`, `filterout`, `filterout_title`, `filterout_description`, and `filterout_author`.
- **Unconditional Trust:** The application does not sanitize or validate the user-supplied regular expressions.
- **No Timeout:** There's no timeout enforced when performing regular expression matches, which leads to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Vulnerable Parameters:** The application has multiple vulnerable parameters that accept user-supplied regular expressions.
- **Optional Re-enablement:** While initially patched, subsequent commits allowed instance maintainers to re-enable the vulnerable regex engine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the application to become unresponsive and consume a significant amount of CPU resources, potentially leading to a complete service disruption.
- **High CPU Usage:** Exploiting the vulnerability leads to the process `node index.js` consuming an entire CPU core for extended periods.
- **Downtime:** The application can become unresponsive for hours, especially on single-core servers (e.g. VPS)
- **Resource Exhaustion:**  On VPS, the high CPU load can consume all remaining CPU credits, causing the VPS provider to limit performance, even after the attack ends, until the credits are replenished.
- **"Zero-cost" attack:** Due to no timeouts enforced, the attack is low-cost and high impact, since one attack can lead to hours of downtime.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Query Parameters:**  Attackers can inject malicious regular expressions via HTTP query parameters such as `filter` and `filterout`.
- **Malicious Input:** Attackers can leverage user-supplied content in social media posts (e.g. via routes like `/twitter/user/:username`) to craft inputs that trigger the vulnerability when RSSHub tries to grab them, combined with a specially crafted regular expression.
- **Publicly Exposed Instances:** Any instance without additional access control is vulnerable by default.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the RSSHub instance.
- **Understanding of ReDoS:**  The attacker should understand how catastrophic backtracking in regular expressions works.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Regex:** The attacker can either use known vulnerable regex patterns or craft a specific one for targeted strings.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was initially fixed by switching to a backtracking-free regex engine (RE2).
- A patch was introduced but instance maintainers could switch back to the vulnerable `RegExp` engine if desired, making them vulnerable again, if they didn't understand the consequences.
- The vulnerability is considered high severity because of the ease of exploitation and impact.
- The vulnerability was present since Feb 9, 2020 (commit `4671720`), introduced in pull request #3910 and fixed on June 21, 2022, with commit `5c41774`.
- The last vulnerable Docker image is `diygod/rsshub:2022-06-20`.
- The full report for the vulnerability can be found in issue #10045 on the GitHub repository.
