Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-48259:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of raw SQL queries in the `getQueryData()` function within the `Oqrs_model.php` file. The function directly concatenates user-supplied input (`station_id` and `callsign`) into the SQL query string without proper sanitization or parameterization. While the `xss_clean` function is used, it only prevents XSS and not SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the lack of proper input sanitization when constructing SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code through the `station_id` and `callsign` parameters.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The affected controller (`Oqrs.php`) does not perform user authentication or authorization checks, making the vulnerable functions accessible to anyone without logging in.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Data Breach:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation (Potentially):** Depending on the database user permissions, attackers might be able to perform more critical actions on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerable functions are accessed via HTTP POST requests to the `request_form()` function in the `Oqrs.php` controller.
- **Malicious Input:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code through the `station_id` and `callsign` parameters included in the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable Function:** `getQueryData()` in `application/models/Oqrs_model.php`
- **Vulnerable Parameters:** `station_id` and `callsign`
- **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**
```php
function getQueryData($station_id, $callsign) {
    $station_id = $this->security->xss_clean($station_id);
    $callsign = $this->security->xss_clean($callsign);
    $sql = 'select lower(col_mode) col_mode, coalesce(col_submode, "") col_submode, col_band from ' . $this->config->item('table_name') . ' where station_id = ' . $station_id . ' and col_call ="' . $callsign . '" and col_prop_mode != "SAT"';

    $sql .= ' union all select lower(col_mode) col_mode, coalesce(col_submode, "") col_submode, "SAT" col_band from ' . $this->config->item('table_name') . ' where station_id = ' . $station_id . ' and col_call ="' . $callsign . '" and col_prop_mode = "SAT"';

    $query = $this->db->query($sql);

    return $query->result();
}
```
- **Controller Function:** `request_form()` in `application/controllers/Oqrs.php`

**Exploitation Examples (from the provided content):**
The attacker can inject SQL code using characters like `'` to cause errors and then use tools like SQLMap to automate the exploitation process. Examples of the payloads that can be used to perform the SQL Injection are:
```
Parameter: #1* ((custom) POST)
    Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: Boolean-based blind - Parameter replace (original value)
    Payload: station_id=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (7715=7715) THEN 1 ELSE (SELECT 4425 UNION SELECT 3185) END))&callsign=1

    Type: error-based
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0 AND error-based - WHERE, HAVING, ORDER BY or GROUP BY clause (FLOOR)
    Payload: station_id=1 AND (SELECT 9729 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x7170716b71,(SELECT (ELT(9729=9729,1))),0x716a6a6271,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a)&callsign=1

    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
    Payload: station_id=1 AND (SELECT 4523 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))PLAO)&callsign=1
```
