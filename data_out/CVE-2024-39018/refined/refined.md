- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Prototype pollution vulnerability exists in the `@cat5th/key-serializer` package. The `query, set, default.query, default.set` functions in versions 0.2.5 and below are vulnerable.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to the functions not sanitizing user-supplied inputs, allowing an attacker to use the `__proto__` property to modify the built-in Object prototype.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - By manipulating the prototype, attackers can alter the behavior of all objects inheriting from the affected prototype.
    - This can lead to denial of service, remote code execution, or cross-site scripting attacks, depending on how the application is using the polluted prototype.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attack vector is through the vulnerable `query, set, default.query, default.set` functions.
    - An attacker can call these functions with arguments crafted with the `__proto__` property.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to call the vulnerable functions with crafted arguments including the `__proto__` property.
