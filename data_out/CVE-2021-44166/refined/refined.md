- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control in FortiToken Mobile (Android) external push notification.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability arises from inadequate access control mechanisms when handling external push notifications during the 2FA process. Specifically, even if a legitimate user clicks "deny" on the push notification, the system may still grant access if an attacker already has the user's password.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker who has obtained a user's password can bypass the 2FA process, even when the legitimate user denies the authentication request via the push notification, gaining unauthorized access to the protected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, leveraging the FortiToken Mobile (Android) external push notification mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have already obtained the legitimate user's password and must be able to trigger an authentication request that generates a push notification to the user's FortiToken Mobile app.
