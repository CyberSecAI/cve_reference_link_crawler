- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call within the SOAP API interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability in the `SetSysEmailSettings` function, specifically the `EmailTo` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of root.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious SOAP request to the device's API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be on the same network as the target device, and while authentication is required, it can be bypassed. The SOAP API listens on TCP port 80 by default.
