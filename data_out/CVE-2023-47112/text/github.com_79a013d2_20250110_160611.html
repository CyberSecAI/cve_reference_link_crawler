# Authenticated users can view job names and groups for which they do not have read authorization

Moderate

published
GHSA-xvmv-4rx6-x6jx
Nov 16, 2023

## Package

maven

rundeck,rundeckpro-enterprise
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

4.17.0-4.17.2

## Patched versions

4.17.3

## Description

Access to two URLs used in both Rundeck Open Source and Process Automation products could allow authenticated users to access the URL path, which provides a list of job names and groups for any project, without the necessary authorization checks.

The affected URLs are:

* `http[s]://[host]/context/rdJob/*`
* `http[s]://[host]/context/api/*/incubator/jobs`

The output of these endpoints only exposes the name of job groups and the jobs contained within the specified project. The output is read-only and the access does not allow changes to the information.

### Impact

Rundeck, Process Automation version 4.17.0 up to 4.17.2

### Patches

Patched versions: 4.17.3

### Workarounds

Access to two URLs used in either Rundeck Open Source or Process Automation products could be blocked at a load balancer level.

* `http[s]://host/context/rdJob/*`
* `http[s]://host/context/api/*/incubator/jobs`

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
