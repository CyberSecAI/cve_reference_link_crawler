- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization checks on specific URLs allow authenticated users to access job names and groups for any project, even without read authorization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate access control on the `/rdJob/*` and `/api/*/incubator/jobs` endpoints.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of job names and group names within Rundeck projects. The output is read-only and does not allow modification.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, by sending HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires an authenticated user account on the Rundeck system.
