Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Incorrect permission checks in certain Foreign Function Interface (FFI) operations within the Deno runtime. This allowed the bypass of security restrictions designed to sandbox the execution environment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient permission checks for FFI operations, leading to a sandbox escape.
-  CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary shell code execution, meaning an attacker can run any command they choose on the host system.
-  Full control over the system running the vulnerable Deno application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious actor controlling code executed within the Deno runtime. This means the attacker needs to be able to execute code in a Deno environment.
- Exploitation through the vulnerable FFI operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to execute code within the sandboxed Deno runtime.
- The attacker must be able to craft code that leverages the vulnerable FFI operations to bypass security restrictions.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Deno versions 1.18.0 to 1.20.2, inclusive.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.20.3.
- No evidence suggests the vulnerability was exploited in the wild.
- The vulnerability does not affect users of Deno Deploy.
- The fix was implemented in pull request [14115](https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/14115).
