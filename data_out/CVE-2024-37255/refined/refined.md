- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An unprivileged user can execute actions that require higher privileges. The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special capabilities are needed, as the vulnerability is accessible to unauthenticated users.
