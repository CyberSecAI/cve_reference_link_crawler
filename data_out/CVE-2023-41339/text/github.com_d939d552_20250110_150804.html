# Unsecured WMS dynamic styling sld=<url> parameter affords blind unauthenticated SSRF

High

[jodygarnett](/jodygarnett)
published
GHSA-cqpc-x2c6-2gmf
Oct 24, 2023

## Package

maven

org.geoserver:gs-wms
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<2.22.5, <2.23.2

## Patched versions

2.22.5, 2.23.2

## Description

### Summary

The WMS specification defines an `sld=<url>` parameter for GetMap, GetLegendGraphic and GetFeatureInfo operations for user supplied "dynamic styling". Enabling the use of dynamic styles, without also configuring URL checks, provides the opportunity for Service Side Request Forgery.

It is possible to use this for "Blind SSRF" on the WMS endpoint to steal NetNTLMv2 hashes via file requests to malicious servers.

### Details

This vulnerability requires:

* WMS Settings dynamic styling being enabled
* Security URL checks to be disabled, or to be enabled and allowing `file:\\*` access

### Impact

This vulnerability can be used to steal user NetNTLMv2 hashes which could be relayed or cracked externally to gain further access.

### Mitigation

The ability to reference an external URL location is defined by the WMS standard GetMap, GetFeatureInfo and GetLegendGraphic operations. These operations are defined by an Industry and International standard and cannot be redefined by the GeoServer application in isolation.

To disable dynamic styling on GeoServer 2.10.3 and GeoServer 2.11.1:

1. Navigate to **Services > WMS Settings** page
2. Locate **Dynamic styling** heading
3. Select the **Disable usage of SLD and SLD\_BODY parameters in GET requests and user styles in POST** checkbox.

### Resolution

To allow dynamic styling safely on GeoServer 2.22.5 and GeoServer 2.23.2:

1. Navigate to **Security > URL Checks**
2. Enable **URL Checks are enabled** setting
3. Check the user manual for [examples](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/security/urlchecks.html#example-regex-patterns) of how to trust specific locations:

   `^https://styles\.server\.net/cartography/.*$`
4. Enable dynamic styling on the **Services > WMS Settings** page, deselect the **Disable usage of SLD and SLD\_BODY parameters in GET requests and user styles in POST** checkbox.

Use of dynamic styling safely is on by default in GeoServer 2.24.0.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
