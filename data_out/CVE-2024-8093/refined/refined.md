- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "Posts reminder" lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into unintentionally updating the plugin's settings. This could lead to modification of email templates and other configuration.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious HTML file or website with a form that submits to the vulnerable settings update endpoint when an admin opens it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in admin to visit a malicious page or file.
