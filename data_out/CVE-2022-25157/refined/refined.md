Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-25157:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a password hash instead of the actual password for authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-836**: Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:
    - Disclose sensitive information on the affected product.
    - Tamper with information on the affected product.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack can be carried out remotely over a network.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Eavesdropping:** The attacker needs to eavesdrop on the network communication to capture a password hash.
- **Replay:** The attacker can then replay the captured password hash to gain access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to eavesdrop on network traffic between a legitimate user and the vulnerable device to obtain a password hash.
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device to replay the captured password hash.
- The attacker doesn't need prior authentication to the system.
- The attacker does not need user interaction to perform the attack.
