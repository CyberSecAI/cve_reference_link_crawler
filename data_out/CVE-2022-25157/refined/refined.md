Based on the provided document, here's the information related to CVE-2022-25157:

**Vulnerability:** Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication (CWE-836)

**Root Cause:** The affected Mitsubishi Electric FA products use password hashes instead of the actual password for authentication. This allows an attacker to potentially bypass authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - The primary vulnerability is the use of password hashes for authentication, which is susceptible to replay attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
   - A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the affected product.
   - Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure or modification of sensitive information within the product.

**Attack Vectors:**
   - Remote, over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to eavesdrop on network traffic to capture a valid password hash.
   - The attacker needs to replay the captured password hash to authenticate to the vulnerable system.
   - No prior authentication is required for exploitation.
   - The attack complexity is rated as high.

**Additional Details:**
- The specific impact, as detailed in the provided content for this CVE, is that the attacker can "disclose or tamper with the information in the product". This is more specific than the general description "bypass authentication".
- The affected products are listed as:
   - MELSEC iQ-F Series FX5U(C) CPU modules, All models: All versions
   - MELSEC iQ-F Series FX5UJ CPU modules, All models: All versions
