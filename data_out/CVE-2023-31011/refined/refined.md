- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the REST service of the NVIDIA DGX H100 BMC.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of input data within the REST service. This falls under CWE-20, which indicates an issue with input validation, handling of external input without proper sanitization or verification.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to escalation of privileges and information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent, meaning that the attacker must have access to the same network segment as the vulnerable system. The attacker needs high privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires adjacent network access and must have high privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
