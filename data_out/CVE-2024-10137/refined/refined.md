Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `id` parameter in the `manage_medicine.php` script within the Pharmacy Management System. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where user-supplied input is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Deletion:** Attackers can delete critical records in the database.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to and expose sensitive information stored in the database.
*   **Disruption of Operations:** Exploitation can disrupt essential functions of the pharmacy management system, leading to operational issues.
*   **Database Corruption**: The attacker may modify data within the database leading to database corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **GET Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted GET request to the `/php/manage_medicine.php` endpoint. The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable endpoint (`/php/manage_medicine.php`) and its parameter (`id`).

**Additional Information:**

*   **Vulnerable System:** Pharmacy Management System version 1.0.
*   **Vulnerable Endpoint:** `/php/manage_medicine.php?action=delete&id=1`
*   **Proof of Concept:** A sample GET request demonstrating the vulnerability is provided, including an example of SQL injection using `BENCHMARK` and `MD5` functions for testing purposes.
*   **Exploitation Tools:** The use of Burp Suite and SQLMap to exploit this vulnerability is shown using images.
*   **Status:** The vulnerability is noted as unpatched.
