{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper privilege validation for the `/xxl-job-admin/joblog/clearLog` and `/xxl-job-admin/joblog/logDetailCat` endpoints. These endpoints do not verify if the user making the request has the necessary permissions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient authorization",
      "Missing privilege checks"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with a low-privileged user account can query job logs and clear job logs without proper authorization, potentially leading to sensitive information leakage and data loss.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "Direct HTTP POST requests to `/xxl-job-admin/joblog/clearLog`",
       "Direct HTTP POST requests to `/xxl-job-admin/joblog/logDetailCat`"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have access to a low-privileged user account within the system. They also need to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints."
