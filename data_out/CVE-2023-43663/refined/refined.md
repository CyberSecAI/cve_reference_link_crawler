Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control in the PrestaShop back office, specifically within the `AdminDashboardController`. The `ajaxProcessSaveDashConfig` function allows any module's hook to be called without proper authorization checks, as long as it is a valid hook and exists on the module object. This allows an attacker to trigger actions related to any module, even if they have low user rights.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Inadequate Authorization:** The code lacks proper verification of user permissions before executing module hooks via the AJAX request. While there's a check for a list of allowed hooks `self::DASHBOARD_ALLOWED_HOOKS`, it does not consider user roles and permissions in the module context.
- **Hook Execution via AJAX:** The `ajaxProcessSaveDashConfig` endpoint allows arbitrary hook execution on module objects if a valid hook name exists, without checking if the user is authorized to execute it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Module Manipulation:** An attacker with low user rights can disable or uninstall modules from the back office.
- **Potential Data Loss/Modification:** By using other vulnerable hook methods, an attacker might be able to modify data if a vulnerable hook method is available.
- **Availability Impact:** The attacker can render some system features unavailable by disabling or uninstalling modules.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is conducted via network requests to the web application.
- **AJAX Endpoint:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted AJAX request to the `ajaxProcessSaveDashConfig` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs only a low-privileged back-office user account to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the PrestaShop application.
- **Knowledge of Modules/Hooks:** The attacker must have knowledge of the existing modules and their hook names to execute actions via the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional details:**
The provided files show the fix for the vulnerability by introducing a check that prevents unauthorized execution of module hooks. The vulnerability is referred to as GHSA-6jmf-2pfc-q9m7 in the advisory, which is the same vulnerability as CVE-2023-43663. The fix is included in PrestaShop version 8.1.2.
