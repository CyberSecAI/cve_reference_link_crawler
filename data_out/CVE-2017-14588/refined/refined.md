Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `dialog` parameter within various resources of Atlassian FishEye and Crucible.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input, specifically within the `dialog` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Remote attackers can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript into the application, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the web application
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Access to sensitive user information

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the `dialog` parameter in HTTP requests. By crafting malicious HTML or JavaScript code within this parameter, an attacker can trigger the XSS vulnerability when a user accesses the affected resource.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs and have a user (victim) access the manipulated URL. The attacker does not need prior authentication to the application.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affects Atlassian FishEye and Crucible before version 4.4.2.
*   The fix is included in versions 4.4.2 and 4.5.0.
*   The vulnerability is labeled as "Severity 2 - Major."
*   The issue is tracked in Jira as FE-6935 (for FishEye) and CRUC-8113 (for Crucible).
