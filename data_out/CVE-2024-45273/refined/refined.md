Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45273:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **weak implementation of encryption** used to protect configuration files in the affected devices. The encryption key is derived from a predictable pattern.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-261: Weak Encoding for Password**: The device employs a weak method to encrypt the configuration file where the encryption key is derived using a known pattern.
*   **CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key**: The encryption key is not truly random and is based on a predefined and predictable format which effectively renders the encryption ineffective.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An unauthenticated **local attacker** can decrypt the device's configuration file.
*   Decryption of the config file leads to exposure of sensitive information, such as VPN credentials.
*   Compromise of the device due to the ability to manipulate the configuration.
*   Undetectable tampering and manipulation of configuration files are possible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local access** to the device is required to obtain the encrypted configuration file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs physical or local access to the device to get a copy of the encrypted configuration file.
*   The attacker must be able to generate the encryption key based on the known pattern.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

Based on the provided documents, these products and versions are affected by CVE-2024-45273:

*   **MB connect line:**
    *   mbNET/mbNET.rokey <= 8.2.0
    *   mbCONNECT24 <= 2.16.2
    *   mymbCONNECT24 <= 2.16.2
    *  mbNET HW1 <= 5.1.11
    *   mbSPIDER <= 2.6.5
    *   mbNET.mini <= 2.2.13
*   **Helmholz:**
    *   myREX24 V2 <= 2.16.2
    *   myREX24.virtual <= 2.16.2
    *   REX200/250 <= 8.2.0
    *   REX300 <= 5.1.11
    *   REX100 <= 2.2.13

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory from SySS GmbH (SYSS-2024-062) provides more technical details, including a proof-of-concept (PoC) that shows how the encryption key can be derived and used to decrypt the configuration file.
*   The vendor note ([4] in SySS advisory) confirms that a new "encryption" concept will be implemented.
*   The SySS advisory mentions that other/similar devices are also affected, implying that the vulnerability may be present in more products than those specifically listed.
*   The vulnerability allows for tampering and manipulation of configuration files without detection.
