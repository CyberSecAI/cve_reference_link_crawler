Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the use of `fmt.Sprintf` to construct SQL queries dynamically using user-supplied input without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the `indexName`, `tableName`, and `fields` parameters are directly inserted into SQL statements, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which occurs because user-controlled input is concatenated directly into SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Manipulation:** An attacker could manipulate database queries to perform malicious operations. This could include reading sensitive data, modifying existing data, deleting data, or executing database administrative commands.
*   **Data Breach:** Exploitation could lead to a complete data breach, as the attacker can extract any data from the database.
*   **System Compromise:** In severe cases, an attacker may be able to execute operating system commands via the database if the database user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exposed through the `/table/index` and `/table/index/:id` routes, which handle the creation and updating of table indexes, respectively.
*   The attacker can control the `indexName`, `tableName`, and `fields` parameters via POST or PUT requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make POST or PUT requests to the `/table/index` and `/table/index/:id` endpoints.
*   The attacker must be able to manipulate the request body to control the `indexName`, `tableName`, and `fields` parameters.

**Specific Vulnerable Code Locations:**

*   `repository/impl/sys_table_imp.go`:
    *   Line 63: SQL injection vulnerability in `CreateTableIndex`.
    *   Line 70: SQL injection vulnerability in `DropTableIndex`.
    *   `createIndexSql := fmt.Sprintf("CREATE %s INDEX %s ON %s (%s)", unique, indexName, tableName, fields)`
    *   `dropIndexSQL := fmt.Sprintf("DROP INDEX %s ON %s", indexName, tableName)`

**Additional Notes**
*   The commit `146359646a5a90cb09156dbd0013b7df77f2aa6c` on GitHub shows changes to multiple controller files, which include sanitization of user input using `utils.SanitizeInput()` for parameters passed in the URL, but not for parameters in request bodies.
*   The GitHub issues #1 and #2 confirm the SQL injection vulnerability in the `/table/index` and `/table/index/:id` routes respectively, which were closed by the owner after the issues were raised.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability lies in the insecure construction of SQL queries by concatenating user-supplied data, specifically in the `/table/index` and `/table/index/:id` routes, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.
