{
  "CVE-2024-40432": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The driver doesn't validate `ProtocolArgumentSize` field of the `SFFDISK_DEVICE_COMMAND_DATA` structure, which is used as an offset when copying data, allowing writing out of bounds of the SystemBuffer.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds write",
      "Missing bounds check on user-controlled offset"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary kernel memory write, leading to potential denial of service (BSOD) or privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted IOCTL_SFFDISK_DEVICE_COMMAND request to the device driver.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A non-privileged user with write access to the device object (PDO)."
  }
}
