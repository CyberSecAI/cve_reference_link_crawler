Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-24021

**Affected Product:** Novel-Plus v4.3.0-RC1 and prior

**Root Cause:**
  - The vulnerability is a SQL injection.
  - It stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input. Specifically, the `offset`, `limit`, and `sort` parameters used in the `/novel/userFeedback/list` endpoint are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly incorporates user-controlled parameters into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterized queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries by manipulating the offset, limit, and sort parameters. This could allow them to:
    - **Data Breach:** Access sensitive data from the database, including user information, application settings, etc.
    - **Data Modification:** Modify or delete data in the database.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gain access to the underlying operating system depending on the database permissions.
    - **Denial of Service:** Disrupt normal operations by injecting queries that consume resources or cause the application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending malicious HTTP requests to the `/novel/userFeedback/list` endpoint.
  - **Malicious Parameters:** The attacker manipulates the `offset`, `limit`, and `sort` parameters within the request to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
  - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided text mentions that the vulnerability exists in Novel-Plus v4.3.0-RC1 and prior versions.
- The fixed version is also mentioned to be Novel-Plus v4.3.0-RC1 which seems incorrect because it mentions that version is vulnerable.
- The vendor of the product is identified as `https://github.com/201206030/novel-plus`.
- The content was extracted from a text file in a GitHub repository, and another page of the related project on Github, which include information about the project.
