- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A malformed plugin shortname in the manifest of a plugin package installed via `--archive-url` or `--archive-path` allows for arbitrary file overwriting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability due to improper handling of plugin shortnames.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system where `stripe-cli` is running.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited when a user installs a malicious plugin package via `--archive-url` or `--archive-path`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to craft a malicious plugin package with a crafted manifest containing a malformed plugin shortname. The attacker needs to convince a user to install the malicious plugin using `stripe-cli`. User interaction is required. The attacker would need to host the malicious plugin package on a location accessible via a URL if the user is using the `--archive-url` flag or have the malicious archive file locally if the user is using the `--archive-path` flag.
