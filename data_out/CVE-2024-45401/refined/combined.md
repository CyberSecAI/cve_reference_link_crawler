Sep 5, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

>= 1.11.1

## Patched versions

1.21.3

## Description

### Impact

A vulnerability exists in stripe-cli versions 1.11.1 and higher where a plugin package containing a manifest with a malformed plugin shortname installed using the --archive-url or --archive-path flags can overwrite arbitrary files.

The update addresses the path traversal vulnerability by removing the ability to install plugins from an archive URL or path.

There has been no evidence of exploitation of this vulnerability.

### Recommendation

Upgrade to stripe-cli v1.21.3.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
