      "Sending a crafted YAML payload to `/api/apps/define/yml` endpoint which uses SnakeYaml's `loadAs` to deserialize the provided configuration, allowing for instantiating arbitrary constructors.",
      "Uploading a crafted YAML file to `/api/monitors/import` endpoint, which uses SnakeYaml to deserialize the configuration.",
