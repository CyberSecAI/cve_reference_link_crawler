# XBlock custom auth does not respect JWT Scopes

## Description

### Context

XBlocks have enabled JWT authentication via its own custom code here:

[edx-platform/lms/djangoapps/courseware/block\_render.py](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/blob/0b3e4d73b6fb6f41ae87cf2b77bca12052ee1ac8/lms/djangoapps/courseware/block_render.py#L752-L775)

|  | # In this case, we are using Session based authentication, so we need to check CSRF token. |
| --- | --- |
|  | if request.user.is\_authenticated: |
|  | error = CsrfViewMiddleware(get\_response=lambda request: None).process\_view(request, None, (), {}) |
|  | if error: |
|  | return error |
|  |  |
|  | # We are reusing DRF logic to provide support for JWT and Oauth2. We abandoned the idea of using DRF view here |
|  | # to avoid introducing backwards-incompatible changes. |

|  | else: |
|  | authentication\_classes = (JwtAuthentication, BearerAuthenticationAllowInactiveUser) |
|  | authenticators = [auth() for auth in authentication\_classes] |
|  |  |
|  | for authenticator in authenticators: |
|  | try: |
|  | user\_auth\_tuple = authenticator.authenticate(request) |
|  | except APIException: |
|  | log.exception( |
|  | "XBlock handler %r failed to authenticate with %s", handler, authenticator.\_\_class\_\_.\_\_name\_\_ |
|  | ) |
|  | else: |
|  | if user\_auth\_tuple is not None: |
|  | request.user, \_ = user\_auth\_tuple |
|  | break |

This code does not respect JWT scopes, and someone with a JWT with more limited scopes could call this endpoint when they are not supposed to.

Our JWT scope code is somewhat brittle. It relies on [this middleware code](https://github.com/openedx/edx-drf-extensions/blob/master/edx_rest_framework_extensions/auth/jwt/middleware.py#L44) to add a scope related permission class if no other scope related permission class is found. It then relies on DRF permissions to enforce this permission.

A solution might be to have custom code that makes use of that permission as well.

Ideally, our auth code (which is quite complex) would all live in edx-drf-extensions and this custom code for enabling JWT authentication (or DRF Authentication and permissions) on a Django request, would live with the rest of the other auth code so individual services don't implement custom solutions.

Aside: this custom code happened to cause an unexpected bug because it is authenticating using a Django request object, rather than a DRF request object.

### Impact

Someone with a JWT with more limited scopes could call this endpoint when they are not supposed to.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
