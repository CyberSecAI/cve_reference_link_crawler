#### iOS 4

* **Application Sandbox**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1751

  Available for: iOS 2.0 through 3.1.3 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 3.1.3 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later

  Impact: An application may be able to infer the user's location without authorization

  Description: The Application Sandbox does not prevent applications from directly accessing the user's photo library. This may allow an application to determine visited locations without authorization. This issue is addressed by modifying the Application Sandbox to prevent direct access to the user's photo library. Credit to Zac White for reporting this issue.

* **CFNetwork**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1752

  Available for: iOS 2.0 through 3.1.3 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 3.1.3 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later

  Impact: A device with a MobileMe account configured may be remotely wiped, even if "Find My iPhone" is disabled

  Description: A user may configure their device to use MobileMe. Individual MobileMe services may be enabled or disabled via the Settings app. Disabling the "Find My iPhone" service prevents the device from being located via MobileMe, but does not prevent the phone from being wiped. An attacker with access to the password of the configured MobileMe account may be able to wipe the device. This issue is addressed by disabling remote wipe and message display when the "Find My iPhone" service is disabled on the device.

* **ImageIO**

  Impact: Remote Lock via MobileMe may not be effective in preventing access

  Description: If the device is unlocked in response to an alert, such as receiving a text message or voicemail, and MobileMe is then used to Remote Lock the device, then the next unlock of the device will have the passcode already entered. A person with physical access to the device will not require the passcode in this situation. This issue is addressed by properly clearing the passcode. Credit to Sidney San Martin of DeepTech, Inc. for reporting this issue.

* **Passcode Lock**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1775

  Impact: A maliciously crafted URL may be obfuscated, making phishing attacks more effective

  Description: Safari supports the inclusion of user information in URLs, which allows the URL to specify a username and password to authenticate the user to the named server. These URLs are often used to confuse users, which can potentially aid phishing attacks. Safari is updated to display a warning before navigating to an HTTP or HTTPS URL containing user information. Credit to Abhishek Arya of Google, Inc. for reporting this issue.

* **Safari**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1723

  Available for: iOS 2.0 through 3.1.3 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 3.1.3 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later

  Impact: A maliciously crafted website may control the displayed website URL while a certificate warning is displayed

  Description: When Safari reaches a website via a 302 redirection and a certificate warning is displayed, the URL bar will contain the original website URL instead of the current website URL. This may allow a maliciously crafted website that is reached via an open redirector on a user-trusted website to control the displayed website URL while a certificate warning is displayed. This issue is addressed by returning the correct URL in the underlying CFNetwork layer. Credit to Kevin Day of Your.Org, and Jason Mueller of Indiana University for reporting this issue.

* **Settings**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1756

  Available for: iOS 2.0 through 3.1.3 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 3.1.3 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2816

  Available for: iOS 2.0 through 3.1.3 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 3.1.3 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may result in unexpected actions on other websites

  Description: An issue exists in WebKit's implementation of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. Before allowing a page from one origin to access a resource in another origin, WebKit sends a preflight request to the latter server for access to the resource. WebKit includes custom HTTP headers specified by the requesting page in the preflight request. This can facilitate cross-site request forgery. This issue is addressed by removing custom HTTP headers from preflight requests. Credit: Apple.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-0544

  Available for: iOS 2.0 through 3.1.3 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 3.1.3 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later

  Impact: Visiting an HTTPS site which redirects to an HTTP site may lead to an information disclosure

  Description: When WebKit is redirected from an HTTPS site to an HTTP site, the Referer header is passed to the HTTP site. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information contained in the URL of the HTTPS site. This issue is addressed by not passing the Referer header when an HTTPS site redirects to an HTTP site. Credit to Colin Percival of Tarsnap for reporting this issue.
