Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input verification for the "subid" parameter in the `showtest.php` file of the "Online Quiz Site Using PHP With Source Code" project. The application directly uses the `subid` parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code via the `subid` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can access sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Comprehensive System Control:**  Potentially allows for complete system control.
- **Service Interruption:** The vulnerability can lead to service interruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request via the `subid` parameter in the `showtest.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required, as the vulnerability can be exploited without logging in.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `showtest.php` file.
- The application fails to sanitize/validate the `subid` parameter, leading to SQL injection.
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) shows examples of boolean-based blind SQL injection, time-based blind SQL injection, and UNION query injection.
- SQLMap can be used to exploit the vulnerability.
- Example payloads:
    - `subid=1 AND 7447=7447` (boolean-based blind)
    - `subid=1 AND (SELECT 2864 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))ZLzn)` (time-based blind)
    - `subid=1 UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x71766a7171,0x67614a667474486c526c48786c71697a6d644b6a5861694b5a665a4f624e436e794e6c5966594967,0x716a627071),NULL-- -` (UNION query)

**Mitigation:**
- The provided mitigation steps are:
  1. **Use prepared statements with parameter binding:** This will treat input as data, not as code.
  2. **Input validation and filtering:** Validate and filter user input data to conform to expected formats.
  3. **Minimize database user permissions:** Use database accounts with the least privileges.
  4. **Regular security audits:** Regularly audit code and systems to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.
