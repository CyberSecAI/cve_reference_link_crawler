- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `fileurl` parameter in `links.php` is not properly sanitized when saving external links. This unsanitized input is later used in HTML code that is passed to the `print` function in `link.php` and `index.php`, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Cookie theft
    - Session hijacking
    - Performing actions on the web application on behalf of other users, such as admin users.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - An attacker crafts a malicious payload in the `fileurl` parameter when creating an external link through HTTP POST request.
    - The malicious payload is stored in the database and then executed when a user views the page displaying external links (`link.php`) or when accessing the main console page (`index.php`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to have the privilege to create external links within the Cacti application.
    - The attacker can be on the network, with low attack complexity.
    - User interaction is required by the victim (to view a page) to trigger the XSS.
