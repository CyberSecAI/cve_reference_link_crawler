cMT EasyWeb V1 Security Fixes

Technical Notice

2021-03-17 (Rev. 1)

Summary

According to ICSA-20-077-01, security issues are found in EasyWeb V1.1 on cMT devices.

If these devices are exposed to an open network, like below, we strongly suggest customers

to disconnect the device from the network and upgrade the operating system (OS).

If these devices are not connected to an open network, they may not be affected but we still

suggest customers to upgrade the OS.

A device is said to be exposed to an open network, if it can be accessed by a public IP

(meaning an IP address NOT like 192.168.x.y, 172.16.x.y with 16 varied from 16 to 31, or

10.x.y.z). For example, you can directly access the device from your home with the firewallâ€™s

IP address. In the example below, it can be access by typing http://1.2.3.4:80 in the web

browser. Note that the firewall must have been configured to allow this operation.

A device accessible to the Internet (firewall is configured to forward the packet)

Description

According to ICSA-20-077-01, security issues are addressed with EasyWeb V1.1 running on

cMT devices. EasyWeb provides the configuration web interface for cMT devices.

A remote attacker may gain access to the system or remotely execute commands without

authentication via the web server whose version is below V1.2 (not included).

If the device mentioned above is connected an open network, meaning the device can be

accessed by anyone, we strongly suggest customers to:

(1) Disconnect the device from the open network

(2) Upgrade the OS of the device

(3) (Optional) Use EasyAccess 2.0 (our secured VPN service) to access the device so there is

no need to expose the device directly to the Internet. EasyAccess 2.0 is a VPN-based remote

access solution providing secure connections between PC/Android/iOS and the devices.

EasyAccess 2.0 Network Overview

In this case, you can access the device via a public IP not in the same network.

b) The device is connected to a network where guests or anyone have access to such as an

open Wi-Fi network.
