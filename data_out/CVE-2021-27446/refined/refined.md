Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-27446:

**CVE-2021-27446**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper control of code generation leading to code injection vulnerabilities in the Weintek cMT product line's EasyWeb interface.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Code Injection (CWE-94):**  The primary vulnerability is a code injection flaw that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the device's operating system.
    *   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):**  While this CVE is specifically for code injection, the advisory also mentions other vulnerabilities, including improper access controls that allow unauthorized access to sensitive information and administrative actions. This is tracked under CVE-2021-27444.
     *   **Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79):** The advisory also notes a cross-site scripting vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript. This is tracked under CVE-2021-27442.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Code Injection:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can execute commands with root privileges.
     *  **Improper Access Control:** Allows for remote access and download of sensitive information, and performing administrative actions
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting:**  Allows an attacker to inject malicious javascript into the web interface.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is remote, requiring no authentication.
    *   The vulnerabilities are in the EasyWeb web interface, which exposes the devices to potential exploitation when connected to an open network (accessible via public IP).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to reach the affected devices over a network (either local or public)
    *   No authentication is needed to exploit the code injection vulnerability.
*   **Affected Products:** Weintek cMT devices with EasyWeb V1.1, specifically:
    *   cMT-SVR-1xx/2xx, versions prior to 20210305
    *   cMT-G01/G02, versions prior to 20210209
    *   cMT-G03/G04, versions prior to 20210222
    *   cMT3071/cMT3072/cMT3090/cMT3103/cMT3151, versions prior to 20210218
    *   cMT-HDM, versions prior to 20210204
    *   cMT-FHD, versions prior to 20210208
    *   cMT-CTRL01, versions prior to 20210302

**Additional Details:**

*   The CISA advisory assigns a CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 to the code injection vulnerability (CVE-2021-27446) with the vector string of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating a critical severity
*   The vendor, Weintek, has released OS updates to address these vulnerabilities.
*   The advisory recommends minimizing network exposure for control system devices, isolating them behind firewalls, and using secure methods like VPNs for remote access.
*   The advisory states there are no known public exploits that specifically target these vulnerabilities.

In summary, CVE-2021-27446 highlights a severe code injection flaw in Weintek cMT devices that can be exploited remotely and without authentication to gain root privileges, alongside other related vulnerabilities involving improper access control and cross-site scripting.
