## 4. MITIGATIONS

Weintek has released OS [upgrades for the affected products](https://www.weintek.com/globalw/Download/Download.aspx). Refer to [Weintek’s Technical Notice](https://dl.weintek.com/public/Document/TEC/TEC21001E_cMT_EasyWeb_V1_Security_Issues.pdf) regarding these vulnerabilities.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

cMT EasyWeb V1 Security Fixes

Technical Notice

2021-03-17 (Rev. 1)

Summary

According to ICSA-20-077-01, security issues are found in EasyWeb V1.1 on cMT devices.

If these devices are exposed to an open network, like below, we strongly suggest customers

to disconnect the device from the network and upgrade the operating system (OS).

If these devices are not connected to an open network, they may not be affected but we still

suggest customers to upgrade the OS.

A device is said to be exposed to an open network, if it can be accessed by a public IP

(meaning an IP address NOT like 192.168.x.y, 172.16.x.y with 16 varied from 16 to 31, or

10.x.y.z). For example, you can directly access the device from your home with the firewall’s

IP address. In the example below, it can be access by typing http://1.2.3.4:80 in the web

browser. Note that the firewall must have been configured to allow this operation.

A device accessible to the Internet (firewall is configured to forward the packet)

Description

According to ICSA-20-077-01, security issues are addressed with EasyWeb V1.1 running on

cMT devices. EasyWeb provides the configuration web interface for cMT devices.

A remote attacker may gain access to the system or remotely execute commands without

authentication via the web server whose version is below V1.2 (not included).

If the device mentioned above is connected an open network, meaning the device can be

accessed by anyone, we strongly suggest customers to:

(1) Disconnect the device from the open network

(2) Upgrade the OS of the device

1

(3) (Optional) Use EasyAccess 2.0 (our secured VPN service) to access the device so there is

no need to expose the device directly to the Internet. EasyAccess 2.0 is a VPN-based remote

access solution providing secure connections between PC/Android/iOS and the devices.

cMT EasyWeb V1 Security Fixes

EasyAccess 2.0 Network Overview

Some examples of an open network:

a) Device is connected to a router which is configured to forward TCP port 80 to the device.

In this case, you can access the device via a public IP not in the same network.

b) The device is connected to a network where guests or anyone have access to such as an

open Wi-Fi network.

Affected Range

The security issues are found in the unpatched web service, EasyWeb V1.1, which is already

running on the cMT products listed below.

A device is affected only if the following two conditions are met:

(1) It is connected to an open network where a remote attacker may have access to.
