Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The B&R Automation Runtime's FTP server supports insecure encryption mechanisms, specifically SSLv3, TLSv1.0, and TLSv1.1. These older protocols have known vulnerabilities and are considered insecure.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Use of obsolete and insecure encryption protocols (SSLv3, TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1)
    *   Vulnerable FTP server component

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks: An attacker can intercept and potentially modify communications between the affected products and other parties.
    *   Decryption of communications: An attacker can decrypt the communication, gaining access to sensitive data.

*   **Attack Vectors:** Network-based attacks. An attacker needs network access to the affected system.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Network access to the affected B&R Automation Runtime system, either directly or through a compromised network, or by installing malicious software on a system node.
    *   Ability to craft and send messages to the affected system.

*   **Affected Products:** B&R Automation Runtime versions prior to I4.93

*   **Mitigation:** Update to B&R Automation Runtime version I4.93 or later, which removes the vulnerability. Additional recommendations include isolating the automation network behind firewalls, implementing physical security measures, and keeping systems up-to-date with security patches.

* **CVSS Score:**
    * Base Score: 9.8 (Critical)
    * Temporal Score: 9.1 (Critical)
    * Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C
