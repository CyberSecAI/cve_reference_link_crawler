Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-32630:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect calculation of buffer size within the "throttling" component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the incorrect buffer size calculation, which can lead to writing beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Escalation of Privilege (EoP):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to an attacker gaining elevated privileges on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the device already.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **System Execution Privileges Needed**: The attacker requires system execution privileges to trigger and exploit the vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction Needed**: The vulnerability does not require any user interaction to be exploited, making it easier to leverage once the attacker has the required privileges.

**Affected Chipsets:**
- MT6789, MT6855, MT6895, MT6983, MT8781

**Affected Software Versions:**
- Android 12.0, 13.0
