Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-21710:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a division-by-zero error in the `eps_print_page` function within the `devices/gdevepsn.c` file of Ghostscript. The division by zero occurs when a custom resolution is set too low.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Division-by-zero error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). The division-by-zero error causes the Ghostscript process to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By processing a specially crafted PostScript file (.eps or .pdf) that triggers the vulnerable code path.
- Command line execution of the `gs` tool using a crafted file: `gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -dSAFER -r8 -dNOCIE -dFitPage -sOutputFile=tmp -sDEVICE=eps9mid $PoC`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious PostScript file to be processed by Ghostscript.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the `gs` tool with specified parameters.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided bug report includes a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) file that triggers the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is also present in `devices/gdevepsc.c:epsc_print_page`
- The vulnerability was fixed in commits `f70ab2044429fe4b991801476ea3f4b4a5c0cdf4` and `4e713293de84b689c4ab358f3e110ea54aa81925`.
- A Debian LTS advisory (DLA 3582-1) addressed this issue.
