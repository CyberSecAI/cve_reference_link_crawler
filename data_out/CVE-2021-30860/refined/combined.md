Installation note:

This update is available through iTunes and Software Update on your
iOS device, and will not appear in your computer's Software Update
application, or in the Apple Downloads site. Make sure you have an
Internet connection and have installed the latest version of iTunes
from <https://www.apple.com/itunes/>

iTunes and Software Update on the device will automatically check
Apple's update server on its weekly schedule. When an update is
detected, it is downloaded and the option to be installed is
presented to the user when the iOS device is docked. We recommend
applying the update immediately if possible. Selecting Don't Install
will present the option the next time you connect your iOS device.
The automatic update process may take up to a week depending on the
day that iTunes or the device checks for updates. You may manually
obtain the update via the Check for Updates button within iTunes, or
the Software Update on your device.

To check that the iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad has been updated:
* Navigate to Settings
* Select General
* Select About
* The version after applying this update will be "12.5.5"

Information will also be posted to the Apple Security Updates

Subject: JBIG2 integer overflow fixed in Xpdf 4.04, Poppler 22.09.0

Xpdf 4.04 (released 2022-04-18, CVE-2022-38171):

   <<https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-38171>>

   <<https://gist.github.com/zmanion/b2ed0d1a0cec163ecd07d5e3d9740dc6>>

Poppler 22.09.0 (released 2022-09-01, CVE-2022-38784):

   <<https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-38784>>

   <<https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/-/blob/master/NEWS>>

   <<https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/-/merge_requests/1261/diffs?commit_id=27354e9d9696ee2bc063910a6c9a6b27c5184a52>>

The lineage of this bug includes a variant used as part of the FORCEDENTRY exploit chain (targeting Apple devices).  The bug readily crashes affected software, code execution is not straightforward and would depend heavily on the context in which affected software is used.

FORCEDENTRY was first discussed publicly in 2021, it took some time to track down the affected OSS components.  Lots of packages are downstream of Xpdf and Poppler.

Crashing test case, use at your own risk:

For background, Apple CoreGraphics fixes released in September 2021 (CVE-2021-30860):

   <<https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-30860>>
