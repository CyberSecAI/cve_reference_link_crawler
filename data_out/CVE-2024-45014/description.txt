In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/boot: Avoid possible physmem_info segment corruption

When physical memory for the kernel image is allocated it does not
consider extra memory required for offsetting the image start to
match it with the lower 20 bits of KASLR virtual base address. That
might lead to kernel access beyond its memory range.
