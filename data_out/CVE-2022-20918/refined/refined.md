Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20918:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided documents include a Cisco Security Advisory specifically addressing CVE-2022-20918. The advisory details the vulnerability and provides relevant information.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the presence of a default credential for SNMP versions 1 (SNMPv1) and 2 (SNMPv2) within Cisco FirePOWER Software for ASA FirePOWER module, Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software, and Cisco Next-Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPS) Software.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Default SNMP Credentials:** The primary weakness is the use of a default community string for SNMP access, which is a well-known security flaw.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** Lack of proper access control on SNMP.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the affected device by performing SNMP GET requests using the default credential.
*   The attacker can only perform SNMP GET requests, not write access.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely if SNMP is enabled on the device and the attacker can reach the device on the network.
*   **SNMP GET Requests:** The attacker sends SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 GET requests to the vulnerable device.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the affected device and must be able to send SNMP requests to it.
*   **No Authentication Required**: The attacker does not need authentication credentials beyond the default community string.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco FirePOWER Software for ASA FirePOWER module, Cisco FMC Software, and Cisco NGIPS Software releases 7.0.0 through 7.0.4 if SNMP is enabled.
*   **Fixed Software:** The vulnerability is fixed in software Release 7.0.5 and later.
*   **Workaround:** Cisco provides a workaround that involves disabling or restricting access to SNMP by modifying `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`. It is also suggested to remove the SNMP configuration or allow connections only from trusted SNMP monitoring hosts.
*  **CVSS Score:**  The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.5 (High severity) with vector string CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
*   **No Known Exploitation:**  Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability at the time of the advisory publication.

**Summary**

CVE-2022-20918 is a high-severity vulnerability due to the usage of default SNMP credentials that allow remote unauthenticated information disclosure. The vulnerability is easily exploitable, requiring only network access and sending SNMP GET requests. Cisco has provided both workarounds and fixes in software updates to address this issue.
