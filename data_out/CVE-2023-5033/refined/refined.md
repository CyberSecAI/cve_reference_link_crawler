Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the `/admin/category/cate-edit-run.php` file. Specifically, the `id` parameter, which is user-controlled, is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly uses unsanitized user input (`id` parameter) within an SQL query, allowing for the execution of arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.
- The attacker can modify, delete, or extract sensitive data from the database.
- The attacker could potentially escalate the attack based on the level of database access obtained.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack can be carried out remotely via HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed via a POST request to `/admin/category/cate-edit-run.php`
- **Parameter Manipulation:** The `id` parameter in the POST request is manipulated by injecting SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have administrative privileges in order to access `/admin/category/category.php` and trigger the vulnerable functionality.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the application.
- **HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker must be able to craft HTTP requests to exploit the vulnerable parameter
- **SQL injection knowledge:** The attacker must have knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional Details:**
- The content provides a detailed step-by-step guide to reproduce the SQL injection vulnerability using `sqlmap`
- The specific vulnerable parameter is `id` in the `/admin/category/cate-edit-run.php` endpoint.
- The provided `sqlmap` command demonstrates how the vulnerability can be exploited to extract database names, which demonstrates the potential for information disclosure.
- The vulnerable application is identified as RapidCMS Dev.1.3.1, and the vendor is specified as `https://github.com/OpenRapid/rapidcms`.
