Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that sensitive clear-key data was not being properly wiped from the stack in the `pkey_unlocked_ioctl` function within the s390/crypto/pkey_api.c driver. Specifically, when converting a clear-key into a protected or secure key, the intermediate clear-key structures (`kcs` and `kcp`) were not zeroed out from the stack on failure or after use, potentially leaving sensitive key material in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  The primary vulnerability is the potential disclosure of sensitive clear-key data from the kernel stack memory.
- **Lack of Memory Sanitization:** The code failed to explicitly wipe/zero out the clear-key structures after they were no longer needed or in error conditions.
- **Insufficient Error Handling:** The initial implementation only broke out of the function on failure without clearing the sensitive data from the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with the ability to read kernel memory could potentially gain access to sensitive clear-key material, which could be used to compromise cryptographic operations or gain unauthorized access to protected resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker would require local access to the system to make calls to the affected ioctl functions.
- **Malicious Process:** A malicious process could execute specifically crafted IOCTL calls that trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have the capability to execute code within the context of the kernel, or have access to the kernel memory.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided diffs show the fix involves adding `memzero_explicit` calls to wipe the `kcs` and `kcp` structures from the stack in cases where an error occurs or after the structure is no longer needed. This resolves the information disclosure by preventing residual key material from remaining in memory.
- The commit messages indicate this change is related to hardening the s390/pkey driver to avoid leaking clear-key material from the stack.
- This fix addresses the vulnerability in the context of IOCTL calls that convert clear keys to protected or secure keys.
- The fix includes a check `!rc` before copying the `kcs` or `kcp` structure to user space.  If there is a failure (rc !=0), the `copy_to_user` is skipped and the structures are zeroed out.
