  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `finder.php` script, specifically the `file[]` parameter, which allows path traversal.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Path Traversal",
        "Arbitrary File Deletion"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious POST request to `/wcms/wex/finder.php?p=` with a `file[]` parameter containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) and the `delete` parameter set to `Delete`.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is explicitly mentioned as a requirement."

   "additional_notes": [
    "The provided github.com content includes a detailed proof of concept, demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability to delete arbitrary files.",
