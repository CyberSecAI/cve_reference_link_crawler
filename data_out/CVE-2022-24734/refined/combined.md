# ACP Settings management RCE

High

[dvz](/dvz)
published
GHSA-876v-gwgh-w57f
Mar 9, 2022

## Package

MyBB
(PHP)

## Affected versions

>= 1.2.0, < 1.8.30

## Patched versions

1.8.30

## Description

### Impact

The Admin CP's Settings management module does not validate setting types correctly on insertion and update, making it possible to add settings of supported type `php` with PHP code, executed on on *Change Settings* pages. This results in a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability.

The vulnerable module requires Admin CP access with the *Can manage settings?* permission.

[CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

### Details

MyBB's *Settings* module, which allows administrators to add, edit, and delete non-default settings, stores setting data in an *options code* string (`$options_code`; `mybb_settings.optionscode` database column) that identifies the setting type and its options, separated by a new line character (`\n`).

In [MyBB 1.2.0](https://mybb.com/versions/1.2.0/), support for setting type `php` was added, for which the remaining part of the *options code* is PHP code executed on *Change Settings* pages (reserved for plugins and internal use).

In [MyBB 1.4.0](https://mybb.com/versions/1.4.0/), a check for settings of type `php` was added to reject insert and modification requests with custom PHP code, but did not account for possible extra characters that are removed using `trim()` when determining the setting type before potential execution.

The checks added in 1.4.0 are present in 1.8.29 at:

* <https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/mybb_1829/admin/modules/config/settings.php#L296-L300>
* <https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/mybb_1829/admin/modules/config/settings.php#L499-L503>

The code responsible for identifying the setting type is present in 1.8.29 at:

* <https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/mybb_1829/admin/modules/config/settings.php#L1467>

The code responsible for the execution of stored PHP code associated with settings of type `php` using an `eval()` statement is present in 1.8.29 at:

* <https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/mybb_1829/admin/modules/config/settings.php#L1540>

### Patches

MyBB 1.8.30 resolves this issue with the following changes:

* Commit: [92012b9](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/commit/92012b9831b330714b9f9b4646a98784113489c1)
  + `.patch`: <https://github.com/mybb/mybb/commit/92012b9831b330714b9f9b4646a98784113489c1.patch>
