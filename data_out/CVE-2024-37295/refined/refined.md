The provided content is related to CVE-2024-37295.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to upload files that appear to be images but contain malicious PHP code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted file upload with insufficient validation allows for the injection of executable PHP code disguised as images. This relates to CWE-73 External Control of File Name or Path.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows for remote code execution (RCE) within the context of the web server. This could lead to a full compromise of the system including data theft, modification, and disruption of service.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is network exploitable with low attack complexity.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative privileges to upload the malicious files. No user interaction is required for the exploitation to occur after the file has been uploaded.
