Aimeos is an Open Source e-commerce framework for online shops. Starting in version 2024.01.1 and prior to version 2024.04.5, a user with administrative privileges can upload files that look like images but contain PHP code which can then be executed in the context of the web server. Version 2024.04.5 fixes the issue.
