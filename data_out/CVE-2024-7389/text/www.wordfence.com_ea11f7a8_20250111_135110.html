### Description

The Forminator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.29.1 via class-forminator-addon-hubspot-wp-api.php. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract the HubSpot integration developer API key and make unauthorized changes to the plugin's HubSpot integration or expose personally identifiable information from plugin users using the HubSpot integration.
