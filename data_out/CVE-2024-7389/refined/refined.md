Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7389:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of a HubSpot developer API key directly within the Forminator plugin's source code. This API key was intended for internal use but was exposed in a way that allowed unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hardcoded Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of the HubSpot API key as a hardcoded constant within the `class-forminator-addon-hubspot-wp-api.php` file. This practice exposes the key to anyone with access to the plugin's codebase, whether through direct file access or other means.
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** By having the API key accessible, attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive information related to the HubSpot integration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can use the exposed HubSpot API key to make unauthorized changes to the plugin's HubSpot integration settings.
- **Data Breach:** The exposed API key allows an attacker to access and potentially expose personally identifiable information from users that utilize the HubSpot integration within the Forminator plugin.
- **Plugin Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially manipulate the HubSpot integration, leading to unexpected behavior or disruption of the plugin's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Code Access:** Attackers with direct access to the plugin's files, such as through compromised servers or leaked repositories, could easily obtain the API key.
- **Plugin Inspection:** Attackers could examine the plugin's code through methods like downloading the plugin archive and inspecting its files or via publicly available code repositories.
- **Web-based access:** Due to the nature of publicly available plugins, it is possible to access the code from the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic Knowledge:** Attackers need basic understanding of web development, WordPress plugin structure or have knowledge on how to read source code.
- **Access to the plugin code:** The attacker would require access to the plugin's source code, which can be obtained through various means.
- **No Authentication Needed:** Exploitation does not require any authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Forminator plugin up to and including version 1.29.1.
- The vulnerable code is located in the `forminator/trunk/addons/pro/hubspot/lib/class-forminator-addon-hubspot-wp-api.php` file.
- The issue was resolved in version 1.29.2 by removing the hardcoded API key.
- The provided patch removed the `CLIENT_SECRET` and `HAPIKEY` constants.
