| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2024788#c0)  Sage McTaggart    2021-11-19 02:29:50 UTC  ``` The key length for encrypted devices created using ceph-volume is incorrect. This is due to a bug in ceph_volume/util/encryption.py, where upon writing a key using osd_dmcrypt_key_size it does not pass the key size to the format and open operations following. The default key is them applied in cryptsetup. All versions since Luminous are assumed affected.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2024788#c4)  Sage McTaggart    2021-11-30 20:53:14 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 2018529](show_bug.cgi?id=2018529) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2024788#c5)  Sage McTaggart    2021-12-02 20:31:13 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 2027837](show_bug.cgi?id=2027837 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - ceph: Ceph volume does not honour osd_dmcrypt_key_size") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2024788#c6)  Sage McTaggart    2022-01-11 21:12:51 UTC  ``` Created ceph tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2039522](show_bug.cgi?id=2039522 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2021-3979 ceph: Ceph volume does not honour osd_dmcrypt_key_size [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2024788#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-04-04 10:19:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ceph Storage 5.1  Via RHSA-2022:1174 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:1174](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A1174)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2024788#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-05-05 07:53:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ceph Storage 4.3  Via RHSA-2022:1716 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:1716](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A1716)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2024788#c9)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-05-05 13:16:07 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
