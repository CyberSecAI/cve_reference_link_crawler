Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24890:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks in the `saveScript` AJAX action of the "Scripts Organizer" WordPress plugin. Additionally, the plugin fails to validate user input before saving it to a file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The `saveScript` AJAX action is accessible to both unauthenticated and authenticated users, bypassing any access control mechanisms.
*   **Missing CSRF Protection:**  The absence of CSRF checks allows an attacker to craft malicious requests that a victim's browser may unknowingly execute.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The plugin does not sanitize or validate user-supplied input before saving it to a file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker can upload arbitrary PHP code into a file on the server.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading and executing malicious PHP files, an attacker could potentially gain full control of the WordPress site's server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Request:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action=saveScript` parameter.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** A malicious user could trick an authenticated user into executing the malicious request, exploiting the missing CSRF protection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target WordPress website.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be logged in to the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerable code is in the `saveScript` AJAX action of the Scripts Organizer plugin.
*   The uploaded file is saved in the `/wp-content/uploads/scripts-organizer/` directory with the post ID as the filename.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 3.0 of the plugin and has been fixed in version 3.0.
*   The exploit does not require any special user permissions or credentials

**Summary**

The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload arbitrary PHP code to a WordPress site via a vulnerable plugin, leading to potential remote code execution. This is due to missing access controls, lack of CSRF protection, and a failure to validate user input, and it was resolved in version 3.0 of the plugin.
