Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** CVE-2021-44467 -  `spx_restservice KillDupUsr_func` Broken Access Control

*   **Root Cause:** The `KillDupUsr_func` function within the `spx_restservice` does not perform proper session verification when handling a POST request to `/api/KillDupUsr`. This allows unauthenticated users to call the function.
*   **Weakness:** Broken Access Control. Lack of authentication or authorization checks allows unauthorized access to a function intended for authenticated users.
*   **Impact:** An unauthenticated attacker can arbitrarily terminate active sessions of other users, causing a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `/api/KillDupUsr` without proper authentication.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device. No prior authentication is required.
