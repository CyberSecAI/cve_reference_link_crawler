- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV series routers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device and then persuading a user to visit specific web pages that include malicious payloads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated, can be remote, and needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious web page after sending the crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.
