Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-7573

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied input through POST data within the 'search' function of the Relevanssi Live Ajax Search plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Argument Injection:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize or validate input, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary arguments into a `WP_Query` query. This is a type of Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** By injecting malicious arguments into the `WP_Query`, attackers could potentially bypass access controls and retrieve sensitive information. This includes:
    - Private posts
    - Attachments

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated Input:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.
- **POST Data:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious arguments via POST data to the 'search' function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers do not need to be authenticated.
- They need to be able to send HTTP POST requests with crafted data to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Relevanssi Live Ajax Search plugin up to and including 2.4.
- The fix is included in version 2.5 of the plugin, which includes a code change to prevent access to private post titles when using the default WP search. This change is implemented by adding a filter `relevanssi_live_search_query_args` which is used to clean up the search arguments. This filter is applied only when Relevanssi is not active.
- When Relevanssi is not active the following search arguments are unset: 'has_password', 'post_password', 'cache_results', 'update_post_meta_cache' and 'update_post_term_cache'.
- In addition, the 'post_status' is forced to 'publish' and the 'posts_per_page' is set based on plugin's setting.

**Summary of changes in version 2.5:**
-  A new filter `relevanssi_live_search_query_args` has been added to the `class-relevanssi-live-search-client.php` file to control the search parameters when Relevanssi is not active.
-  In the `class-relevanssi-live-search-form.php` file the `add_action` call for `wp_enqueue_scripts` has been moved to priority 12.
-  The plugin's version has been updated from 2.4 to 2.5 in `class-relevanssi-live-search.php`, `readme.txt`, and `relevanssi-live-ajax-search.php` files.
-  The changelog and upgrade notice have been updated in `readme.txt` to reflect the security update.
