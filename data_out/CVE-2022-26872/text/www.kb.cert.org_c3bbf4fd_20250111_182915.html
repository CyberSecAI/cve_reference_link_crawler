## Tychon is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to OPENSSLDIR location

#### Vulnerability Note VU#730007

Original Release Date: 2022-04-28 | Last Revised: 2022-04-28

---

### Overview

Tychon contains a privilege escalation vulnerability due to the use of an `OPENSSLDIR` variable that specifies a location where an unprivileged Windows user may be able to place files.

### Description

Tychon includes an OpenSSL component that specifies an `OPENSSLDIR` variable as a subdirectory that my be controllable by an unprivileged user on Windows. Tychon contains a privileged service that uses this OpenSSL component. A user who can place a specially-crafted `openssl.cnf` file at an appropriate path may be able to achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.

### Impact

By placing a specially-crafted `openssl.cnf` in a location used by Tychon, an unprivileged user may be able to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on a Windows system with the vulnerable Tychon software installed.

### Solution

#### Apply an update

This issue is addressed in Tychon 1.7.857.82
