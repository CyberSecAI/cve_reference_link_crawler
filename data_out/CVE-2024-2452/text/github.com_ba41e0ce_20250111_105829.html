# Integer wraparound, under-allocation, and heap buffer overflow in Eclipse ThreadX NetX Duo \_\_portable\_aligned\_alloc()

High

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 6.4.0

## Patched versions

6.4.0

## Description

### Summary

In Eclipse ThreadX NetX Duo before 6.4.0, if an attacker can control parameters of \_\_portable\_aligned\_alloc() could cause an integer wrap-around and an allocation smaller than expected. This could cause subsequent heap buffer overflows.

### Details

If an attacker could control the `size` or `alignment` arguments to the `__portable_aligned_alloc()` function, they could cause an integer wraparound thus causing `malloc()` to allocate a small amount of memory, exposing to subsequent heap buffer overflows (AKA BadAlloc-style memory corruption).

The vulnerable code has been removed.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
