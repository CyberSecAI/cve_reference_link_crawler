Based on the provided information, here's an analysis:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `HookWhiteList AddHookWhiteList` interface in ESAFENET CDG V5 is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `policyId` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user-supplied input (specifically the `policyId`) when constructing SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The attacker could potentially:
    *   Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   Modify or delete data within the database.
    *   Potentially compromise the application or the server hosting the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited via the `AddHookWhiteList` interface by manipulating the `policyId` parameter in an HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable `AddHookWhiteList` interface, which is likely a web-based API endpoint.
*   The attacker needs to understand SQL and be able to craft valid SQL injection payloads.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is located in `HookWhiteListService.java`.
* The issue is referenced by VulDB entry [282440](?id.282440).
* The provided link to flowus.cn seems to confirm the vulnerability but cannot be viewed directly in the current browser environment.
