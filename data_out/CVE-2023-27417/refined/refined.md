- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Affiliate Super Assistent WordPress plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or access within the WordPress site. Specific impact varies depending on the actions the vulnerable plugin allows.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site that submits a crafted request to the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in user to perform a crafted request on the vulnerable site. The attacker does not need any prior authentication.
