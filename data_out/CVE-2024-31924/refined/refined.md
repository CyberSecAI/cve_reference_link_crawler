- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The EWWW Image Optimizer plugin for WordPress versions 7.2.3 and below is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to perform unintended actions, leveraging their existing authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could craft a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, would execute unwanted actions within the context of that user's session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into triggering the crafted malicious request. The attacker does not require any prior authentication on the WordPress site.
