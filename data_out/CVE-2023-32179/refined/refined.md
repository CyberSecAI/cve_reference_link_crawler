**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `FPQuarTransfer` method of VIPRE Antivirus Plus.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core vulnerability is a symbolic link following issue that allows an attacker to manipulate the `FPQuarTransfer` method to delete arbitrary files on the system. This stems from improper handling of symbolic links.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation enables a local attacker to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM, the highest privilege level on a Windows system. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with full system access.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required. The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target machine.
- The vulnerability is exploited through the creation of a symbolic link. The attacker leverages the flawed logic of the `FPQuarTransfer` method when handling symlinks to delete arbitrary files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- The attacker needs to be able to create symbolic links.

**Additional details:**
- VIPRE has released a patch to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2022-11-24, with the coordinated public release on 2023-05-31.
