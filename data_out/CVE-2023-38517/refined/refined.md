- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress WRC Pricing Tables plugin (versions <= 2.3.9) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack can lead to the injection of malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, HTML payloads) into the website, which are then executed when users visit the site. This could result in various impacts, such as unauthorized redirects, displaying malicious content, and potentially compromising user accounts.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor can inject scripts into the website through a vulnerability in the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the plugin's input fields. An administrator level privilege is required.
