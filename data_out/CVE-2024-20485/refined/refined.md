- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of a specific file when read from system flash memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Code injection vulnerability due to insufficient validation during backup file restoration. Specifically, the system fails to properly validate a file from flash memory, which allows for the injection of malicious code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with *root*-level privileges after the next device reload, potentially leading to a complete takeover of the system and altered system behavior. The injected code persists across reboots.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by restoring a crafted backup file to an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated, local attacker with *administrator*-level privileges on the target device is required to exploit this vulnerability.
