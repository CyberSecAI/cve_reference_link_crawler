### [CVE-2022-40304] Fix dict corruption caused by entity reference cycles

```

When an entity reference cycle is detected, the entity content is
cleared by setting its first byte to zero. But the entity content might
be allocated from a dict. In this case, the dict entry becomes corrupted
leading to all kinds of logic errors, including memory errors like
double-frees.

Stop storing entity content, orig, ExternalID and SystemID in a dict.
These values are unlikely to occur multiple times in a document, so they
shouldn't have been stored in a dict in the first place.

Thanks to Ned Williamson and Nathan Wachholz working with Google Project
Zero for the report!

iOS device, and will not appear in your computer's Software Update
application, or in the Apple Downloads site. Make sure you have an
Internet connection and have installed the latest version of iTunes
from <https://www.apple.com/itunes/>  iTunes and Software Update on the

to be installed is presented to the user when the iOS device is
docked. We recommend applying the update immediately if possible.
Selecting Don't Install will present the option the next time you
connect your iOS device.  The automatic update process may take up to
a week depending on the day that iTunes or the device checks for
updates. You may manually obtain the update via the Check for Updates
button within iTunes, or the Software Update on your device.  To
check that the iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad has been updated:  *
Navigate to Settings * Select General * Select About. The version
after applying this update will be "iOS 15.7.2 and iPadOS 15.7.2".
