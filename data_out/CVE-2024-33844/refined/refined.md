- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `mavlink_itf_reset_mission_data` function does not sanitize the `MAV_MISSION_TYPE` when processing a `MAVLink MISSION_COUNT` payload. Specifically, when a `MAV_MISSION_TYPE` value of 17 is sent, the function attempts to free memory at a 0-filled memory address which is invalid, causing a crash.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation/lack of sanitization in the `mavlink_itf_reset_mission_data` function, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability or null pointer dereference.

- **Impact of exploitation**: The 'control' process on the drone crashes, leading to a denial of service.

- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted `MAVLink MISSION_COUNT` payload with `MAV_MISSION_TYPE` set to 17 to the drone.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be connected to the drone's WiFi network (WPA2 protected) and able to send MAVLink commands. The vulnerability is only present when using the MAVLink interface.
