The provided content relates to CVE-2024-36932.

**Root cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a race condition in the thermal debugfs driver. Specifically, `thermal_debug_cdev_remove()` can run concurrently with `thermal_debug_cdev_state_update()`. `thermal_debug_cdev_remove()` may free the `struct thermal_debugfs` object used by `thermal_debug_cdev_state_update()` after the latter has checked that it is not NULL, resulting in a use-after-free.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Use-after-free

**Impact:**
- Kernel crash due to accessing freed memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by concurrent calls to `thermal_debug_cdev_remove()` and `thermal_debug_cdev_state_update()`.

**Required attacker capabilities:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger concurrent calls to `thermal_debug_cdev_remove()` and `thermal_debug_cdev_state_update()`. This likely involves interaction with thermal cooling devices and the debugfs interface, which may require specific privileges depending on the kernel configuration.

**Additional Notes:**
The fix involves using `cdev->lock` in `thermal_debug_cdev_remove()` around the check for `cdev->debugfs` and setting `cdev->debugfs` to `NULL`. This prevents the race condition by ensuring that the `struct thermal_debugfs` object is not freed while it might be accessed by `thermal_debug_cdev_state_update()`.
