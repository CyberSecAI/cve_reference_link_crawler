  "cveId": "CVE-2022-48926",
  "date": "2022-12-28",
  "description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The RNDIS response list in the Linux kernel's USB gadget function lacks a lock, leading to potential list corruption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition on the RNDIS response list due to concurrent access by multiple threads",
      "Missing spinlock protection for critical sections of code that manipulate the RNDIS response list"
    ],
    "impact": "List corruption can cause kernel crashes and unexpected behavior due to invalid pointer manipulation within the response list",
     "attackVectors": [
      "Multiple threads concurrently calling functions that add/remove/traverse the RNDIS response list"
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker must be able to trigger multiple concurrent calls to the affected functions. Specifically, it involves using a USB gadget RNDIS interface in a way that leads to multiple threads concurrently trying to add, remove, or access responses in the RNDIS response list, thereby triggering a race condition."
