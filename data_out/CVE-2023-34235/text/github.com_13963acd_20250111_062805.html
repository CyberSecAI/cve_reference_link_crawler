# Leaking sensitive user information still possible by filtering on private with prefix fields

Jul 25, 2023

## Package

npm

@strapi/database
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 4.10.7

## Patched versions

>= 4.10.8

npm

@strapi/utils
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

<= 4.10.7

>= 4.10.8

## Description

### Summary

Still able to leak private fields if using the t(number) prefix

### Details

Knex query allows you to change there default prefix

`SqliteError: select distinct `t0`.* from `pages` as `t0` left join `admin_users` as `t1` on `t0`.`updated_by_id` = `t1`.`id` where (`t1`.`password` = 1)`

so if you change the prefix to the same as it was before or to an other table you want to query you query changes from password to t1.password password is protected by filtering protections but t1.password is not protected

### PoC

1 Create a contentType

2 add to its options "populateCreatorFields"

3 create 1 entity in your new content type

4 in settings enable the find route in settings for the content type you created for public

5 /api/(Your contenttype)?filters%5BupdatedBy%5D%5Bt1.password%5D%5B%24startsWith%5D=a%24

And now the api returns noting if you were to do

/api/(Your contenttype)?filters%5BupdatedBy%5D%5Bt1.password%5D%5B%24startsWith%5D=%24 it would return your entity

### Impact

You can do filtering attacks on everything related to the object again including admin passwords and reset-tokens.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
