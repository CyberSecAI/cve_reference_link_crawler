Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Knex queries are handled within the Strapi framework. Specifically, the default prefix used in Knex queries could be manipulated by an attacker to bypass intended filtering protections. By changing the prefix to target other tables, an attacker could query protected fields, such as passwords or reset tokens.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input related to query parameters, specifically within filters. This allows attackers to inject malicious prefixes into database queries.
*   **Bypassed Access Controls:** The filtering protections in place were circumvented by manipulating the query prefix. This allows access to sensitive data that should be protected by default.
*   **Direct SQL Manipulation:** The vulnerability enables direct manipulation of the generated SQL queries by controlling table prefixes, enabling direct access to data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive user information, including admin passwords and reset tokens, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** By manipulating the SQL query parameters, attackers can extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Account Takeover:** Compromised admin credentials can lead to full control of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious HTTP requests with specifically designed filter parameters. The vulnerability is reachable through the public API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Strapi application.
*   **No authentication required:** The vulnerability is exposed through the public API.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable system:** The attacker must know how the Strapi query system works to craft the malicious query, although the provided PoC greatly reduces that bar.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Strapi versions <= 4.10.7.
*   The vulnerability is patched in Strapi versions >= 4.10.8.
*   The fix involves improved sanitization in `sanitizeQuery` and `convertQueryParams`.
*   The provided PoC demonstrates the ability to bypass filtering on protected fields by prefixing the table field in the filter by another table alias.
*   CVSS score is 8.6, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N. This reflects a high severity vulnerability with low attack complexity and no privileges or user interaction required.
