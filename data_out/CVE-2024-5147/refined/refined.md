Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5147

**Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion (LFI)

**Affected Software:** WPZOOM Addons for Elementor (Templates, Widgets) plugin for WordPress, versions up to and including 1.1.37.

**Root Cause:** The plugin is vulnerable to LFI via the `grid_style` parameter. The code in `wpzoom-elementor-ajax-posts-grid.php` uses the `grid_style` parameter from user input to construct a path to include a PHP file. However, it does not properly sanitize the `grid_style` parameter before using it in the file path.

Specifically, the vulnerable code is at line 107:
```php
$grid_style = isset( $data['grid_style'] ) && is_int( $data['grid_style'] ) ? sanitize_file_name ( $data[ 'grid_style' ] ) : '1';
```
While `sanitize_file_name` is used, it only sanitizes the filename but doesn't prevent path traversal.  Prior to this fix, the code was simply casting the value to an integer and using it directly.

**Weakness:**
- Improper Input Validation: The plugin doesn't sufficiently validate and sanitize the `grid_style` parameter, allowing for path traversal.
- Path Traversal: The lack of proper sanitization allows attackers to manipulate the `grid_style` parameter to include arbitrary files on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: By including a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Bypassing Access Controls: Attackers can bypass access restrictions.
- Sensitive Data Disclosure: It can be used to obtain sensitive data.

**Attack Vector:**
- HTTP POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the action `wpz_posts_grid_load_more`.
- The request includes the `grid_style` parameter within the `posts_data` parameter as JSON encoded string

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated user: The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated user since the `wp_ajax_nopriv_wpz_posts_grid_load_more` action is vulnerable.
- No special position or privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The `ajax_post_grid_load_more` function in `wpzoom-elementor-ajax-posts-grid.php` is responsible for handling the AJAX request.
- The function retrieves the `grid_style` parameter from the POST data.
- The `grid_style` parameter is used to construct the path to a PHP layout file (`includes/widgets/posts-grid/layouts/layout-$grid_style.php`).
- An attacker can manipulate this `grid_style` parameter to include files from outside the intended directory using directory traversal sequences such as `../` within the `grid_style` value.
- The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to include any PHP file within the server's filesystem.

**Patch Information:**
- The vulnerability is patched in version 1.1.38 of the plugin.
- The patch includes adding a check to make sure the grid\_style value is an integer, and then sanitizing it with `sanitize_file_name`.

This information provides a comprehensive understanding of the LFI vulnerability in the WPZOOM Addons for Elementor plugin.
