##### CWE

CWE-347 - Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature

##### DETAILS

The rtl819x Jungle SDK is an SDK for routers. This SDK uses as web server boa.

This Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK vulnerability was found while researching the Levelone WBR-6013 router. We are going to explain this vulnerability from the perspective of the WBR-6013 router.

The WBR-6013 router has a web server called `boa`. This web server offers, through the `/boafrm/formUpload`, API functionality to upgrade the firmware with a newer one. The WBR-6013, throughout the whole firmware upgrade process, never checks the validity of the uploaded firmware. This allows an attacker to upgrade the router with an arbitrary firmware.

##### VENDOR RESPONSE

Realtek has provided updates software to their customers.
LevelOne has declined to patch the issues in their software.
