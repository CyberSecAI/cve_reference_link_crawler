Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch is cryptographically signed with the
[signify(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-7.3/signify.1) tool and contains
usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/7.3.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Alternatively, the [syspatch(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/syspatch)
utility can be used to apply binary updates on the following architectures:
amd64, i386, arm64.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).
