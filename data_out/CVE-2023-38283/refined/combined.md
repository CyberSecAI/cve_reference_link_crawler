# Grave flaws in BGP Error handling

![A broken fuse](https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/ipvnQ92fc1)

Border Gateway Protocol is the de facto protocol that directs routing decisions between different ISP networks, and is generally known as the “glue” that holds the internet together. It’s safe to say that the internet we currently know would not function without working BGP implementations.

However, the software on those networks’ routers (I will refer to these as edge devices from now on) that implements BGP has not had a flawless track record. Flaws and problems do exist in commercial and open source implementations of the world’s most critical routing protocol.

Most of these flaws are of course benign in the grand scheme of things; they will be issues around things like route filtering, or insertion, or [handling withdraws](https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/bgp-stuck-routes-tcp-zero-window). However a much more scary issue is a BGP bug that can propagate after causing bad behaviour, akin to a [computer worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm).

While debugging support for a future feature for my business (bgp.tools) I took a brief diversion to investigate something, and what I came out with might be one of the most concerning things I’ve discovered for the reliability of the internet. To understand the problems, though, we will need a bit more context.

# A mistaken attribute

On 2 June 2023, a [small Brazilian network](https://bgp.tools/as/264366) (re)announced one of their internet routes with a small bit of information called an attribute that was corrupted. The information on this route was for a feature that had not finished standardisation, but was set up in such a way that if an intermediate router did not understand it, then the intermediate router would pass it on unchanged.

As many routers did not understand this attribute, this was no problem for them. They just took the information and propagated it along. However it turned out that Juniper routers running even slightly modern software did understand this attribute, and since the attribute was corrupted the software in its default configuration would respond by raising an error that would shut down the whole BGP session. Since a BGP session is often a critical part of being “connected” to the wider internet, this resulted in the small Brazilian network disrupting other networks’ ability to communicate with the rest of the internet, despite being 1000’s of miles away.

A reader has pointed out that the attribute in question was not actually corrupted, but the support was just unfinished it appears

The packet that causes session shutdowns was really quite benign at first glance:

![A screenshot of wireshark](https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/7CcFultij0)

When a BGP session shuts down due to errors, customer network traffic generally stops flowing down that cable until the BGP connection is automatically restarted (typically within seconds to minutes).

This appears to be what happened to a number of different carriers, for example [COLT](https://bgp.tools/as/8220) was heavily impacted by this. Their outage is what originally drew some of my attention to this subject area.

To understand why this sort of thing can happen, we’ll need to take a deeper look at what BGP route attributes are, and what they’re used for.

# What is a BGP Route Attribute?

At their core a BGP UPDATEs purpose is to tell another router about some traffic that it can (or can no longer) send to it. However just knowing directly what you can send to another router is not very useful without *context*.

For this reason a BGP packet is split up into two sections: the Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) data (aka, the IP address ranges), and the attributes that help describe extra context about that reachability data.

Arguably the most used attribute is the AS\_PATH (or actually, the AS4\_PATH), an attribute that tells you which networks a route has travelled through to get to you. Routers use this list of networks to pick paths for their traffic that are either the fastest, economically viable, or least congested, playing a critical role in ensuring that things run smoothly.

At the time of writing there are over 32 different route attribute types, 14 deprecated ones, and 209 officially unassigned ones. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is in charge of [assigning codes to each BGP attribute type codes](https://www.iana.org/assignments/bgp-parameters/bgp-parameters.xhtml#bgp-parameters-2), normally off the back of IETF Internet-Drafts. The IANA list doesn’t always give the full story, though, as not all internet-drafts make their way into more official documents (like RFC’s), so code numbers are assigned (or sometimes even “squatted”) to attribute types that did not get wide deployment.

# Unknown attribute propagation

At the start of every route attribute is a set of flags, conveying information about the attribute. One important flag is called the “transitive bit”:

![A wireshark decoding of the BGP Path Attribuites Flags](https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/BSaiOklQh0)

If a BGP implementation does not understand an attribute, and the transitive bit is set, it will copy it to another router. If the router does understand the attribute then it may apply its own policy.

At a glance this “feature” seems like an incredibly bad idea, as it allows possibly unknown information to propagate blindly through systems that do not understand the impact of what they are forwarding. However this feature has also allowed widespread deployment of things like [Large Communities](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8195) to happen faster, and has arguably made deployment of new BGP features possible at all.

# When attribute decoding goes wrong

What happens when an attribute fails to decode? The answer depends strongly on if the BGP implementation has been updated to use [RFC 7606](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7606) logic or not; If the session is *not* [RFC 7606](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7606) compliant, then typically an error is raised and the session is shut down. If it is, the session can usually continue as normal (except the routes impacted by the decoding error are treated as unreachable).

BGP session shutdowns are particularly undesirable, as they will impact traffic flow along a path. However in the case of a “Transitive” error they can become worm-like. Since not all BGP implementations support the same attributes, an attribute that is unknown to one implementation (and subsequently forwarded along) can cause another implementation to shut down the session it received it from.

With some reasonably educated crafting of a payload, someone could design a BGP UPDATE that “travels” along the internet unharmed, until it reaches a targeted vendor and results in that vendor resetting sessions. If that data comes down the BGP connections that are providing wider internet access for the network, this could result in a network being pulled offline from the internet.

![](https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/vQvI0ZQC9V)

This attack is not even a one-off “hit-and-run”, as the “bad” route is still stored in the peer router; when the session restarts the victim router will reset again the moment the route with the crafted payload is transmitted again. This has the potential to cause prolonged internet or peering outages.

This is a large part of why the RFC mentioned earlier, RFC 7606, exists; looking at its security considerations section, we can see a description of this exact problem::

> Security Considerations
> This specification addresses the vulnerability of a BGP speaker to a
> potential attack whereby a distant attacker can generate a malformed
> optional transitive attribute that is not recognized by intervening
> routers. Since the intervening routers do not recognize the
> attribute, they propagate it without checking it. When the malformed
> attribute arrives at a router that does recognize the given attribute
> type, that router resets the session over which it arrived. Since
> significant fan-out can occur between the attacker and the routers
> that do recognize the attribute type, this attack could potentially
> be particularly harmful.

In a basic BGP setup this is bad, but with extra engineering it could be used to partition large sections of the internet. If BGP sessions between carriers are forced to reset in this way, causing traffic flow to stop, some routes on the internet would not have alternatives to use, making this a family of bugs that is a grave threat to the overall reliability of the internet.

# Building a basic fuzzer

**Important Commitment:** I run a business that involves being peered to many IXP route servers and other peoples routers. I have not and will not ever test for BGP bugs/exploits on customer/partner sessions (unless they give consent).

All testing here has been done either on [GNS3](https://www.gns3.com/) VMs, or physical hardware I have hanging around and in isolated VLANs.

To figure out if this would be a practically exploitable attack, I decided to write a [fuzzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing) that would try to stuff random data in random attribute codes to see if I could get sessions to reset on different vendors BGP implementations.

Because I am looking for problems that are “wormable”, I added a [Bird 2](https://bird.network.cz/) router in between my fuzzer and the router being tested. This way Bird will filter out all of the obvious non-exploitable issues, and leave me with the packets that are of concern.

![](https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/ppvsN8rslG)

All good fuzzers should be able to run unattended, so how do we teach the fuzzer to tell if the session has reset itself? The solution I came to was that the Victim router would always announce a keepalive prefix, 192.0.2.0/24 (aka [`TEST-NET-1`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5735)) and the fuzzer would treat a withdraw of that prefix (from the intermediate bird router) as a sign the session went down, and report back the parameters that caused that to happen!

Testing the fuzzer, I can see that the bird output shows unknown attributes as their type code, and a hex encoding of their contents. In addition it puts a `[t]` to indicate that it is transitive.

```
198.51.100.0/24      unicast [fuzzer 21:31:24.378] * (100) [AS65001?]
	via 192.168.5.1 on ens5
	Type: BGP univ
	BGP.origin: Incomplete
	BGP.as_path: 65001
	BGP.next_hop: 192.168.5.1
	BGP.local_pref: 100
	BGP.community: (123,2345)
	BGP.ec [t]: 7d cc c7 30

```

Now that the fuzzer was able to run itself, all that was left was to test all of the vendors one by one…

# Fuzzer findings / Impacted Vendors

Keep in mind that the described issues are applicable if you are running an edge device with full BGP tables. If you are not running a “full routing table” or a partial peering table, then you are less likely to be impacted by these discoveries.

Another thing to keep in mind, the issues below are different to the ones that [the team at Forescout recently presented at BlackHat](https://www.blackhat.com/us-23/briefings/schedule/index.html#route-to-bugs-analyzing-the-security-of-bgp-message-parsing-32162).

Unimpacted Vendors:

* MikroTik RouterOS 7+
* Ubiquiti EdgeOS
* Arista EOS
* Huawei NE40
* Cisco IOS-XE / “Classic” / XR
* Bird 1.6, All versions of Bird 2.0
* GoBGP

## Juniper JunOS Impact

Juniper has released: [JSA72510](https://kb.juniper.net/JSA72510)

Similar to the problem that caused this research to be done, another exploitable Attribute was found in the form of Attribute 29 (BGP-LS). Due to the nature of the attribute it is unlikely that an exploit attempt will propagate too far over the internet, however peering sessions and route servers are still at risk.

All Juniper users are **urged** to enable `bgp-error-tolerance`:

```
[edit protocols bgp]
root# show
group TRANSIT {
    import import-pol;
    export send-direct;
    peer-as 4200000001;
    local-as 4200000002;
    neighbor 192.0.2.2;
}
bgp-error-tolerance;

```

In all tested cases, enabling bgp-error-tolerance does not reset sessions, and applies the improved behaviour without restarting sessions.

A JunOS software release is expected in the future to correct this. One member of staff at Juniper has also [authored an Internet-Draft at the IETF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-haas-idr-bgp-attribute-escape-00) around handling these issues. Juniper is tracking this issue as CVE-2023-4481 / JSA72510.

## Nokia SR-OS Impact

Fuzzing SR-OS (Version 22.10) revealed many, likely highly propagatable and thus exploitable attributes.

All Nokia SR-OS and SR-Linux users are **urged** to enable `error-handling update-fault-tolerance` on their devices.

```
 bgp
     group "TRANSIT"
         export "yes"
         error-handling
             update-fault-tolerance
         exit
         neighbor 192.0.2.2
             peer-as 2
         exit
     exit
     no shutdown
 exit

```

In all tested cases, enabling update-fault-tolerance does not reset sessions, and applies the improved behaviour without restarting sessions.

To the best of my understanding, Nokia has no plans to correct these issues, instead suggesting customers apply `error-handling update-fault-tolerance` to their BGP groups.

## FRR Impact (and other downstream vendors)

FRR Has patched post publication: [[Link to PR]](https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/pull/14290)

[FRR](https://github.com/FRRouting/frr) attempts to handle bad attributes using RFC 7606 behaviour. However the fuzzer discovered that a corrupted attribute 23 (Tunnel Encapsulation) will cause a session to go down regardless.

After reporting this bug to FRR maintainers I received an acknowledgement of the issue and understanding that the issue is a DoS risk to FRR users, but I have not managed to get anything out of FRR since.

This bug is being tracked as CVE-2023-38802 and at the time of writing has no patch or fix.

FRR is packaged inside many other products, to name a few: [SONIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SONiC_%28operating_system%29), [PICA8](https://www.pica8.com/), [Cumulus](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/networking/ethernet-switching/cumulus-linux/), and [DANOS](https://www.danosproject.org/).

## OpenBSD OpenBGPd Impact

OpenBGPd also supports the improved RFC 7606 behaviour, however it was found that the recently added [Only To Customer](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9234.html) implementation could cause session resets. This issue was very rapidly fixed after being reported to them, and is tracked as CVE-2023-38283.

OpenBSD users can install [Errata 006](https://www.openbsd.org/errata73.html) to mitigate this issue.

## Extreme Networks EXOS Impact

As a result of fuzzing EXOS, the program revealed 2 highly propagatable and thus exploitable attributes in the form of:

* Attribute 21: AS\_PATHLIMIT
* Attribute 25: IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community

There is currently no known patch or mitigating config for this issue.

I made Extreme aware of this problem, however after a back and forth with them waiting for what I understood was an implied release of a patch or fix, they communicated that they will not be fixing it in the near future.

A quote from the security email thread (I’ve added emphasis to the critical parts of their response):

> After review of all the material, **we are not considering this a vulnerability due to the presence of RFC 7606**, as well as a history of documentation expressing these concerns all the way back to early 2000s, if not earlier. Malformed attributes are not a novel concept as an attack vector to BGP networks, as evidenced by RFC 7606, which is almost a decade old.
> As such, customers that have chosen to not require or implement RFC 7606 have done so willingly and with knowledge of what is needed to defend against these types of attacks. Thus, the expectation that we’ll reset our BGP sessions based on RFC 4271 attribute handling is proper. We do abide by other RFCs, in which we claim support, that update RFC 4271.
> Other vendors do claim RFC 7606 support and have been sharing these controls as a mitigation to malformed attribute response. They don’t appear to be producing new work product to account for these behaviors.
> **We are evaluating support for RFC 7606 as a future feature.** Obviously, if customers desire a different response, we’ll work through our normal feature request pipelines to address. This is no different than any other RFC support request.

I cannot overstate how much I disagree with Extreme’s response to this, and in the interests of full transparency (and to avoid any allegations of editorialising this, in my view, extremely poor response), I have made the full email exchange available here: [(PDF)](https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/JgH8G5duO1).

# The Vendor Security Response

I’ve been through my fair share of security issue discoveries, and over time I’ve taken a stronger leaning into “simply do not report” or “full disclosure without warning”, rather than the now commonly accepted 90 day “responsible disclosure” methodology. This is mostly because I’ve had really poor experiences when disclosing issues to security teams.

The bugs discussed in this post cover many vendors and implementations. Full disclosure was originally my plan, however due to the clear risk of harm to the general internet routing system from these findings, I felt it was likely inexcusable to do full-disclosure. (Plus, a malicious deployment of these findings could have a small but I believe very real chance of a [“kinetic response”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_military_action) from a misunderstanding.)

Overall the response from vendors has been mostly disappointing. One vendor was extremely hard to find contacts for, and I feel that they were stringing me along for some time, only to reply back that they were not going to fix the problem.

Other vendors notably were not immediately interested in notifying customers of mitigating config to the problems, however when I personally started extending notices to my peers at larger carriers about the problems (since if they were not going to, I was going to try and reduce the exploit surface) a vendor notice was issued.

No vendor that I reported to has any form of bug bounty, and this entire adventure has consumed huge volumes of my time and mental capacity. In a normal situation this “cost” would have simply been eaten by an employer whose interest is name recognition or altruistic actions. However I am self-employed with my own company (that admittedly does have an interest in a functioning BGP ecosystem), and so this entire adventure has simply delayed product development that I (and customers) really would have liked to have done.

With all of that in mind, my “good faith” advice to people reporting security bugs in network vendor software is that contacting vendors is not an effective solution.

The people on the other side are either already overloaded, or generally don’t care about receiving issues. Since there is no motivation to report bugs (either in the form of bug bounties, or being treated well), I see no reason to do responsible disclosure (apart from cases where it would clearly protect their innocent customers from misery, while accounting for the risk of a vendor simply doing nothing).

The two options, as far as I see it, are either being strung along by a vendor over email for 90 days and then likely finding out nothing is done, or full disclosure.

I worry about the state of networking vendors.

With that being said, I would like to thank the OpenBSD security team, who very rapidly acknowledged my report, and prepared a patch. My only regret with dealing with the OpenBSD team was reporting the issue to them too quickly.

# Closing thoughts

As mentioned before, with a few of the vendors (Nokia, Extreme, Juniper) I found myself contacting their own customers myself to warn them to enable mitigating config, as that proved to be a much more effective way at preventing risk than trying to push the vendor itself into action.

As a result at least several incumbent ISPs, 1 large CDN, and 2 “Tier 1” networks have applied configuration to help prevent these issues from impacting them.

If the goal of reporting security flaws is to reduce harm to their customers, I’m not convinced that reporting problems to vendors has enough of an effective impact to be worth doing, vs the loss of personal time and sanity.

Several people I spoke to have been incredibly helpful (some who could not be listed here). I would like to thank the following people for having some role in helping me either discover/disclose these problems, editing this post, or general support for when vendors were being very frustrating.

      mishandling of ASPA objects. Fix bgpctl(8) 'show rib in' by renaming
      'invalid' into 'disqualified'.

    * Include OpenBSD 7.3 errata 006:
      Incorrect length handling of path attributes in bgpd(8) can lead to a
      session reset.

    * Include OpenBSD 7.3 errata 009:
      When tracking nexthops over IPv6 multipath routes, or when receiving
      a NOTIFICATION while reaching an internal limit, bgpd(8) could crash.

      When checking the next hop for IPv6 multipath routes, or when receiving
      a NOTIFICATION while reaching an internal limit, bgpd(8) could crash.

    * Add configure options to adjust WWW_USER and wwwrunstatedir.

    * Fix 'ext-community * *' matching which also affects filters removing
      all ext-commuinites.

    * Limit the socket buffer size to 64k for all sessions.
      Limiting the buffer size to a reasonable size ensures that not too many
      updates end up queued in the TCP stack.

OpenBGPD-portable is known to compile and run on FreeBSD and the
Linux distributions Alpine, Debian, Fedora, RHEL/CentOS and Ubuntu.
It is our hope that packagers take interest and help adapt OpenBGPD-portable
to more distributions.

We welcome feedback and improvements from the broader community.
Thanks to all of the contributors who helped make this release
possible.

A few years ago a team of researchers tried to use a feature attribute flag in BGP. Their experiment caused an important BGP software to crash. The BGP community reacted by thanking the researchers for uncovering that flaw and worked on improving stability. No, just kidding. They shouted at the researchers and asked them to stop, which they eventually did. I felt back then that this community had a very unhealthy relationship with the quality of their software and the work of security researchers.

I suspect a Network Operators mailing list is going to be full of people trying to keep production up, with the tools they've got, rather than the tools they'd like. Thinking the software quality on the routers they're using are dogshit is probably just called "Monday" and thinking their peers' routers are even worse is called "Tuesday". I can understand they don't appreciate "research" done on production systems that might cause issues when they already know their equipment sucks. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [gnfargbl](user?id=gnfargbl) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37310495)   | [root](#37307354) | [parent](#37307733) | [next](#37308192) [–]  I *can't* understand it. The network operators should save their vitriol for the vendors who are selling them equipment that sucks, and for whoever in their own organisation is continuing to purchase equipment that sucks. Bitching at researchers (note: not "researchers") who are finding and calling out those flaws before someone really bad comes along and exploits them is somewhere between unhelpful and negligent.

Yeah okay the lock sucks. But I probably shouldn't have been doing it on your house in the first place and now you've got a broken lock. Who are you mad at? A researcher could have bought their own copy of the lock and picked it there. Or even borrowed yours with some notice, or let you know so you could have them use an interior door instead, or any number of other things that didn't break your actual house. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [zajio1am](user?id=zajio1am) [on Aug 30, 2023](item?id=37321481)   | [root](#37307354) | [parent](#37315512) | [next](#37317365) [–]  That is not really a matching comparison. With BGP, there is kind of public space (global BGP tables) and participants are free to attach valid attributes to their routes. From a cursory look, these researchers used announcement that was compliant with BGP standards (in contrast to Ben Cartwright-Cox from this article, who used fuzzed invalid attributes), so they did something that was generally acceptable behavior for BGP participants. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [timnetworks](user?id=timnetworks) [on Aug 30, 2023](item?id=37317365)   | [root](#37307354) | [parent](#37315512) | [prev](#37321481) | [next](#37311534) [–]  "I can get into this lock" will not have the same effect or call to action as "I can get into your doors" but it admittedly has to be aimed at the landlords, not the doormen. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hn8305823](user?id=hn8305823) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37311534)   | [root](#37307354) | [parent](#37310495) | [prev](#37315512) | [next](#37311307) [–]  > I can't understand it. The network operators should save their vitriol for the vendors who are selling them equipment that sucks We call out vendors when their quality suffers but you only have two or three practical vendor options for high end routers depending on your use case/feature requirements. All three have varying cycles of hardware and software quality, with hardware and software rarely being in phase for the same vendor. The fact that all three vendors make most of their money on non-network focused enterprises with less sophisticated engineers doesn't help get development attention where it needs to be for global infrastructure. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tw04](user?id=tw04) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37311307)   | [root](#37307354) | [parent](#37310495) | [prev](#37311534) | [next](#37310844) [–]  >I can't understand it. The network operators should save their vitriol for the vendors who are selling them equipment that sucks, and for whoever in their own organisation is continuing to purchase equipment that sucks. I think you fail to realize that the internet is a bunch of disparate networks that no one person controls. When "fixing" a router means you break half the internet, you just don't fix it. This isn't some walled garden where you can just say "tough shit if you broke, fix it". Most of the "issues" these researchers find are well known, but backbone operators are more militant than Linus when it comes to: rule #1 is don't break user space. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [gnfargbl](user?id=gnfargbl) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37311579)   | [root](#37307354) | [parent](#37311307) | [next](#37310844) [–]  > I think you fail to realize that the internet is a bunch of disparate networks that no one person controls. The internet is a bunch of disparate networks that no one person controls, *exactly*. That means that when someone tells you there's a fault in the kit that you have installed in your network, then that is 100% your problem and it is 100% on you to get it fixed. Once a vulnerability is known then someone out there is going to start exploiting it almost immediately. > backbone operators are more militant than Linus when it comes to: rule #1 is don't break user space. Backbone operators can have all the hubris they want, but it won't change the reality that the only effective action they can take when a vulnerability is found is to get it fixed ASAP. This is a security lesson that has been learnt in recent years by many sectors of the IT industry and, judging by the woeful response that Ben Cartwright-Cox describes in his post, it's one that the network backbone is going to be learning soon. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [zamadatix](user?id=zamadatix) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37314798)   | [root](#37307354) | [parent](#37311579) | [next](#37311828) [–]  The internet does not owe a negligent operator peering. No one person controls the internet but you sure as hell can find yourself kicked out if your goal is to be right on principals instead of a good peer. The only hubris which could be at play is someone thinking the rest of the internet should follow their desires instead of the other way around. Research is great but if you're poking around breaking things via DoS in the internet you're going to be judged as a bad peer regardless what the route daemon does. The security of the internet constantly moves forward but that doesn't mean the expectation of improving has to hold more precedence than the expectation of running. It's still very much a human to human system for all but the actual route exchange. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tw04](user?id=tw04) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37311828)   | [root](#37307354) | [parent](#37311579) | [prev](#37314798) | [next](#37310844) [–]  >The internet is a bunch of disparate networks that no one person controls, exactly. That means that when someone tells you there's a fault in the kit that you have installed in your network, then that is 100% your problem and it is 100% on you to get it fixed. So you've never worked in a corporate environment. Here's how that conversation would go: Hey guys, some researchers found out if you use a test flag meant for the lab on the public internet, it breaks all our BGP sessions. OK, so drop their feed and block them? Great, done. >Once a vulnerability is known then someone out there is going to start exploiting it almost immediately. And yet the "vulnerability" in question was known, and was not being immediately exploited if you read through the mailing list or were participating in NANOG at that point in time. So your statement is provably false. >Backbone operators can have all the hubris they want, but it won't change the reality that the only effective action they can take when a vulnerability is found is to get it fixed ASAP. And yet we're having this conversation in 2023, they have operated the same way for 40+ years, and somehow the internet is still working. Bad actors get blackholed, it worked in the past, it'll continue working in the future. The reality is that backbone routing is expensive, and expecting everyone to update their kit on YOUR timeline isn't reasonable. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [gnfargbl](user?id=gnfargbl) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37312105)   | [root](#37307354) | [parent](#37311828) | [next](#37312861) [–]  I am aware that network operators have behaved this way for very many years. The point I am making is that *all of the IT industry* used to attempt to "work around" security vulnerabilities in the same way, until log4shell and all the others gradually beat that propensity out of them. I am prophesying that a similar reckoning is likely to come upon the network backbone. You're arguing that the cost of entry to the game (BGP peering) is such that the old ways will continue to work. Let's hope you're right. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [devonkim](user?id=devonkim) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37315240)   | [root](#37307354) | [parent](#37312105) | [next](#37312861) [–]  Software ecosystems like libraries and frameworks have completely different propagation and remediation mechanics compared to federated systems like core Internet backbone routers and switches is the thing. Try as we might conceptualize otherwise the modern Internet from a packet’s purview is more like a loose confederation of ultimately privatized or state-run fiefdoms than a cellular automata digraph explosion. So actors that try to act maliciously against the network will be basically shut out given the rule of an iron fist being the default. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [gnfargbl](user?id=gnfargbl) [on Aug 30, 2023](item?id=37319333)   | [root](#37307354) | [parent](#37315240) | [next](#37319352) [–]  Conceptually, there is no special difference between a remotely exploitable vulnerability in an HTTP server and a remotely exploitable vulnerability in a BGP router. It would have been theoretically possible to have dealt with log4shell by blocking every IP address that was sending malicious payloads, for instance. Practically, I accept that there is a real difference. ASNs are much harder to acquire than IP addresses, and there are far fewer of them. That difference *might* mean that blocking continues to be an effective mechanism. However, in a world where malicious actors are increasingly just nation states wearing a flimsy mask, I'm not sure that the difficulty of getting access to sufficient numbers of ASNs is going to be a forever mitigation. The main thing I have taken away from this thread is that when it comes to vulnerability management, network operators seem to be pretty far behind the curve in mindset terms. The arguments being made in here ("you can't break other people's stuff", "we have a lot of boxes and SLAs mean we can't patch quickly") aren't even slightly new. The well-proven reality is that threat actors don't give one single shit about any of that. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [eskaytwo](user?id=eskaytwo) [on Aug 30, 2023](item?id=37319352)   | [root](#37307354) | [parent](#37315240) | [prev](#37319333) | [next](#37312861) [–]  Operators could have raised this with vendors to fix. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [robertlagrant](user?id=robertlagrant) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37312861)   | [root](#37307354) | [parent](#37311828) | [prev](#37312105) | [next](#37310844) [–]  > OK, so drop their feed and block them? > Great, done.

We had a large number of routers in production with this bug, we were aware and upgrading as fast as we could, but with 99.999% uptime SLA's we only have so many minutes per router we could afford for downtime/outages. We had schedules in place (approx 3 months of out-of-hours upgrades) 1 week warning was a bullshit move. Dropping the BGP sessions on 1000's of routers globally was stupidity. Bearing in mind we also couldn't just "apt-get upgrade" in place, most boxes required hard reboots to apply the patches. The answer to your question is no, as per a few others have said, Don't violate Rule #1. We see bad actors very often, our job is to keep the bits flowing and the internet online. Keeping the internet online is painful enough as it is without "researchers" dropping thousands of routers to "prove a point." | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [SSLy](user?id=SSLy) [on Aug 30, 2023](item?id=37319295)   | [root](#37307354) | [parent](#37317240) | [next](#37310844) [–]  Verbatim this is the same things people said in early 00's about people testing XSS et al. against poorly coded PHP/Perl sites. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [netfortius](user?id=netfortius) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37310844)   | [root](#37307354) | [parent](#37310495) | [prev](#37311307) | [next](#37316726) [–]  I suppose you have never seen, ever, in your professional career, the "C" suits making business deals and thus decisions on what's to be acquired, with big network/server/storage/database/software vendors, over the head and against the advice of those then called to support crap in production. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [patmorgan23](user?id=patmorgan23) [on Aug 30, 2023](item?id=37316726)   | [root](#37307354) | [parent](#37310495) | [prev](#37310844) | [next](#37308192) [–]  Rule number 1 of the internet is don't break other people's shit.

Full thread here: ```     https://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2023-August/222706.html  ``` Now the interesting part of that thread was that shortly after (~4 hours) the OP posted about their problem, someone replied and recommended that they setup their own GPS-based NTP network. From there, that sub-thread was mostly about NTP attacks and GPS security and mounting receivers on top of datacenter buildings and such. Counting up the messages (if my mail client's threading capabilities are to be trusted), of the 94 or so total messages in the thread, 79 (84%) of the messages were in that GPS-related subthread, and only 15 messages responded to the OPs issue directly.

GREASE means that when you build your "advanced" security device which "protects" customers by treating everything different as hostile, it won't work, so you'll need to tweak it to *at least* just ignore such differences as irrelevant, which is enough that we can come back later and intentionally improve things. Previously, without GREASE, we'd have to guess what oversights we could exploit to avoid this "protection" to deliver protocol improvements, if we guessed wrong nothing works, or everybody's security is broken, sometimes both. e.g. for TLS 1.2 the oversight we found is, if you're resuming an existing session the "security" products just wave that through because otherwise they break people's real workflows. So in TLS 1.3 protocol as actually spoken essentially an initial connection goes like this: Client: Hi some.dns.name.example I'm a TLS 1.2 Client, I'd like to resume our previous conversation #randomNonsense. Also, completely unrelated, I happen to speak FlyCasualThisIsReallyTLSv1.3 and so I have these TLSv1.3KeyAgreementParameters. then either: TLS 1.3 Server: Hi Client, of course, let's continue from there. [ whereupon everything further is encrypted because this is actually TLS 1.3, but to a dumb middlebox it makes sense that they're just resuming a prior encrypted conversation #randomNonsense which it doesn't remember ] OR TLS 1.2 Server: Er, no I don't remember any such conversation and I don't know FlyCasualThisIsReallyTLSv1.3 so let's start a fresh conversation as normal. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hinkley](user?id=hinkley) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37310499)   | [root](#37307354) | [parent](#37309441) | [prev](#37310498) | [next](#37308968) [–]  I think you’ve discovered the secret to getting people to exercise more. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [salawat](user?id=salawat) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37311827)   | [root](#37307354) | [parent](#37310499) | [next](#37308968) [–]  More like the secret to getting ignored/blackholed/sued into the ground the moment your fuzzer hits on a combo that actually does damage to someone else's system, since the implication here is you're not doing it on your own stuff.

We’ve been building trillions of dollars of public transit since about the same time as we started building the National highway system. So when exactly does public transit start saving all these lives? A new train from SF to LA has been in the works since 1996. They are expecting partial completion for $30 billion by 2030 which is projected to carry ~15 million passengers \* ~400 miles = 6 billion passenger miles per year. The fatality rate for passenger cars is ~0.57 per 100 million miles, so eliminating 6 billion passenger miles could be reasonably expected to save about 60 \* 0.57 = 34 lives a year out of the ~40,000 that are dying on the roads annually. This is just rough napkin math showing the scale of the problem would require a roughly $30 *trillion* investment in public transit to appreciably shift passenger-miles away from passenger cars. Public transit can be very useful. But it’s clearly not the solution to eliminating driving deaths. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [autoexec](user?id=autoexec) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37310565)   | [root](#37307354) | [parent](#37310232) | [next](#37319087) [–]  It seems unfair to say that public transport doesn't have a role in reducing deaths caused by drunk drivers just because the hugely flawed and half-assed public transport systems in our cities (which were designed to make public transport ineffective) haven't yet delivered on that promise. In places where cities and public transportation systems are well designed and useful people do use them and those places see far fewer deaths from drunk drivers than the US does as a result. You argue that it would be very expensive to fix the problems we've made for ourselves in order to get useful public transportation and that's certainly true. It's also very expensive to invent self-driving cars and part that cost has already been paid with lives lost and human suffering, but that hasn't stopped us from developing those systems.

We can say it until we're blue in the face, but vendor behavior will remain largely unchanged regardless (there are a few bright spots, but not nearly enough). So you go to war with the army you have. In this case, that means frequently deferring/coordinating security event communications. As much as I wish the market would appropriately penalize vendors that encourage researchers to sit on 0-days, that rarely happens, and the cost of insecurity is passed onto consumers instead. Tl;dr delaying disclosure does suck, but you should still do it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [salawat](user?id=salawat) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37311918)   | [root](#37306369) | [parent](#37308873) | [next](#37306840) [–]  Alas, it is the consumer that apparently drives pain reception for vendors, as they have no interest in minimizing consumer pain, but their own pain.

Chances are the control plane is handled by a bog-standard Linux/VxWorks/BSD that does all the logic of talking BGP/etc and then populates the right registers in the switching/routing hardware which handles the actual data plane. You could technically replace all the control and decision-making with whatever off-the-shelf computer platform you want, and have it drive the carrier-grade router and "manually" populate its routing table via some API/Telnet/SNMP. In fact, as long as the hardware packet-routing core is still good, this might be a good way to upgrade out-of-support equipment that is no longer getting updates to its control-plane computer. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [appplication](user?id=appplication) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37306733)   | [root](#37306369) | [parent](#37306519) | [prev](#37306840) | [next](#37315075) [–]  I could have sworn I saw someone on here a few weeks ago saying how they switched their router to openBSD and ended up in some horrible broken state after a power outage or something.

For a router I’d much prefer that it comes up on its own after I lose power, but the system isn’t totally broken or anything. It’s happened probably 3 times in the last year or so. To another commenter saying it’s crazy to not run a UPS with your router: this is residential. 99% of people don’t have a UPS for their router. They probably don’t even have a separate router and all and just use an all in one modem/router/wifi combo. None of these people are crazy, they’re just not made of money and a UPS is expensive.

That's awesome! I would want my web server to block bad clients. Well, somewhat, except that it's not awesome. It's like fail2ban, but implemented on a server that sits behind a load balancer. So, when it receives a bad login request from an IP and it bans that IP, it actually banned the IP of the load balancer, so now it won't receive any other requests. So that a malicious client can just send 1 bad request, and take down everyone else using the whole server. Basically, this whole discussion is not so much about Postel's law, it's about limiting failure domains. A bad route advertisement should make that 1 route inaccessible. It is not good design for a bad route advertisement to take down all the other good routes. It is particularly bad design for a protocol where routes are automatically propagated by devices that don't think there's anything wrong with them. If you want to compare it to the HTML situation, the bug can also be seen as a browser that, when it receives invalid HTML from www.google.com/search would not only throw an error, but also refuse any other connection to \*.google.com/\*.

My point still stands: attributes can have important information about the intentions of how a network operator wishes their network to be seen to the rest of the world.

It recommends that in many cases, an error should be treated as a route withdrawal, not by dropping the session. (The RFC specifies other ways to handle errors in specific situations.) There’s no guessing or assuming. In the scenario that started off the author’s investigation, the bad attribute kicked COLT off the Internet even though COLT did not connect directly to the Brazilian ISP that sent the bad route update. When they received the bad update, COLT’s routers dropped their BGP sessions with intermediate ISPs that were unrelated to the Brazilian ISP, causing complete loss of connectivity. If COLT’s routers had treated the error as a route withdrawal, they would have lost connectivity to the Brazilian ISP but not the rest of the Internet. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tsimionescu](user?id=tsimionescu) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37308240)   | [root](#37306384) | [parent](#37307998) | [prev](#37308242) | [next](#37306599) [–]  That is not what is being done. If you advertise a route with a corrupt attribute, your route will be considered inaccessible by any device that understands the attribute. But! All your other routes that you advertised earlier with perfectly fine attributes will continue working. This is what prevents this from becoming a DoS vulnerability. Let's take a more complete example. ISP1 advertises 2 routes to ISP2: ```   35.67.0.0/16 attr1=val1   37.61.0.0/16 attr1=corr  ``` ISP2 doesn't know what attr1 is, and it advertisea the following routes to ISP3: ```   35.67.0.0/16 attr1=val1   37.61.0.0/16 attr1=corr   78.0.0.0/8  ``` The bug is that ISP3 will then stop routing any traffic to 35.67.0.0/16, 37.61.0.0/16, or to 78.0.0.0/8. After the fix, ISP3 will keep routing traffic to 35.67.0.0/16 (respecting the value val1 for attribute attr1) and to 78.0.0.0/8 through ISP2. It will not route traffic to 37.61.0.0/16. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [capableweb](user?id=capableweb) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37306599)   | [parent](#37306384) | [prev](#37306611) | [next](#37306439) [–]  That sounds like a typical denial of service attack, which you don't see a problem with? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [JonChesterfield](user?id=JonChesterfield) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37308529)   | [root](#37306384) | [parent](#37306599) | [next](#37306439) [–]  It sounds like a system designed to stop doing things on unexpected input. The designers chose correctness over robustness. It's not an accidental vulnerability. Maybe switch off on request is a dubious design choice for infrastructure that you'd rather stay alive, but it sounds like a new version of the spec has already been released to make that an option. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [vitiral](user?id=vitiral) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37306439)   | [parent](#37306384) | [prev](#37306599) | [next](#37308813) [–]  The issue is how it interacts with other designs, such as forwarding of unknown attributes who are now poisoned | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [remram](user?id=remram) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37308813)   | [parent](#37306384) | [prev](#37306439) | [next](#37306514) [–]  Imagine if Gmail and Outlook refused to talk to each other and transmit any email anymore, because Gmail tried to deliver one email whose content was invalid (bad MIME, invalid attachment, etc).

Really should be titled “RTFM: Juniper routers shutdown BGP on bad input”. That being said, I found it be a good deep dive and I appreciate the author looking into this. BGP isn’t perfect but we made it this far and I think it does a pretty good job for handling ~75K autonomous systems. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [gregw2](user?id=gregw2) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37306757)   | [root](#37306384) | [parent](#37306514) | [next](#37310210) [–]  Err no, it was not just Juniper. Many other systems were fuzzed, half a dozen vendors were fine, another 5 weren’t and some remain unpatched and vulnerable. If it were just a Juniper implementation flaw it’d be less interesting than explaining an aspect of BGP error handling more generally which is indeed what the article was, for those of us aware of BGP but not familiar with specific protocol design decisions and implications. If you quibbled with the word “Grave” I might agree since it’s not industrywide and impacting major vendors like Cisco and Huawei and those implementing RFC 7606 (although there is no patch for Nokia or Extreme or Bird!) I’d counterpropose that a more neutral TLDR title/summary for an HN audience might be “Grave flaws in non compliant BGP error handling.” But on balance I think the author is better off with raising the alarm with a stronger headline; he clearly put his passion to good use and I learned a little something as a result. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nsteel](user?id=nsteel) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37309456)   | [root](#37306384) | [parent](#37306757) | [next](#37315332) [–]  As I understand it, Nokia equipment already does the correct thing if you configure it correctly in fault-tolerance mode. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hellt](user?id=hellt) [on Aug 31, 2023](item?id=37334813)   | [root](#37306384) | [parent](#37309456) | [next](#37315332) [–]  correct, Nokia implements RFC 7606, it needs to be added to the configuration, as it is not the default for now. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pdonis](user?id=pdonis) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37315332)   | [root](#37306384) | [parent](#37306757) | [prev](#37309456) | [next](#37310210) [–]  Bird routers didn't have the problem, correct? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sgjohnson](user?id=sgjohnson) [on Aug 29, 2023](item?id=37310210)   | [root](#37306384) | [parent](#37306514) | [prev](#37306757) | [next](#37306955) [–]  > BGP isn’t perfect but we made it this far and I think it does a pretty good job for handling ~75K autonomous systems.

Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch is cryptographically signed with the
[signify(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-7.3/signify.1) tool and contains
usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/7.3.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Alternatively, the [syspatch(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/syspatch)
utility can be used to apply binary updates on the following architectures:
amd64, i386, arm64.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).
