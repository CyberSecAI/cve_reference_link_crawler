{
  "CVE-2024-23897": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The args4j library used by Jenkins CLI to parse command arguments has a feature (`expandAtFiles`) that replaces an `@` character followed by a file path with the file's contents. This feature is enabled by default and not disabled in vulnerable versions.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Arbitrary file read vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller, potentially leading to:\n  - Remote code execution via Resource Root URLs.\n  - Remote code execution via \"Remember me\" cookie.\n  - Remote code execution via stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks through build logs.\n  - Remote code execution via CSRF protection bypass.\n  - Decryption of secrets stored in Jenkins.\n  - Deletion of any item in Jenkins.\n  - Download of Java heap dumps.",
    "Attack vectors": "Attackers can exploit the vulnerability through the Jenkins CLI using the `@file` syntax in command arguments. This can be done through the CLI via HTTP POST requests or websockets.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attackers require network access to the Jenkins instance. Depending on the desired impact, they may need Overall/Read permissions. Attackers without Overall/Read permissions can read the first few lines of files. Access to cryptographic keys stored in binary files is needed for some attacks."
