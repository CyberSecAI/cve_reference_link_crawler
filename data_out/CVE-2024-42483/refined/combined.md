# Replay Attacks Vulnerability In ESP-NOW

Moderate

[lhespress](/lhespress)
published
GHSA-wf6q-c2xr-77xj
Sep 12, 2024

## Package

ESP-NOW

## Affected versions

<= 2.5.1

## Patched versions

2.5.2

## Description

### Impact

An replay attacks vulnerability was discovered in the implementation of the `ESP-NOW` because the caches is not differentiated by message types, it is a single, shared resource for all kinds of messages, whether they are broadcast or unicast, and regardless of whether they are ciphertext or plaintext.

This can result an attacker to clear the cache of its legitimate entries, there by creating an opportunity to re-inject previously captured packets.

### Patches

In the magic, now the **magic** has be modified to use separated caches: one for plaintext and the other for ciphertext. In plaintext must not be allowed to modify the state of the cache dedicated to ciphertext.

BTW, this is not a 100% reliable solution, as an attacker with more effort can still replay old ciphertext. but considering the connectionless nature of `ESP-NOW`, it's "good enough" for now.

Patched versions of `ESP-NOW` are listed below:

| Branch | Commit ID |
| --- | --- |
| master | [4e30db50](https://github.com/espressif/esp-now/commit/4e30db50d541b2909d278ef0db05de1a3d7190ef) |

### Workarounds

The upgrade is applicable for all applications and users of `ESP-NOW` component from [ESP Component Registry](https://components.espressif.com/).

Please consider updating to `ESP-NOW` release containing the fixes mentioned above. Alternatively, the fixes can also be cherry-picked in your codebase.

### References
