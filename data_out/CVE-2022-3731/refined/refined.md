Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `Payload` argument in the `/api/v1/attack/token` endpoint, which is then used in an SQL query.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** SQL injection (CWE-89). The application constructs an SQL command using unsanitized input, allowing an attacker to modify the intended query.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information (confidentiality), modification of data (integrity), or denial of service (availability).
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted request to the `/api/v1/attack/token` endpoint and manipulating the `Payload` argument.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint and manipulate the `Payload` parameter. The content suggests that this attack is possible remotely.
