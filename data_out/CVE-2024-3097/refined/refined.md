Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-3097:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `get_item` function of the NextGEN Gallery plugin's REST API. Specifically, the `permission_callback` was initially set to `__return_true`, effectively bypassing any permission checks for accessing image metadata.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks in the `get_item` function, allowing unauthenticated users to access sensitive information.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability results in the exposure of image metadata, including EXIF data, which can contain sensitive information such as location data, camera settings, and other potentially private details.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access to Metadata:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information like EXIF and other metadata associated with images uploaded through the plugin.
- **Privacy Violation:**  Exposure of EXIF data could lead to privacy breaches, potentially revealing the location of where photos were taken, camera details and other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated HTTP Request:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable REST API endpoint, without needing to authenticate. The endpoint is `/wp-json/ngg/v1/admin/block/image/<image_id>/`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have any user account on the affected WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable website to send HTTP requests.
- **Knowledge of Image IDs:** The attacker needs to know or guess a valid image ID to retrieve metadata.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in NextGEN Gallery versions up to and including 3.59.
- The patch implemented in version 3.59.1 included a proper `permission_callback` check `[ $this, 'get_item_permissions_check' ]`, which enforces authentication and capability verification.
- The vulnerable code was located in `nextgen-gallery/trunk/src/REST/Admin/Block.php`.
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding a nonce verification and a capability check ( `current_user_can( 'edit_posts' )`).
