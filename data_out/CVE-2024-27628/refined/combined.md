### Possible overflow in EctEnhancedCT

**Description**

The first problem stems from the fact that the multiplication of rows and cols may overflow 'int' before it is converted to 'size\_t'. For example, if the EctEnhancedCT::create method is used where a user has control over the value of rows and cols.
```
Uint16 rows = 0;
Uint16 cols = 0;
m_CT.getRows(rows);
m_CT.getColumns(cols);
const size_t numFrames      = m_CT.m_Frames.size();
const size_t numBytesFrame  = m_CT.m_Frames[0]->length;
// HERE:
const size_t numPixelsFrame = rows * cols;

```

Inside the below method the expected number of pixel bytes is not validated, leading to uncontrolled access to memory in a memcpy() call.
```
OFCondition EctEnhancedCT::WriteVisitor::operator()(ImagePixel& pixel)

```

This has been fixed in commit #ec52e9.

Thanks to GitHub user "bananabr" (Daniel Berredo) for the report and suggested patch.
