- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Deserialization of untrusted input from the `arsp_options` post meta option.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** PHP Object Injection via deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker with contributor-level access or higher can inject a PHP Object. If a POP chain exists in another plugin or theme on the system, this could lead to arbitrary file deletion, sensitive data retrieval, or code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Authenticated attacker with contributor-level access or higher can inject a malicious PHP object by manipulating the `arsp_options` post meta option.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with contributor-level access or higher on the target WordPress site.
