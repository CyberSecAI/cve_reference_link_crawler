Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2023-28745:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an uncontrolled search path in the Intel® QSFP+ Configuration Utility software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled Search Path: The software doesn't properly control the paths it searches, allowing an attacker to potentially influence the execution flow by placing malicious files in locations where the utility searches.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Escalation of Privilege: A successful exploit could allow an authenticated user to escalate their privileges, gaining higher access levels on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
- Authenticated User: The attacker must be an authenticated user of the system.
- User Interaction: The attack requires user interaction (UI:R).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a local user with valid credentials on the system.
- The attacker must be able to place a malicious file in a location that is searched by the vulnerable software.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory states that Intel is not releasing updates to fix the vulnerability and has issued a Product Discontinuation Notice for the Intel® QSFP+ Configuration Utility software.
- The recommended mitigation is to uninstall or discontinue using the software and switch to the replacement tool "Ethernet Port Configuration Tool (EPCT)".
- The CVSS score is 6.7 (Medium), with the vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` which indicates:
    - **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):** The vulnerability requires local access.
    - **AC:H (Attack Complexity: High):** The conditions for a successful exploit are difficult to achieve.
    - **PR:L (Privileges Required: Low):** Low-privileged user is required
    - **UI:R (User Interaction: Required):** The attack requires user interaction.
    - **S:U (Scope: Unchanged):** The vulnerability only impacts the vulnerable component
    - **C:H (Confidentiality Impact: High):** There is a high impact to confidentiality if exploited.
    - **I:H (Integrity Impact: High):** There is a high impact to integrity if exploited.
    - **A:H (Availability Impact: High):** There is a high impact to availability if exploited.
