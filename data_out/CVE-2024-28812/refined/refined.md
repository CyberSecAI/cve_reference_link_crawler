- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A hidden SSH service on the local management network interface uses hardcoded credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Hardcoded credentials for a hidden SSH service.
    - Undocumented remote SSH access on the QF network interface.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Full compromise of the appliance operating system with highest privileges.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network access to the QF interface.
    - Exploitation of a hidden SSH service on a custom port.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Network connectivity to the local management network interface (QF).
    - Knowledge of the specific IP address to connect to.
    - Knowledge of the custom port used by the SSH service.
    - Knowledge of the hardcoded credentials (obtained from diagnostic and firmware update files).
