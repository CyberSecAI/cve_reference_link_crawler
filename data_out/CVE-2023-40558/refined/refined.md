- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Video Gallery & Management Plugin <= 3.3.5 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability allows a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could lead to unauthorized actions being performed by a privileged user. The specific impact varies depending on the actions the attacker can trigger.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via a CSRF attack, where the attacker tricks a logged-in user into unknowingly submitting a malicious request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a compromised page to initiate the forged request.
