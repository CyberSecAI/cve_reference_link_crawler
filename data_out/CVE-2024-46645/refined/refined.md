This document provides an overview of multiple path traversal vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-46644 to CVE-2024-46649) found in eNMS versions prior to 4.7.1. While the provided content is a summary, it does include a reference to a specific file detailing CVE-2024-46645 ([CVE-2024-46645.md](/skit-cyber-security/eNMS_vulnerabilities/blob/main/CVE-2024-46645.md)), which is a direct match to the requested CVE ID. This indicates that the content is related to the specified CVE.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Path Traversal

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The eNMS application has multiple path traversal vulnerabilities (specifically 6 parameters) allowing manipulation of URL requests to access files outside the intended directory.
- This can lead to arbitrary file upload and access to sensitive files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to sensitive files.
- Arbitrary file upload.
- Potential exposure of confidential information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Manipulating URL requests.
- Path traversal using vulnerable parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send manipulated URL requests to the eNMS application.

The document explicitly states that the eNMS application is vulnerable to path traversal issues and specifies CVE-2024-46645 as one of the affected CVEs. It also points to a markdown file `CVE-2024-46645.md` that could contain more information about this specific vulnerability.
