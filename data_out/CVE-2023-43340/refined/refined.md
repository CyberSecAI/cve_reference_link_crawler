Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input during the installation process of Evolution CMS v3.2.3. Specifically, the `cmsadmin`, `cmsadminemail`, `cmspassword`, and `cmspasswordconfim` parameters within the admin options of the database installation process are not being properly sanitized, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. This means that the malicious script is not stored on the server but is rather injected in the request, and reflected back to the user in the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
- This can lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the website
  - Stealing sensitive information
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:**  The attacker needs to be able to interact with the installation process, which typically is done locally on the machine where the CMS is being installed.
- **Crafted Payload:** The attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into the vulnerable parameters (`cmsadmin`, `cmsadminemail`, `cmspassword`, `cmspasswordconfim`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the installation process:** An attacker needs to be in a position to perform the installation process or manipulate the input during it.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameters:** The attacker needs to know which parameters are vulnerable to XSS and how to inject the malicious payload.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided payload `'"><svg/onload=alert('admin_name')>` demonstrates a typical XSS injection using an SVG tag with an onload event handler that triggers an alert box.
- The attack is demonstrated during the installation process where the attacker inputs the XSS payload in the specified parameters. When submitting, the injected script is reflected back, resulting in the execution of the injected Javascript.
- The vulnerability lies in the lack of sanitization for these parameters.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable software is Evolution CMS version 3.2.3
- The vulnerability exists in the admin options of the database installation process.
- The report provides multiple screenshots showing the XSS injection in different parameters, and showing the XSS execution in the browser.
