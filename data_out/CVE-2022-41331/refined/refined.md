- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authentication for critical functions in FortiPresence on-prem infrastructure server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control, specifically a lack of authentication for Redis and MongoDB instances. [CWE-306]
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can access the Redis and MongoDB instances. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulation of data, or complete compromise of the affected systems.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks, specifically crafted authentication requests targeting the Redis and MongoDB instances.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker with network access to the vulnerable FortiPresence server.
