# The DocBook XML to PostScript processor

SDoP is a Simple DocBook Processor. It is a typesetting program that reads
DocBook XML and outputs the typeset pages as PostScript. This can easily be
converted into PDF form by the ps2pdf command that comes as part of the
GhostScript package. SDoP supports most of the subset of DocBook that is known
as "Simplified DocBook". Illustrations can be encapsulated PostScript, Scalable
Vector Graphics (basic support only) or, if the relevant libraries are
installed, JPEG or PNG images. You can read the
[SDoP manual](https://github.com/PhilipHazel/sdop/blob/main/doc/sdop.pdf)
on this GitHub site.

## About

SDoP is a typesetter that turns Simple Docbook XML into PostScript page images.

# JVN#16420523 SDoP vulnerable to stack-based buffer overflow

## Overview

SDoP contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.

## Products Affected

* SDoP versions prior to 1.11

## Description

SDoP fails to handle appropriately some parameters inside the input data, resulting in a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability ([CWE-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)).

## Impact

When a user of the affected product is tricked to process a specially crafted XML file, an arbitrary code may be executed on the user's environment.

## Solution

**Update the software**

Update the software to the latest version according to the information provided by the developer.

The developer has added the commit to fix the vulnerability in SDoP repository, named as version 1.11.
