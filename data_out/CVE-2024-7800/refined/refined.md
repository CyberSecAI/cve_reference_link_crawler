Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is an unrestricted SQL injection vulnerability present in the `ajax.php` file of the Simple Online Bidding System. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the `delete_product` action is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input (`id` parameter) before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection to retrieve sensitive server information, including database details and potentially other sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Potential Data Manipulation:** Although not explicitly mentioned, SQL injection can potentially lead to data manipulation, deletion, or unauthorized modification of records within the application's database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint (`/simple-online-bidding-system/bidding/admin/ajax.php?action=delete_product`).
- **Malicious `id` Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter to manipulate the SQL query executed by the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be capable of crafting HTTP requests, including POST requests with URL-encoded parameters.
- **SQL Knowledge:** Basic knowledge of SQL syntax is required to craft the malicious SQL injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code is in `/simple-online-bidding-system/bidding/admin/ajax.php` with action set to `delete_product`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `id`.
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates a successful SQL injection attack using the `updatexml()` function to extract the database name.
-  The injection is demonstrated using the following payload: `id=4%20and%20updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(database())),3)--%20q`

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the Sourcecodester Simple Online Bidding System v1.0
- The identified file path is `/simple-online-bidding-system/bidding/admin/ajax.php?action=delete_product`.

This information provides a clear picture of the SQL injection vulnerability present in the identified system, its root cause, impact, and exploitation methodology.
