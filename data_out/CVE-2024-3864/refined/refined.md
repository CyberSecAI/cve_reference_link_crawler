The provided content relates to CVE-2024-3864.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A double-free vulnerability was discovered in the `SkRefCntBase::unref` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double-free: The vulnerability occurs when the reference count of an object is decremented more times than allocated leading to a double-free.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: This can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the rasterization process, specifically within the graphics component when handling `Skia` objects. It can be triggered by rendering web content that uses patterns.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to cause the vulnerable code to execute, which is typically achieved by crafting web content. The attacker does not need specific privileges on the local system, exploitation would be achieved by the browser handling malicious content.
