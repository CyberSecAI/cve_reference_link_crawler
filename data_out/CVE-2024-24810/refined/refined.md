- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The .be TEMP folder, used by the WiX installer framework, is created in the user's TEMP folder when the bundle is not run as admin. This makes it vulnerable to DLL redirection attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: DLL redirection vulnerability due to the use of the user's TEMP folder instead of the system TEMP folder when the installer isn't run as admin. The vulnerability exists because the .be folder is created in a user-controlled location, making it susceptible to malicious file injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Privilege escalation. A malicious DLL can be placed in the .be folder and, when the installer elevates privileges, the malicious DLL will also gain elevated privileges allowing arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attack vector. The attacker needs local access to the target system and the ability to monitor file system changes in the user's TEMP folder.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - Standard, non-admin user privileges
  - Ability to monitor the user's TEMP folder for changes
  - Ability to drop a DLL into a specific folder inside the .be folder before the installer elevates privileges

The provided content gives more details than the CVE description by detailing the steps required to exploit the vulnerability and the specific DLL redirection attack using .exe.Local capability. It also describes how to construct the attack by monitoring the TEMP directory for the .be folder creation. It also mentions that the issue affects any installer built with the WiX installer framework and provides affected and patched versions of the framework.
