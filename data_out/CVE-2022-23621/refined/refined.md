Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23621:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `XWiki#invokeServletAndReturnAsString` function, which allows a user with script rights to read arbitrary files from the XWiki WAR (Web Application Archive). This is because the function doesn't properly restrict the URL parameter passed to `servletRequest.getRequestDispatcher`, allowing an attacker to specify the path to sensitive files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary weakness is the ability to include and display the contents of arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The vulnerability exists because the function can be invoked with only script rights, and lacks proper access control mechanisms.
- **Unrestricted URL Parameter:** The `invokeServletAndReturnAsString` method does not validate the URL it is given, which allows the user to traverse the file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive files, including configuration files (e.g., `xwiki.cfg`, `xwiki.properties`), potentially exposing passwords, API keys, and other confidential data.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Access to configuration files can provide further attack vectors if the revealed credentials or settings are abused.
- **Compromise of XWiki instance:** Attackers can potentially obtain complete control of the XWiki instance after accessing the configuration files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Function Call:** Attackers use the function `$xwiki.invokeServletAndReturnAsString(URL)` with a manipulated URL parameter.
- **Velocity Template Injection:** The function can be called through the Velocity templating engine, which is accessible to users with script permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **XWiki User Account:** The attacker needs a user account with script rights, which can be obtained via editing rights on a wiki page.
- **Network Access:** Network access is needed to access the vulnerable XWiki instance.
- **Scripting Knowledge:** Basic understanding of Velocity templates and XWiki scripting.
