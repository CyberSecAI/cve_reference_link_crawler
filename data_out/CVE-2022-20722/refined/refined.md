{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient path validation of command arguments within the Cisco IOx API.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Path Traversal vulnerability due to lack of proper validation of command arguments within the Cisco IOx API, potentially allowing access to restricted files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read the contents of any file located on the underlying host filesystem.",
  "Attack vectors": "An authenticated, remote attacker can exploit this by sending a crafted command request using the Cisco IOx API.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated and have remote access to the Cisco device."
