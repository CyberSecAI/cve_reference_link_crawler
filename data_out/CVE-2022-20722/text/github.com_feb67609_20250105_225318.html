# Cisco IOx - Application Environment Path Traversal Vulnerability (CVE-2022-20722)

Moderate

[orange-cert-cc](/orange-cert-cc)
published
GHSA-2qx4-9cr7-gg38
Apr 19, 2022

## Package

IOx
(Cisco)

## Affected versions

17.3.3

## Patched versions

17.3(5)

## Description

### Overview

A vulnerability in the Cisco IOx application hosting environment of multiple Cisco platforms could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files from the underlying host filesystem.

### Impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted command request using the API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read the contents of any file that is located on the host device filesystem.

### Details

This vulnerability is due to insufficient path validation of command arguments within the Cisco IOx API.

### Solution

#### Security patch

Upgrade to patched version (see above).

#### Workaround

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
