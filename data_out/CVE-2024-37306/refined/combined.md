# Export and backup-related API endpoints are susceptible to CSRF

High

[SpecLad](/SpecLad)
published
GHSA-jpf9-646h-4px7
Jun 13, 2024

## Package

CVAT

## Affected versions

2.2.0-2.14.2

## Patched versions

2.14.3

## Description

### Impact

If an attacker can trick a logged-in CVAT user into visiting a malicious URL, they can initiate a dataset export or a backup from a project, task or job that the victim user has permission to export into a cloud storage that the victim user has access to. The name of the resulting file can be chosen by the attacker.

This implies the following:

* The attacker can overwrite arbitrary files in any cloud storage that the victim can access.
* If the attacker has read access to the cloud storage used in the attack, they can obtain media files, annotations, settings and other information from any projects, tasks or jobs that the victim has permission to export.

### Patches

Update to CVAT 2.14.3.

### Workarounds

N/A

### References

Fix commit: [5d36d10](https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/commit/5d36d10e493d92e893d7eae595544bcbe9cce1ce)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

* Mitigate a CSRF vulnerability in export and backup-related endpoints

While Django has built-in CSRF protection (which we use), it does not cover
GET requests, and AFAICS, there is no way to force it to do that.
Unfortunately, the many endpoints that initiate dataset exports and backups
do accept GET requests _and_ initiate side effects, making them susceptible.

The proper fix for this issue would be to redesign those endpoints to use
POST requests, but a) that's more complicated, and b) we should still keep
the old endpoints for backwards compatibility.

So apply a less proper fix, which is to disable session authentication for
the affected endpoints. It's a bit complex, because in some cases
(particularly when `action=download`) we _need_ session authentication to
work, because the UI redirects the user to such endpoints.

In addition, modify the handling logic for these endpoints in order to
ensure that when `action=download`, no side effects are triggered.
Previously, `action=download` would still queue an RQ job if none existed.

Even after this, `action=download` will still have two small side effects:

* An existing RQ job will be deleted if its results are out of date.
  I don't think this is a problem, because such a job cannot be used anyway.

* A completed RQ job will be deleted too. This is a problematic design,
  but I don't think an attacker can achieve anything by exploiting this. If
  an attacker maliciously redirects the user to an `action=download` URL,
  then they'll just download the export/backup as usual.

Some tests were making export requests incorrectly, so fix them.

* Add test for the CSRF workaround
```
