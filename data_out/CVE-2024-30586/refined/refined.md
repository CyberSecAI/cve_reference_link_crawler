{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `formWifiBasicSet` function in Tenda FH1202 firmware has a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `security_5g` parameter from a POST request is copied to a fixed-size buffer (256 bytes) using `strcpy`. Since the user can control the input of `security_5g`, a buffer overflow can occur if the input exceeds 256 bytes.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A stack overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other undefined behavior, depending on the attacker's payload.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/WifiBasicSet` endpoint with a `security_5g` parameter longer than 256 bytes.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, suggesting that they need to be on the same network as the device or have some form of network access."
