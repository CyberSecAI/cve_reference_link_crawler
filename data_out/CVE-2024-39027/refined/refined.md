Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `js/player/dmplayer/dmku/index.php` file when handling the `cid`, `text`, and `color` parameters. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into SQL queries without any validation or sanitization.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    * **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw. The application allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `cid`, `text`, and `color` parameters due to a lack of input sanitization in the `编辑_弹幕` method
    * **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication.
* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    * **Database Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to access sensitive data from the database.
    * **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data modification or deletion.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to `/js/player/dmplayer/dmku/index.php?ac=edit`
    * The attacker controls the `cid`, `text`, and `color` parameters.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable URL.
    * No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
    * The attacker does not need prior knowledge of the system.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is located in the `编辑_弹幕` function. The application directly uses the provided parameters in the SQL query, making it possible to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Example Exploit (Provided in the content):**

```
POST /js/player/dmplayer/dmku/index.php?ac=edit HTTP/1.1
Host: ip
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/70.0.3538.77 Safari/537.36
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 56

cid=(select(1)from(select(sleep(6)))x)&text=1&color=1
```
This specific exploit uses a time-based SQL injection by calling the `sleep(6)` function in the database which results in a delay when the query is executed. This helps the attacker confirm the presence of SQLi. The attacker can replace `sleep(6)` with other SQL statements to extract database information.
