- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `deepAssign` function in `@alexbinary/object-deep-assign` recursively copies properties from a source object to a destination object without proper sanitization or validation. Specifically, it does not prevent the modification of the `Object.prototype` via special properties like `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Prototype pollution vulnerability. The lack of checks when assigning properties allows an attacker to modify the prototype of the `Object`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to denial-of-service (DoS), remote code execution (RCE), or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, by modifying the application logic.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious JSON object containing `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` properties and passing it as a source object to the `deepAssign` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the input being passed to the vulnerable `deepAssign` function.
