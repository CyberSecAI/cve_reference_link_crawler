Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-26275:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the affected applications when parsing specially crafted X_T files. The read occurs past the end of an allocated structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125):** The applications attempt to read memory outside the bounds of an allocated buffer or structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious X_T File:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted X_T file to the targeted application.
*   **User Interaction:** A user must be tricked into opening the malicious file with the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to deliver the malicious X_T file to the user.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system beyond that of a normal user.

**Affected Products:**

*   **Siemens JT2Go:** All versions prior to V2312.0004.
*   **Siemens Teamcenter Visualization:**
    *   V14.2: All versions prior to V14.2.0.12.
    *   V14.3: All versions prior to V14.3.0.9.
    *   V2312: All versions prior to V2312.0004.
*    **Siemens Parasolid:**
    *   V35.1: All versions prior to V35.1.254
    *   V36.0: All versions prior to V36.0.207
    *   V36.1: All versions prior to V36.1.147

**Additional Notes:**

*   The same vulnerability (out-of-bounds read when parsing a malicious X_T file) is also present in Parasolid and is tracked under the same CVE.
*   The vulnerability is also related to two other vulnerabilities, CVE-2024-26276 (stack exhaustion) and CVE-2024-26277 (null pointer dereference). All three are triggered when parsing a malicious X_T file.
*   The provided documents include CVSS v3.1 and CVSS v4.0 scores.
*   The advisory recommends not opening untrusted XT files as a mitigation.
* The CVSS vector indicates the attack complexity is low in v3.1 and high in v4.0.
