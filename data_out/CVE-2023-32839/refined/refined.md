- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the dpe component, leading to a missing valid range check.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write due to the missing valid range checking in dpe.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed.
- **Attack vectors**: Local exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires local access to the device and the ability to execute code with system privileges. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.
