- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly sanitize or validate the `media_folder` parameter in the URL, allowing for path traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path Traversal vulnerability. The application allows the use of `../` in the `media_folder` parameter to navigate up the directory tree.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can access sensitive files within the application's file system, such as the `config.ini.php` file, which contains database credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the `media_folder` parameter in the URL, specifically by inserting `../` sequences after URL-encoded forward slashes (`%2F`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an administrator logged into the application to access the "Manage Media" section and manipulate the URL.
