- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer in the parameter type parser.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption due to lack of proper bounds checking in the parameter type parser.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker with administrator privileges can cause memory corruption, leading to a thread crash on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: Attacker needs to be authenticated with administrator privileges to exploit the vulnerability via network access by sending malicious crafted parameter type input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrator privileges and network access to the device.
