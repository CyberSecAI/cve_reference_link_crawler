**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-79:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS). This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application, which are then stored and executed when other users access the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution within the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network connection.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when a user interacts with malicious content that is stored on the server. This can be via a link or by accessing a malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction (UI:R) to trigger the malicious script. This usually involves the user viewing content that contains the attacker's injected script.

**CVSS Metrics:**

*   **CVSS Base Score:** 5.4
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
    *   AV:N (Network) - Attack vector is over the network.
    *   AC:L (Low) - Attack complexity is low.
    *   PR:L (Low) - Low privileges are required.
    *  UI:R (Required) - User interaction is required.
    *   S:C (Changed) - Scope is changed because the attacker's script is executed within the context of the web application.
    *   C:L (Low) - Confidentiality impact is low.
    *   I:L (Low) - Integrity impact is low.
    *  A:N (None) - Availability impact is none.

**Affected Product:**

*   Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) AEM Cloud Service (CS) and versions 6.5.20 and earlier
