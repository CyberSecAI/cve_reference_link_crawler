# Open Redirect Vulnerability in Sign-In in default configuration of OpenProject packaged installation

Moderate

[oliverguenther](/oliverguenther)
published
GHSA-g92v-vrq6-4fpw
Jul 25, 2024

## Package

OpenProject

## Affected versions

< 14.3.0

## Patched versions

14.3.0

## Description

### Summary

Using a forged HOST header in the default configuration of packaged installations and using the "Login required" setting, an attacker could redirect to a remote host to initiate a phishing attack against an OpenProject user's account.

This vulnerability affects default packaged installation of OpenProject without any additional configuration or modules on Apache (such as mod\_security, manually setting a host name, having a fallthrough VirtualHost). It might also affect other installations that did not take care to fix the HOST/X-Forwarded-Host headers.

### Mitigation

We strongly recommend all users to update to the latest version which includes stronger protections for the hostname from within the application using the HostAuthorization middleware of Rails (<https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#actiondispatch-hostauthorization>) to reject any requests with a host name that does not match the configured one. Also, all generated links by the application are now ensured to use the built-in hostname.

### Releases

OpenProject version [14.3.0](https://www.openproject.org/docs/release-notes/14-3-0)

contains additional measures to protect against Host header injections from within the application.

### Workaround

For users who aren't able to upgrade immediately, please use mod\_security for Apache2 or manually fix the Host and X-Forwarded-Host headers in your proxying application before reaching the application server of OpenProject.

Alternatively, you can use this patch to opt-in to host header protections in previous versions of OpenProject (>= 12.0)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
