## Vulnerabilities in Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2555917)

Published: July 12, 2011

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves 15 privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logged on locally and ran a specially crafted application. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit these vulnerabilities.

This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the way that kernel-mode drivers manage kernel-mode driver objects, keep track of kernel-mode driver objects, and validate function parameters. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

#### FAQ for Win32k Incorrect Parameter Allows Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1886

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer de-reference due to the way kernel-mode drivers keep track of pointers to certain kernel-mode driver objects.

**What is the component affected by this vulnerability?**

Win32k.sys is the Windows component affected by the vulnerability.

**What is the Windows kernel?**

The Windows kernel is the core of the operating system. It provides system-level services such as device management and memory management, allocates processor time to processes, and manages error handling.

It also contains the Graphics Device Interface (GDI), which is a library of functions for graphics output devices. Finally, it serves as a wrapper for DirectX support that is implemented in another driver (dxgkrnl.sys).

**What is the SAM file?**

The Security Account Manager (SAM) database file is the storage point for user passwords in Windows. The passwords are stored in a hashed form in the database. Hashing is a cryptographic process that generates a unique "fingerprint" from a piece of data. Hash functions are one-way functions, so even if an attacker learned the hashed values of another user's password, the attacker could not "unhash" it to learn the password itself.

However, if an attacker gained access to the SAM database, the attacker could conduct an offline password cracking attack. The attacker could copy the SAM database to another machine, then exhaustively generate every possible password, hash it, and compare the result to the hashes in the database. For example, if the hash of "XYZ" matched one of the values in the database, the attacker would know that the password for that user was "XYZ". There are tools available to mount such an attack, once a copy of the SAM database has been obtained.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker could use the vulnerability to access data in any kernel-mode memory location, including access to the SAM file.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

Because of the way kernel-mode drivers validate certain function parameters that are passed to them, an attacker could access data from any kernel-mode memory location.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that kernel-mode drivers validate function parameters.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

* <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms11-054.mspx>

Certain Avaya products utilize Microsoft Operating Systems and may be affected by this vulnerability.

## 2. Avaya System Products:

Avaya system products include an Operating System with the product when it is delivered. The system products described below are delivered with a Microsoft Operating System. Actions to be taken with these products are also described below.

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya CallPilot | 4.0.x through 5.0.x | Medium | Avaya recommends that customers install the security update as provided via Microsoft Windows Update. |
| Avaya Communication Server 1000 Telephony Manager | 3.0.x through 4.0.x | Medium | Avaya recommends that customers install the security update as provided via Microsoft Windows Update. |
| Avaya Aura® Conferencing Standard Edition | 6.0.x | Medium | Avaya recommends that customers install the security update as provided via Microsoft Windows Update. |
| Avaya Meeting Exchange Components:  * Client Registration Server * Recording Server * Streaming Server * Web Conferencing Server * Webportal | 5.0.x through 5.2.x | Medium | Avaya recommends that customers install the security update as provided via Microsoft Windows Update. |
| Avaya Messaging Application Server | 4.0.x through 5.2.x | Medium | Avaya recommends that customers install the security update as provided via Microsoft Windows Update. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as the recommended
update is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2011-1874 CVE-2011-1875 CVE-2011-1876 CVE-2011-1877 CVE-2011-1878 CVE-2011-1879 CVE-2011-1880 CVE-2011-1881 CVE-2011-1882 CVE-2011-1883 CVE-2011-1884 CVE-2011-1885 CVE-2011-1886 CVE-2011-1887 CVE-2011-1888 | These are a Medium for all products due to the possibility of privilege escalation. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose
operating systems. Occasionally
vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or applications that come with the operating system.
These vulnerabilities often do not impact the
software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of
the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are
not affected by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Microsoft Windows
platform may be. For affected Microsoft Operating Systems,
Microsoft recommends installing patches. Detailed instructions for
patching the Operating System are given by Microsoft at the following link:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
