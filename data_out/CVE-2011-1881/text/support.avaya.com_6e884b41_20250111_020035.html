Certain Avaya products utilize Microsoft Operating Systems and may be affected by this vulnerability.

## 2. Avaya System Products:

Avaya system products include an Operating System with the product when it is delivered. The system products described below are delivered with a Microsoft Operating System. Actions to be taken with these products are also described below.

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya CallPilot | 4.0.x through 5.0.x | Medium | Avaya recommends that customers install the security update as provided via Microsoft Windows Update. |
| Avaya Communication Server 1000 Telephony Manager | 3.0.x through 4.0.x | Medium | Avaya recommends that customers install the security update as provided via Microsoft Windows Update. |
| Avaya Aura® Conferencing Standard Edition | 6.0.x | Medium | Avaya recommends that customers install the security update as provided via Microsoft Windows Update. |
| Avaya Meeting Exchange Components:  * Client Registration Server * Recording Server * Streaming Server * Web Conferencing Server * Webportal | 5.0.x through 5.2.x | Medium | Avaya recommends that customers install the security update as provided via Microsoft Windows Update. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as the recommended
update is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2011-1874 CVE-2011-1875 CVE-2011-1876 CVE-2011-1877 CVE-2011-1878 CVE-2011-1879 CVE-2011-1880 CVE-2011-1881 CVE-2011-1882 CVE-2011-1883 CVE-2011-1884 CVE-2011-1885 CVE-2011-1886 CVE-2011-1887 CVE-2011-1888 | These are a Medium for all products due to the possibility of privilege escalation. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose
operating systems. Occasionally
vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or applications that come with the operating system.
These vulnerabilities often do not impact the
software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of
the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are
not affected by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Microsoft Windows
platform may be. For affected Microsoft Operating Systems,
Microsoft recommends installing patches. Detailed instructions for
patching the Operating System are given by Microsoft at the following link:
