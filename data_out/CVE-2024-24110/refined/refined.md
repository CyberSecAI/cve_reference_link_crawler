Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `sortKey` parameter within the `/api/front/spread/people` endpoint. This parameter is directly embedded into an SQL query using `${}` string interpolation, without adequate filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct inclusion of user-supplied input (`sortKey`) into the SQL query without any sanitization or parameterized queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries.
- **Potential Code Execution:** The provided example demonstrates the use of `updatexml`, which can potentially be leveraged for further malicious activities beyond information disclosure, potentially leading to code execution or unauthorized data modifications, although not explicitly demonstrated here.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/api/front/spread/people` endpoint.
- **Specific Parameter:** The `sortKey` parameter is the vulnerable entry point for the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected application.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to construct and send HTTP requests.
- **Target System Knowledge:** While not strictly required, understanding the database structure can assist in crafting more targeted and effective SQL injection payloads. It is noted that the vulnerability is only triggered if the user has at least two promoters.
