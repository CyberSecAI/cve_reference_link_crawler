# It's possible to overwrite the security rules of a page with a final page having the same reference

High

[surli](/surli)
published
GHSA-gg53-wf5x-r3r6
Sep 7, 2022

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-security
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 5.0

## Patched versions

12.10.11, 13.10.1, 13.4.6

## Description

### Impact

A bug in the security cache is storing rules associated to document Page1.Page2 and space Page1.Page2 in the same cache entry.

That means that it's possible to overwrite the rights of a space or a document by creating the page of the space with the same name and checking the right of the new one first so that they end up in the security cache and are used for the other too.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in XWiki 12.10.11, 13.10.1, 13.4.6.

### Workarounds

No workaround other than patching.

### References

<https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-14075>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

#### Description

STEPS TO REPRODUCE

1. Create an user (U1)
2. Login as U1 (advanced user)
3. Create a page (e.g. Pag1)
4. Create a WebHome (non-terminal) child to this page (Pag1/Pag2/)
5. On Pag2, click 'More Actions' > 'Move / Rename'
6. Tick 'Rename as Terminal Page'
7. Click 'Rename'
8. Go again to Pag2, click 'More Actions'
9. Observe the options available under 'Manage' section

EXPECTED RESULTS

Since the renamed (now Terminal) 'Pag2' page was initially created by the same user (U1), on 'More Actions' > 'Manage' drop-down section, the 'Move / Rename' and 'Delete' actions are also available.

ACTUAL RESULTS

The user U1 has available only the 'Copy' action.

If the page Pag2 is created from the beginning as Terminal, the 'Move / Rename' and 'Delete' actions are present.

The issue reproduces also on older XWiki versions, including XWiki 11.1, but could not reproduce it on XWiki 11.0.3.
