I’m using the Pro version where a client has some pretty specific wants where no similar plugin could accommodate all of them. This is a remarkably versatile and flexible plugin, and the support is awesome. It seems almost instantaneous and super helpful. 100% recommended.

I have been using WPDM for almost 2 years. It works bug free and has many features. I use the download management feature to track my plublic downloads. Recently I also now use it to sell some of my digital offerings. I like the product so much I purchased their All In One Pass too. I look forward to implementing a membership service based on my digital downloadable products for the science community.
