Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `formWriteFacMac` function in the Tenda W30Ev1.0 V1.0.1.25(633) firmware directly passes the user-provided `mac` variable to the `doSystemCmd` function without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The lack of input validation on the `mac` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed by the underlying operating system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary command execution:** An attacker can execute any system command on the device, potentially leading to full control over the router. This can include:
    - Data exfiltration
    - Modification of device settings
    - Installation of malware
    - Denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a POST request to the `/goform/WriteFacMac` endpoint.
- **`mac` parameter:** The malicious command is injected through the `mac` parameter of the POST data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router. This likely means being on the same network as the router or having network access through another method.
- **No authentication required**: The provided information does not mention any authentication requirements to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) code demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability by sending a POST request with a malicious command in the `mac` parameter.
- The `v2` parameter is mentioned as another potential location where command injection could exist but the `mac` parameter is the only one detailed.
- The affected firmware version is Tenda W30Ev1.0 V1.0.1.25(633).
