```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to the use of double quotes when logging incorrect login attempts in Centos Web Panel 7. This allows for the execution of bash commands through the login parameter.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server without authentication.
- Command Injection: The `login` parameter in `index.php` is vulnerable to command injection via bash commands.

Impact of exploitation:
- Full system compromise: An attacker can gain complete control over the affected server.
- Data breach: Sensitive information on the server can be accessed by the attacker.
- Service disruption: The attacker can disrupt services running on the server.

Attack vectors:
- HTTP POST request to `/login/index.php` with a crafted `login` parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Centos Web Panel 7 instance.
- No authentication is required.
