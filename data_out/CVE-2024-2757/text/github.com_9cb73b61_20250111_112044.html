# mb\_encode\_mimeheader runs endlessly for some inputs

High

GHSA-fjp9-9hwx-59fq
Apr 11, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 8.3.5

## Patched versions

8.3.6

## Description

### Summary

Certain inputs provided to mb\_encode\_mimeheader trigger an endless loop.

### Details

A discernible pattern has not yet been identified, but a specific string consistently reproduces the issue.

### PoC

In PHP 8.3.3, execute:

```
<?php
mb_internal_encoding('UTF-8');
mb_encode_mimeheader(",9868949,9868978,9869015,9689100,9869121,9869615,9870690,9867116,98558119861183. ", "utf-8", "B");

```

The mb\_encode\_mimeheader function seems to enter an infinite loop and fails to return.

### Impact

Given that this function is integral to numerous email processing routines, including those handling potentially untrusted user inputs, this vulnerability could be exploited for denial-of-service attacks. For instance, CakePHP 5 relies on this function to encode email subjects.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
