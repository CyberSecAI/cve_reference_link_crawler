Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3596:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content includes information related to CVE-2016-3596. It is listed within a larger Oracle Critical Patch Update advisory, and also mentioned in an IBM security bulletin regarding IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation. Both sources identify the vulnerability as related to Oracle Outside In Technology.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is an unspecified flaw within the "Outside In Filters" component of Oracle Outside In Technology. The specifics of the flaw are not detailed in the provided text.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- The vulnerability lies within the processing of data by the "Outside In Filters" component.
- The exact nature of the flaw isn't provided.
- The weakness is located in a component that handles various file formats.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality:** Successful exploitation could lead to a high level of confidentiality breach. Attackers might gain access to sensitive information.
- **Integrity:** The impact on data integrity is low, which implies attackers might have limited ability to modify data.
- **Availability:** The impact on availability is also low, meaning exploitation is less likely to cause a service disruption.
- The overall impact is described as potentially leading to "high confidentiality impact, low integrity impact, and low availability impact".

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is through network exploitation (`AV:N`).
- The vulnerability is triggered when the affected component processes malicious data.
- The specific protocol used in the Oracle advisory is HTTP.
- IBM mentions that the vulnerability is in Oracle Fusion Middleware related to the Outside In Technology Outside In Filters component which means it's likely exploited via the network where the component is reachable.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker does not require any privileges (`PR:N`).
- No user interaction is required for exploitation (`UI:N`).
- The attack complexity is low (`AC:L`), indicating that exploitation is relatively straightforward.
- The attacker can be remote because the attack vector is `Network`.
