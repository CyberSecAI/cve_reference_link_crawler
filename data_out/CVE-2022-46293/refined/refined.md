{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds write in the `translationVectors` array in the MOPAC file format parser. Specifically, when parsing lines containing \"FINAL POINT AND DERIVATIVES\", the code reads a sequence of lines and extracts coordinate values (x, y, z). If the condition to set the z-coordinate is met, it writes the coordinates to the `translationVectors` array while incrementing an index.  The loop continues as long as specific tokens are found and the index, `numTranslationVectors`, can increase arbitrarily, eventually writing beyond the bounds of the `translationVectors` array.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds write on the stack"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution. Depending on how the code is compiled and the stack is laid out, writing beyond the bounds of the `translationVectors` array can overwrite adjacent memory on the stack, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted malformed file with a large number of lines that can trigger the vulnerable code path in the `ReadMolecule` function of the MOPAC file format parser can cause the out-of-bounds write.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide a malicious file to the vulnerable application (Open Babel) to trigger this vulnerability. This could be done through direct file input, or via a network service that uses the vulnerable library in the backend."
