- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The authentication framework has a flaw where, when a user is logged in, it generates new valid session IDs for unauthenticated requests to certain pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken authentication framework, allowing unauthenticated users to obtain valid session cookies while a user is logged in.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain a valid session cookie without authentication and use it to perform authenticated actions on the web application, potentially leading to further exploitation, as demonstrated by the author who combined this with CVE-2022-45725 to achieve RCE.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker sends an unauthenticated GET request to the “/cgi-bin/system-status” page (or similar) while a user is logged into the web application. This results in the server generating a new valid session ID which is sent back to the attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web interface and a user needs to be logged into the web application of the router.
