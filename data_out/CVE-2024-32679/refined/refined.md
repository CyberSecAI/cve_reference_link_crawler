- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Unprivileged users can perform actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users. The specific impact can vary.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is related to the plugin's functions that handle access control, which can be exploited by sending requests to these functions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires no authentication, as the vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
