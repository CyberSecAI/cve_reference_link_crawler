{
  "CVE-2024-26793": {
    "description": "The gtp_link_ops operations structure for the subsystem must be registered after registering the gtp_net_ops pernet operations structure.",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect order of registration of operations structures in the GTP module initialization.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Null-pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A general protection fault due to a null-pointer dereference, leading to a denial of service. The use-after-free vulnerability is implied by the description as the root cause of the null pointer dereference.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the creation of a new GTP link. An attacker could potentially exploit this through netlink messages or other operations that trigger gtp_newlink().",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the GTP module and trigger the creation of a new GTP link, which may require some privileges or a specific network configuration."
