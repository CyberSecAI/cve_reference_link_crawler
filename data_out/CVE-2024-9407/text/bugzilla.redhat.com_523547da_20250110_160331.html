Even if SELinux is used, this vulnerability can bypass its protection by allowing the source directory to be relabeled to give the container access to host files. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2315887#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-10-01 10:55:17 UTC  ``` A flaw in the bind-propagation option of the Dockerfile RUN --mount instruction allows arbitrary parameters to be passed to the underlying mount command. This issue enables an attacker to mount arbitrary host files into a container during the build process and potentially modify them. SELinux does not provide sufficient defense, as the attacker can specify :z or :Z to relabel the host directory for container access. The vulnerability requires an attacker to have build privileges on the system and can lead to unauthorized access and modification of host files, posing significant security risks.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2315887#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-05 03:54:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:8846 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8846](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8846)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2315887#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-11 01:27:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:9051 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9051](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A9051)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2315887#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-12 11:12:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:9454 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9454](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A9454)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2315887#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-12 11:13:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:9459 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9459](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A9459)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2315887#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-19 01:51:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.4 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:9926 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9926](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A9926)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2315887#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-26 18:45:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16  Via RHSA-2024:10147 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10147](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10147)   ``` |  |
