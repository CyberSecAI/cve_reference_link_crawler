- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "OfferBox" mobile application uses a hard-coded secret key for JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hard-coded cryptographic key (CWE-321).
- **Impact of exploitation:** The hard-coded secret key can be retrieved through reverse engineering of the application binary. This could potentially allow attackers to forge or manipulate JWT tokens, which might lead to unauthorized access or other security breaches, although the exact impact is not specified in detail. The official description indicates the vulnerability impact is low confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local. An attacker would need to obtain the application's binary and perform reverse engineering to extract the hard-coded secret key.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need local access to the application binary and the ability to perform reverse engineering.
