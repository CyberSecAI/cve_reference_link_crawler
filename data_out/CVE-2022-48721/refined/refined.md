The provided content relates to a fix for a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's SMC (Shared Memory Communications) implementation, specifically related to how wait queue entries are handled during a fallback from SMC to TCP.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the incorrect handling of wait queue entries associated with an SMC socket when a fallback to TCP occurs. Previously, the code attempted to transfer these entries from the SMC socket's wait queue (`smc->wq`) to the corresponding TCP socket's wait queue (`clcsock->wq`). However, this transfer was done privately, and the original owners of these entries (e.g., epoll) were not aware of the transfer. Consequently, when those owners attempted to operate on the entries using the original waitqueue spinlock (`smc socket->wq.wait.lock`), they would cause a race condition and a potential crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Race condition:** The core weakness is a race condition caused by the mismatch between the waitqueue entries location and the spinlock used to protect it, triggered by the private transfer of waitqueue entries between different socket structures (`smc->wq` and `clcsock->wq`).
- **Incorrect wait queue management:** The original approach of transferring wait queue entries was flawed because it didn't account for the existing locking mechanisms used by the owners of those entries.
- **Use-after-free scenario:** The wait queue entries are moved from one wait queue to another, while the epoll structures still maintain pointers to the old queue. When the second wait queue is iterated, the epoll structure might attempt to remove it from the first queue while it's not there anymore causing a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Kernel crash:** The primary impact is a kernel crash, manifesting as a general protection fault, as seen in the provided call trace. This can lead to denial of service.
- **System instability:** The kernel crash can cause the system to become unstable.
- **Data loss/corruption:** In some specific cases, it is possible that memory corruption might occur.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering an SMC to TCP fallback: The vulnerability is triggered when a fallback from SMC to TCP occurs. This fallback might be caused by various network issues.
- Presence of wait queue entries in the SMC socket's wait queue: The vulnerability is triggered when applications use functionalities such as epoll on SMC sockets that creates entries on the socket's wait queue.
- Exploitation would involve creating a scenario where a fallback occurs and wait queue entries exist in the SMC socket's wait queue.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to trigger a fallback from SMC to TCP, which can happen due to network conditions or by actively causing connection problems.
- No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability, as it occurs in the network stack. An attacker needs to make use of SMC sockets and trigger a fallback.

**Fix details:**
The fix involves:
- **No more private transfer:** Instead of transferring the wait queue entries, the fix introduces new implementations of the `clcsock`'s callback functions (`sk_state_change`, `sk_data_ready`, `sk_write_space`, `sk_error_report`).
- **Callback forwarding:** These new callbacks will check if `smc->wq` has any entries and if so will forward wake-up events to the original `smc->wq`. This ensures that applications waiting on the SMC socket are properly notified, even after the fallback.
- **`smc_mark_woken` Structure:** A new structure is introduced to signal if a callback has been triggered.
- **Modified Callback mechanism:** The original callback of the `clcsock` is called and if woken, the `smc->wq` is also woken using `smc_fback_wakeup_waitqueue`.

This approach ensures that wait queue entries are not moved around, eliminating the race condition, and ensures that all listeners are properly notified on events after the fallback. The fix also modifies the `sk_user_data` field to be able to access the `smc_sock` structure.
