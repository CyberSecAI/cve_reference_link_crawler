- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the Layout module's SEO configuration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF, Remote Code Execution (RCE) through the scripting console.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code within the scripting console.
- **Attack vectors:** By exploiting the `\_com\_liferay\_layout\_admin\_web\_portlet\_GroupPagesPortlet\_backURL` parameter within the SEO configuration of the Layout module. This appears to be achieved by tricking a user into submitting a crafted request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a user into making a request to the vulnerable endpoint, possibly through a malicious link or embedded within a website. The user would need to have the necessary permissions to modify the SEO configuration.
