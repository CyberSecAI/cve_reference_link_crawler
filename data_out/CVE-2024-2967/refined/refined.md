**Vulnerability Description:**
The 'Guest posting / Frontend Posting wordpress plugin â€“ WP Front User Submit / Front Editor' plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts, potentially leading to various malicious actions within the context of the user's browser.
- **Account Hijacking:** If an administrator views a page with a malicious script, the attacker could potentially gain admin access to the site.
