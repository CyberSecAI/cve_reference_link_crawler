Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, which allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that require higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is a failure to properly restrict access to certain functions or actions based on user roles and permissions. This allows unauthorized users to perform privileged actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The impact is described as highly dangerous and expected to become mass exploited, however, specific impacts vary case by case. In general, a broken access control vulnerability can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, as well as the ability to take over the entire site, depending on the function affected.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The specific attack vector is not detailed but given the description, the vulnerability is likely exploited by sending a request to an affected function without having the required privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a user with low privileges, such as a "Contributor", which suggests any logged-in user who does not have administrative roles could potentially exploit the vulnerability.
