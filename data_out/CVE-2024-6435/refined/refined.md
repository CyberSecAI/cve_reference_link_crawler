**Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect permission assignment for a critical resource (CWE-732).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation vulnerability. A malicious user with basic privileges can access functions intended for administrative users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Read sensitive data.
*   Create users.
*   Perform critical functions such as creating users with elevated privileges.
*   Access sensitive information in the "views" section.

**Attack vectors:** Network-based attack (AV:N).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs basic user privileges (PR:L) and no user interaction is required (UI:N).
