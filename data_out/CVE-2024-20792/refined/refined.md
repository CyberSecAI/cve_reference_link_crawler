- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free (UAF)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A use-after-free vulnerability exists in Adobe Illustrator.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the system. The attack requires user interaction (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs local access to the system, and they require the user to open a crafted file or perform a specific action.
