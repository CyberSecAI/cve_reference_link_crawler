# Path Traversal – Reading Certain File Extensions

Low

published
GHSA-3qjg-229m-vq84
Oct 30, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.6.0

## Description

### Impact

BigBlueButton 2.5 is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability, that allows an attacker with a valid starting folder path, to traverse and read other files without authentication, assuming the files have certain extensions (txt, swf, svg, png).

### Patches

Input validation was added on the parameters being passed and dangerous characters are stripped.

Patch on BigBlueButton 2.6.0-beta.1: [#15960](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/15960)

### Workarounds

There are no workarounds. We recommend upgrading to a patched version of BigBlueButton.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
