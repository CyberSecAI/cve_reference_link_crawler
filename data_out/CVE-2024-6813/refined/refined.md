Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied strings before they are used to construct SQL queries within the `getSortString` method of the NETGEAR ProSAFE Network Management System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation enables a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. The code is executed in the context of SYSTEM, the highest privilege level in Windows.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based Attack:** The attack is network-based, meaning it can be carried out remotely.
*   **Specific Method:** The vulnerability is located in the `getSortString` method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** An attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. This implies a privilege level of 'low' according to the CVSS vector.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `getSortString` method of NETGEAR's ProSAFE Network Management System. By injecting malicious SQL code, an authenticated attacker can achieve remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges.
