- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of the `category_id` parameter in the `category.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection (CWE-89).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can retrieve all the information stored in the database by sending a specially crafted SQL query. This could lead to data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based. An attacker can send a specially crafted SQL query via the `category_id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special capabilities or authentication is required. An attacker can be unauthenticated and remote.
