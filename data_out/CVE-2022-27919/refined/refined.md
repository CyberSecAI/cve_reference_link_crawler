- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The default access control settings in Gradle Enterprise installations created without a specific configuration file incorrectly allowed anonymous access to build cache administration and the Export API. This deviates from the intended and documented default configuration which should only allow anonymous users to view and publish build scans.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control, specifically allowing anonymous access to sensitive administrative functions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could achieve remote code execution (RCE) by modifying the build cache access control settings to allow storing malicious software in the cache.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker leverages the anonymous access to the Gradle Enterprise admin interface to modify build cache settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network access to the affected Gradle Enterprise instance and must be able to access the `/admin/access/anonymous` endpoint.
