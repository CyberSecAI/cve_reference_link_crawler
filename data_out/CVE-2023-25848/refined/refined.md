- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command (SQL injection).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure through a crafted query. Specifically, a single attribute within a database connection string can be exposed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Low severity information disclosure. The attacker can obtain a single attribute from a database connection string. No business data is disclosed.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unauthorized attacker can submit a crafted query.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted query to the ArcGIS server. No authentication is required.
