| Example considerations (non exhaustive list):   * Attacker has access to the source (once we open source the project) * Multiplayer: unauthorized access to a sliver server * Unauthorized access to running agents (i.e: ability to spoof the server / send commands to running slivers) * RCE via logged in operator (might be worth to check for escape shell issues in the `generate` and `msf` commands) * ... |

| We may want to document specific security objectives. As you stated, to me there is a clear security boundary between the operator and server, an operator should not inherently be able to run commands or code on the server. I also added an "audit log" to the server for a white team to review, which records all of the (remote) operator's commands that relies on this boundary. |

| Totally agree with this. Also, I don't know the status for other projects, but I think putting detailed GitHub issues with the **security** label could be enough for the reporting part. |

| I'd be happy to help in this effort, but I'll need to tackle some other PRs to familiarize myself with the codebase. If I don't circle back to this in a couple of weeks, ping me. |
