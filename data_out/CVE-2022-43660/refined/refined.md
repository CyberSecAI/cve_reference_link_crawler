Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2022-43660:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper Neutralization of Server-Side Includes (SSI) within a web page. This means the application is not properly sanitizing or escaping user-provided input when it is used in Server-Side Includes, which could lead to the execution of unintended code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-97:** Improper Neutralization of Server-Side Includes (SSI) Within a Web Page. This vulnerability occurs because the application does not properly sanitize or neutralize user-supplied input before including it in a server-side include.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote, authenticated attacker with the privilege "Manage of Content Types" can execute arbitrary Perl scripts and/or arbitrary operating system commands on the server. This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, modification, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker needs to be authenticated with high privileges within the application and be able to manage content types. The attacker can then inject malicious SSI code through the vulnerable interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be:
    *   Remote (can access the system over the network).
    *   Authenticated with the privilege "Manage of Content Types".
    *   They do not need user interaction from the victim (UI:N).

**Summary:**
The vulnerability (CVE-2022-43660) in Movable Type arises from the improper handling of server-side includes (SSI). An authenticated attacker with high privileges can inject malicious code through the web interface, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
