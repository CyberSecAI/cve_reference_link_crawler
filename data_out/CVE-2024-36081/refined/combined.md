Westermo-24-05: EDW-100 Security Advisory
Severity: MEDIUM

2024-05-03

Description

EDW-100 is a serial to Ethernet converter designed to allow RS-232, RS-422 and RS-485 serial devices
to communicate via TCP/IP Ethernet networks.

Westermo acknowledges the following vulnerabilities that have been identified.

1.  Hidden root user with hardcoded password: EDW-100 has a hidden root user account
with a hardcoded password that cannot be changed, making EDW-100 vulnerable to
unauthorized access (CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password, CWE-256: Plaintext
Storage of a Password)

2.  Unauthenticated user can read config containing password: (CWE-522: Insufficiently

Protected Credentials, CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password)

Affected versions

EDW-100 – All versions

Impact

EDW-100 is impacted as follows:

1.  Hidden administrator account with hardcoded password. In the firmware package, in

"image.bin", the username root and the password for this account are both hard-coded and
exposed as strings that can trivially be extracted. Currently there is no way to change this
password.

2.  Unauthenticated user can read configuration-file containing password. An unauthenticated
GET request can download the configuration-file that contains the configuration, including
the username and passwords in clear-text.

Mitigation

To mitigate the risks associated with these vulnerabilities, Westermo recommends network
segregation, perimeter protection, network to network protection, and physical security measures.

EDW-100 functions as an industrial serial to ethernet converter. This means that EDW-100 does not
in itself have any of the protective measures you require in a modern security posture, EDW-100
should not be placed at the edge of the network but instead deployed using the techniques
mentioned in the IEC 62443 standard.

This means the use of network segregation and perimeter protection which can be accomplished by
for example deploying a firewall and the use of VLANs.

If data needs to flow into, or out of, the security zone containing EDW-100 it is important to have
network to network protection enabled which for example can be applied with a Virtual Private
Network (VPN).

It is also crucial to have physical security measures put in place as the unit can be vulnerable to
physical attacks and tampering. A recommendation to mitigate this risk is to place the unit in a
separate enclosure with locks and alarms if it opened outside of normal maintenance.

While the unit’s design characteristics may necessitate extra precautions, implementing the
suggested countermeasures ensures a secure deployment that effectively addresses associated risks.

Replacement

Additionally, Westermo recommends replacing EDW-100 with Lynx DSS L105-S1. For further
