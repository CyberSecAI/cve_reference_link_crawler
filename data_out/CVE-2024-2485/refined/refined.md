Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the first document:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formSetSpeedWan` function of the Tenda AC18 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `speed_dir` parameter from a POST request is directly used in a `sprintf` function without proper bounds checking. This allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The stack overflow can overwrite the return address of the `formSetSpeedWan` function. This would allow an attacker to gain control of the program execution and execute arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/SetSpeedWan` endpoint.
- The `speed_dir` parameter in the POST request is the attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This typically requires network access to the router.

The second document does not contain any vulnerability information.

The identified vulnerability aligns with the description of a stack buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when handling a user provided parameter passed in a HTTP POST request.
