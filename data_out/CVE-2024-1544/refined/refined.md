The provided content relates to CVE-2024-1544.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how ECDSA nonces (k) are generated in wolfSSL before version 5.6.6. The process involves sampling a random number (r) and then truncating it using a modular reduction modulo n, where n is the order of the elliptic curve.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Side-channel vulnerability:** The division performed during the modular reduction leaks information through control-flow, revealing a bias in the most significant bits of the generated nonce (k).
- **Bias in nonce generation:** This bias, depending on the curve used, can be either negligible or significant enough for an attacker to reconstruct the nonce using lattice reduction methods.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Reconstruction of the ECDSA nonce (k) can lead to the compromise of the ECDSA private key.

**Attack vectors:**
- A side-channel attack analyzing the control-flow during the modular reduction of the nonce.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to analyze the side-channel information (e.g., timing, power consumption, electromagnetic emanation) during the nonce generation.
- Depending on the curve, significant resources might be required to reconstruct the nonce using lattice reduction techniques.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of wolfSSL before 5.6.6.
- The issue is related to the `wc_ecc_sign_hash` function calls.
- The fix is available in pull request #7020.
- The vulnerability was reported by Luca Wilke, Florian Sieck, and Thomas Eisenbarth from the University of LÃ¼beck.
- The detailed analysis of the vulnerability will appear in the proceedings of CCS 24.
