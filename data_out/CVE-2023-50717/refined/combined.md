## Description

### Summary

---

Attacker can upload a html file with malicious content. If user tries to open that file in browser malicious scripts can be executed leading Stored XSS(Cross-Site Script) attack.

### PoC

---

NocoDB was configured using the Release Binary `Noco-macos-arm64`, and nocodb version 0.202.9 (currently the latest version) was used.

binary hash infos: md5(164b727f287af56168bc16fba622d0b4) / sha256(43e8e97f4c5f5330613abe071a359f84e4514b7186f92954b678087c37b7832e)

Here, used the default `Features` table.

### 2. Click `+` in the table `field header` to add an `attachment` field.

### 3. Click the `Add File(s)` button to select and upload files.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86613161/287473041-0801ff39-e48c-4746-8518-be825bfd5533.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86613161/287473041-0801ff39-e48c-4746-8518-be825bfd5533.png)

Here, `test.html` containing `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` was uploaded.

### 4. Check the uploaded file path.

### 5. Access the uploaded file path.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86613161/287473278-410f9228-58e3-4ee4-b111-70cdbffa9ed5.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86613161/287473278-410f9228-58e3-4ee4-b111-70cdbffa9ed5.png)

When the file path is accessed, the `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` script statement contained in the file is executed and the server host appears in the alert message.

### Impact

---

This allows remote attacker to execute JavaScript code in the context of the user accessing the vector. An attacker could have used this vulnerability to execute requests in the name of a logged-in user or potentially collect information about the attacked user by displaying a malicious form.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
