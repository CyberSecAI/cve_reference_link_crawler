- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application allows users to upload HTML files with malicious content and then serves these files directly, enabling the execution of embedded JavaScript code in the user's browser.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The lack of sanitization or validation of uploaded files allows the injection of malicious scripts. Specifically, the application does not prevent the upload of HTML files containing JavaScript, leading to the execution of the script when a user accesses the file through the application.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This could allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, collect sensitive information (like session cookies), or redirect users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** Uploading a malicious HTML file through the "attachment" field of a table within the application, then accessing the uploaded file via its generated URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have an account (or be able to manipulate the user into creating an account) to access the arbitrary table dashboard and add a new file. Once the file is uploaded, no special privileges are needed for the exploit to execute when any user accesses it via its URL.
