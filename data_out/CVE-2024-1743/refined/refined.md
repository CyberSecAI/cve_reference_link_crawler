The provided content relates to CVE-2024-1743.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The WooCommerce Customers Manager plugin fails to sanitize and escape various parameters before outputting them in pages and attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities. This attack is especially dangerous if performed against high privilege users, such as administrators.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack is performed by crafting malicious URLs or HTML forms containing the XSS payload within specific plugin parameters. The attacker must entice a logged-in user (especially an admin) to open the crafted URL or submit the form. The following vulnerable parameters and pages have been identified:
    - `page` parameter in `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=woocommerce-customers-manager`
    - `wccm_customers_ids` parameter in `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=woocommerce-customers-manager`
    - `page` parameter in `/wp-admin/?page=woocommerce-customers-manager&action=customer_details`
    - `customer` parameter in `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=woocommerce-customers-manager&action=wccm-customer-metadata`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs or forms and trick a logged-in user into accessing them. No authentication is needed to craft the payload, but the targeted user has to be logged into the WordPress admin panel.
