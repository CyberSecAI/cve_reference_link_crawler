- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the "wrapper link URL" feature of the Sky Addons for Elementor plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker with contributor-level or higher permissions can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will then execute whenever any user accesses the compromised page, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or further compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker leverages the plugin's "wrapper link URL" field by injecting malicious JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated WordPress user with at least contributor-level permissions.
