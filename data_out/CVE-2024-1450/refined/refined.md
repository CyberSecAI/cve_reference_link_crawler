Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1450

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `shariff` shortcode of the Shariff Wrapper WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts execute whenever a user accesses the compromised page.
- This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities on the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `shariff` shortcode
- Specifically, the `align` attribute (and potentially other attributes) are not properly sanitized/escaped

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to be authenticated users with at least Contributor-level permissions within the WordPress environment.
- They need the ability to create or edit posts or pages where shortcodes can be used.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 4.6.10.
- The fix was implemented in version 4.6.11 by applying escaping to the `align` and `align_widget` attributes.
- A duplicate issue, CVE-2024-29109, appears to exist.
