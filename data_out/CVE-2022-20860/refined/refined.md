- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because SSL server certificates are not validated when Cisco Nexus Dashboard is establishing a connection to Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC), Cisco Cloud APIC, or Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper certificate validation, specifically the lack of SSL server certificate validation during connection establishment. This is a CWE-295 issue (Improper Certificate Validation).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to:
    - Alter communications between the affected device and the controllers.
    - View sensitive information, including *Administrator* credentials for these controllers.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle (MITM) techniques.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can intercept traffic between the affected device and the controllers. The attacker needs the ability to use a crafted certificate to impersonate the controllers.
