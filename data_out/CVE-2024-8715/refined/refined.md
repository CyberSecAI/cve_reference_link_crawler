Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8715

**Vulnerability Description:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of `add_query_arg` without proper sanitization/escaping of the URL in the Simple LDAP Login WordPress plugin. The plugin takes user input (the 'tab' parameter in the URL) and uses it to construct links, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin directly includes the unsanitized user-controlled `tab` parameter within dynamically generated URLs.
*   **Improper Input Neutralization:** The `add_query_arg` function was used without any escaping or sanitization, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML/JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into a page within the WordPress site.
*   If a user clicks on a maliciously crafted link, the attacker's script will execute in the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable site, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is network-based, and the attacker leverages a malicious URL containing the exploit.
*   The attacker must craft a malicious URL containing the malicious JavaScript.
*   The attacker must induce a victim (website user) to click on the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs no authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs the ability to create and share malicious links.
*   The attacker needs to socially engineer a victim into clicking the malicious link.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Simple LDAP Login plugin up to and including 1.6.0.
*   The fix in version 1.6.1 includes:
    *   Sanitizing the `$_GET['tab']` parameter using `sanitize_text_field()`
    *   Escaping the generated URLs using `esc_url()`
    *   Escaping the `active_tab` variable using `esc_attr()`
