- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input sanitization in the `connect()` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection (CWE-78)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker provides a malicious string as input to the `connect()` function. Specifically, the `ssid` parameter is vulnerable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code that utilizes the vulnerable `wifey` package and be able to control the input to the `connect()` function. No user interaction or special privileges are required.
