Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2024-35816.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a missing `free_irq()` call when the firewire ohci driver is unbound from a device. Specifically, commit `5a95f1ded28691e6` removed the call to `free_irq()` in `pci_remove()`. However, the IRQ is still requested via `devm_request_irq()`, leading to a leftover irq at `pci_disable_msi()` in `pci_remove()` when the driver is unbound.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The interrupt resource is not released, resulting in a memory leak. The `remove_proc_entry` call reveals a non-empty directory and indicates resource leakage.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The memory leak can cause resource exhaustion and instability over time, particularly if the driver is repeatedly bound and unbound from the device. The system may become unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by unbinding the firewire ohci driver from the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to unbind the firewire ohci driver, which can typically be done by an administrator or someone with sufficient privileges.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves calling `devm_free_irq()` before `pci_disable_msi()` in both `pci_remove()` and `fail_msi:` of `pci_probe()`.
- The provided call trace illustrates the sequence of function calls leading to the resource leak.
