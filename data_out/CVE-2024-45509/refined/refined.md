The provided content is a commit diff from the MISP project on GitHub, specifically addressing an issue related to bookmark visibility. While it doesn't explicitly describe a vulnerability, it does highlight a fix for a problem where bookmark information was being returned in an overly verbose manner, potentially exposing user data unintentionally.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of the Issue:**

The issue stemmed from how bookmark data, particularly user information, was being handled in the `index` and `view` functions of the `BookmarksController`. The original code was returning user details even when the current user didn't have the necessary permissions to view that information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness was the unintentional disclosure of user information associated with bookmarks. This could occur when a user queried bookmarks using the `index` or `view` functions. Although the access control checks were in place, the user information was not being properly filtered out prior to being sent as part of the response, potentially leading to unauthorized access to PII.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access to User Data:**  If a malicious actor could craft requests, they could potentially gain access to the user data associated with bookmarks that they should not have access to, such as user IDs, emails, or organization IDs.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **API Manipulation:** An attacker could exploit the API endpoints used to fetch bookmarks (likely `/bookmarks` for `index` and `/bookmarks/{id}` for `view`) to retrieve information about bookmarks, including the user details, without proper authorization.
- **Authenticated access:** An attacker would have to have a valid account to be able to access the API endpoints in question.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker would need a valid user account on the MISP system.
- **API Knowledge:** The attacker would need some knowledge of the API endpoints used for retrieving bookmarks and their respective parameters.

**Changes Made to Fix the Issue:**

The commit introduces the following key changes:

1. **`index` function:** Added logic to filter user information from the results within an `afterFind` callback using `mayViewUser()` function from the `Bookmark` model.
2. **`view` function:** Similar to the `index` function, logic to filter user information has been added within an `afterFind` callback, using the same `mayViewUser()` function.
3. **`mayViewUser` function:** A new function `mayViewUser()` was added to the `Bookmark` model. This function checks if the current user has permission to view the user details associated with a specific bookmark based on their role (site admin, owner, or org admin) and whether the bookmark is exposed to the organization.

**Summary:**

This commit addresses an information disclosure vulnerability by implementing proper filtering of user data in the bookmark API endpoints. It prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive user information by correctly applying access controls. This is a bug fix rather than a full vulnerability disclosure.
