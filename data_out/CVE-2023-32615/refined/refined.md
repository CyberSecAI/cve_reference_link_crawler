- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The OAS Platform allows a user to save the running configuration to disk, and the user specifies the path and filename. The application does not properly validate the provided path, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path.
    - Arbitrary file creation and overwrite
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker can overwrite existing files with configuration data, and potentially gain access to the underlying system by overwriting the OAS user's `authorized_keys` file with an attacker-controlled SSH key.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A specially crafted series of network requests sent to the OAS Engine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be authenticated to the OAS configuration server.
    - The attacker needs to know the format of the protobuf structure.
    - The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server.
    - The attacker needs to be able to create elements within the application, like a new user.
