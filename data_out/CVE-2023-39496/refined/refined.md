- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of TIF files, where crafted data can cause a read past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability when processing TIF files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by opening or viewing a malicious TIF file. User interaction is required to open the file, or to visit a malicious page serving a malicious TIF file
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious TIF file. The user needs to open the malicious file using the vulnerable software.
