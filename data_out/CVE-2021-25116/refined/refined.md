- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `remove_asset` AJAX action in the Enqueue Anything plugin lacks authorization and CSRF checks. Additionally, the plugin doesn't properly validate if the item being deleted is an asset.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Missing authorization checks, allowing low-privilege users to access functionality intended for higher-privilege users.
    - Missing CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection, making the site vulnerable to attacks where an attacker can trick a logged-in user into making unintended requests.
    - Inadequate validation, allowing the deletion of arbitrary assets and even putting arbitrary posts in the trash, which should be limited to deleting only assets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A subscriber or any user through CSRF can delete arbitrary assets and move arbitrary posts to trash, leading to data loss and potential disruption of the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious request using the `remove_asset` AJAX action. This request can be submitted either directly by a low-privilege user or indirectly through a CSRF attack against an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Attacker needs to be a subscriber on the affected WordPress site or able to trick a logged-in user into submitting a crafted form (CSRF).
    - The attacker needs knowledge of the `remove_asset` AJAX action and the ability to craft HTTP requests to exploit the vulnerable endpoint.
