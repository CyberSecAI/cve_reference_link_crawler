The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21958.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `HwordApp.dll` of Hancom Office 2020. It occurs during the parsing of a malformed Compound File Directory Entry. Specifically, the size of data read via `fread_wrapper` into a fixed-size buffer is determined by the `stream_size` field of the entry, and can be larger than the destination buffer if the internal sector chain calculation results in a condition that causes a larger size to be used.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)
- Insecure handling of stream size during Compound File Directory Entry processing
- Incorrect calculation of data size to be read into buffer
- Lack of proper bounds checking when reading from a crafted stream.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption
- Potential arbitrary code execution

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted malformed file (HWord document).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious file to the vulnerable application
- User interaction (opening a malicious document) is required.
