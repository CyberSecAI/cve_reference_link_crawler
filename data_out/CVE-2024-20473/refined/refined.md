- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software does not adequately validate user input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain unauthorized data from the database and make changes to the system.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated, remote attacker can send crafted SQL queries to an affected system through the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to authenticate to the application as an *Administrator*.
