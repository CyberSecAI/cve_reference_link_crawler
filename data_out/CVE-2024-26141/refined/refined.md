Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-26141:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Rack handles `Range` request headers. Specifically, when multiple byte ranges are requested in the header, the server can be forced to respond with an unexpectedly large amount of data if the sum of the ranges exceeds the actual file size.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of the `Range` header.
- Lack of validation to check if the sum of requested byte ranges exceeds the file size.
- `Rack::Utils.byte_ranges` method and `Rack::File` middleware are vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By sending a crafted `Range` header with overly large ranges, an attacker can force the server to generate and send large responses, potentially exhausting server resources and causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a malicious HTTP request with a specially crafted `Range` header containing multiple byte ranges whose sum exceeds the size of the requested resource.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special privileges or access is required other than the ability to reach the server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Rack versions 1.3.0 and later.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Rack versions 3.0.9.1 and 2.2.8.1
- The fix implemented in commit `4849132bef471adb21131980df745f4bb84de2d9` and `62457686b26d33a15a254c7768c2076e8e02b48b` involves returning an empty array if the sum of the requested ranges is greater than the file size, effectively refusing to respond with any bytes.
- The issue is present in `Rack::Utils.byte_ranges` and affects applications using this method directly or through `Rack::File` middleware, including Rails applications.
- There are no workarounds for this issue other than upgrading to the patched versions.
- Patches for the 3.0 and 2.2 series are available.
