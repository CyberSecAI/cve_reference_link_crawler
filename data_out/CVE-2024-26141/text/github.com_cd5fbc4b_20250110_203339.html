This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-26141.
 Versions Affected: >= 1.3.0. Not affected: < 1.3.0 Fixed Versions: 3.0.9.1, 2.2.8.1

 Vulnerable applications will use the `Rack::File` middleware or the `Rack::Utils.byte\_ranges` methods (this includes Rails applications).
 # Releases
 The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.
