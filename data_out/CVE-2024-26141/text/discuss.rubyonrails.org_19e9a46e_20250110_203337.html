There is a possible DoS vulnerability relating to the Range request header in
Rack. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-26141.

Versions Affected: >= 1.3.0.
Not affected: < 1.3.0
Fixed Versions: 3.0.9.1, 2.2.8.1

## Impact

Carefully crafted Range headers can cause a server to respond with an
unexpectedly large response. Responding with such large responses could lead
to a denial of service issue.

Vulnerable applications will use the `Rack::File` middleware or the
`Rack::Utils.byte_ranges` methods (this includes Rails applications).

## Releases

The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

## Workarounds

There are no feasible workarounds for this issue.

## Patches

To aid users who aren’t able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for
the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a
