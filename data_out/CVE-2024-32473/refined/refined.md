{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "IPv6 was not being disabled on network interfaces, even when the network was configured with `--ipv6=false`. This affected `ipvlan` and `macvlan` interfaces.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the fact that IPv6 was not explicitly disabled when it should have been, resulting in unexpected IPv6 addresses and capabilities being assigned to containers on IPv4-only networks. This led to an increased attack surface, and potential for unauthorized network communication.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The impact of this vulnerability includes:\n\n*   Containers could communicate with other hosts on the local network via link-local IPv6 addresses.\n*   Containers could obtain SLAAC-assigned addresses if router advertisements were present on the network.\n*   Containers would join IPv6 multicast groups.\n*   Increased potential for data exfiltration from the container due to lack of IPv6 firewall constraints.\n*   Remote attackers could potentially divert traffic through malicious Router Advertisements.\n*   Containers might experience denial of service due to software not handling dual-stack environments properly.",
  "Attack vectors": "Attack vectors include:\n\n*   Exploiting the container's unexpected IPv6 address to listen for connections or open connections to other nodes.\n*   Performing DoS attacks using the container's IPv6 address.\n*   Sending malicious Router Advertisements to divert network traffic.\n*   Exploiting software that mishandles dual-stack configurations, causing a denial of service condition.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker capabilities and positions vary depending on the specific attack:\n\n*   Local access is required for attacks exploiting unexpected IPv6 addresses and capabilities within the container. (CVSS score AV:L)\n*   A network-adjacent position is required to inject malicious Router Advertisements. (CVSS score AV:A)\n*   No special privileges or user interaction are required to exploit the IPv6 enablement. (PR:N/UI:R)\n*   High privilege is required to carry out a denial of service attack by abusing software that does not behave properly with IPv6. (PR:H)"
