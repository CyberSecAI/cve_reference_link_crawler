Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-41251:

**CVE-2022-41251**

*   **Root Cause:** The Apprenda Plugin does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Missing permission check.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can enumerate the IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. These IDs can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to capture the credentials.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network access to the Jenkins instance.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs Overall/Read permission within the Jenkins instance.

**Summary of the vulnerability**
The Apprenda Plugin 2.2.0 and earlier has an endpoint that does not check for proper permissions. This allows a user with Overall/Read permissions to obtain a list of the credentials IDs, which can then be used in a separate attack to capture credentials.
