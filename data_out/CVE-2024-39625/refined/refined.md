- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. Specifically, a lack of proper checks that allows unprivileged users to execute privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unprivileged users can execute actions that should require higher privileges. The specific impact varies depending on the context of the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special privileges or access is needed to exploit this vulnerability. An unauthenticated user can trigger the vulnerability.
