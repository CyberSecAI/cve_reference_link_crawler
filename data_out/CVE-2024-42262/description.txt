In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/v3d: Fix potential memory leak in the performance extension

If fetching of userspace memory fails during the main loop, all drm sync
objs looked up until that point will be leaked because of the missing
drm_syncobj_put.

Fix it by exporting and using a common cleanup helper.
