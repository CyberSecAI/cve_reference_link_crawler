- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A memory leak occurs in the V3D (VideoCore 3D) driver in the Linux kernel when fetching userspace memory during the performance query extension. If the memory fetch fails, the `drm_syncobj` objects that were looked up until that point are not released, leading to a memory leak.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing cleanup of `drm_syncobj` objects in error paths within the `v3d_get_cpu_reset_performance_params` and `v3d_get_cpu_copy_performance_query_params` functions, which handle user space data for performance queries.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A memory leak. Repeatedly triggering this code path could cause the system to run out of memory and become unstable.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending specially crafted IOCTL calls with invalid user space memory addresses to the V3D driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the V3D driver, which typically means having access to the device.
