- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the `boostmyshopagent` module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the `apiKey` parameter in `changeOrderCarrier.php`, `relayPoint.php`, `shippingConfirmation.php`, and `pack.php` is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query, leading to SQL injection. Additionally, `shopId` in `productData.php` was not properly type-casted as an integer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - SQL Injection (CWE-89): Due to the lack of sanitization of the `apiKey` parameter before being used in SQL queries.
    - Blind SSRF: While not the primary vulnerability addressed by this CVE, the advisory mentions that the module also has a blind SSRF issue. This is not the focus of the report and has a lower CVSS score.
    - Potential for Stored XSS due to missing pSQL function.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Obtain admin access to the PrestaShop installation.
    - Remove or modify data from the associated PrestaShop database.
    - Expose sensitive data by copying it from tables to the front end.
    - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network-based attacks through HTTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - No special privileges or user interaction are needed. The attacker can exploit the vulnerability through simple HTTP calls.

**Additional notes:**
- The advisory includes patch code snippets showing the use of `pSQL()` to sanitize the `apiKey` and an integer casting for `shopId`.
- The advisory strongly recommends upgrading to the latest version of the module and PrestaShop, restricting access to the `webservice` directory, and enabling OWASP rules on the WAF.
- The advisory also mentions that while changing the database prefix can offer some defense, it's ineffective against skilled attackers with DBA knowledge.
