Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-37908:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from improper handling of invalid characters in HTML attribute names during XHTML rendering in XWiki. While the system was designed to sanitize HTML attributes, it incorrectly handled invalid characters within attribute names. Specifically, it added a prefix (`data-xwiki-translated-attribute-`) to disallowed attributes without properly stripping or validating the attribute name itself. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious attributes by including characters that the browser would interpret as attribute separators (e.g. `/` in `/onmouseover="alert('XSS1')"`) and thus bypass the sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation and sanitization of characters within attribute names. While the system detected that an attribute was not allowed, it did not validate the attribute name itself before adding the prefix.
*   **XSS Vulnerability:** The improper handling of attribute names allowed for the injection of malicious JavaScript code through attributes like `onmouseover`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the user's browser.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If a privileged user with programming rights is targeted, this can lead to server-side code execution with the same rights, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the entire XWiki instance.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XWiki Syntax:** The vulnerability can be exploited through XWiki syntax in any content that supports it, including comments.
*   **Malicious Attributes:**  Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript by embedding specially crafted attribute names within the XWiki syntax, e.g. `[[Link1>>https://XWiki.example.com||/onmouseover="alert('XSS1')"]]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** An attacker with low privileges can inject the malicious code.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to interact with the malicious content (e.g., hover over a link) for the XSS code to be executed.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability was introduced in version 14.6-rc-1.
*   The fix involves removing invalid characters from attribute names before re-validating them, preventing the injection of malicious attributes.
*   Versions prior to 14.6-rc-1 are vulnerable to XSS through attributes but through a different mechanism (CVE-2023-32070).
* The vulnerability is assigned CWE-86: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes
