## Porto Business & WooCommerce WordPress Theme

Porto is the most powerful, customizable, and user-friendly WordPress theme with WooCommerce & website builder for building modern sites.

Version: 7.4.0, Already Compatible with WordPress 5.x & 6.x and WooCommerce 9.5, 9.4, 9.3, 9.2, 9.1, 9.0, 8.x, 7.x, 6.x & 5.x | [Changelog](https://themeforest.net/item/porto-responsive-wordpress-ecommerce-theme/9207399#item-description__change_logs)

Porto Wordpress is an ultimate business & woocommerce wordpress theme that is suitable for any business and woocommerce sites. Porto provides plenty elements and powerful features that can configure all you want. Compared to other multi-purpose themes’ general ecommerce features, Porto provides ultimate woocommerce features with exclusive skins & layouts and features. Porto guarantees super fast performance which is essential for your business & woocommerce shops. Please check below to see more features from Porto. Enjoy Porto Business & Woocommerce Theme!

Porto introduces a lot of new features and demos, we also enhanced our speed Optimization wizard and reached top performance scores in ThemeForest.
Porto releases 5 wonderful features – Soft Mode, Merged JS and CSS, Critical CSS, Type Builder, Single and Archive Builders.
Soft Mode is a new feature that can be surely called a huge development.
It has made possible to edit anything. You can build site without touching a single line of code using full site builders.
Critical CSS helps you reduce the rendering time of your site.
Your site may suffer from too many styles yet not all of them are used at first time. Critical CSS helps you escape from all this stuff.
You will be able to achieve high performance.
Merged JS & CSS is also a important point in the new version.
It limits the request count so even though you don’t use cache plugins, you can expect high speed on mobile devices.
With Post Type Builder, any archive post layout can be built to be harmonized with your website.
As for Single & Archive Builder, most themes want customization yet for their single and archive pages.
Never mind. Porto will do all those things for you and build a layout that is in your head.
Eventually Porto has improved all its Google Lighthouse metrics above 98 on desktop and 70 on mobile without any cache plugins. For example Beauty Salon, Dentist, Auto Service….

Porto improved performance by optimizing dynamic styles about 30ms, using css variables, optimizing server respond time about 30ms, etc.
Please check changelog below for more details.
