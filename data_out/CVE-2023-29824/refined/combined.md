#### Reference issue

Closes [gh-14713](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/14713). See the issue for more details.

#### What does this implement/fix?

Remove the extra reference decrement which is not needed and may cause the ref count to become negative in case of a memory error (though that's not likely).

My understanding of this was that `Py_XDECREF` would not do anything if there is NULL as opposed to `Py_DECREF`. But if we don't need this at all here (which seems to be the case) then why not remove this line.

| My understanding of this was that `Py_XDECREF` would not do anything if there is NULL as opposed to `Py_DECREF`  Yes that is true, but in this case, the result is not NULL if/when the `PyErr_Occurred` holds true. In that case, it is actually a dangling pointer since the ref count has been decremented to zero once and then again the second decrement still goes through (since it is not NULL) making the ref count -1. So we can just remove this extra DECREF which is not required anyway.  I believe this bug managed to get in at the first place in anticipation to counter the complimentary increment on L920:   [scipy/scipy/ndimage/src/nd\_image.c](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/8ef583067438a16e7f3a4bed2e109168f16dfda8/scipy/ndimage/src/nd_image.c#L920)  Line 920 in [8ef5830](/scipy/scipy/commit/8ef583067438a16e7f3a4bed2e109168f16dfda8)   |  | Py\_INCREF(result); | | --- | --- |      But in case of an error (Eg L891), the control is transferred directly to the exit label and that increment is never hit. |

| Hi [@Snape3058](https://github.com/Snape3058), thanks for the details. But [Py\_XDECREF](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_XDECREF), as opposed to Py\_DECREF, is taking care of NULL as per the doc so there should be no problem no? Or you are saying that we don't need this last call? |

| Function `PyList_New` returns a new reference and is then assigned to variable `result`. Let's assume it is not NULL. As a new reference it is, we assume (in our analyzer) the refcnt is 1. After the first `Py_XDECREF`, the refcnt becomes 0, and the PyObject that `result` points to will be destructed. Then the second `Py_XDECREF` will decrease the refcnt to -1, which is a potential use-after-free bug.  It is not the matter of `X` for NULL pointers, but the `DECREF`. This report is a use-after-free bug report, not a null pointer dereference report.  I made a test with the following code snippet, which is similar to the path in the report. The refcnt change of the PyObject is commented in the code.  ``` void f() {   PyObject *result = PyList_New(1); // <-- new reference returned (line 878)   assert(result);   printf("%ld\n", result->ob_refcnt); // 1    PyErr_NoMemory(); // <-- error happens, an exception is thrown (line 890)   Py_XDECREF(result); // <-- destruction here (line 924)   printf("%ld\n", result->ob_refcnt); // 0    if (PyErr_Occurred()) {     Py_XDECREF(result); // <-- use after free here (line 931)     printf("%ld\n", result->ob_refcnt); // -1   } } ``` |

| This issue just got assigned a CVE: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29824>. This is very similar to [#16235 (comment)](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/16235#issuecomment-1625361328) (Cc [@nonsense-j](https://github.com/nonsense-j)), and seems invalid too. This use-after-free occurs when creation of a Python list of length "max number of labels for found objects" fails. This list is small compared to the image itself. So to even trigger the use-after-free, an attacker would have to be able to deterministically exhaust memory at the point where this API is called. It's quite similar to the use-after-free example under *Public disclosure preferred* in <https://www.python.org/dev/security/>. From that example:  *While these are clearly important bugs to fix, and may, in some hypothetical situations, have a security impact, the only proof of concept the PSRT can imagine for any of them is to be able to execute arbitrary Python code. If you can already execute Python code, there are far worse things you can do than provoke a use-after-free or an interpreter crash.*  So, it's a regular bug, but not a security issue. |

| [@rgommers](https://github.com/rgommers) Thanks for your clear reassessment and explanation about this issue. I misunderstand the specific difference between CVE and bug, which caused some extra work for your team. Both of the two cves will be updated as reject. Besides, no more cves are requested except the two you mentioned. I will strictly follow responsible disclosure practices next time. Sorry again and so much appreciation. |

| Hi [@Snape3058](https://github.com/Snape3058), thanks for the details. But [Py\_XDECREF](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_XDECREF), as opposed to Py\_DECREF, is taking care of NULL as per the doc so there should be no problem no? Or you are saying that we don't need this last call? |

| Function `PyList_New` returns a new reference and is then assigned to variable `result`. Let's assume it is not NULL. As a new reference it is, we assume (in our analyzer) the refcnt is 1. After the first `Py_XDECREF`, the refcnt becomes 0, and the PyObject that `result` points to will be destructed. Then the second `Py_XDECREF` will decrease the refcnt to -1, which is a potential use-after-free bug.  It is not the matter of `X` for NULL pointers, but the `DECREF`. This report is a use-after-free bug report, not a null pointer dereference report.  I made a test with the following code snippet, which is similar to the path in the report. The refcnt change of the PyObject is commented in the code.  ``` void f() {   PyObject *result = PyList_New(1); // <-- new reference returned (line 878)   assert(result);   printf("%ld\n", result->ob_refcnt); // 1    PyErr_NoMemory(); // <-- error happens, an exception is thrown (line 890)   Py_XDECREF(result); // <-- destruction here (line 924)   printf("%ld\n", result->ob_refcnt); // 0    if (PyErr_Occurred()) {     Py_XDECREF(result); // <-- use after free here (line 931)     printf("%ld\n", result->ob_refcnt); // -1   } } ``` |

| This issue just got assigned a CVE: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29824>. This is very similar to [#16235 (comment)](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/16235#issuecomment-1625361328) (Cc [@nonsense-j](https://github.com/nonsense-j)), and seems invalid too. This use-after-free occurs when creation of a Python list of length "max number of labels for found objects" fails. This list is small compared to the image itself. So to even trigger the use-after-free, an attacker would have to be able to deterministically exhaust memory at the point where this API is called. It's quite similar to the use-after-free example under *Public disclosure preferred* in <https://www.python.org/dev/security/>. From that example:  *While these are clearly important bugs to fix, and may, in some hypothetical situations, have a security impact, the only proof of concept the PSRT can imagine for any of them is to be able to execute arbitrary Python code. If you can already execute Python code, there are far worse things you can do than provoke a use-after-free or an interpreter crash.*  So, it's a regular bug, but not a security issue. |

| [@rgommers](https://github.com/rgommers) Thanks for your clear reassessment and explanation about this issue. I misunderstand the specific difference between CVE and bug, which caused some extra work for your team. Both of the two cves will be updated as reject. Besides, no more cves are requested except the two you mentioned. I will strictly follow responsible disclosure practices next time. Sorry again and so much appreciation. |
