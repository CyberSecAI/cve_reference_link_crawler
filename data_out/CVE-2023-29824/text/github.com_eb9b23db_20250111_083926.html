#### Reference issue

Closes [gh-14713](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/14713). See the issue for more details.

#### What does this implement/fix?

Remove the extra reference decrement which is not needed and may cause the ref count to become negative in case of a memory error (though that's not likely).

My understanding of this was that `Py_XDECREF` would not do anything if there is NULL as opposed to `Py_DECREF`. But if we don't need this at all here (which seems to be the case) then why not remove this line.

| My understanding of this was that `Py_XDECREF` would not do anything if there is NULL as opposed to `Py_DECREF`  Yes that is true, but in this case, the result is not NULL if/when the `PyErr_Occurred` holds true. In that case, it is actually a dangling pointer since the ref count has been decremented to zero once and then again the second decrement still goes through (since it is not NULL) making the ref count -1. So we can just remove this extra DECREF which is not required anyway.  I believe this bug managed to get in at the first place in anticipation to counter the complimentary increment on L920:   [scipy/scipy/ndimage/src/nd\_image.c](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/8ef583067438a16e7f3a4bed2e109168f16dfda8/scipy/ndimage/src/nd_image.c#L920)  Line 920 in [8ef5830](/scipy/scipy/commit/8ef583067438a16e7f3a4bed2e109168f16dfda8)   |  | Py\_INCREF(result); | | --- | --- |      But in case of an error (Eg L891), the control is transferred directly to the exit label and that increment is never hit. |
