Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-45368:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a **Session Fixation** vulnerability. The H2-DM1E PLC's authentication protocol accepts multiple distinct packets as valid authentication responses, which is an anomaly because a single, specific response/encoding is expected. This deviates from standard security practices, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Fixation (CWE-384):** The PLC accepts multiple different packets as valid authentication responses, instead of a single specific one, making it vulnerable to session fixation attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to **authenticate as a valid user** without possessing the correct credentials. This could lead to unauthorized access and control of the PLC.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through an **adjacent network**. An attacker needs to be on the same network as the PLC to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be positioned on the same network segment as the vulnerable PLC, implying an adjacent network position is needed.
*   The attacker does not require any prior privileges or user interaction.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects DirectLogic H2-DM1E versions 2.8.0 and prior.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8 and a CVSS v4 base score of 8.7.
*   The vendor, AutomationDirect, recommends upgrading to the BRX platform, network segmentation, air gapping, and the use of a StrideLinx secure VPN platform to mitigate the risks.
*   No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.
