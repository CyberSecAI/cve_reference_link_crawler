| Because of the use of innerHTML here instead of innerText, it is possible to inject HTML which is interpreted: <https://github.com/brianvoe/slim-select/blob/master/src/slim-select/select.ts#L345>  I used the following HTML page as an example:  ``` <html>   <head>     <script src="https://unpkg.com/slim-select@latest/dist/slimselect.min.js"></script>     <link href="https://unpkg.com/slim-select@latest/dist/slimselect.css" rel="stylesheet"></link>   </head>   <body>     <select id="selectElement">       <option>&lt;IMG SRC=X ONERROR=alert(2)&gt;&lt;/IMG&gt;</option>       <option>&#x3c;&#x69;&#x6d;&#x67;&#x20;&#x73;&#x72;&#x63;&#x3d;&#x78;&#x20;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#x65;&#x72;&#x72;&#x6f;&#x72;&#x3d;&#x61;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x72;&#x74;&#x28;&#x31;&#x29;&#x3e;&#x3c;&#x2f;&#x69;&#x6d;&#x67;&#x3e;</option>       <option>Option 3</option>     </select>     <script>       new SlimSelect({         select: '#selectElement'       })     </script>   </body> </html> ```  It is important to note that the payload is HTML encoded.  Changing the selected option on the page leads to the execution of JavaScript: [image](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/83423277/364281851-579aa949-0c3a-4a25-b95f-42918a9b7a35.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.cu8wE01P7njg6ZW4T7mDOYcdKjYwlnI4axNR3DEjGp0) |

| I am not a developer so I would not be able to provide you with a fix and confirm that it would not break anything, sorry. I can simply confirm you that the part of the code that I exploited to get an XSS is this specific innerHTML: <https://github.com/brianvoe/slim-select/blob/master/src/slim-select/select.ts#L377C14-L377C23>  You can try to replace it with an innerText and build the application on your side to make sure that it works well. As previously said, here is the index.html that I used for a small PoC:  ``` <html>   <head>     <script src="https://unpkg.com/slim-select@latest/dist/slimselect.min.js"></script>     <link href="https://unpkg.com/slim-select@latest/dist/slimselect.css" rel="stylesheet"></link>   </head>   <body>     <select id="selectElement">       <option>&lt;IMG SRC=X ONERROR=alert(1)&gt;&lt;/IMG&gt;</option>       <option>Option 2</option>       <option>Option 3</option>     </select>     <script> new SlimSelect({   select: '#selectElement', })     </script>   </body> </html> ```  As long as once you change the selection and it does not trigger the alert(1), then the reported vulnerability can be considered as fixed.  Also notice that this example is provided as a PoC but I exploited this vulnerability in a global application during a security assessment to elevate my privileges to super admin as I was able to inject a malicious payload into one of the list. Even though it was their choice to let users create new options, I think that this is a frequent use case and it cannot be ignored ... Especially as there doesn't seem to be any real point in converting the option's innerText into HTML, so the fix is unlikely to break any feature. |

| Dependabot also warned us about a potential risk for slimselect: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9440>  Slim Select 2.0 versions through 2.9.0 are affected by a potential cross-site scripting vulnerability. In select.ts:createOption(), the text variable from the user-provided Options object is assigned to an innerHTML without sanitation. Software that depends on this library to dynamically generate lists using unsanitized user-provided input may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting, resulting in attacker executed JavaScript. At this time, no patch is available. |

| Hi [@brianvoe](https://github.com/brianvoe) I just submitted a PR for that. ~~Don't know what you mean with "add a test" I think the update should be already covered by all the tests that use the `select.createOption` method~~  UPDATE: the original PR did not pass the test suite. I changed `innerText` to `textContent`. Also added a test for this and now all tests pass. |
