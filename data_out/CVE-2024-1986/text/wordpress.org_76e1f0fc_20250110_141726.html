## FAQ

### How to install Booster for WooCommerce (free version)?

The easiest way to install Booster is via your site’s Dashboard. Please follow these instructions to install and connect Booster:

Log in to your site’s Dashboard (e.g. http://www.yourdomain.com/wp-admin)

Click on the “Plugins” tab in the left panel, then click “Add New”.

Search for “Booster for WooCommerce” and the latest version will appear at the top of the list of results.

Install it by clicking the “Install Now” link.

When installation finishes, click “Activate Plugin”.

You’re done!

### Do I need any coding skills to use Booster?

Absolutely not! You can configure everything Booster has to offer without any coding knowledge.

### What’s the difference between Booster and Paid Booster bundles?

The free version of Booster for WooCommerce offers 68 amazing features. But, if you’re looking for greater functionality and even more customization options – Booster Plus is the ultimate WooCommerce product bundle for you. Booster Plus is packed with 196 features and counting.

Check out our [feature comparison](https://booster.io/booster-woocommerce-free-vs-plus/) and decide which version is best for you.

### Why should I choose paid Booster bundles over other plugins?

Implementing just a few modules from the Booster paid Booster bundles suite is more cost-effective than using multiple individual plugins, often priced at $79-$99 each. Stacking your WooCommerce site with a lot of different plugins can slow it down too. All those individual plugins may not necessarily be compatible with one another.

paid Booster bundles solves all of these problems with over 100 compatible modules in a single package for easy WooCommerce integration. You get multiple custom features for the cost of one WordPress product plugin and the benefit of zero bloat.

### Do you offer refunds?

If you are not completely satisfied with paid Booster bundles, you can request a refund within the first 30 days, and we will give you 100% of your money back – no questions asked.

### How to unlock those some features settings that are locked?

To unlock all Booster for WooCommerce features, please install additional paid Booster bundles(https://booster.io/buy-booster/) plugin.

Signed up for a 5 site agency package. It didn’t do what I needed it to do. AT ALL. contacted support. Took roughly 4 days for them to finally say they were looking at it. 3 days later and no action. Requested a refund and got a response in 3 hours. They replied to the refund request saying were still looking into my issue… In spite of me having found and implemented a suitable replacement already and having asked for a refund. 24 hours later and they’ve logged into my site, deactivated the replacement plugin, reactivated their plugin and STILL haven’t fixed the problem. Have deleted their user account and FTP account (still not sure why they needed that given it was a fresh install and I’ve not needed to use FTP to manage my own site yet). Just soooo slow and straight up ignoring my instructions at this point.l causing more work for me. Not fun. In the middle of all this I got a “2023” wrap up email from their marketing comms. In December 2024. Attention to detail clearly not high.

Very happy with the fast response on a problem we had with the invoice. Clear instructions and solved correctly.
However, really annoyed with the fact we got 3 mail in 3 days asking to write a review. Almost wasn’t going to happen because of this.

Great plugin with a lot of options, but be aware that the support is $129.99 a year!The support reaction speed is very slow. It will take days/weeks for you to get a reaction, and they don’t really help and brush it off with, make contact via our website and pay us an extra $129.99. And even then, the speed of the support is slow of not existing.They said: We were receiving an overwhelming volume of support requests, making it impossible to maintain the high level of service our customers expect within reasonable timeframes.In my case, they have an error/bug in their plugin and I need to pay them $129.99 to be able to send a ticket and for them to maybe solve the error/bug in their plugin…Yeah, I say no.So be aware!

We don’t use many of the huge range of options, but I recently tried turning on Maximum Products per User. This was to stop our members from ordering a product more than once. It’s a lottery as to whether it works or not, and I have just had a case where it was triggered incorrectly. Needs a bit of work.
Also I have turned on payment gateways per product category, but it doesn’t do anything.
