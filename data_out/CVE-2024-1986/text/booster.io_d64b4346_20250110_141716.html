### Why should I choose the Booster suite over other individual plugins?

Oh, that's an easy one! Implementing just a few modules from the Booster suite is more cost-effective than using dozens of individual plugins often priced at $15-$30 each. On top of that, stacking your site with a lot of different plugins can make
it bloated and slow. What's worse, all those individual plugins don't always play nice together. But Booster is the solution to all that nonsense. The Booster suite features over 100 compatible modules that allow
you to add custom features and functionality to your WooCommerce site easily.
