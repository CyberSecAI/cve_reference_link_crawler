- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-based buffer overflow occurs in the `bfd_getl32` function when processing debugging information in the `.stab` section of a binary. Specifically, the `read_section_stabs_debugging_info` function in `rddbg.c` does not properly check the boundaries when concatenating stab strings, leading to out-of-bounds reads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can lead to a crash due to out-of-bounds memory access. The provided crash log shows a heap-buffer-overflow detected by AddressSanitizer.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when `objdump` processes a crafted binary with a malformed `.stab` section.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted binary to the `objdump` tool.
