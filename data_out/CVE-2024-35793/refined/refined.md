The provided content relates to CVE-2024-35793.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect logic in the debugfs removal process. Specifically, when a debugfs file is removed, the code should either wait for all active users to finish (if the reference count hits zero) or trigger cancellations for ongoing operations (if the refcount does not hit zero). The original implementation was flawed and could never enter the loop that triggers cancellations, leading to potential deadlocks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect Logic:** The core issue lies in the flawed conditional logic within `__debugfs_file_removed`. It prevents the cancellation loop from being entered, which causes the program to get stuck in a loop when there is still a reference.
- **Deadlock Potential:**  Concurrent debugfs remove operations while files are being accessed can lead to deadlocks because the cancellation mechanism is not properly triggered when the refcount is not zero.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation results in a deadlock, which will cause the system to become unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves triggering a debugfs removal operation concurrently with ongoing access to the same file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the ability to trigger debugfs removal operations and also have access to the debugfs file, such as by performing file operations that increment the reference counter. This implies the attacker would need local access to the system or would need to be able to trigger the operations through an existing vulnerability or misconfiguration.
