Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient enforcement of search restrictions when using cross-cluster API keys in Elasticsearch. Specifically, if a cross-cluster API key restricts search using `query` or `field_security` parameters for a given index and also grants replication for the same index, the search restrictions are not applied during cross-cluster search operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** Search restrictions defined in the API key are bypassed in cross-cluster search scenarios when replication is also enabled.
- **Data Leakage:**  Documents and terms that should be restricted based on the API key's search configurations are returned in the search results.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data occurs when search restrictions are not enforced, leading to exposure of information that should not be visible to the user using the specific cross-cluster API key.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially view data they should not have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Cross-Cluster Search Operation:** Exploitation occurs through performing a cross-cluster search using a specifically crafted API key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid API Key:** The attacker needs a cross-cluster API key that:
    -  Has search restrictions via the `query` or `field_security` parameters.
    -  Also has replication permissions for the same index.
- **Access to Elasticsearch Cluster:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate cross-cluster search operations.
- **Knowledge of Index and Data:** The attacker likely needs to know the name of an index with restricted data.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability only affects the API key based security model for remote clusters which was previously a beta feature and is released as GA with 8.14.0
- The issue is resolved in version 8.14.0 of Elasticsearch.
- This issue was identified in versions 8.10.0 and later before 8.14.0.
