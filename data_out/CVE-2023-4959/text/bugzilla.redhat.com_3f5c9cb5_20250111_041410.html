| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2238908#c0)  Avinash Hanwate    2023-09-14 09:14:11 UTC  ``` Cross-Site Request Forgery or CSRF attacks force a user to perform unwanted actions in an application. Through the use of techniques such as social engineering (e.g. sending a link via email), or existing vulnerabilities in the domain itself or others (e.g. XSS), the attacker gets users of the web application to silently execute actions in the context of the user's session. The consequences of exploiting this vulnerability range from compromising the data or operations of a user, to the compromise of the entire web application, if the user has the role of "Administrator". During the pentest, it has been detected that the config-editor page (<https://example-registry-quay-config-editor-openshift-operators.apps.automagic.gcp.quaydev.org/>) is vulnerable to CSRF. The config-editor page is used to configure the Quay instance.   ``` |  |
