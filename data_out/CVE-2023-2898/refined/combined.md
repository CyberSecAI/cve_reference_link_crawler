Subject: [[f2fs-dev] [PATCH] f2fs: fix to avoid NULL pointer dereference f2fs_write_end_io()](#r)
Date: Mon, 22 May 2023 20:42:03 +0800	[[thread overview]](#r)
Message-ID: <20230522124203.3838360-1-chao@kernel.org> (<raw>)

butt3rflyh4ck reports a bug as below:

When a thread always calls F2FS_IOC_RESIZE_FS to resize fs, if resize fs is
failed, f2fs kernel thread would invoke callback function to update f2fs io
info, it would call  f2fs_write_end_io and may trigger null-ptr-deref in
NODE_MAPPING.

general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address
KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000030-0x0000000000000037]

The root cause is below race case can cause leaving dirty metadata
in f2fs after filesystem is remount as ro:

Thread A				Thread B
- f2fs_ioc_resize_fs
 - f2fs_readonly   --- return false
 - f2fs_resize_fs
					- f2fs_remount
					 - write_checkpoint
					 - set f2fs as ro
  - free_segment_range
   - update meta_inode's data

Then during f2fs_put_super() fails to write_checkpoint due to readonly
status, and meta_inode's dirty data will be writebacked after node_inode
is put, finally write_end_io will access NULL pointer on sbi->node_inode.

Thread A				IRQ context
- f2fs_put_super
 - write_checkpoint fails
 - iput(node_inode)
 - node_inode = NULL
 - iput(meta_inode)
  - write_inode_now
   - f2fs_write_meta_page
					- f2fs_write_end_io
					 - NODE_MAPPING(sbi)
					 : access NULL pointer on node_inode

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2022-4269

    William Zhao discovered that a flaw in the Traffic Control (TC)
    subsystem when using a specific networking configuration
    (redirecting egress packets to ingress using TC action "mirred"),
    may allow a local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service
    (triggering a CPU soft lockup).

CVE-2022-39189

    Jann Horn discovered that TLB flush operations are mishandled in
    the KVM subsystem in certain KVM_VCPU_PREEMPTED situations, which
    may allow an unprivileged guest user to compromise the guest
    kernel.

CVE-2023-1206

    It was discovered that the networking stack permits attackers to
    force hash collisions in the IPv6 connection lookup table, which
    may result in denial of service (significant increase in the cost
    of lookups, increased CPU utilization).

CVE-2023-1380

    Jisoo Jang reported a heap out-of-bounds read in the brcmfmac
    Wi-Fi driver. On systems using this driver, a local user could
    exploit this to read sensitive information or to cause a denial of
    service.

CVE-2023-2002

    Ruiahn Li reported an incorrect permissions check in the Bluetooth
    subsystem. A local user could exploit this to reconfigure local
    Bluetooth interfaces, resulting in information leaks, spoofing, or
    denial of service (loss of connection).

CVE-2023-2007

    Lucas Leong and Reno Robert discovered a
    time-of-check-to-time-of-use flaw in the dpt_i2o SCSI controller
    driver. A local user with access to a SCSI device using this

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2023-1206

    It was discovered that the networking stack permits attackers to
    force hash collisions in the IPv6 connection lookup table, which may
    result in denial of service (significant increase in the cost of
    lookups, increased CPU utilization).

CVE-2023-1989

    Zheng Wang reported a race condition in the btsdio Bluetooth adapter
    driver that can lead to a use-after-free. An attacker able to insert
    and remove SDIO devices can use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to run arbitrary code in
    the kernel.

CVE-2023-2430

    Xingyuan Mo discovered that the io_uring subsystem did not properly
    handle locking when the target ring is configured with IOPOLL, which
    may result in denial of service.

CVE-2023-2898

    It was discovered that missing sanitising in the f2fs file
    system may result in denial of service if a malformed file
    system is accessed.

CVE-2023-3611

    The TOTE Robot tool found a flaw in the Btrfs filesystem driver that
    can lead to a use-after-free. It's unclear whether an unprivileged
    user can exploit this.

CVE-2023-3772

    Lin Ma discovered a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the XFRM
    subsystem which may result in denial of service.

CVE-2023-3773

    Lin Ma discovered a flaw in the the XFRM subsystem, which may result
    in denial of service for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in
    any user or network namespace.

CVE-2023-3776, CVE-2023-4128, CVE-2023-4206, CVE-2023-4207, CVE-2023-4208

    It was discovered that a use-after-free in the cls_fw, cls_u32 and
    cls_route network classifiers may result in denial of service or
    potential local privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-3777

    Kevin Rich discovered a use-after-free in Netfilter when flushing
    table rules, which may result in local privilege escalation for a
    user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or network
    namespace.

CVE-2023-3863

    It was discovered that a use-after-free in the NFC implementation
    may result in denial of service, an information leak or potential
    local privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-4004

    It was discovered that a use-after-free in Netfilter's
    implementation of PIPAPO (PIle PAcket POlicies) may result in denial
    of service or potential local privilege escalation for a user with
    the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or network namespace.

CVE-2023-4015

    Kevin Rich discovered a use-after-free in Netfilter when handling
    bound chain deactivation in certain circumstances, may result in
    denial of service or potential local privilege escalation for a user
    with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or network namespace.

CVE-2023-4132

    A use-after-free in the driver for Siano SMS1xxx based MDTV
    receivers may result in local denial of service.

CVE-2023-4147

    Kevin Rich discovered a use-after-free in Netfilter when adding a
    rule with NFTA_RULE_CHAIN_ID, which may result in local privilege
    escalation for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user
    or network namespace.

CVE-2023-4155

    Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the KVM subsystem allowing a KVM
    guest using EV-ES or SEV-SNP to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2023-4194

    A type confusion in the implementation of TUN/TAP network devices
    may allow a local user to bypass network filters.

CVE-2023-4273

    Maxim Suhanov discovered a stack overflow in the exFAT driver, which
    may result in local denial of service via a malformed file system.

CVE-2023-4569

    lonial con discovered flaw in the Netfilter subsystem, which may
    allow a local attacher to cause a double-deactivations of catchall
    elements, which results in a memory leak.

CVE-2023-4622

    Bing-Jhong Billy Jheng discovered a use-after-free within the Unix
    domain sockets component, which may result in local privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-20588

    Jana Hofmann, Emanuele Vannacci, Cedric Fournet, Boris Koepf and
    Oleksii Oleksenko discovered that on some AMD CPUs with the Zen1
    micro architecture an integer division by zero may leave stale
    quotient data from a previous division, resulting in a potential
    leak of sensitive data.

CVE-2023-34319

    Ross Lagerwall discovered a buffer overrun in Xen's netback driver
    which may allow a Xen guest to cause denial of service to the
    virtualisation host my sending malformed packets.

CVE-2023-40283

    A use-after-free was discovered in Bluetooth L2CAP socket handling.

For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.1.52-1. This update is released without armel builds. Changes
in the new stable series import cause a substantial increase of the
compressed image for marvell flavour. This issue will be addressed in a
future linux update.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
