{
  "CVE-2023-2898": {
    "Description": "It was discovered that missing sanitising in the f2fs file system may result in denial of service if a malformed file system is accessed.",
    "Root cause": "Missing sanitization in the f2fs file system.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Accessing a malformed f2fs file system"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": [
      "Local access to a malformed f2fs file system"
    ],
    "More Information": "The vulnerability is caused by a race condition in the f2fs filesystem when resizing fails during a remount. A thread attempting to resize the filesystem can cause dirty metadata, which will later result in a NULL pointer dereference when the node_inode is accessed after being put. The issue is triggered in the f2fs_write_end_io function through a NULL pointer on sbi->node_inode."
